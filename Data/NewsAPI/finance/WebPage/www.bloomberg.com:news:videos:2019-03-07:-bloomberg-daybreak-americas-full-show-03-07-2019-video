THIS IS PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT\r\nIN VIEW OF THE OVERALL LIMITED\r\n\r\nIMPLEMENTATION OF 2018 COUNTRY\r\nSPECIFIC EXPECTATIONS AS TO THE\r\n\r\nEUROPEAN COMMISSION.\r\nREGARDING FISCAL POLICIES, THE\r\n\r\nEXPANSION HE EURO AREA AND THE\r\n\r\nESTABLISHMENT OF AUTOMATIC\r\nSTABILIZERS ARE PROVIDING\r\n\r\nSUPPORT TO ECONOMIC ACTIVITY.\r\nAT THE SAME\r\n\r\nTIME, COUNTRIES WERE\r\nGOVERNMENT DEBT IS HIGH NEED TO\r\n\r\nCONTINUE TO MAINTAIN FISCAL\r\nBUFFERS.\r\n\r\nCOUNTRY SHOULD CONTINUE EFFORTS\r\n-- THE TRANSPARENT AND\r\n\r\nCONSISTENT IMPLEMENTATION OF THE\r\nEUROPEAN UNION FISCAL AND\r\n\r\nECONOMIC FRAMEWORK OR WORK TIME\r\nAND ACROSS COUNTRIES REMAINS\r\n\r\nESSENTIAL TO BOLSTER THE\r\nRESILIENCE OF THE EURO AREA\r\n\r\nECONOMY.\r\nIMPROVING THE FUNCTIONING OF\r\n\r\nECONOMIC AND MONETARY UNION\r\nREMAINS A PRIORITY.\r\n\r\nTHE GOVERNING COUNCIL WELCOMES\r\nTHE ONGOING WORK AND URGES\r\n\r\nFURTHER SPECIFIC AND DECISIVE\r\nSTEPS TO COMPLETE THE BANKING\r\n\r\nUNION AND THE CUSTOM MARKETS\r\nUNION.\r\n\r\nWE ARE NOW AT YOUR DISPOSAL FOR\r\nQUESTIONS.\r\n\r\n&gt;&gt; MR. PRESIDENT, COULD YOU GIVE\r\nUS AN IDEA ABOUT THE REASONS\r\n\r\nWHY YOU DECIDED ON THE SPECIFIC\r\nFEATURES OF THE TLTRO'S THREE\r\n\r\nPROGRAM?\r\nWHY ARE THE MATURITIES TWO YEARS\r\n\r\n, WIFE YOU INDEXED IT TO THE MRO\r\nAND WHY IS THE START DATE IN\r\n\r\nSEPTEMBER WHEN THE FUNDING\r\nBECOMES RELEVANT FOR BANKS IN\r\n\r\nJUNE?\r\nMY SECOND QUESTION IS WHAT YOU\r\n\r\nWOULD LIKE TO ACHIEVE WITH THIS\r\nPROGRAM?\r\n\r\nARE YOU TRYING TO KEEP THE SIZE\r\nOF THE BALANCE SHEET STABLE OR\r\n\r\nYOU TRYING TO ADD EXTRA\r\nACCOMMODATION? THANK YOU.\r\n\r\nPRES. DRAGHI: THE DESIGN OF THE\r\nTLTRO RESPONSE TO A VARIETY OF\r\n\r\nOBJECTIVES. THE KEY ONE\r\n\r\nDERIVES FROM HOW THE\r\nSITUATION OF BANK FUNDING LOOKS\r\n\r\nLIKE EVER THE NEXT FEW YEARS.\r\nIN THE COMING YEARS, WE WILL\r\n\r\nHAVE A CONGESTION FOR BANK\r\nFUNDING\r\n\r\nPOSED BY THE COMING TO\r\nMATURITY OF THE EXISTING TLTRO'S\r\n\r\n, THE COMING TO MATURITY OF A\r\nSIZABLE AMOUNT OF BANK LOANS,\r\n\r\nVARIOUS REGULATORY COMPLIANCE IS\r\nES.\r\n\r\nTHE TLTRO'S MAINTAINS FAVORABLE\r\n\r\nBANK LENDING CONDITIONS AND A\r\nSMOOTH TRANSMISSION OF MONETARY\r\n\r\nPOLICY.\r\nTHE PRECISE DESIGN REFLECTS THE\r\n\r\nCHANGED CONDITIONS WE HAVE\r\nTODAY.\r\n\r\nFURTHER DETAILS ON THE PRICING\r\nAND OTHER DETAILS WILL BE KNOWN\r\n\r\nIN DUE TIME.\r\nON THE SECOND QUESTION\r\n\r\n, IT ADDRESSES THE SUBSTANCE OF\r\nTODAY'S MEETING.\r\n\r\nLET ME GIVE YOU A BROAD ACCOUNT\r\nOF HOW THIS MEETING UNFOLDED AND\r\n\r\nIN SO DOING RESPONSE SOME OF THE\r\nQUESTIONS YOU INTEND TO ASK.\r\n\r\nFIRST OF ALL, THE DECISIONS.\r\nIT IS FOUR SETS OF\r\n\r\nDECISIONS.\r\nWE MOVED THE CALENDAR-BASED PART\r\n\r\nOF OUR FORWARD GUIDANCE FROM\r\nSEPTEMBER TO DECEMBER.\r\n\r\nTHE SECOND WE CONFIRMED\r\nINVESTMENT IN FULL OF THE\r\n\r\nPRINCIPAL PAYMENTS FROM MATURING\r\nSECURITIES.\r\n\r\nYOU UNDERSTAND THE IMPORTANCE OF\r\nTHE TRADE ELEMENT IN OUR\r\n\r\nMONETARY POLICY.\r\n\r\nHAVING MOVE THE CALENDAR-BASED,\r\nSO DOES WHATEVER THE HORIZON\r\n\r\nWILL BE DURING WHICH THE\r\nPURCHASES WILL TAKE PLACE TO\r\n\r\nKEEP THE STOCK UNCHANGED.\r\nYOU SEE THIS ACCOMMODATION.\r\n\r\nTO ANSWER YOUR QUESTION, THIS IS\r\nADDING ACCOMMODATION.\r\n\r\nTHE FINANCING CONDITIONS HAVE\r\nBEEN VERY ACCOMMODATIVE, BUT\r\n\r\nFINANCING CONDITIONS HAVE EASED\r\nEVEN SINCE OUR LAST MEETING.\r\n\r\nTHIS IS ALSO PARTLY DUE TO THE\r\nSTRUCTURE OF OUR FORWARD\r\n\r\nGUIDANCE SO EXPECTED INTEREST\r\nRATES HAVE GONE DOWN SINCE LAST\r\n\r\nMEETING AND ESPECIALLY\r\n\r\nAT THE END OF LAST YEAR AS WELL.\r\nTHEN WE HAVE THE THIRD ELEMENT,\r\n\r\nTHE TARGETED LONGER-TERM\r\nREFINANCING OPERATIONS WE JUST\r\n\r\nDISCUSSED.\r\nTHEN WE HAVE THE FIXED RATE AND\r\n\r\nTHE PROCEDURES, AS LONG AS\r\nNECESSARY\r\n\r\nUNTIL MARCH 2021.\r\nWHAT ARE THE FEATURES OF THESE\r\n\r\nMEASURES? THEY ARE DATA-DRIVEN.\r\nTHESE ARE DECISIONS THAT HAVE\r\n\r\nBEEN TAKEN FOLLOWING A\r\nSIGNIFICANT DOWNWARD REVISION OF\r\n\r\nTHE FORECAST BY OUR STAFF.\r\nSECOND, YOU JUST HEARD ME SAY\r\n\r\nOPTIONALITY IS IN ALL THE\r\nINSTANCES, WHICH MEANS THE\r\n\r\nGOVERNING COUNTY IS BOTH WILLING\r\nAND COMMITTED TO ACT WHEN, IF\r\n\r\nNEEDED, AMPLIFYING THE USE OF\r\nTHESE INSTRUMENTS BASED ON THE\r\n\r\nDATA. THIRD\r\n\r\n, IT OBVIOUSLY TAKES PLACE\r\nIN AN ENVIRONMENT WHERE MONETARY\r\n\r\nPOLICY ACCOMMODATION IS\r\nSUBSTANTIAL.\r\n\r\nTHE SECOND POINT IS HOW DID WE\r\nGET TO TAKE THESE DECISIONS?\r\n\r\nTHE ANSWER IS THAT THEY WERE\r\nUNANIMOUS. THERE WAS UNANIMITY.\r\n\r\nGIVEN THE COMPLEXITY OF THE\r\nPACKAGE, I THINK THIS IS A\r\n\r\nPOSITIVE SIGN FOR THE\r\nCOHESIVENESS OF THE GOVERNMENT\r\n\r\nCOUNSEL AND OUR DELIBERATIONS.\r\nTHIRD, WHAT IS THE GENERAL\r\n\r\nCONTEXT IN WHICH THESE DECISIONS\r\nHAVE TAKEN PLACE? WE ARE IN\r\n\r\nA -- WE ARE COMING TO,\r\nAND MAYBE WE STILL ARE, IN A\r\n\r\nPERIOD OF EXTENDED WEAKNESS AND\r\nA PHASE OF UNCERTAINTY.\r\n\r\nTHAT IS WHY THE FORECAST HAS\r\nBEEN REVISED DOWNWARD QUITE\r\n\r\nSIGNIFICANTLY.\r\nTHE OUTCOME -- THE FACTORS THAT\r\n\r\nHAVE ORIGINALLY CAUSED THIS\r\nWEAKNESS, WHICH ARE MOSTLY OF\r\n\r\nEXTERNAL SOURCE ARE STILL THERE.\r\nTHE UNCERTAINTY IS PARTLY\r\n\r\nRELATED TO HOW LONG THESE\r\nFACTORS WILL CONTINUE AFFECTING\r\n\r\nTHE WORLD ECONOMY, THE EUROZONE\r\nECONOMY, AND CONFIDENCE MORE\r\n\r\nGENERALLY.\r\nTHERE ARE TWO OBSERVATIONS TO\r\n\r\nMAKE ABOUT THE ASSESSMENT OF THE\r\nOUTLOOK.\r\n\r\nFIRST, THE GOVERNMENT COUNSEL\r\nEXPRESSED CONFIDENCE.\r\n\r\nALL MEMBERS EXPRESSED CONFIDENCE\r\nIN THE BASELINE, WHICH MEANS WE\r\n\r\nASSESS THE PROBABILITIES OF A\r\nRECESSION AS BEING VERY LOW\r\n\r\n, AS\r\nWELL AS THE PROBABILITIES OF ADA\r\n\r\nGROWING OF INFLATION\r\nEXPECTATIONS -- OF A DEANCHORING\r\n\r\nOF INFLATION EXPECTATIONS.\r\nTHE REASONS ARE THE SAME THAT\r\n\r\nUNDERPIN THE STRENGTH OF OUR\r\nECONOMY AND OUR PREVIOUS\r\n\r\nMEETINGS.\r\nNOMINAL WAGE GROWTH CONTINUES\r\n\r\nTHE LABOR MARKET, THOUGH IT IS A\r\nLOWER RATE, IT CONTINUES TO\r\n\r\nIMPROVE.\r\nCONSUMPTION REMAINS BY AND LARGE\r\n\r\nIN GOOD SHAPE.\r\nMONETARY POLICY REMAINS\r\n\r\nACCOMMODATIVE EVEN NOW.\r\nIT IS MORE ACCOMMODATIVE.\r\n\r\nFINANCING CONDITIONS HAVE EASED\r\nUP.\r\n\r\nTHERE IS A SECOND FACTOR WE HAVE\r\nTAKEN INTO ACCOUNT IN\r\n\r\nMAINTAINING THIS CONFIDENCE.\r\nIT IS TRUE THAT THESE EXTERNAL\r\n\r\nFACTORS CONTINUE TO BE HANGING\r\nON, CONTINUE TO BE WEIGHING ON\r\n\r\nTHE EUROZONE ECONOMY.\r\nIT IS ALSO TRUE THAT GOVERNMENTS\r\n\r\nARE RESPONDING IN THEIR\r\nRESPECTIVE JURISDICTIONS WITH\r\n\r\nPOLICIES THAT ARE DRESSING THESE\r\nPROBLEMS. IN THE U.S., IN CHINA.\r\n\r\nTHE SECOND POINT TO BE KEPT IN\r\nMIND IS THAT YOU HAVE SEEN THE\r\n\r\nREVISION OF THE INFLATION\r\n\r\nPATH SAYS ONE THING.\r\nWE HAVE CONFIDENCE WE WILL\r\n\r\nCONVERGE AND AT THIS POINT WE\r\nTHINK IT WILL TAKE LONGER TO GET\r\n\r\nTHERE.\r\nWHY IS IT GOING TO TAKE LONGER?\r\n\r\nTHE WEAKER GROWTH PROBABLY\r\n\r\nWILL FURTHER SLOW DOWN THE PASS\r\nTHROUGH FROM HIGHER WAGES TO\r\n\r\nHIGHER PRICES, HIGHER INFLATION.\r\nYOU ALSO SLOW DOWN THE CLOSURE\r\n\r\n-- WE WILL SLOW DOWN THE OUTPUT\r\nGAP.\r\n\r\nIN OTHER WORDS, THE OUTPUT GAP\r\nIS CLOSING.\r\n\r\nTHESE REGIONS ARE IMPORTANT TO\r\nBE KEPT IN MIND.\r\n\r\nTHE OTHER IMPORTANT PART OF\r\nTODAY'S DECISION IS THAT WE\r\n\r\nMAINTAIN THE RISK ASSESSMENT AS\r\nTILTED TO THE DOWNSIDE.\r\n\r\nTHIS IS NOT FREQUENT, BECAUSE WE\r\nUSUALLY SAY WHEN WE TAKE POLICY\r\n\r\nACTIONS, THE RISKS GET BACK INTO\r\nBALANCE.\r\n\r\nON OTHER OCCASIONS IN THE PAST,\r\nBUT NOT FREQUENTLY. WHY IS THAT?\r\n\r\nWE ARE AWARE OUR DECISIONS\r\nINCREASE THE RESILIENCE OF THIS\r\n\r\nEUROZONE ECONOMY.\r\nCAN THEY ADDRESS THESE\r\n\r\nFACTORS THAT ARE WEIGHING ON THE\r\nEUROZONE ECONOMY AND THE REST OF\r\n\r\nTHE WORLD? THEY CANNOT.\r\nTHE FACT OF PROTECTION IS ONE\r\n\r\nFACTOR.\r\nGEOPOLITICAL CONSIDERATIONS ALSO\r\n\r\nRELATED TO WHATEVER HAPPENS\r\nABOUT THE UNITED KINGDOM BREXIT\r\n\r\n, THE FORMS IN WHICH THEY WILL\r\nEXIT FROM THE EUROPEAN UNION.\r\n\r\nTHE EMERGING MARKET FOR\r\nABILITIES, WHAT IS HAPPENING IN\r\n\r\nCHINA?\r\nWE KNOW THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT\r\n\r\nHAS REACTED.\r\nMONETARY POLICY IS CHANGED.\r\n\r\nIN THE U.S. WE HAVE TO TAKE INTO\r\nACCOUNT THERE IS GOING TO BE A\r\n\r\nWAITING EFFECT ON THE FISCAL\r\nPACKAGE.\r\n\r\nTHE LOAD IS EXPECTED THERE.\r\nOUR ACTIONS INCREASE THE\r\n\r\nRESILIENCE OF THE EUROZONE\r\nECONOMY\r\n\r\nAND SO MAKE US\r\nCONFIDENT, KEEP US CONFIDENT\r\n\r\nTHAT CONVERGENCE TO A\r\nSUSTAINABLE RATE OF INFLATION,\r\n\r\nOUR OBJECTIVE, WILL HAPPEN.\r\nTHANK YOU.\r\n\r\n&gt;&gt; CAN I ASK YOU ABOUT WHAT YOU\r\nSAID EARLIER THAT YOU ARE\r\n\r\nSTANDING READY TO ADJUST ALL OF\r\nYOUR INSTRUMENTS AVAILABLE?\r\n\r\nDOES THAT INCLUDE THE NET ASSET\r\nPURCHASE PROGRAM.\r\n\r\nCOULD YOU REVISE IT IN CASE THE\r\nECONOMY IS NOT GOING BETTER AND\r\n\r\nTHE INFLATION OUTLOOK IS GOING\r\nTO WORSEN?\r\n\r\nI HAVE A QUESTION ON THE\r\nUNDERLYING ASSUMPTION OF YOUR\r\n\r\nGROWTH AND INFLATION ESTIMATES.\r\nIS THE UNDERLYING ASSUMPTION\r\n\r\nTHAT THE U.S. AND CHINA WILL\r\nCOME TO AN AGREEMENT ON TRADE OR\r\n\r\nNOT? THANK YOU.\r\nPRES. DRAGHI: THE ANSWER TO THE\r\n\r\nSECOND QUESTION IS OUR\r\nPROJECTIONS TAKE INTO ACCOUNT\r\n\r\nTHE PROTECTIONS MEASURES THAT\r\nHAVE ALREADY BEEN IMPLEMENTED,\r\n\r\nBUT THEY DO NOT PROJECT AND\r\nASSESSMENT OF FUTURE MEASURES OR\r\n\r\nOF HOW THE CURRENT NEGOTIATION\r\nWILL END. ON YOUR FIRST\r\n\r\nQUESTION, YOU SEE\r\nOPTIONALITY'S EVERYWHERE.\r\n\r\nTHE ISSUE IS WHETHER WE SEE\r\nCONTINGENCIES THAT WOULD JUSTIFY\r\n\r\nTHE USE OF CERTAIN INSTRUMENTS\r\nINSTEAD OF OTHERS.\r\n\r\nI DO NOT WANT TO SPECULATE AT\r\nTHIS POINT IN TIME.\r\n\r\nAT THIS POINT IN TIME WE ARE\r\nTAKING ALL OF THESE DECISIONS\r\n\r\nAND WE THINK THEY ARE THE RIGHT\r\nDECISION AND THE ADEQUATE\r\n\r\nDECISIONS TO BE TAKEN AT THIS\r\nPOINT IN TIME.\r\n\r\nLET ME ADD ONE THING.\r\nWE DO NOT TIGHTEN WHEN WE\r\n\r\nSTOPPED PURCHASING THE NET ASSET\r\nPURCHASE PROGRAM.\r\n\r\nWE DO NOT TIGHTEN MONETARY\r\nPOLICY, CONTRARY TO WHAT SOME OF\r\n\r\nYOU SAID.\r\nI'M NOT SURE IT IS ONE OF YOU,\r\n\r\nBUT IT IS BEING SAID. WE\r\n\r\nCONTINUE -- JUST TO GIVE YOU\r\nAN IDEA, THE BALANCE SHEET OF\r\n\r\nTHE ECB IS ABOUT 42% OF THE\r\nEUROZONE GDP.\r\n\r\nTHE FED IS ABOUT HALF OF IT NOW.\r\nIN ORDER TO KEEP THIS STOCK\r\n\r\nUNCHANGED, WE CONTINUE\r\nPURCHASING\r\n\r\nSOMETHING IN THE\r\nORDER OF 20 MILLION EURO A MONTH\r\n\r\nIN BONDS.\r\nTHIS HAPPENS IN A CONTEXT WHERE\r\n\r\nTHE DEBT TO GDP RATIO IN THE\r\nEUROZONE IS FALLING.\r\n\r\nTHE SIMPLE ACTION OF MAINTAINING\r\nA STOCK UNCHANGED IN THIS\r\n\r\nCONTEXT IS CONTINUOUS\r\n\r\nEASING\r\nBECAUSE INTEREST RATES ARE\r\n\r\nPUSHED DOWNWARD BY THIS ACTION.\r\nYOU CAN SEE THIS BECAUSE SINCE\r\n\r\nWE DECIDED JUNE OF LAST YEAR\r\nINTEREST RATES HAVE GONE DOWN,\r\n\r\nTHEY KEEP GOING DOWN.\r\nTHE TERM PREMIUM IS NEGATIVE SO\r\n\r\nCONDITIONS ARE ACCOMMODATIVE.\r\nTHE CHAIN ELEMENTS -- THE\r\n\r\nHORIZON OVER WHICH WE WILL CARRY"}}

THE KEY ONE\r\n\r\nDERIVES FROM HOW THE\r\nSITUATION OF BANK FUNDING LOOKS\r\n\r\nLIKE EVER THE NEXT FEW YEARS.\r\nIN THE COMING YEARS, WE WILL\r\n\r\nHAVE A CONGESTION FOR BANK\r\nFUNDING\r\n\r\nPOSED BY THE COMING TO\r\nMATURITY OF THE EXISTING TLTRO'S\r\n\r\n, THE COMING TO MATURITY OF A\r\nSIZABLE AMOUNT OF BANK LOANS,\r\n\r\nVARIOUS REGULATORY COMPLIANCE IS\r\nES.\r\n\r\nTHE TLTRO'S MAINTAINS FAVORABLE\r\n\r\nBANK LENDING CONDITIONS AND A\r\nSMOOTH TRANSMISSION OF MONETARY\r\n\r\nPOLICY.\r\nTHE PRECISE DESIGN REFLECTS THE\r\n\r\nCHANGED CONDITIONS WE HAVE\r\nTODAY.\r\n\r\nFURTHER DETAILS ON THE PRICING\r\nAND OTHER DETAILS WILL BE KNOWN\r\n\r\nIN DUE TIME.\r\nON THE SECOND QUESTION\r\n\r\n, IT ADDRESSES THE SUBSTANCE OF\r\nTODAY'S MEETING.\r\n\r\nLET ME GIVE YOU A BROAD ACCOUNT\r\nOF HOW THIS MEETING UNFOLDED AND\r\n\r\nIN SO DOING RESPONSE SOME OF THE\r\nQUESTIONS YOU INTEND TO ASK.\r\n\r\nFIRST OF ALL, THE DECISIONS.\r\nIT IS FOUR SETS OF\r\n\r\nDECISIONS.\r\nWE MOVED THE CALENDAR-BASED PART\r\n\r\nOF OUR FORWARD GUIDANCE FROM\r\nSEPTEMBER TO DECEMBER.\r\n\r\nTHE SECOND WE CONFIRMED\r\nINVESTMENT IN FULL OF THE\r\n\r\nPRINCIPAL PAYMENTS FROM MATURING\r\nSECURITIES.\r\n\r\nYOU UNDERSTAND THE IMPORTANCE OF\r\nTHE TRADE ELEMENT IN OUR\r\n\r\nMONETARY POLICY.\r\n\r\nHAVING MOVE THE CALENDAR-BASED,\r\nSO DOES WHATEVER THE HORIZON\r\n\r\nWILL BE DURING WHICH THE\r\nPURCHASES WILL TAKE PLACE TO\r\n\r\nKEEP THE STOCK UNCHANGED.\r\nYOU SEE THIS ACCOMMODATION.\r\n\r\nTO ANSWER YOUR QUESTION, THIS IS\r\nADDING ACCOMMODATION.\r\n\r\nTHE FINANCING CONDITIONS HAVE\r\nBEEN VERY ACCOMMODATIVE, BUT\r\n\r\nFINANCING CONDITIONS HAVE EASED\r\nEVEN SINCE OUR LAST MEETING.\r\n\r\nTHIS IS ALSO PARTLY DUE TO THE\r\nSTRUCTURE OF OUR FORWARD\r\n\r\nGUIDANCE SO EXPECTED INTEREST\r\nRATES HAVE GONE DOWN SINCE LAST\r\n\r\nMEETING AND ESPECIALLY\r\n\r\nAT THE END OF LAST YEAR AS WELL.\r\nTHEN WE HAVE THE THIRD ELEMENT,\r\n\r\nTHE TARGETED LONGER-TERM\r\nREFINANCING OPERATIONS WE JUST\r\n\r\nDISCUSSED.\r\nTHEN WE HAVE THE FIXED RATE AND\r\n\r\nTHE PROCEDURES, AS LONG AS\r\nNECESSARY\r\n\r\nUNTIL MARCH 2021.\r\nWHAT ARE THE FEATURES OF THESE\r\n\r\nMEASURES? THEY ARE DATA-DRIVEN.\r\nTHESE ARE DECISIONS THAT HAVE\r\n\r\nBEEN TAKEN FOLLOWING A\r\nSIGNIFICANT DOWNWARD REVISION OF\r\n\r\nTHE FORECAST BY OUR STAFF.\r\nSECOND, YOU JUST HEARD ME SAY\r\n\r\nOPTIONALITY IS IN ALL THE\r\nINSTANCES, WHICH MEANS THE\r\n\r\nGOVERNING COUNTY IS BOTH WILLING\r\nAND COMMITTED TO ACT WHEN, IF\r\n\r\nNEEDED, AMPLIFYING THE USE OF\r\nTHESE INSTRUMENTS BASED ON THE\r\n\r\nDATA. THIRD\r\n\r\n, IT OBVIOUSLY TAKES PLACE\r\nIN AN ENVIRONMENT WHERE MONETARY\r\n\r\nPOLICY ACCOMMODATION IS\r\nSUBSTANTIAL.\r\n\r\nTHE SECOND POINT IS HOW DID WE\r\nGET TO TAKE THESE DECISIONS?\r\n\r\nTHE ANSWER IS THAT THEY WERE\r\nUNANIMOUS. THERE WAS UNANIMITY.\r\n\r\nGIVEN THE COMPLEXITY OF THE\r\nPACKAGE, I THINK THIS IS A\r\n\r\nPOSITIVE SIGN FOR THE\r\nCOHESIVENESS OF THE GOVERNMENT\r\n\r\nCOUNSEL AND OUR DELIBERATIONS.\r\nTHIRD, WHAT IS THE GENERAL\r\n\r\nCONTEXT IN WHICH THESE DECISIONS\r\nHAVE TAKEN PLACE? WE ARE IN\r\n\r\nA -- WE ARE COMING TO,\r\nAND MAYBE WE STILL ARE, IN A\r\n\r\nPERIOD OF EXTENDED WEAKNESS AND\r\nA PHASE OF UNCERTAINTY.\r\n\r\nTHAT IS WHY THE FORECAST HAS\r\nBEEN REVISED DOWNWARD QUITE\r\n\r\nSIGNIFICANTLY.\r\nTHE OUTCOME -- THE FACTORS THAT\r\n\r\nHAVE ORIGINALLY CAUSED THIS\r\nWEAKNESS, WHICH ARE MOSTLY OF\r\n\r\nEXTERNAL SOURCE ARE STILL THERE.\r\nTHE UNCERTAINTY IS PARTLY\r\n\r\nRELATED TO HOW LONG THESE\r\nFACTORS WILL CONTINUE AFFECTING\r\n\r\nTHE WORLD ECONOMY, THE EUROZONE\r\nECONOMY, AND CONFIDENCE MORE\r\n\r\nGENERALLY.\r\nTHERE ARE TWO OBSERVATIONS TO\r\n\r\nMAKE ABOUT THE ASSESSMENT OF THE\r\nOUTLOOK.\r\n\r\nFIRST, THE GOVERNMENT COUNSEL\r\nEXPRESSED CONFIDENCE.\r\n\r\nALL MEMBERS EXPRESSED CONFIDENCE\r\nIN THE BASELINE, WHICH MEANS WE\r\n\r\nASSESS THE PROBABILITIES OF A\r\nRECESSION AS BEING VERY LOW\r\n\r\n, AS\r\nWELL AS THE PROBABILITIES OF ADA\r\n\r\nGROWING OF INFLATION\r\nEXPECTATIONS -- OF A DEANCHORING\r\n\r\nOF INFLATION EXPECTATIONS.\r\nTHE REASONS ARE THE SAME THAT\r\n\r\nUNDERPIN THE STRENGTH OF OUR\r\nECONOMY AND OUR PREVIOUS\r\n\r\nMEETINGS.\r\nNOMINAL WAGE GROWTH CONTINUES\r\n\r\nTHE LABOR MARKET, THOUGH IT IS A\r\nLOWER RATE, IT CONTINUES TO\r\n\r\nIMPROVE.\r\nCONSUMPTION REMAINS BY AND LARGE\r\n\r\nIN GOOD SHAPE.\r\nMONETARY POLICY REMAINS\r\n\r\nACCOMMODATIVE EVEN NOW.\r\nIT IS MORE ACCOMMODATIVE.\r\n\r\nFINANCING CONDITIONS HAVE EASED\r\nUP.\r\n\r\nTHERE IS A SECOND FACTOR WE HAVE\r\nTAKEN INTO ACCOUNT IN\r\n\r\nMAINTAINING THIS CONFIDENCE.\r\nIT IS TRUE THAT THESE EXTERNAL\r\n\r\nFACTORS CONTINUE TO BE HANGING\r\nON, CONTINUE TO BE WEIGHING ON\r\n\r\nTHE EUROZONE ECONOMY.\r\nIT IS ALSO TRUE THAT GOVERNMENTS\r\n\r\nARE RESPONDING IN THEIR\r\nRESPECTIVE JURISDICTIONS WITH\r\n\r\nPOLICIES THAT ARE DRESSING THESE\r\nPROBLEMS. IN THE U.S., IN CHINA.\r\n\r\nTHE SECOND POINT TO BE KEPT IN\r\nMIND IS THAT YOU HAVE SEEN THE\r\n\r\nREVISION OF THE INFLATION\r\n\r\nPATH SAYS ONE THING.\r\nWE HAVE CONFIDENCE WE WILL\r\n\r\nCONVERGE AND AT THIS POINT WE\r\nTHINK IT WILL TAKE LONGER TO GET\r\n\r\nTHERE.\r\nWHY IS IT GOING TO TAKE LONGER?\r\n\r\nTHE WEAKER GROWTH PROBABLY\r\n\r\nWILL FURTHER SLOW DOWN THE PASS\r\nTHROUGH FROM HIGHER WAGES TO\r\n\r\nHIGHER PRICES, HIGHER INFLATION.\r\nYOU ALSO SLOW DOWN THE CLOSURE\r\n\r\n-- WE WILL SLOW DOWN THE OUTPUT\r\nGAP.\r\n\r\nIN OTHER WORDS, THE OUTPUT GAP\r\nIS CLOSING.\r\n\r\nTHESE REGIONS ARE IMPORTANT TO\r\nBE KEPT IN MIND.\r\n\r\nTHE OTHER IMPORTANT PART OF\r\nTODAY'S DECISION IS THAT WE\r\n\r\nMAINTAIN THE RISK ASSESSMENT AS\r\nTILTED TO THE DOWNSIDE.\r\n\r\nTHIS IS NOT FREQUENT, BECAUSE WE\r\nUSUALLY SAY WHEN WE TAKE POLICY\r\n\r\nACTIONS, THE RISKS GET BACK INTO\r\nBALANCE.\r\n\r\nON OTHER OCCASIONS IN THE PAST,\r\nBUT NOT FREQUENTLY. WHY IS THAT?\r\n\r\nWE ARE AWARE OUR DECISIONS\r\nINCREASE THE RESILIENCE OF THIS\r\n\r\nEUROZONE ECONOMY.\r\nCAN THEY ADDRESS THESE\r\n\r\nFACTORS THAT ARE WEIGHING ON THE\r\nEUROZONE ECONOMY AND THE REST OF\r\n\r\nTHE WORLD? THEY CANNOT.\r\nTHE FACT OF PROTECTION IS ONE\r\n\r\nFACTOR.\r\nGEOPOLITICAL CONSIDERATIONS ALSO\r\n\r\nRELATED TO WHATEVER HAPPENS\r\nABOUT THE UNITED KINGDOM BREXIT\r\n\r\n, THE FORMS IN WHICH THEY WILL\r\nEXIT FROM THE EUROPEAN UNION.\r\n\r\nTHE EMERGING MARKET FOR\r\nABILITIES, WHAT IS HAPPENING IN\r\n\r\nCHINA?\r\nWE KNOW THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT\r\n\r\nHAS REACTED.\r\nMONETARY POLICY IS CHANGED.\r\n\r\nIN THE U.S. WE HAVE TO TAKE INTO\r\nACCOUNT THERE IS GOING TO BE A\r\n\r\nWAITING EFFECT ON THE FISCAL\r\nPACKAGE.\r\n\r\nTHE LOAD IS EXPECTED THERE.\r\nOUR ACTIONS INCREASE THE\r\n\r\nRESILIENCE OF THE EUROZONE\r\nECONOMY\r\n\r\nAND SO MAKE US\r\nCONFIDENT, KEEP US CONFIDENT\r\n\r\nTHAT CONVERGENCE TO A\r\nSUSTAINABLE RATE OF INFLATION,\r\n\r\nOUR OBJECTIVE, WILL HAPPEN.\r\nTHANK YOU.\r\n\r\n&gt;&gt; CAN I ASK YOU ABOUT WHAT YOU\r\nSAID EARLIER THAT YOU ARE\r\n\r\nSTANDING READY TO ADJUST ALL OF\r\nYOUR INSTRUMENTS AVAILABLE?\r\n\r\nDOES THAT INCLUDE THE NET ASSET\r\nPURCHASE PROGRAM.\r\n\r\nCOULD YOU REVISE IT IN CASE THE\r\nECONOMY IS NOT GOING BETTER AND\r\n\r\nTHE INFLATION OUTLOOK IS GOING\r\nTO WORSEN?\r\n\r\nI HAVE A QUESTION ON THE\r\nUNDERLYING ASSUMPTION OF YOUR\r\n\r\nGROWTH AND INFLATION ESTIMATES.\r\nIS THE UNDERLYING ASSUMPTION\r\n\r\nTHAT THE U.S. AND CHINA WILL\r\nCOME TO AN AGREEMENT ON TRADE OR\r\n\r\nNOT? THANK YOU.\r\nPRES. DRAGHI: THE ANSWER TO THE\r\n\r\nSECOND QUESTION IS OUR\r\nPROJECTIONS TAKE INTO ACCOUNT\r\n\r\nTHE PROTECTIONS MEASURES THAT\r\nHAVE ALREADY BEEN IMPLEMENTED,\r\n\r\nBUT THEY DO NOT PROJECT AND\r\nASSESSMENT OF FUTURE MEASURES OR\r\n\r\nOF HOW THE CURRENT NEGOTIATION\r\nWILL END. ON YOUR FIRST\r\n\r\nQUESTION, YOU SEE\r\nOPTIONALITY'S EVERYWHERE.\r\n\r\nTHE ISSUE IS WHETHER WE SEE\r\nCONTINGENCIES THAT WOULD JUSTIFY\r\n\r\nTHE USE OF CERTAIN INSTRUMENTS\r\nINSTEAD OF OTHERS.\r\n\r\nI DO NOT WANT TO SPECULATE AT\r\nTHIS POINT IN TIME.\r\n\r\nAT THIS POINT IN TIME WE ARE\r\nTAKING ALL OF THESE DECISIONS\r\n\r\nAND WE THINK THEY ARE THE RIGHT\r\nDECISION AND THE ADEQUATE\r\n\r\nDECISIONS TO BE TAKEN AT THIS\r\nPOINT IN TIME.\r\n\r\nLET ME ADD ONE THING.\r\nWE DO NOT TIGHTEN WHEN WE\r\n\r\nSTOPPED PURCHASING THE NET ASSET\r\nPURCHASE PROGRAM.\r\n\r\nWE DO NOT TIGHTEN MONETARY\r\nPOLICY, CONTRARY TO WHAT SOME OF\r\n\r\nYOU SAID.\r\nI'M NOT SURE IT IS ONE OF YOU,\r\n\r\nBUT IT IS BEING SAID. WE\r\n\r\nCONTINUE -- JUST TO GIVE YOU\r\nAN IDEA, THE BALANCE SHEET OF\r\n\r\nTHE ECB IS ABOUT 42% OF THE\r\nEUROZONE GDP.\r\n\r\nTHE FED IS ABOUT HALF OF IT NOW.\r\nIN ORDER TO KEEP THIS STOCK\r\n\r\nUNCHANGED, WE CONTINUE\r\nPURCHASING\r\n\r\nSOMETHING IN THE\r\nORDER OF 20 MILLION EURO A MONTH\r\n\r\nIN BONDS.\r\nTHIS HAPPENS IN A CONTEXT WHERE\r\n\r\nTHE DEBT TO GDP RATIO IN THE\r\nEUROZONE IS FALLING.\r\n\r\nTHE SIMPLE ACTION OF MAINTAINING\r\nA STOCK UNCHANGED IN THIS\r\n\r\nCONTEXT IS CONTINUOUS\r\n\r\nEASING\r\nBECAUSE INTEREST RATES ARE\r\n\r\nPUSHED DOWNWARD BY THIS ACTION.\r\nYOU CAN SEE THIS BECAUSE SINCE\r\n\r\nWE DECIDED JUNE OF LAST YEAR\r\nINTEREST RATES HAVE GONE DOWN,\r\n\r\nTHEY KEEP GOING DOWN.\r\nTHE TERM PREMIUM IS NEGATIVE SO\r\n\r\nCONDITIONS ARE ACCOMMODATIVE.\r\nTHE CHAIN ELEMENTS -- THE\r\n\r\nHORIZON OVER WHICH WE WILL CARRY","thumbnail":{"url":"https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/iQnq_DEc..gI/v5/-1x-1.jpg"},"bmmrId":"vr_oPPj2TeGrF8H3B0J6LA"},"series":[{"type":"Series","id":"daybreak-americas","name":"Bloomberg Daybreak: Americas"},{"type":"Series","id":"tv-shows","name":"TV Shows"}],"videoType":"cut-from-tv"},"videoList":[{"headline":{"html":"'Bloomberg Daybreak: Americas' Full Show (03/07/2019)","text":"'Bloomberg Daybreak: Americas' Full Show (03/07/2019)","seo":"'Bloomberg Daybreak: Americas' Full Show (03/07/2019)"},"slug":"2019-03-07/-bloomberg-daybreak-americas-full-show-03-07-2019-video","attributor":"bn","authoredRegion":null,"type":"video","url":"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/videos/2019-03-07/-bloomberg-daybreak-americas-full-show-03-07-2019-video","brand":"business","id":"PO0J2E6TTDSD01","site":"bbiz","summary":{"html":"Live from New York, \"Bloomberg Daybreak: Americas\" brings viewers the latest in business and finance, providing unique global insights into where industry and markets are headed.

PRESIDENT, COULD YOU GIVE\r\nUS AN IDEA ABOUT THE REASONS\r\n\r\nWHY YOU DECIDED ON THE SPECIFIC\r\nFEATURES OF THE TLTRO'S THREE\r\n\r\nPROGRAM?\r\nWHY ARE THE MATURITIES TWO YEARS\r\n\r\n, WIFE YOU INDEXED IT TO THE MRO\r\nAND WHY IS THE START DATE IN\r\n\r\nSEPTEMBER WHEN THE FUNDING\r\nBECOMES RELEVANT FOR BANKS IN\r\n\r\nJUNE?\r\nMY SECOND QUESTION IS WHAT YOU\r\n\r\nWOULD LIKE TO ACHIEVE WITH THIS\r\nPROGRAM?\r\n\r\nARE YOU TRYING TO KEEP THE SIZE\r\nOF THE BALANCE SHEET STABLE OR\r\n\r\nYOU TRYING TO ADD EXTRA\r\nACCOMMODATION? THANK YOU.\r\n\r\nPRES. DRAGHI: THE DESIGN OF THE\r\nTLTRO RESPONSE TO A VARIETY OF\r\n\r\nOBJECTIVES. THE KEY ONE\r\n\r\nDERIVES FROM HOW THE\r\nSITUATION OF BANK FUNDING LOOKS\r\n\r\nLIKE EVER THE NEXT FEW YEARS.\r\nIN THE COMING YEARS, WE WILL\r\n\r\nHAVE A CONGESTION FOR BANK\r\nFUNDING\r\n\r\nPOSED BY THE COMING TO\r\nMATURITY OF THE EXISTING TLTRO'S\r\n\r\n, THE COMING TO MATURITY OF A\r\nSIZABLE AMOUNT OF BANK LOANS,\r\n\r\nVARIOUS REGULATORY COMPLIANCE IS\r\nES.\r\n\r\nTHE TLTRO'S MAINTAINS FAVORABLE\r\n\r\nBANK LENDING CONDITIONS AND A\r\nSMOOTH TRANSMISSION OF MONETARY\r\n\r\nPOLICY.\r\nTHE PRECISE DESIGN REFLECTS THE\r\n\r\nCHANGED CONDITIONS WE HAVE\r\nTODAY.\r\n\r\nFURTHER DETAILS ON THE PRICING\r\nAND OTHER DETAILS WILL BE KNOWN\r\n\r\nIN DUE TIME.\r\nON THE SECOND QUESTION\r\n\r\n, IT ADDRESSES THE SUBSTANCE OF\r\nTODAY'S MEETING.\r\n\r\nLET ME GIVE YOU A BROAD ACCOUNT\r\nOF HOW THIS MEETING UNFOLDED AND\r\n\r\nIN SO DOING RESPONSE SOME OF THE\r\nQUESTIONS YOU INTEND TO ASK.\r\n\r\nFIRST OF ALL, THE DECISIONS.\r\nIT IS FOUR SETS OF\r\n\r\nDECISIONS.\r\nWE MOVED THE CALENDAR-BASED PART\r\n\r\nOF OUR FORWARD GUIDANCE FROM\r\nSEPTEMBER TO DECEMBER.\r\n\r\nTHE SECOND WE CONFIRMED\r\nINVESTMENT IN FULL OF THE\r\n\r\nPRINCIPAL PAYMENTS FROM MATURING\r\nSECURITIES.\r\n\r\nYOU UNDERSTAND THE IMPORTANCE OF\r\nTHE TRADE ELEMENT IN OUR\r\n\r\nMONETARY POLICY.\r\n\r\nHAVING MOVE THE CALENDAR-BASED,\r\nSO DOES WHATEVER THE HORIZON\r\n\r\nWILL BE DURING WHICH THE\r\nPURCHASES WILL TAKE PLACE TO\r\n\r\nKEEP THE STOCK UNCHANGED.\r\nYOU SEE THIS ACCOMMODATION.\r\n\r\nTO ANSWER YOUR QUESTION, THIS IS\r\nADDING ACCOMMODATION.\r\n\r\nTHE FINANCING CONDITIONS HAVE\r\nBEEN VERY ACCOMMODATIVE, BUT\r\n\r\nFINANCING CONDITIONS HAVE EASED\r\nEVEN SINCE OUR LAST MEETING.\r\n\r\nTHIS IS ALSO PARTLY DUE TO THE\r\nSTRUCTURE OF OUR FORWARD\r\n\r\nGUIDANCE SO EXPECTED INTEREST\r\nRATES HAVE GONE DOWN SINCE LAST\r\n\r\nMEETING AND ESPECIALLY\r\n\r\nAT THE END OF LAST YEAR AS WELL.\r\nTHEN WE HAVE THE THIRD ELEMENT,\r\n\r\nTHE TARGETED LONGER-TERM\r\nREFINANCING OPERATIONS WE JUST\r\n\r\nDISCUSSED.\r\nTHEN WE HAVE THE FIXED RATE AND\r\n\r\nTHE PROCEDURES, AS LONG AS\r\nNECESSARY\r\n\r\nUNTIL MARCH 2021.\r\nWHAT ARE THE FEATURES OF THESE\r\n\r\nMEASURES? THEY ARE DATA-DRIVEN.\r\nTHESE ARE DECISIONS THAT HAVE\r\n\r\nBEEN TAKEN FOLLOWING A\r\nSIGNIFICANT DOWNWARD REVISION OF\r\n\r\nTHE FORECAST BY OUR STAFF.\r\nSECOND, YOU JUST HEARD ME SAY\r\n\r\nOPTIONALITY IS IN ALL THE\r\nINSTANCES, WHICH MEANS THE\r\n\r\nGOVERNING COUNTY IS BOTH WILLING\r\nAND COMMITTED TO ACT WHEN, IF\r\n\r\nNEEDED, AMPLIFYING THE USE OF\r\nTHESE INSTRUMENTS BASED ON THE\r\n\r\nDATA. THIRD\r\n\r\n, IT OBVIOUSLY TAKES PLACE\r\nIN AN ENVIRONMENT WHERE MONETARY\r\n\r\nPOLICY ACCOMMODATION IS\r\nSUBSTANTIAL.\r\n\r\nTHE SECOND POINT IS HOW DID WE\r\nGET TO TAKE THESE DECISIONS?\r\n\r\nTHE ANSWER IS THAT THEY WERE\r\nUNANIMOUS. THERE WAS UNANIMITY.\r\n\r\nGIVEN THE COMPLEXITY OF THE\r\nPACKAGE, I THINK THIS IS A\r\n\r\nPOSITIVE SIGN FOR THE\r\nCOHESIVENESS OF THE GOVERNMENT\r\n\r\nCOUNSEL AND OUR DELIBERATIONS.\r\nTHIRD, WHAT IS THE GENERAL\r\n\r\nCONTEXT IN WHICH THESE DECISIONS\r\nHAVE TAKEN PLACE? WE ARE IN\r\n\r\nA -- WE ARE COMING TO,\r\nAND MAYBE WE STILL ARE, IN A\r\n\r\nPERIOD OF EXTENDED WEAKNESS AND\r\nA PHASE OF UNCERTAINTY.\r\n\r\nTHAT IS WHY THE FORECAST HAS\r\nBEEN REVISED DOWNWARD QUITE\r\n\r\nSIGNIFICANTLY.\r\nTHE OUTCOME -- THE FACTORS THAT\r\n\r\nHAVE ORIGINALLY CAUSED THIS\r\nWEAKNESS, WHICH ARE MOSTLY OF\r\n\r\nEXTERNAL SOURCE ARE STILL THERE.\r\nTHE UNCERTAINTY IS PARTLY\r\n\r\nRELATED TO HOW LONG THESE\r\nFACTORS WILL CONTINUE AFFECTING\r\n\r\nTHE WORLD ECONOMY, THE EUROZONE\r\nECONOMY, AND CONFIDENCE MORE\r\n\r\nGENERALLY.\r\nTHERE ARE TWO OBSERVATIONS TO\r\n\r\nMAKE ABOUT THE ASSESSMENT OF THE\r\nOUTLOOK.\r\n\r\nFIRST, THE GOVERNMENT COUNSEL\r\nEXPRESSED CONFIDENCE.\r\n\r\nALL MEMBERS EXPRESSED CONFIDENCE\r\nIN THE BASELINE, WHICH MEANS WE\r\n\r\nASSESS THE PROBABILITIES OF A\r\nRECESSION AS BEING VERY LOW\r\n\r\n, AS\r\nWELL AS THE PROBABILITIES OF ADA\r\n\r\nGROWING OF INFLATION\r\nEXPECTATIONS -- OF A DEANCHORING\r\n\r\nOF INFLATION EXPECTATIONS.\r\nTHE REASONS ARE THE SAME THAT\r\n\r\nUNDERPIN THE STRENGTH OF OUR\r\nECONOMY AND OUR PREVIOUS\r\n\r\nMEETINGS.\r\nNOMINAL WAGE GROWTH CONTINUES\r\n\r\nTHE LABOR MARKET, THOUGH IT IS A\r\nLOWER RATE, IT CONTINUES TO\r\n\r\nIMPROVE.\r\nCONSUMPTION REMAINS BY AND LARGE\r\n\r\nIN GOOD SHAPE.\r\nMONETARY POLICY REMAINS\r\n\r\nACCOMMODATIVE EVEN NOW.\r\nIT IS MORE ACCOMMODATIVE.\r\n\r\nFINANCING CONDITIONS HAVE EASED\r\nUP.\r\n\r\nTHERE IS A SECOND FACTOR WE HAVE\r\nTAKEN INTO ACCOUNT IN\r\n\r\nMAINTAINING THIS CONFIDENCE.\r\nIT IS TRUE THAT THESE EXTERNAL\r\n\r\nFACTORS CONTINUE TO BE HANGING\r\nON, CONTINUE TO BE WEIGHING ON\r\n\r\nTHE EUROZONE ECONOMY.\r\nIT IS ALSO TRUE THAT GOVERNMENTS\r\n\r\nARE RESPONDING IN THEIR\r\nRESPECTIVE JURISDICTIONS WITH\r\n\r\nPOLICIES THAT ARE DRESSING THESE\r\nPROBLEMS. IN THE U.S., IN CHINA.\r\n\r\nTHE SECOND POINT TO BE KEPT IN\r\nMIND IS THAT YOU HAVE SEEN THE\r\n\r\nREVISION OF THE INFLATION\r\n\r\nPATH SAYS ONE THING.\r\nWE HAVE CONFIDENCE WE WILL\r\n\r\nCONVERGE AND AT THIS POINT WE\r\nTHINK IT WILL TAKE LONGER TO GET\r\n\r\nTHERE.\r\nWHY IS IT GOING TO TAKE LONGER?\r\n\r\nTHE WEAKER GROWTH PROBABLY\r\n\r\nWILL FURTHER SLOW DOWN THE PASS\r\nTHROUGH FROM HIGHER WAGES TO\r\n\r\nHIGHER PRICES, HIGHER INFLATION.\r\nYOU ALSO SLOW DOWN THE CLOSURE\r\n\r\n-- WE WILL SLOW DOWN THE OUTPUT\r\nGAP.\r\n\r\nIN OTHER WORDS, THE OUTPUT GAP\r\nIS CLOSING.\r\n\r\nTHESE REGIONS ARE IMPORTANT TO\r\nBE KEPT IN MIND.\r\n\r\nTHE OTHER IMPORTANT PART OF\r\nTODAY'S DECISION IS THAT WE\r\n\r\nMAINTAIN THE RISK ASSESSMENT AS\r\nTILTED TO THE DOWNSIDE.\r\n\r\nTHIS IS NOT FREQUENT, BECAUSE WE\r\nUSUALLY SAY WHEN WE TAKE POLICY\r\n\r\nACTIONS, THE RISKS GET BACK INTO\r\nBALANCE.\r\n\r\nON OTHER OCCASIONS IN THE PAST,\r\nBUT NOT FREQUENTLY. WHY IS THAT?\r\n\r\nWE ARE AWARE OUR DECISIONS\r\nINCREASE THE RESILIENCE OF THIS\r\n\r\nEUROZONE ECONOMY.\r\nCAN THEY ADDRESS THESE\r\n\r\nFACTORS THAT ARE WEIGHING ON THE\r\nEUROZONE ECONOMY AND THE REST OF\r\n\r\nTHE WORLD? THEY CANNOT.\r\nTHE FACT OF PROTECTION IS ONE\r\n\r\nFACTOR.\r\nGEOPOLITICAL CONSIDERATIONS ALSO\r\n\r\nRELATED TO WHATEVER HAPPENS\r\nABOUT THE UNITED KINGDOM BREXIT\r\n\r\n, THE FORMS IN WHICH THEY WILL\r\nEXIT FROM THE EUROPEAN UNION.\r\n\r\nTHE EMERGING MARKET FOR\r\nABILITIES, WHAT IS HAPPENING IN\r\n\r\nCHINA?\r\nWE KNOW THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT\r\n\r\nHAS REACTED.\r\nMONETARY POLICY IS CHANGED.\r\n\r\nIN THE U.S. WE HAVE TO TAKE INTO\r\nACCOUNT THERE IS GOING TO BE A\r\n\r\nWAITING EFFECT ON THE FISCAL\r\nPACKAGE.\r\n\r\nTHE LOAD IS EXPECTED THERE.\r\nOUR ACTIONS INCREASE THE\r\n\r\nRESILIENCE OF THE EUROZONE\r\nECONOMY\r\n\r\nAND SO MAKE US\r\nCONFIDENT, KEEP US CONFIDENT\r\n\r\nTHAT CONVERGENCE TO A\r\nSUSTAINABLE RATE OF INFLATION,\r\n\r\nOUR OBJECTIVE, WILL HAPPEN.\r\nTHANK YOU.\r\n\r\n&gt;&gt; CAN I ASK YOU ABOUT WHAT YOU\r\nSAID EARLIER THAT YOU ARE\r\n\r\nSTANDING READY TO ADJUST ALL OF\r\nYOUR INSTRUMENTS AVAILABLE?\r\n\r\nDOES THAT INCLUDE THE NET ASSET\r\nPURCHASE PROGRAM.\r\n\r\nCOULD YOU REVISE IT IN CASE THE\r\nECONOMY IS NOT GOING BETTER AND\r\n\r\nTHE INFLATION OUTLOOK IS GOING\r\nTO WORSEN?\r\n\r\nI HAVE A QUESTION ON THE\r\nUNDERLYING ASSUMPTION OF YOUR\r\n\r\nGROWTH AND INFLATION ESTIMATES.\r\nIS THE UNDERLYING ASSUMPTION\r\n\r\nTHAT THE U.S. AND CHINA WILL\r\nCOME TO AN AGREEMENT ON TRADE OR\r\n\r\nNOT? THANK YOU.\r\nPRES. DRAGHI: THE ANSWER TO THE\r\n\r\nSECOND QUESTION IS OUR\r\nPROJECTIONS TAKE INTO ACCOUNT\r\n\r\nTHE PROTECTIONS MEASURES THAT\r\nHAVE ALREADY BEEN IMPLEMENTED,\r\n\r\nBUT THEY DO NOT PROJECT AND\r\nASSESSMENT OF FUTURE MEASURES OR\r\n\r\nOF HOW THE CURRENT NEGOTIATION\r\nWILL END. ON YOUR FIRST\r\n\r\nQUESTION, YOU SEE\r\nOPTIONALITY'S EVERYWHERE.\r\n\r\nTHE ISSUE IS WHETHER WE SEE\r\nCONTINGENCIES THAT WOULD JUSTIFY\r\n\r\nTHE USE OF CERTAIN INSTRUMENTS\r\nINSTEAD OF OTHERS.\r\n\r\nI DO NOT WANT TO SPECULATE AT\r\nTHIS POINT IN TIME.\r\n\r\nAT THIS POINT IN TIME WE ARE\r\nTAKING ALL OF THESE DECISIONS\r\n\r\nAND WE THINK THEY ARE THE RIGHT\r\nDECISION AND THE ADEQUATE\r\n\r\nDECISIONS TO BE TAKEN AT THIS\r\nPOINT IN TIME.\r\n\r\nLET ME ADD ONE THING.\r\nWE DO NOT TIGHTEN WHEN WE\r\n\r\nSTOPPED PURCHASING THE NET ASSET\r\nPURCHASE PROGRAM.\r\n\r\nWE DO NOT TIGHTEN MONETARY\r\nPOLICY, CONTRARY TO WHAT SOME OF\r\n\r\nYOU SAID.\r\nI'M NOT SURE IT IS ONE OF YOU,\r\n\r\nBUT IT IS BEING SAID. WE\r\n\r\nCONTINUE -- JUST TO GIVE YOU\r\nAN IDEA, THE BALANCE SHEET OF\r\n\r\nTHE ECB IS ABOUT 42% OF THE\r\nEUROZONE GDP.\r\n\r\nTHE FED IS ABOUT HALF OF IT NOW.\r\nIN ORDER TO KEEP THIS STOCK\r\n\r\nUNCHANGED, WE CONTINUE\r\nPURCHASING\r\n\r\nSOMETHING IN THE\r\nORDER OF 20 MILLION EURO A MONTH\r\n\r\nIN BONDS.\r\nTHIS HAPPENS IN A CONTEXT WHERE\r\n\r\nTHE DEBT TO GDP RATIO IN THE\r\nEUROZONE IS FALLING.\r\n\r\nTHE SIMPLE ACTION OF MAINTAINING\r\nA STOCK UNCHANGED IN THIS\r\n\r\nCONTEXT IS CONTINUOUS\r\n\r\nEASING\r\nBECAUSE INTEREST RATES ARE\r\n\r\nPUSHED DOWNWARD BY THIS ACTION.\r\nYOU CAN SEE THIS BECAUSE SINCE\r\n\r\nWE DECIDED JUNE OF LAST YEAR\r\nINTEREST RATES HAVE GONE DOWN,\r\n\r\nTHEY KEEP GOING DOWN.\r\nTHE TERM PREMIUM IS NEGATIVE SO\r\n\r\nCONDITIONS ARE ACCOMMODATIVE.\r\nTHE CHAIN ELEMENTS -- THE\r\n\r\nHORIZON OVER WHICH WE WILL CARRY","thumbnail":{"url":"https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/iQnq_DEc..gI/v5/-1x-1.jpg"},"bmmrId":"vr_oPPj2TeGrF8H3B0J6LA"},"series":[{"type":"Series","id":"daybreak-americas","name":"Bloomberg Daybreak: Americas"},{"type":"Series","id":"tv-shows","name":"TV Shows"}],"videoType":"cut-from-tv"},{"headline":{"html":"Â LeviÂ Strauss IPO Shows Jeans Are Back in the Game"},"url":"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/videos/2019-03-11/levi-strauss-ipo-shows-jeans-are-back-in-the-game-video","video":{"duration":87000,"thumbnail":{"url":"https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/i.wlLieICJnk/v5/-1x-1.jpg"},"bmmrId":"ossisX8YR9~inRJKBJOnfA"},"series":null},{"headline":{"html":"Ibtihaj Muhammad On Breaking Barriers"},"url":"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/videos/2019-03-11/ibtihaj-muhammad-on-breaking-barriers-video","video":{"duration":70000,"thumbnail":{"url":"https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/iKghPclPSEYQ/v5/-1x-1.jpg"},"bmmrId":"yrpcRUMvTiOJCsY39qOQVw"},"series":null},{"headline":{"html":"'Bloomberg Daybreak: Americas' Full Show (03/11/2019)"},"url":"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/videos/2019-03-11/-bloomberg-daybreak-americas-full-show-03-11-2019-video","video":{"duration":5511000,"thumbnail":{"url":"https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/isOHn7DZKuRY/v5/-1x-1.jpg"},"bmmrId":"oXmyfX83RZyLh9YOyFitSQ"},"series":null},{"headline":{"html":"Optimism Over Hedge Funds Is Misplaced, IDW's Ilana Weinstein Says"},"url":"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/videos/2019-03-11/optimism-over-hedge-funds-is-misplaced-idw-s-ilana-weinstein-says-video","video":{"duration":278000,"thumbnail":{"url":"https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/iWCplurv9HhY/v5/-1x-1.jpg"},"bmmrId":"WTimwU~SQ6GCv2gsbGOIgw"},"series":null},{"headline":{"html":"Elanco Animal Health Has a 'Very Clear' Strategy, CEO Says"},"url":"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/videos/2019-03-11/elanco-animal-health-has-a-very-clear-strategy-ceo-says-video","video":{"duration":168000,"thumbnail":{"url":"https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/iiWNVFOSNjl8/v5/-1x-1.jpg"},"bmmrId":"zW5VUAbJSbOB7dJ86_tLlQ"},"series":null},{"headline":{"html":"Gov't Has Made a Lot of Money From Fannie and Freddie, Jim Millstein Says"},"url":"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/videos/2019-03-11/gov-t-has-made-a-lot-of-money-from-fannie-and-freddie-jim-millstein-says-video","video":{"duration":373000,"thumbnail":{"url":"https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/iGUi2SZLxsu0/v5/-1x-1.jpg"},"bmmrId":"cqlPaRykSE6iUsxgsvPtNg"},"series":null},{"headline":{"html":"Connecticut Gov.
