GROUNDING THEIR\r\n\r\nFLIGHTS, BUT IT IS ALSO A\r\nPROBLEM FOR INVESTORS WHEN ALL\r\n\r\nTHE PEOPLE HARMED BY THE CRASH\r\nARE SUED.\r\n\r\n&gt;&gt; YES, IT IS A PROBLEM ALSO\r\nFIRST OF ALL FOR THE FAMILIES OF\r\n\r\nTHOSE WHO WERE LOST.\r\nBOEING SHARES ARE DOWN, 20% OF\r\n\r\nTHE ORDERS OF THESE NEW JETS\r\nCAME FROM CHINA. .\r\n\r\nCHINA HAS GROUNDED THEM.\r\nHOW IMPORTANT IS BOWING TO THE\r\n\r\nINDUSTRIAL SECTOR?\r\nTHE DOW IS DOWN ENTIRELY BECAUSE\r\n\r\nOF BOWING RIGHT NOW?\r\n\r\n&gt;&gt; IT IS VERY IMPORTANT BECAUSE\r\nIT IS IMPORTANT TO THE AREA.\r\n\r\nIT IS LESS IMPORTANT TO THE S&amp;P\r\n500 AND THE INDUSTRIAL SECTOR,\r\n\r\nBUT IT DOES COME AS A DIFFICULT\r\nTIME BECAUSE BOEING HAS BEEN ONE\r\n\r\nOF THE BEST PERFORMERS.\r\nTHIS IS A STOCK THAT IS WELL\r\n\r\nBEYOND ITS LAST YEAR'S HIGHS\r\nUNLIKE THE REST OF THE INDEX.\r\n\r\nAT ITS PEAK, IT WAS UP 50% FROM\r\nITS LOWS IN DECEMBER, STILL UP\r\n\r\n40%. THE STRUGGLE.\r\nBUT WE WERE PRICING IN SO MUCH,\r\n\r\nWE WERE PRICING IN WHICH THINGS\r\nFOR BOEING.\r\n\r\nTHIS PARTICULAR MODEL IS 30% OF\r\nOPERATING PROFIT.\r\n\r\nIF THIS STARTS TO LEAK INTO\r\nPROFITS, WE COULD SEE\r\n\r\nGREATER DOWN SHARES BECAUSE OF\r\nEXTRADITIONS BEING SO INFLATED.\r\n\r\nEXPEDITIONS REPRESENTED BY WHAT\r\nTHE STOCK PRICE IS DOING.\r\n\r\nLISA: WE WILL KEEP WITH BOEING\r\nFOR THE RENDER OF THE SHOW AND\r\n\r\nFOR THE DAY, FRANKLY, BECAUSE IT\r\nIS SUCH AN IMPORTANT STORY.\r\n\r\nWE GOT SOME ECONOMIC DATA FROM\r\nCHINA OVERNIGHT.\r\n\r\nIT INCLUDED NEW LOANS , THE IDEA\r\nTHAT PERHAPS CREDIT IS\r\n\r\nACCELERATING AS QUICKLY -- IS\r\nNOT ACCELERATING AS QUICKLY AS\r\n\r\nEXPECTED.\r\nEXPORTS PICKED UP, BASICALLY\r\n\r\nTRYING TO PAINT A POSITIVE SHE\r\nON THE ECONOMY AT THE TIME WHERE\r\n\r\nTHERE ARE ONGOING TENSIONS ON\r\nTRADE.\r\n\r\nWHAT DID YOU MAKE ON THIS DATA?\r\nWAS IT POSITIVE ENOUGH TO\r\n\r\nGENERATE OPTIMISM ABOUT GLOBAL\r\nGROWTH?\r\n\r\nGINA: ALL THESE MECHANISMS BY\r\nWHICH MONETARY POLICY WILL\r\n\r\nIMPACT THE ECONOMY IN CHINA ARE\r\nREALLY INSPECTING A SELECTED\r\n\r\nGROUP OF COMPANIES AND IS\r\nSELECTED SEGMENT OF SOCIETY.\r\n\r\nLOOK FOR AT THE YIELD CURVE, THE\r\nCREDIT CARD, IT IS ONLY THE\r\n\r\nHIGHEST QUALITY CREDIT BORROWERS\r\nGETTING A LIFT FROM THIS.\r\n\r\nYOU SEE THAT IN THE STOCKS\r\nAS WELL.\r\n\r\nTHE STOCKS OF HAVE A GREATER\r\nPERCENTAGE OF THEIR COMPANIES\r\n\r\nARE OUTPERFORMING THE REST OF\r\nTHE CHINESE SHARES.\r\n\r\nTHERE IS CLEARLY NOT THE WIDE\r\nSPREAD IMPASSE YET, AND THAT IS\r\n\r\nREPRESENTED IN THE DATA.\r\nEXPECTATIONS WERE FOR BETTER\r\n\r\nIMPROVEMENT AND WE SAW IN THESE\r\nSEGMENTS.\r\n\r\nI THINK YOU ARE GETTING\r\nINCREMENTAL BUT NOT WIDESPREAD\r\n\r\nIMPROVEMENT.\r\nIT SUGGESTS THAT WE WILL NOT GET\r\n\r\nTHIS HUGE LIFT IN GLOBAL GROWTH\r\nFROM CHINA JUST YET? DAVID:\r\n\r\nWE KEEP ASKING OURSELVES,\r\nHOW MUCH OF IT IS THE TRADE\r\n\r\nISSUE AND HOW MUCH IS CHINA\r\nITSELF?\r\n\r\nYESTERDAY 90'S CONFERENCE, THEY\r\nSAID, WE ARE CLOSE TO CONSENSUS\r\n\r\nTHAT WE ARE NOT THERE YET.\r\n\r\n&gt;&gt; THE ANSWER IS BOTH.\r\nCHINA HAS TO GET ITS HOUSE IN\r\n\r\nORDER.\r\nTHERE IS A LOT OF BAD DEBT IN\r\n\r\nTHE CORPORATE AND BANKING SECTOR\r\nTHAT NOBODY HAS A REAL HANDLE\r\n\r\nON.\r\nIT IS SOMETHING THAT COULD BRING\r\n\r\nDOWN THE ECONOMY DOMESTICALLY.\r\nTHEN, WE ARE IN THE MIDDLE OF\r\n\r\nTRADE TALKS WITH THE U.S..\r\nTRUMP IS HONESTLY A HARDLINER ON\r\n\r\nTHAT FRONT AND CHINA HAS, OF\r\nBOTH OF THOSE SOOL -- FOR\r\n\r\nCHINA TO COME OUT OF THAT\r\nCLEANLY, IT WOULD BE A TRICKY\r\n\r\nACT? DAVID:\r\nCHAIRMAN POWELL GIVE US\r\n\r\nHIS PAWS AND WHAT IS GOING ON\r\nWITH MONETARY POLICY.\r\n\r\n&gt;&gt; PATIENT NEWS WE DON'T FEEL IN\r\nA HURRY TO CHANGE ARE INTERESTED\r\n\r\nPOLICY.\r\nWHAT HAS HAPPENED IN THE LAST 90\r\n\r\nOR SO DAYS IS THAT WE HAVE SEEN\r\nINCREASING EVIDENCE OF THE\r\n\r\nGLOBAL ECONOMY SLOWING DOWN,\r\nALTHOUGH OUR OWN ECONOMY HAS\r\n\r\nCONTINUED TO PERFORM WELL.\r\n\r\n&gt;&gt; GINA, THIS IS THE INTERESTING\r\nTENSION.\r\n\r\nOUR ECONOMY IS DOING OK,\r\nTHE PROBLEM IS THE REST OF THE\r\n\r\nWORLD.\r\nHOW DOES AN INVESTOR RECONCILE\r\n\r\nTHOSE TWO THINGS?\r\nGINA: I THINK NOW THEY ARE\r\n\r\nRECONCILING IT BY LOOKING FOR\r\nEVIDENCE THAT IT IS LEAKING INTO\r\n\r\nU.S. DATA.\r\nTHE EMPLOYMENT REPORT WAS\r\n\r\nRELATIVELY WEAK.\r\nSOME OF THE CUSTOMER NUMBERS\r\n\r\nWE'VE HAD LATELY HAVEN'T BEEN AS\r\nSTRONG.\r\n\r\nSO THE INVESTOR CLASS IS LOOKING\r\nFOR SIGNS OF WEAKNESS IN THE\r\n\r\nDOMESTIC ECONOMY TO REFLECT WHAT\r\nWE ARE IMPORTING FROM THE REST\r\n\r\nOF THE WORLD.\r\nWE HAVE YET TO SEE ANY\r\n\r\nPERFUNCTORY CLASSES IN MARCH, I\r\nTHINK THAT IS WHAT IS KEEPING\r\n\r\nTHE FED ON THIS POSITION -- WHEN\r\nHE TUESDAY OF HOLD, WE DON'T\r\n\r\nKNOW IF OUR NEXT MOVE IS\r\nTIGHTENING OR EASING.
