Among them, Jordan said, were Cohen’s claims that he never defrauded a bank; that he said he had no contact with foreign entities (though Cohen says he answered accurately on the committee’s disclosure form); that he didn’t set up a self-promotional Twitter account; and that he never wanted a job in the Trump administration.

Ayanna Pressley (Mass.) and Rashida Tlaib (Mich.) — said that just because Trump might have a black friend didn’t mean that he wasn’t a racist. (Cohen agreed.)</p> <p data-elm-loc="34">The statements harked back to a moment from earlier in the hearing, when Rep. Mark Meadows (R-N.C.) had Department of Housing and Urban Development employee Lynne Patton, who is black, stand behind him as he challenged Cohen’s characterization of Trump as someone who freely expressed racist sentiments. Tlaib made the direct connection, opining that it “is alone racist in itself … to use a black woman as a prop” to disprove Cohen’s statements.</p> <p data-elm-loc="35">A red-faced Meadows immediately objected to what he interpreted as Tlaib calling him a racist, demanding that Tlaib’s comments be removed from the record of the hearing — and accusing her of being the racist in the room.</p> <p data-elm-loc="36">“It’s racist to suggest that I asked her to come in for that reason,” Meadows said.</p> <p data-elm-loc="37">But Tlaib defended her comments, telling the panel that she was criticizing the act as racist, not Meadows as a person — and apologizing if it sounded different.</p> <p data-elm-loc="38">Cummings reminded people that he is the son of former sharecroppers in settling the spat.</p> <p data-elm-loc="39">“I can see and feel your pain,” he said to Meadows — who, he told the assembled audience, is one of his best friends. “And I don’t think Ms. Tlaib intends to cause you that kind of pain and that kind of frustration.”</p> <div data-elm-loc="40" class="inline-content inline-html"> <hr style="margin-top:-10px;margin-bottom:-10px;"/> </div> <p data-elm-loc="41"><b>4:56 p.m.: AOC focuses on Trump’s tendency to falsely state assets</b></p> <p data-elm-loc="42">Freshman Rep.

Cohen said he was willing to disclose his contact with a bank in Kazakhstan, which he argued was not a government entity though it is majority-owned by the Kazakh government.</p> <p data-elm-loc="62">Jordan, the ranking Republican, said Cohen should also disclose his work for a Korean entity.

As noted by the Southern District of New York, Cohen’s wide array of crimes were ‘marked by a pattern of deception that permeated his professional life’ and his ‘instinct to blame others is strong.’ Prosecutors said his actions were to ensure that he would ‘profit personally, build his own power, and enhance his level of influence.’ This is the same Michael Cohen who has admitted that he lied to Congress previously.

He added that Trump’s longtime secretary, Rhona Graff, would have also been aware of the call, as she transferred it back to Trump’s office.</p> <p data-elm-loc="127">Cohen guessed the meeting took place on July 18 or 19 — the first tranche of emails released by the anti-secrecy organization WikiLeaks would come out just a few days later.</p> <div data-elm-loc="128" class="inline-content inline-html"> <hr style="margin-top:-10px;margin-bottom:-10px;"/> </div> <p data-elm-loc="129"><b>1:50 p.m.: Did Cohen actually want a White House job?</b></p> <p data-elm-loc="130">The question has been kicking around the committee hearing room a few times Wednesday, as Cohen has said repeatedly that he never wanted a job in the administration, and was content to just serve as Trump’s lawyer.</p> <p data-elm-loc="131">The problem is, federal prosecutors thought otherwise — and those words are emblazoned on a display board prominently featured on the Republican side of the dais.</p> <p data-elm-loc="132">“[Cohen] expected to be given a prominent role and title in the new administration.

Justin Amash (R-Mich.) asked Cohen to elaborate more on these hints that Trump would give, seeking to shed light on how Trump gives orders without saying the words specifically.</p> <p data-elm-loc="139">Cohen said Trump likes to give orders by making a sweeping claim — then asking a question that’s not really a question, per se. Cohen likened it to a powerful individual pointing to his tie and claiming it’s “the nicest looking tie!”—then asking a subordinate if he or she agrees.</p> <p data-elm-loc="140">Similarly, Cohen has testified that while the two were in frequent contact about the prospect of a Trump Tower Moscow during the campaign, Trump would at times look at him and say something along the lines of, “There is no Moscow project.” Cohen said he took that as a sign to lie to the public and to Congress about Trump’s business interests in Russia during the campaign.</p> <p data-elm-loc="141">“He speaks in a code, and I understand the code,” Cohen said.</p> <div data-elm-loc="142" class="inline-content inline-html"> <hr style="margin-top:-10px;margin-bottom:-10px;"/> </div> <p data-elm-loc="143"><b>1:35 p.m.: Cohen: Trump was in on the hush-payment lie </b></p> <p data-elm-loc="144">Cohen testified that the president personally called him to make sure he continued to lie about hush payments made to women alleging sexual relationships with him during the 2016 presidential campaign.</p> <p data-elm-loc="145">Rep. Katie Hill, a freshman Democrat from California, used her time to ask Cohen about Trump’s role overseeing his former lawyer’s lies to the public about the payments.

Yet according to his own testimony, Cohen has held foreign contracts within the past two years.</p> <p data-elm-loc="155">Meadows lept on this discrepancy, demanding Cohen explain why he had appeared to lie to Congress yet again. Cohen claimed he hadn’t, promising to consult with his lawyer and amend the form if he made a mistake.</p> <p data-elm-loc="156">For a hearing in which the central theme has been Cohen’s credibility, the omission would have been an example of the point the GOP has been making: Once a liar, always a liar, and his testimony against Trump should not be trusted.</p> <p data-elm-loc="157">But Rep. Katie Hill (D-Calif.) pointed out, the form has a footnote: For witnesses not representing a government, the foreign contracts and payments that must be disclosed are those “originating with a foreign government.”</p> <p data-elm-loc="158">Cohen maintains his foreign contracts did not involve foreign governments.</p> <div data-elm-loc="159" class="inline-content inline-html"> <hr style="margin-top:-10px;margin-bottom:-10px;"/> </div> <p data-elm-loc="160"><b>1:24 p.m.: Felix Sater takes center stage</b></p> <p data-elm-loc="161">Rep.

Sater also worked with Cohen during the presidential campaign to pursue a Trump Tower in Moscow.</p> <p data-elm-loc="162"><i>[<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/former-mafia-linked-figure-describes-association-with-trump/2016/05/17/cec6c2c6-16d3-11e6-aa55-670cabef46e0_story.html?utm_term=.0147d7f2c61d" title="www.washingtonpost.com">Former Mafia-linked figure describes association with Trump</a>]</i></p> <p data-elm-loc="163">In sworn testimony in a 2013 deposition, Trump had testified that he wouldn’t recognize Sater if the two were in the same room. But Cohen testified that Sater was a business partner and had been given both a Trump business card and an office in the Trump Organization’s suite. These details had been known previously, but Cohen was able to offer a personal touch: He testified that he was quite familiar with Sater’s office, since he took over the same space after Sater vacated it.</p> <p data-elm-loc="164">Rouda referred to Sater repeatedly as a “convicted Russian mobster.” Sater immigrated to the United States from Soviet Russia as a child. In 1998, he was convicted of taking part in a stock pump-and-dump fraud that used members of the Italian mob as muscle. He was spared prison time and prosecutors kept his plea deal under seal for years while he assisted the government and provided information on issues related to organized crime and national security. When information about his involvement in the scheme became public, Trump sought to distance himself from his onetime partner, including in the 2013 deposition.</p> <p data-elm-loc="165">Asked by Rouda if Trump was being misleading in the deposition or, “at worst, lying under oath,” Cohen responded simply, “yes.”</p> <div data-elm-loc="166" class="inline-content inline-html"> <hr style="margin-top:-10px;margin-bottom:-10px;"/> </div> <p data-elm-loc="167"><b>1:20 p.m.: Cohen says Trump lawyer Jay Sekulow edited congressional testimony later found to be false</b></p> <p data-elm-loc="168">Cohen asserted Wednesday that Jay Sekulow, Trump’s lawyer, edited the congressional testimony to Congress that he would later admit was false — implying that Sekulow might have, in part, caused it to be wrong.</p> <p data-elm-loc="169">Cohen confirmed to Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-Md.) that Sekulow was the lawyer he alleged previously had edited his congressional testimony, and he confirmed, importantly, one of the changes had to do with “the length of time that the Trump Tower Moscow project stayed and remained alive.” Cohen has admitted he lied about the project, telling lawmakers discussions about it ended by January 2016, when in fact they continued into the summer — the heart of the presidential campaign.</p> <p data-elm-loc="170">“There were several changes that were made, including, how we were going to handle that message,” Cohen said when asked about Sekulow’s edits. “Which was — the message of course being the length of time that the Trump Tower Moscow project stayed and remained alive.”</p> <p data-elm-loc="171">“That was one of the changes?” Raskin said.</p> <p data-elm-loc="172">“Yes,” Cohen responded.</p> <p data-elm-loc="173">In response to questions later from Rep. John Sarbanes (D-Md.), Cohen said he electronically circulated his written testimony before speaking to Congress previously to a group of lawyers for the president and others because he was part of a joint defense agreement. He said the testimony was reviewed, for instance, by a Abbe Lowell, a lawyer for Ivanka Trump and husband Jared Kushner.

He pleaded guilty in December and is expected to begin a three-year prison sentence in May.</p> <p data-elm-loc="180">Cohen also recalled how Trump had told him: “Michael, there’s no collusion, there’s no Russia, there’s no involvement, no interference.”</p> <p data-elm-loc="181">“That’s the message, the stay on point, that’s the party line that he created,” Cohen explained. “That’s the message that he wanted to reinforce.”</p> <div data-elm-loc="182" class="inline-content inline-html"> <hr style="margin-top:-10px;margin-bottom:-10px;"/><a name="unspecified"></a> </div> <p data-elm-loc="183"><b>1 p.m.: Cohen sidesteps question about last conversation with Trump, cites ongoing criminal probe</b></p> <p data-elm-loc="184">Cohen suggested federal prosecutors in New York are investigating some unspecified crime involving Trump, declining to answer questions about his last conversation with the president because of a request that he not discuss an ongoing inquiry.</p> <p data-elm-loc="185">Oversight Committee member Raja Krishnamoorthi (D-Ill.) pressed Cohen on his final conversations with the Trump. The last time they spoke, Cohen said, occurred about two months after the FBI raided his home and office last April — but he could not disclose what was said, he continued.</p> <p data-elm-loc="186">“Unfortunately, this topic is actually something that is being investigated right now by the Southern District of New York, and I’ve been asked by them not to discuss, and not to talk about these issues,” Cohen said.</p> <p data-elm-loc="187">Krishnamoorthi followed up: “Is there any other wrongdoing or illegal act that you are aware of regarding Donald Trump that we haven’t yet discussed today?”</p> <p data-elm-loc="188">“Yes, and again, those are part of the investigation that is currently being looked at by the Southern District of New York,” Cohen responded.</p> <p data-elm-loc="189">The testimony is an ominous sign for Trump, signaling potential continued law enforcement interest in him or those around him.</p> <p data-elm-loc="190">The Southern District had investigated hush-money payments made to women alleging sexual relationships with Trump during the campaign, and Cohen pleaded guilty to campaign finance violations regarding these transactions. But Cohen has talked in detail about that case, so he is probably referring to something else.

Trump’s defenders have insisted that, despite Cohen’s plea deal, it would be very hard to bring criminal charges over the payments against Trump in part because he was being advised by a lawyer.</p> <p data-elm-loc="194">Massie asked Cohen if a lawyer has an ethical obligation to provide good legal advice. Cohen agreed that he does. “I believe so,” Cohen responded. He referenced Cohen’s written testimony, in which he said he paid the money to Daniels without considering whether it was the right thing to do. “Is that being a good lawyer? To not even consider whether it’s legal or not?”</p> <p data-elm-loc="195">Cohen maintained that he was looking to protect Trump and knew what Trump wanted because he had been dealing with threats from Daniels to go public that dated to 2011.</p> <div data-elm-loc="196" class="inline-content inline-html"> <hr style="margin-top:-10px;margin-bottom:-10px;"/> </div> <p data-elm-loc="197"><b>12:40 p.m.: Cohen provides a date for claim Stone told Trump he was in contact with Assange</b></p> <p data-elm-loc="198">In his written testimony, Cohen merely said that he heard Stone tell Trump he had been in contact with WikiLeaks leader Julian Assange in July 2016, shortly before the publication of stolen emails by WikiLeaks.</p> <p data-elm-loc="199">Pressed to provide an exact date in oral testimony, he told lawmakers that he believed the conversation occurred on either July 18 or 19, likely the second day. That would place it three days before WikiLeaks published internal Democratic Party emails on July 22.</p> <p data-elm-loc="200">Massie noted that Assange had claimed publicly in June that he had damaging material about Clinton. “I’m not saying you have fake news.

Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) opened his questions by zeroing in on a disputed BuzzFeed News article that alleges Cohen had told the special counsel that Trump directed him to lie to Congress. Jordan noted that Cohen’s attorney, Lanny Davis, had said in the wake of that report he could not confirm or deny it — though the special counsel’s office would soon come out say it was wrong.</p> <p data-elm-loc="204">“Why didn’t he deny the BuzzFeed story?” Jordan asked of Davis.</p> <p data-elm-loc="205">“Because I didn’t think it was his responsibility to do that,” Cohen responded. “We are not the fact-checkers for BuzzFeed.”</p> <p data-elm-loc="206">In his opening statement, Cohen had said Trump did not tell him to lie to Congress, though he intuited that is what Trump wanted. Jordan, though, did not press into the substance of what discussions, if any, Cohen and Trump might have had about his testimony. Instead, he seemed to batter Davis for not knocking down the story, and noted that the special counsel had.</p> <p data-elm-loc="207">“The special counsel said — something they’ve never done — they said that story was false,” Jordan said, after he and Cohen repeatedly interrupted the other.</p> <p data-elm-loc="208">“My response, the president has told something over 9,000 lies to date, do I ask Mr. Davis or Mr. [Michael] Monico, do I go on television to correct his mistakes?” Cohen responded.</p> <p data-elm-loc="209">Monico is another of Cohen’s lawyers.

But under more specific questioning, Cohen declined to commit that he would not pursue public activities in the future.</p> <p data-elm-loc="214">“Can you commit under oath that you will not, that you have not, and will not pursue a book deal,” Foxx asked.</p> <p data-elm-loc="215">And I would not do that, no,” Cohen responded.</p> <p data-elm-loc="216">He also declined to commit that he would not pursue a political office in New York.</p> <div data-elm-loc="217" class="inline-content inline-html"> <hr style="margin-top:-10px;margin-bottom:-10px;"/> </div> <p data-elm-loc="218"><b>12:15 p.m.: Cohen: I’m responsible for your silliness</b></p> <p data-elm-loc="219">Cohen has said he was motivated to turn on Trump and change previous testimony to Congress because he was distressed by Trump’s reaction to the white supremacist rally in Charlottesville and his interactions with Russian President Vladimir Putin at a summit in Helsinki. Most of all, Cohen said, he was moved by what he called “watching the daily destruction of our civility to each other.”</p> <p data-elm-loc="220">He noted the Republicans displaying a sign calling him a “liar, liar” and called it “unbecoming” of Congress — behavior he said has been influenced by Trump’s discourse. “</p> <p data-elm-loc="221">“I’m responsible for your silliness because I did the same things that you’re doing now,” he said. “I protected Mr. Trump for 10 years.”</p> <p data-elm-loc="222">He passionately argued that others who surround the president should learn from his example. “Look at what’s happened to me. I had a wonderful life . . . And I’ve lost it all,” he said.</p> <p data-elm-loc="223">As a pre-lunch final offering, he offered a vivid and devastating portrait of what it was like to work for the Trump Organization: “Everybody’s job at the Trump Organization is to protect Mr. Trump.

You don’t know truth from falsehood,” Gosar charged, suggesting that if Cohen had been worth anything as a lawyer, he should know he had a “duty of loyalty” and “duty of confidentiality” to his client — in this case, Trump.</p> <p data-elm-loc="229">“How can anybody listen to this pathological person?” Gosar asked.</p> <p data-elm-loc="230">In the moments that followed, Gosar and Cohen fell into a classic “yes it is” — “no it’s not” spat, debating whether Cohen was testifying negatively about Trump simply to make a deal with federal prosecutors and reduce his jail time.</p> <p data-elm-loc="231">“I’m not sure how my appearance today is providing substantial information that the Southern District can use for the creation of a case,” Cohen said.</p> <p data-elm-loc="232">“Liar, liar, pants on fire,” Gosar concluded. “No one should ever listen to you and give you credibility.”</p> <div data-elm-loc="233" class="inline-content inline-html"> <hr style="margin-top:-10px;margin-bottom:-10px;"/><a name="protecting"></a> </div> <p data-elm-loc="234"><b>12:09 p.m.: Trump Jr, Ivanka Trump were briefed on Trump Tower Moscow discussions, Cohen says</b></p> <p data-elm-loc="235">Cohen said Wednesday that while he pursued a possible Trump Tower project in Moscow as Trump was running for president, he briefed the president’s children, Donald Trump Jr. and Ivanka Trump, on several occasions, as well as Trump himself.</p> <p data-elm-loc="236">In naming Ivanka and Donald Trump Jr., Cohen was clearing up a mystery in court records filed as part of his plea — which noted he had briefed Trump family members about the project but did not identify them by name. Cohen said he briefed the Trump children about 10 times, as well as reporting back to Trump every time he had a discussion about the project.</p> <p data-elm-loc="237">“After each communication that I had, I would report back to him,” Cohen said.</p> <p data-elm-loc="238">Trump has claimed in the past he had no business involvement in Russia; Cohen’s testimony takes direct aim at that.

In response to questions from Rep. Jody Hice (R-Georgia), Cohen testified that he reached out to Davis to represent him, not the other way around. Cohen said that Davis is not currently being paid for his work.</p> <div data-elm-loc="243" class="inline-content inline-html"> <hr style="margin-top:-10px;margin-bottom:-10px;"/> </div> <p data-elm-loc="244"><b>12:04 p.m.: Cohen: No proof Trump is a racist </b></p> <p data-elm-loc="245">Cohen said he doesn’t have proof that Trump is a racist, telling Rep. Mark Meadows (R-N.C.) that while he has “maybe 100” secret recordings of Trump talking, none of them include comments he’s made about black individuals.</p> <p data-elm-loc="246">Meadows, a close ally to president Trump, pressed Cohen for evidence of his allegation that Trump was racist. Cohen in his opening statement said Trump “once asked me if I could name a country that was run by a black person that wasn’t a ‘s----hole,’” and he said Trump “told me black people would never vote for him because they were too ‘stupid.’”</p> <p data-elm-loc="247">Meadows pointed to his guest at the hearing, Trump associate Lynne Patton, to counter that assertion. Patton, who is black and who stood behind Meadows as he spoke, submitted a comment for the record saying Trump is not racist.</p> <p data-elm-loc="248">“You made some very demanding comments about the president that Ms. Patton doesn’t agree with,” Meadows said. “She says there is no way she would work with an individual who is racist.”</p> <p data-elm-loc="249">He added his own take, too: “I’ve talked to the president more than 300 times. I have not heard a racist comment from the president.”</p> <p data-elm-loc="250">Meadows also pressed Cohen about consulting contracts Cohen signed after Trump became president, when Cohen collected more than $4 million to advise major companies. Wasn’t Cohen selling access to Trump, Meadows asked?</p> <p data-elm-loc="251">Cohen insisted that he was paid to advise on the “enigma” of Donald Trump.</p> <p data-elm-loc="252">“Not something that’s unusual in Washington,” he said. He said that he was, for instance, paid $1.2 million by the drug company Novartis and agreed he spoke to company executives no more than six times.</p> <p data-elm-loc="253">But Cohen insisted he did not lobby for his massive fees, an important assertion for the former lawyer since he never registered to lobby on their behalf.</p> <div data-elm-loc="254" class="inline-content inline-html"> <hr style="margin-top:-10px;margin-bottom:-10px;"/> </div> <p data-elm-loc="255"><b>11:55 a.m.: Behind the scenes of the Trump response to the ‘Access Hollywood’ tape</b></p> <p data-elm-loc="256">In October 2016, Cohen said he received in a phone call from Trump adviser Hope Hicks while he was traveling in London, asking for his help. News was about to break that the president had been caught on video saying obscene things about what famous people could do to women. Hicks, Cohen testified, asked him if he could call reporters he knew.</p> <p data-elm-loc="257">“We want you to just spin this,” she said, according to Cohen.</p> <p data-elm-loc="258">Cohen offered the behind-the-scenes interactions of Trump advisers about the now infamous “Access Hollywood” tape in response to questions from Rep. Eleanor Holmes Norton (D-D. C.). He said the campaign was particularly worried about the tape because Trump around the same time was facing allegations that he engaged in extramarital affairs, which he was hoping to pay to keep quiet.</p> <p data-elm-loc="259">“I was concerned about it, but more importantly, Mr. Trump was concerned about it,” Cohen said.</p> <p data-elm-loc="260">Norton pressed aggressively on whether Trump’s concern was because of the election, and Cohen said it was. That is important because Cohen has pleaded guilty to campaign finance violations in connections to the payments to the women, which might have been legal if they were merely to shield Trump from personal embarrassment. Cohen has alleged he arranged the payments at Trump’s direction.</p> <div data-elm-loc="261" class="inline-content inline-html"> <hr style="margin-top:-10px;margin-bottom:-10px;"/> </div> <p data-elm-loc="262"><b>11:50 a.m.: ‘Shame on you, Mr. Jordan’</b></p> <p data-elm-loc="263">Cohen joined the select ranks of witnesses who have erupted at Jordan, the committee’s ranking Republican, during their testimony, after Jordan accused him of disputing federal prosecutors’ determination that he is a liar.</p> <p data-elm-loc="264">“Shame on you, Mr. Jordan,” Cohen said, warning Jordan against casting aspersions on him. “I made mistakes, I own them, and I didn’t fight with the Southern District of New York … what I did do is I pled guilty and I am going to be going to prison.”</p> <p data-elm-loc="265">“I took responsibility … I take responsibility for my mistakes,” he said. “I am remorseful, I am going to prison.”</p> <p data-elm-loc="266">The retort came on the heels of an exchange with Rep.

Carolyn B. Maloney (D-N.Y.), Cohen has explained how “catch and kill” worked, the practice by which David Pecker, the head of AMI, which publishes the National Enquirer, would agree to help Trump by buying negative stories about him and then never have the magazine write about them.</p> <p data-elm-loc="272">Cohen explained that he was involved with “several” such episodes. So far, only one has been made public. As part of Cohen’s plea, he agreed that he worked with Pecker to have AMI purchase the rights to model Karen McDougal’s story that she had an affair with Trump. The tabloid outlet never ran her story. Cohen did not outline other such episodes with which he was involved but noted that Pecker’s practice of buying and burying negative stories about Trump began even before Cohen was hired to work for the Trump Organization in 2007.</p> <p data-elm-loc="273">Maloney asked Cohen whether there were other women who had made claims similar to McDougal’s and Daniels’s. Cohen replied that he could not recall but noted, “it’s certainly the two that we know about.”</p> <p data-elm-loc="274">Cohen described an ongoing conversation about how Trump should repay him for the hush money he paid to Daniels. Could the business let Cohen throw a party at a Trump Organization facility? Did Cohen know someone who wanted free membership to a Trump golf club? Finally, he explained, with time running out before Daniels sold her story to an outlet that would publicize it, he said the decision was made to simply repay Cohen the money.</p> <div data-elm-loc="275" class="inline-content inline-html"> <hr style="margin-top:-10px;margin-bottom:-10px;"/> </div> <p data-elm-loc="276"><b>11:34 a.m.: Cohen: Trump is capable of colluding to win</b></p> <p data-elm-loc="277">Rep.

But he confirmed that Trump’s children likely also knew about the Trump Organization’s attempt to build a Trump tower in Moscow during the 2016 election.</p> <p data-elm-loc="281">“The company was involved … which meant the family was involved,” he said.</p> <p data-elm-loc="282">Wasserman Schultz continued: “Is it possible the whole family is conflicted or compromised with a foreign adversary in the months before the election?”</p> <p data-elm-loc="283">Cohen answered yes.</p> <p data-elm-loc="284">Wasserman Schultz, who resigned her DNC position following the hacking and release of internal emails, asked Cohen if he thought Trump was so desperate to win that he would collude and coordinate with Russia or a foreign power.</p> <p data-elm-loc="285">“It calls on so much speculation …” he trailed off. “Mr. Trump, he’s all about winning and will do what is necessary to win.”</p> <p data-elm-loc="286">He continued: “I wouldn’t use the word ‘colluding.’ Was there something odd about the back-and-forth praise with President [Vladimir] Putin? Yes. But I’m not really sure that I can answer that question in terms of collusion. I was not part of the campaign.

Cohen said he paid his own way.</p> <p data-elm-loc="292">For the rest of the time, Green delivered a soliloquy about Cohen’s questionable credibility, scoffing at panel Democrats for picking a “star witness” who had committed basically every infraction he was accusing Trump of orchestrating.</p> <p data-elm-loc="293">As Green excoriated Cohen, “none other than a scorned man” who, he said, had lied about everything from his finances to the birth of his child, he never looked at him, delivering his comments to wall cameras at the back of the room.

Cohen said that these three statements — from 2011, 2012 and 2013 — were shown to Deutsche Bank, as Trump sought a loan to purchase the Buffalo Bills football team. Trump, in the end, did not buy the team.</p> <p data-elm-loc="297">These statements were not rigorously audited financial documents. Instead, they amounted to Trump’s own estimates about what he was worth and what he owed. Trump himself was the main source of the data.</p> <p data-elm-loc="298">But the 2013 statement showed something remarkable.</p> <p data-elm-loc="299">That year, Trump rapidly increased his own estimate of his net worth — from $4.6 billion to $8.6 billion.</p> <p data-elm-loc="300">The reason was not a new building or a big business success by Trump. Instead, Trump simply assigned a massive dollar value — $4 billion — to his own brand, and then counted that brand among his assets, as if it was a building or a golf course. The result was that his net worth nearly doubled.</p> <p data-elm-loc="301">In his statement, Cohen said that these statements were part of a pattern of Trump exaggerating his net worth, when it benefited him.</p> <p data-elm-loc="302">“It was my experience that Mr. Trump inflated his total assets when it served his purposes,” Cohen said.</p> <div data-elm-loc="303" class="inline-content inline-html"> <hr style="margin-top:-10px;margin-bottom:-10px;"/> </div> <p data-elm-loc="304"><b>11:20 a.m.: ‘You didn’t get brought to the dance’</b></p> <p data-elm-loc="305">Jordan, the panel’s ranking Republican, made clear in his first exchange with Cohen what Republicans line of attack will be at the hearing: Cohen is a disgruntled employee, upset that he couldn’t get a job in the Trump White House.</p> <p data-elm-loc="306">Jordan opened his questioning of Cohen by walking the president’s former personal lawyer through a litany of wrongdoing — including tax and bank fraud — to which he has pleaded guilty, but has nothing to do with Trump.

Cohen conceded that Trump Jr. might have had only “cursory information,” about what was afoot, though Trump and the COO of the Trump organization were intimately involved.</p> <p data-elm-loc="321">Cohen said the payments were made directly because they were “declaratively a retainer for services that would be provided for the year of 2017.”</p> <p data-elm-loc="322">But “there is no retainer agreement,” he noted.</p> <div data-elm-loc="323" class="inline-content inline-html"> <hr style="margin-top:-10px;margin-bottom:-10px;"/> </div> <p data-elm-loc="324"><b>11:06 a.m.: Cohen is officially no longer a lawyer</b></p> <p data-elm-loc="325">Cohen officially lost his law license on Tuesday, he told the Oversight Committee — just over two months before he is due to report to prison for having lied to Congress.</p> <p data-elm-loc="326">Cohen brought up the fact that he will not be allowed to practice law, when asked by Chairman Cummings if he understood how serious his admission was that he lied to Congress — especially as a lawyer.</p> <p data-elm-loc="327">Cohen said yes — even though he is no longer a lawyer.</p> <p data-elm-loc="328">Cohen’s credibility is at issue during the hearing, as Republicans have sought to cast him as a thorough liar whose testimony cannot be trusted.

Protesters. The familiar sight outside high-profile congressional hearings and the court proceedings of Trump’s affiliates was noticeably absent Wednesday.

Cohen said this was notable because people rarely walked behind Trump’s desk. He testified that he heard Trump Jr. lean down and whisper to his father, “The meeting is all set.” He alleged that Trump responded, “Okay good … let me know.”</p> <p data-elm-loc="344">Cohen testified that when news of the meeting broke in 2017, he remembered the incident and decided it was likely a reference to the Trump Tower meeting. Bitingly, he added that he believed this was likely the case because “Mr. Trump had frequently told me and others that his son Don Jr. had the worst judgment of anyone in the world. And also, that Don Jr. would never set up any meeting of any significance alone and certainly not without checking with his father.”</p> <p data-elm-loc="345">Cohen’s testimony finally provides a direct account from Trump’s former lawyer of what he claims he knows — and doesn’t know — about Trump’s knowledge of the meeting. This became a major issue this summer, when CNN reported that Cohen had told investigators that he had evidence Trump Jr. informed his father of the meeting.</p> <p data-elm-loc="346">Cohen’s lawyer, Lanny Davis, was later identified as the source of that information. But Davis was forced to later revise his claims and said he’d gotten things wrong about what Cohen knew. “It’s a major mistake for which I am 100 percent sorry. Period. I never should have done it unless I was certain and could prove it,” he told NBC News.</p> <div data-elm-loc="347" class="inline-content inline-html"> <hr style="margin-top:-10px;margin-bottom:-10px;"/> </div> <p data-elm-loc="348"><b>10:45 a.m.: Trump exaggerated his financial position, according to Cohen documents and testimony</b></p> <p data-elm-loc="349">From 2011 to 2013, Trump exaggerated his financial position and the value of the properties he owned to obtain financing from lenders including Deutsche Bank, according to testimony and documents submitted to Congress by Cohen.</p> <p data-elm-loc="350">The “statements of financial condition” for Trump that Cohen submitted to Congress depict Trump as having between $170 million and $346 million in cash and marketable securities on hand. Trump attempted to use the documents to try to obtain a Deutsche loan to purchase the Buffalo Bills, Cohen said in his testimony, and to improve his ranking among lists of wealthy Americans.</p> <p data-elm-loc="351">“It was my experience that Mr. Trump inflated his total assets when it served his purposes, such as trying to be listed among the wealthiest people in Forbes, and deflated his assets to reduce his real estate taxes,” Cohen said.</p> <div data-elm-loc="352" class="inline-content inline-html"> <hr style="margin-top:-10px;margin-bottom:-10px;"/> </div> <p data-elm-loc="353"><b>10:40 a.m.: Cohen releases threatening letter to Fordham University</b></p> <p data-elm-loc="354">Among the documents Cohen has provided to the committee is a letter to the president of Fordham University in New York, where Trump studied for two years before transferring to the University of Pennsylvania. In the letter, dated May 5, 2015 — about a month before Trump declared his candidacy for president — Cohen noted that media outlets had been asking for the release of Trump’s college records. Cohen wrote to the university president that federal law requires the permission of a former student before the release of college records — and made clear that Trump’s permission would not be forthcoming.</p> <p data-elm-loc="355">Releasing the records, Cohen wrote, would open the school “to both criminal and civil liability and damages including, among other things, substantial fines, penalties and even the potential loss of government aid and other funding.”</p> <p data-elm-loc="356">“The criminality will lead to jail time,” Cohen went on to threaten, adding, “We will hold your institution liable to the fullest extent of the law including damages and criminality.”</p> <p data-elm-loc="357">He concluded by asking that the university contact him to confirm that Trump’s records had been “permanently sealed.”</p> <p data-elm-loc="358">In his opening remarks, Cohen told the committee that he was instructed to write the letter to Fordham and Trump’s other educational institutions by Trump. And he will note the irony: Trump was secretly instructing Cohen to bully and threaten people to ensure Trump’s records, after engaging in a years-long campaign to press President Barack Obama to release documents about his background, including college transcripts.</p> <div data-elm-loc="359" class="inline-content inline-html"> <hr style="margin-top:-10px;margin-bottom:-10px;"/> </div> <p data-elm-loc="360"><b>10:30 a.m.: Cohen has begun reading from his prepared statement</b></p> <p data-elm-loc="361">Cohen has begun reading from his prepared statement.

He called Cohen a “fraudster, a liar and, in two months, a federal inmate” and suggested history will look unkindly on Democrats’ decision to hold their first oversight public hearing after taking over control of Congress in January with Cohen.</p> <p data-elm-loc="365">Jordan asserted that the hearing may be the first time in history that a person convicted of lying to Congress, as Cohen was in November, has appeared before Congress again so quickly to once again offer testimony.</p> <p data-elm-loc="366">And he alleged that the hearing — its timing, its topics, its audience — had all been orchestrated by Lanny Davis, a longtime friend of Bill and Hillary Clinton and now a lawyer for Cohen. Jordan told Cohen that he was acting as Democrats’ “patsy” at the hearing.</p> <p data-elm-loc="367">“They’ve got to find somebody somewhere to say some thing to remove the president from office,” he said, before adding wryly, “Actually, they didn’t find him.

Cohen seemed to dispute the reporting, saying in his written testimony, “Mr. Trump did not directly tell me to lie to Congress. That’s not how he operates.”</p> <p data-elm-loc="388">But he also suggested he intuited what Trump wanted him to do, based on conversations they had during the campaign about the Trump Tower project.</p> <p data-elm-loc="389">“To be clear: Mr. Trump knew of and directed the Trump Moscow negotiations throughout the campaign and lied about it. He lied about it because he never expected to win the election. He also lied about it because he stood to make hundreds of millions of dollars on the Moscow real estate project,” Cohen said in the prepared testimony. “And so I lied about it, too — because Mr. Trump had made clear to me, through his personal statements to me that we both knew were false and through his lies to the country, that he wanted me to lie. And he made it clear to me because his personal attorneys reviewed my statement before I gave it to Congress.”</p> <p data-elm-loc="390">In a statement Wednesday, BuzzFeed continued to stand by its story.</p> <p data-elm-loc="391">“Michael Cohen’s public testimony reaffirms what he claimed in private to investigators, as we reported last month: President Trump directed him to lie to Congress about negotiations to build a Trump Tower in Moscow in the heat of the 2016 campaign,” spokesman Matt Mittenthal said.</p> <p data-elm-loc="392"><i>This post has been updated to correct the spelling of Matt Mittenthal’s name. </i></p> <div data-elm-loc="393" class="inline-content inline-html"> <hr style="margin-top:-10px;margin-bottom:-10px;"/> </div> <p data-elm-loc="394"><b>9:18 a.m.: Evidence of yet another portrait Trump bought of himself</b></p> <p data-elm-loc="395">According to written testimony distributed in advance, Cohen will allege that Trump asked him to arrange for purchase of a large portrait of Trump himself for $60,000 — and that Trump then repaid the bidder with money from Trump’s own charitable foundation. Trump kept the art for himself.</p> <p data-elm-loc="396">The Washington Post has previously reported about two portraits of himself that Trump bought with money from his charity, the Donald J. Trump Foundation. This appears to be a third.</p> <p data-elm-loc="397">Cohen’s description matches news reports about a 2013 art auction in New York’s Hamptons, in which a Trump friend named Stewart Rahr bought a nine-foot-tall portrait of Trump from artist William Quigley. The Hamptons news site <a href="https://www.danspapers.com/2015/11/east-hampton-artists-trump-portrait-caught-the-donalds-attention/">Dan’s Papers </a>quoted Quigley then as saying the payment was $67,000, and that he picked the check up from Trump himself.</p> <p data-elm-loc="398">If Cohen’s account is true, the payment to Rahr was not mentioned in the Trump Foundation’s IRS filings for 2013. Those filings show only a $60,000 payment from the Trump Foundation, but that was listed as going to the American Cancer Society.</p> <p data-elm-loc="399">Rahr, Quigley and the American Cancer Society all declined to comment while The Post <a href="https://projects.propublica.org/nonprofits/organizations/133404773/201443189349101314/IRS990PF">was reporting </a>on Trump’s charitable giving in 2016.</p> <p data-elm-loc="400">The New York attorney general last year sued Trump and his foundation, alleging the charity engaged in “persistently illegal conduct.” Among the allegations: Trump used charity funds to pay for two other portraits of himself.

According to Cohen’s written testimony, he will say “he had just gotten off the phone with [WikiLeaks founder] Julian Assange and that Mr. Assange told Mr. Stone that, within a couple of days, there would be a massive dump of emails that would damage Hillary Clinton’s campaign.” It was in those days that WikiLeaks released a batch of DNC emails.

In August 2016, he also boasted publicly of having communicated with Assange and — perhaps most notably — tweeted on Aug. 21: “Trust me, it will soon the Podesta’s time in the barrel.” Six weeks later, WikiLeaks began posting another set of stolen emails from the account of Clinton’s campaign chairman, John Podesta.</p> <p data-elm-loc="409">A person familiar with Cohen’s testimony said Cohen does not have evidence, such as contemporaneous memos, to support the assertion he will make about the phone call between Stone and Trump.</p> <p data-elm-loc="410">In response to the testimony, WikiLeaks tweeted that the group “had already publicly announced its pending publications and has always denied speaking to Roger Stone.”</p> <div data-elm-loc="411" class="inline-content inline-html"> <hr style="margin-top:-10px;margin-bottom:-10px;"/><a name="stormy"></a> </div> <p data-elm-loc="412"><b>7:45 a.m. A check signed by Trump, and another signed by his son</b></p> <p data-elm-loc="413">People familiar with Cohen’s testimony had in recent days touted that he would release evidence connecting Trump to possible criminal conduct while in office. His written testimony makes clear what that evidence is.</p> <p data-elm-loc="414">Cohen will provide a copy of a $35,000 check that he says was personally signed by Trump on Aug. 1, 2017, to reimburse him for paying off Stormy Daniels, an adult-film actress who had alleged having an affair with Trump. Cohen has admitted that — at Trump’s direction — he paid the woman $130,000 in the waning days of the campaign so she would keep quiet about the affair, a payment that violated campaign finance laws.</p> <p data-elm-loc="415">According to his written testimony, Cohen will effectively use the check to allege that the criminal wrongdoing in which he has implicated the president continued even after Trump took office.</p> <p data-elm-loc="416">“I am providing a copy of a $35,000 check that President Trump personally signed from his personal bank account on August 1, 2017 — when he was President of the United States — pursuant to the coverup, which was the basis of my guilty plea, to reimburse me — the word used by Mr. Trump’s TV lawyer — for the illegal hush money I paid on his behalf. This $35,000 check was one of 11 check installments that was paid throughout the year — while he was President,” Cohen will say, according to his written remarks.</p> <p data-elm-loc="417">Cohen will also display a second $35,000 check, dated March 17, 2017, this one signed by Donald Trump Jr. and Trump organization chief operating officer Allen Weisselberg, a person familiar with his testimony said. The check offers the first evidence that the president’s son may also have been involved with the reimbursement scheme.</p> <p data-elm-loc="418">Rudolph W. Giuliani, Trump’s lawyer, has previously acknowledged Trump reimbursed Cohen for the payments, though he has disputed the president violated campaign finance laws. He has also said, though, that he did not know when the president learned the nature of the payment to Daniels and that he only learned the full details after law enforcement raided Cohen’s home in April.</p> <p data-elm-loc="419">While it already had been clear that Cohen was implicating Trump in the campaign finance violations to which he pleaded guilty, his assertion that Trump was involved in a “coverup” while president — backed by a check with Trump’s writing on it — will be notable. Cohen will also allege that in February 2017, one month into his presidency, Trump assured him in the Oval Office that the reimbursement checks were on their way.</p> <p data-elm-loc="420" class="interstitial-link "><i>[<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/trumps-longtime-lawyer-michael-cohen-is-in-plea-discussions-with-federal-prosecutors-according-to-a-person-familiar-with-the-matter/2018/08/21/5fbd7f34-8510-11e8-8553-a3ce89036c78_story.html?utm_term=.4946bd77e8c1">The details of what Michael Cohen has admitted previously about the hush money payments</a>]</i></p> <div data-elm-loc="421" class="inline-content inline-html"> <hr style="margin-top:-10px;margin-bottom:-10px;"/> </div> <p data-elm-loc="422"><b>7:30 a.m.: ‘He is a racist, he is a con man, he is a cheat’</b></p> <p data-elm-loc="423">One of the notable aspects of Cohen’s testimony is the extent to which he will air what he says are the president’s personal and moral failings.

Davis, an attorney for Cohen, said of Gaetz’s comment: “We will not respond to Mr. Gaetz’s despicable lies and personal smears, except to say we trust that his colleagues in the House, both Republicans and Democrats, will repudiate his words and his conduct. I also trust that his constituents will not appreciate that their congressman has set a new low — which in today’s political culture is hard to imagine as possible.”</p> <p data-elm-loc="434">Earlier in the day, White House press secretary Sarah Sanders had said in a statement, “Disgraced felon Michael Cohen is going to prison for lying to Congress and making other false statements. Sadly, he will go before Congress this week and we can expect more of the same. It’s laughable that anyone would take a convicted liar like Cohen at his word, and pathetic to see him given yet another opportunity to spread his lies.”</p> <div data-elm-loc="435" class="inline-content inline-html"> <hr style="margin-top:-10px;margin-bottom:-10px;"/> </div> <p data-elm-loc="436"><b>7 a.m.: What will Cohen say about the contentious BuzzFeed story? </b></p> <p data-elm-loc="437">Last month, BuzzFeed News leveled the explosive allegation that Cohen had claimed the president directed him to lie to Congress about a possible Trump Tower project in Moscow, and that he had told the special counsel as much. The special counsel’s office soon disputed that report. But Cohen had never addressed it publicly — until now.</p> <p data-elm-loc="438">According to his written testimony, Cohen will tell lawmakers, “Mr. Trump did not directly tell me to lie to Congress. That’s not how he operates.” That would seem to refute BuzzFeed’s report, which alleged “the president personally instructed him to lie — by claiming that negotiations ended months earlier than they actually did — to obscure Trump’s involvement.”</p> <p data-elm-loc="439">The testimony is not totally surprising. If Cohen said BuzzFeed was right, that would raise significant questions about the credibility of the special counsel’s office, which issued a rare public statement taking aim at the news outlet’s reporting.</p> <p data-elm-loc="440">Cohen will offer, according to his written testimony, that he felt Trump was sending him an implicit message he should lie — though he seemed to intuit that message from interactions he had with Trump many months before he testified, while Trump was still a candidate and the Trump Tower Moscow project was still being pursued.</p> <p data-elm-loc="441">“To be clear: Mr. Trump knew of and directed the Trump Moscow negotiations throughout the campaign and lied about it. He lied about it because he never expected to win the election. He also lied about it because he stood to make hundreds of millions of dollars on the Moscow real estate project. And so I lied about it, too — because Mr. Trump had made clear to me, through his personal statements to me that we both knew were false and through his lies to the country, that he wanted me to lie. And he made it clear to me because his personal attorneys reviewed my statement before I gave it to Congress.”</p> <p data-elm-loc="442">That should be little solace to BuzzFeed, as it was all mostly public at the time it published its story. In court documents, Cohen’s lawyers had said previously his lies “sprung regrettably from Michael’s effort, as a loyal ally and then-champion” of Trump. They also noted when he prepared his testimony, he was “in close and regular contact with White House-based staff and legal counsel” to Trump.</p> <div data-elm-loc="443" class="inline-content inline-html"> <hr style="margin-top:-10px;margin-bottom:-10px;"/> </div> <p data-elm-loc="444"><b>6:45 a.m.: Cohen will present Trump financial records</b></p> <p data-elm-loc="445">Cohen is expected to present to lawmakers some Trump financial records — including three years of financial statements, from 2011-2013, which he gave to Deutsche Bank, according to his written testimony. He will allege that Trump “inflated his total assets when it served his purposes, such as trying to be listed among the wealthiest people in Forbes, and deflated his assets to reduce his real estate taxes.”</p> <p data-elm-loc="446">That testimony could be particularly grating for the president, who has bristled in particular at the notion that his and his family’s finances might be subjected to congressional or law enforcement scrutiny.</p> <p data-elm-loc="447" class="trailer "> David A.
