There would be nothing to stop a constitutional convention, once it convened, from taking up issues far beyond its original mandate, and tiny states like Vermont or Wyoming would be on equal footing with megastates like California and Texas. This is why Antonin Scalia, among others, was against the idea.</p> <p>Walker countered that 38 states – three-quarters of the country – would need to ratify any changes that a convention made to the Constitution.</p> <p><strong>-- Loren Enns, the president of the group Walker is joining, was a successful network engineer for Cisco Systems and a computer engineer for Microsoft who grew alarmed about the debt over the years. In 2015, he decided to focus full-time on the nonprofit. </strong>Enns, 46 of Clearwater, Fla., has recruited <a href="http://csnds.org/leadership/">a board of directors</a> that includes conservatives like former governor Mike Huckabee, as well as former senators Judd Gregg, George Allen and Norm Coleman.

He will turn 65 the day before that election.</p> <p>There is even a precedent. “You look way back,” Walker told me. “Ronald Reagan talked a lot about this issue between being governor of California and president.”</p> <table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="center"> <tbody> <tr style="border-bottom:none !important;"> <td align="center" valign="top" style="padding-top: 15px; padding-bottom: 5px;"><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/podcasts/daily-202-big-idea/" target="_blank"><img src="https://palomaimages.washingtonpost.com/pr2/45e2573b53836c50b5226cd57f0ad6ff-1400-519-70-8-Daily202_Image.jpg" width="700" alt="The Daily 202's BIG IDEA> Get James' insight into Washington every weekday on your smart speaker or favorite podcast player." border="0" style="border-width:0; width:100%; max-width:700px; height:auto; display:block;"></a></td> </tr> <tr style="border-bottom:none !important;"> <td align="center" valign="top"> <table width="90%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="center"> <tbody> <tr style="border-bottom:none !important;"> <td style="padding-top: 5px; padding-bottom: 15px; font-family: FranklinITCProLight, FranklinITCStdLight, 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, 'Lucida Grande', sans-serif; font-size: 16px; color: #000000; text-align: center;">Subscribe on <strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/The-Daily-202s-Big-Idea/dp/B01JHJHSTA/" target="_blank" style="text-decoration: underline; color: #1955a5;">Amazon Echo</a></strong>, <strong><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/podcasts/daily-202-big-idea/?tid=pod_202news_google" target="_blank" style="text-decoration: underline; color: #1955a5;">Google Home</a></strong>, <strong><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/podcasts/daily-202-big-idea/?tid=pod_202news_homepod" target="_blank" style="text-decoration: underline; color: #1955a5;">Apple HomePod</a></strong> and other podcast players.</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <table width="100%"> <tbody> <tr> <td>&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr> <td> <table cellpadding="20" width="100%" style="background-color:#E1E1E1;border-collapse: collapse; mso-table-lspace: 0pt; mso-table-rspace: 0pt;margin-top: 1em"> <tbody> <tr> <td style="background-color:#E1E1E1;font-family:sans-serif" bgcolor="#E1E1E1">Welcome to the Daily 202, <b>PowerPost's</b> morning briefing for decision-makers.<br><a href="https://subscribe.washingtonpost.com/newsletters/?location=ENL&amp;method=SURL#/bundle/daily202" style="color: #005b88; text-decoration: none; word-wrap: break-word; border-bottom-color: #d4d4d4; border-bottom-style: solid; border-bottom-width: 1px;">Sign up to receive the newsletter.</a></td> </tr> </tbody> </table></td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <p><strong>WHILE YOU WERE SLEEPING:</strong></p> <p><strong>-- Bob Mueller obtained court-approved warrants to search the emails of Trump’s lawyer Michael Cohen in July 2017, according to <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/context/read-the-documents-michael-cohen-search-warrants/?noteId=4412d871-284a-4cca-85a2-7b14fad243c1&amp;questionId=a057673c-250f-47fb-96c4-c0f8fc4cb1f0&amp;utm_term=.032a673295e3">search warrants unsealed this morning</a>. </strong><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/mueller-began-investigating-michael-cohens-phone-and-digital-data-months-before-fbi-raid-warrants-show/2019/03/19/9e936cc2-49b5-11e9-b79a-961983b7e0cd_story.html?utm_term=.8b2d657afbcc">Devlin Barrett, Matt Zapotosky and Rosalind Helderman report</a>: “[They] offer new insight into how Mueller and his team handed off a key part of the Cohen investigation to federal prosecutors in New York in early 2018, and how much evidence prosecutors already had against Cohen even before they searched his office, home, and hotel room in April of that year.”</p> <div class="inline-content inline-photo inline-photo-center horizontal-photo modal-3"> <img data-no-process="data-no-process" src="https://img.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.washingtonpost.com%2Fresizer%2FXa11ECwYGrhts9IM0r7JvvrPNjE%3D%2F918x0%2Farc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2FK4B6SZHK35GC5E22HD7JDPRWXM.png&amp;w=908" class="zoom-in"> <p class="pb-caption">White House growth projections from Page 529 of the 2019 Economic Report of the President.

Now the university wants to put humans at its center,</strong></a><strong>” by Elizabeth Dwoskin: </strong>“On Monday, the university will launch the Stanford Institute for Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence (HAI), a sprawling think tank that aims to become an interdisciplinary hub for policymakers, researchers and students who will go on to build the technologies of the future. They hope they can inculcate in that next generation a more worldly and humane set of values than those that have characterized it so far — and guide politicians to make more sophisticated decisions about the challenging social questions wrought by technology. … The institute — backed by the field’s biggest leaders and industry players — is not the first such academic effort of its kind, but it is by far the most ambitious: It aims to raise more than $1 billion. And its advisory council is a who’s who of Silicon Valley titans, including former Google executive chairman Eric Schmidt, LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman, former Yahoo chief executive Marissa Mayer and co-founder Jerry Yang, and the prominent investor Jim Breyer.

In popular memory, it’s a vestige of a racist ideology that the Greatest Generation did its best to scour from the Earth. History, though, tells a different story. King’s recent question, posed in a New York Times interview, may be appalling: 'White nationalist, white supremacist, Western civilization—how did that language become offensive?'&nbsp;But it is apt. 'That language' has an American past in need of excavation. Without such an effort, we may fail to appreciate the tenacity of the dogma it expresses, and the difficulty of eradicating it.
