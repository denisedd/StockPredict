THAT.\r\nWOMEN WERE UNDERREPRESENTED IN\r\n\r\nJAPAN.\r\nIN THE U.S., THE PROBLEM IS THE\r\n\r\nREVERSE.\r\nARE THERE THINGS WE CAN DO TO\r\n\r\nBRING THE MEN BACK IN?\r\nCATHERINE: THAT IS PARTLY A\r\n\r\nBUSINESS PROPOSITION.\r\nGOING OUT AND HIRING LABOR AND\r\n\r\nDOING SOME TRAINING.\r\nPEOPLE HAVE BEEN OUT OF THE\r\n\r\nLABOR FORCE.\r\nTHERE'S ALSO CHANGES IN THE\r\n\r\nHANDLING OF PREVIOUS ISSUES THAT\r\nSOME PEOPLE HAVE WITH REGARD TO\r\n\r\nINCARCERATION OR DRUG\r\nDEPENDENCY.\r\n\r\nTHESE ARE ISSUES AT THE BUSINESS\r\nSIDE OF THINGS.\r\n\r\nFOR GOVERNMENT POLICIES, THERE\r\nIS A ROLE FOR THEM TO PLAY WITH\r\n\r\nREGARD TO SUBSIDIES FOR\r\nEDUCATION OR BRINGING PEOPLE\r\n\r\nBACK FOR TRAINING FOR THE TYPES\r\nOF JOBS BEING OPENED UP.\r\n\r\nIT'S A COMBINATION OF
