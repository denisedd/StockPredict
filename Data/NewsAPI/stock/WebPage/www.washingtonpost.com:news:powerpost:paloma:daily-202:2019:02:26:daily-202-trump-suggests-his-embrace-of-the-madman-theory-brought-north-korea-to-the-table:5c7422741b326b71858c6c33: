He has repeatedly sought to use his reputation for rashness and unpredictability to his advantage, sometimes successfully.</p> <p><strong>Trump is not wrong that his threats have packed more of a punch because foreign leaders think he might go through with them.</strong> For example, no one would have believed Barack Obama or George W. Bush if either of them threatened to scuttle NATO or NAFTA to prod allies to spend more on defense or improve the terms of existing trade deals. People also wouldn’t have believed past presidents if they had tweeted they were going to impose stiff tariffs on <em>all</em> Chinese imports.</p> <p>Yet <strong>many serious people really thought a year ago that there was some possibility Trump might actually go through with a preemptive strike on Pyongyang</strong> after all his charged rhetoric, despite American military commanders warning that such a move could lead to tens of thousands being killed. In other words, Trump’s intimidations have seemed more credible because he’s gladly encouraged the global perception that he’s quarrelsome.</p> <p><strong>The president has preached the virtue of strategic unpredictability as a lever to gain the upper hand in negotiations.</strong> “We must as a nation be more unpredictable,” Trump said as a candidate in 2016. “We have to be unpredictable!”</p> <div class="inline-content inline-photo inline-photo-center horizontal-photo modal-3"> <img data-no-process="data-no-process" src="https://img.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https%3A%2F%2Farc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2F2GRBEIVN3EI6PG4TXFYEHZL2EI.jpg&amp;w=908" class="zoom-in"> <p class="pb-caption">President Trump confers with Henry Kissinger in the Oval Office in October 2017.

The goal was to bring an end to the quagmire at the negotiating table.</strong></p> <p>“I call it the madman theory,” Nixon explained to H.R. Haldeman, who would serve as his White House chief of staff, while they walked along a foggy beach one day in 1968, according to <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0812907248?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=washpost-20&amp;camp=1789&amp;linkCode=xm2&amp;creativeASIN=0812907248">Haldeman’s memoir</a>. “I want the North Vietnamese to believe I’ve reached the point where I might do anything to stop the war. We’ll just slip the word to them that, ‘For God’s sake, you know Nixon is obsessed about communism. We can’t restrain him when he’s angry — and he has his hand on the nuclear button!’ And Ho Chi Minh himself will be in Paris in two days begging for peace.”</p> <p><strong>-- Nixon certainly didn’t invent the concept; he just coined the term. </strong>Niccolò Machiavelli <a href="https://www.constitution.org/mac/disclivy3.htm">wrote </a>back in 1517 that “at times it is a very wise thing to simulate madness.”</p> <p><strong>-- Trump has long admired Nixon, and <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/paloma/daily-202/2016/12/20/daily-202-donald-trump-embraces-the-risky-madman-theory-on-foreign-policy/58583391e9b69b36fcfeaf47/">he signaled even before taking office</a> that he’d embrace the madman theory. </strong>Henry Kissinger, the nonagenarian who was tasked back in the day with “slipping the word” that Nixon might just be wacky enough to use The Bomb, has tutored Trump on foreign policy and <a href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/961671974153080834">repeatedly </a>given him advice before big meetings with heads of state, <a href="https://thediplomat.com/2018/11/ahead-of-xi-trump-g20-meeting-xi-meets-foreign-policy-guru-kissinger/">including</a> Kim and Chinese leader Xi Jinping.</p> <p>During an April 1971 conversation, which was recorded and has <a href="https://history.state.gov/historicaldocuments/frus1969-76v07/d190">now been transcribed</a>, Nixon told Kissinger that he should try to break an impasse in peace talks by hinting to Hanoi that the use of nuclear weapons was back on the table.</p> <p>“You can say, ‘I cannot control him.’ Put it that way,” Nixon told his secretary of state.</p> <p>“Yeah,” Kissinger replied. “And imply that you might use nuclear weapons.”</p> <p>“Yes, sir,” said Nixon, adding that Kissinger should say: “I just want you to know he is not going to cave.”</p> <div class="inline-content inline-video"> <div class="posttv-video-embed powa" data-org="wapo" data-uuid="c55d33b1-695e-46b5-b2fe-ac82066161ad" data-ad-bar="1" data-playthrough="1" data-blurb="1" data-object-id="5c61dca0e4b0b13431418df3" data-youtube-id="" data-live="0" data-aspect-ratio="0.5625"> <script src="https://d1pz6dax0t5mop.cloudfront.net/prod/PoWaLoaderWapo.js?_=20181113" async></script> </div> </div> <p><strong>-- Game theory experts teach that acting irrationally can sometimes be very rational. </strong>Trump plainly believes he’s a good bluffer, even when his bluffs get called again and again. The fact that he doesn’t always fold right away, even when he has a losing hand, has strengthened his capacity to keep others on their toes.</p> <p>Consider the partial government shutdown, which became the longest in American history. Even though he ultimately caved, and declared a national emergency to try getting the money Congress would not appropriate for a wall, Trump showed he was willing to drag out the fight. He kept it going even as his polling numbers took a hit.</p> <p>The same is true on the world stage. He’s kept the door open to military intervention in Venezuela, even as he orders a drawdown of troops in Syria and Afghanistan. He’s also saber-rattled against Iran since pulling out of the nuclear deal. And he said during his State of the Union this month that he would be willing to spend whatever is necessary to win an arms race with the Russians. All these moves are risky and might backfire over the long term, but Trump appears to believe he is setting the terms of the debate.</p> <p><strong>-- Ever the showman, Trump recognizes the power of fear.</strong> Indeed, Bob Woodward’s entire book last year (“<a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1501175513?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=washpost-20&amp;camp=1789&amp;linkCode=xm2&amp;creativeASIN=1501175513">Fear</a>”) was based on this premise.</p> <p><strong>-- Trump has even advised his own aides to tell people on the outside that he is “crazy” if they think it will help in negotiations. </strong>During an Oval Office meeting in September 2017, Trump told chief trade negotiator Bob Lighthizer that he should threaten to have the U.S. withdraw from its free trade agreement with South Korea. <a href="https://www.axios.com/scoop-trump-urges-staff-to-portray-him-as-crazy-guy-1513305888-c1cbdb89-6370-4e13-98ed-28c414e62a35.html">Axios reported</a> this exchange at the time:</p> <p>“You've got 30 days, and if you don't get concessions, then I'm pulling out,” Trump told Lighthizer.</p> <p>“Okay,&nbsp;well I'll tell the Koreans they've got 30 days," Lighthizer replied.</p> <p>“No, no, no," Trump interjected. "That's not how you negotiate. You don't tell them they've got 30 days. You tell them, 'This guy's so crazy he could pull out any minute!’”</p> <p>“That's what you tell them: <em>Any minute</em>,” Trump continued.</p> <p><strong>During an Oval Office meeting this past Friday focused on defusing the trade war that he started, Trump once again <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/trump-delays-increase-in-tariffs-on-china-citing-progress-in-trade-talks/2019/02/24/273198aa-388c-11e9-a2cd-307b06d0257b_story.html?utm_term=.55b3a8dbf2a6">admonished</a> Lighthizer – this time in front of a Chinese delegation. </strong>The veteran lawyer was rebuked by Trump for saying the two sides were working on a “memorandum of understanding.” Trump said the term, routinely used in situations like this, does not “mean very much.” The president also did this in front of reporters. For close Trump observers, it felt like he was saying this as much to unnerve his foreign visitors and keep them on their toes as because he was going to kill the deal. But with Trump you never know. And that’s just the way he wants it.</p> <p><strong>-- The irony, of course, is that the madman theory did not ultimately work for Nixon. Vietnam remains one of the most humiliating chapters in America’s history.</strong> New York University historian Tim Naftali, the former director of the Nixon presidential library, says North Vietnam more likely came to the table for other reasons. He also argues that Nixon played the part of a madman to give himself domestic cover with his base to open relations with China and pursue detente with the Kremlin.</p> <p>“Nixon’s madman strategy wasn’t supposed to take three and a half years, over 21,000 U.S. deaths, and untold Vietnamese losses, to work. It was supposed to be a version of 'shock and awe,’” Naftali wrote for <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2017/10/madman-theory-trump-north-korea/542055/">the Atlantic</a> in 2017. “There can be little debate, however, over what Nixon’s calculated unpredictability abroad achieved at home. It tore this country apart. In a declassified ‘eyes only’ memorandum to Alexander Haig on May 20, 1972, after ordering the mining of Haiphong harbor, Nixon explained who his domestic audience was: ‘The hawks are our hard core and we must do everything that we can to keep them from jumping ship [in reaction to arms-control talks with Moscow] after getting their enthusiasm restored as a result of our mining operation in the North.’”&nbsp;</p> <div class="inline-content inline-video"> <div class="posttv-video-embed powa" data-org="wapo" data-uuid="c6caaaa2-be74-4d91-ba08-081ddd7d56a1" data-ad-bar="1" data-playthrough="1" data-blurb="1" data-object-id="5c74130bcff47e000b8f3bfc" data-youtube-id="" data-live="0" data-aspect-ratio="0.5625"> <script src="https://d1pz6dax0t5mop.cloudfront.net/prod/PoWaLoaderWapo.js?_=20181113" async></script> </div> </div> <table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="center"> <tbody> <tr style="border-bottom:none !important;"> <td align="center" valign="top" style="padding-top: 15px; padding-bottom: 5px;"><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/podcasts/daily-202-big-idea/" target="_blank"><img src="https://palomaimages.washingtonpost.com/pr2/45e2573b53836c50b5226cd57f0ad6ff-1400-519-70-8-Daily202_Image.jpg" width="700" alt="The Daily 202's BIG IDEA> Get James' insight into Washington every weekday on your smart speaker or favorite podcast player." border="0" style="border-width:0; width:100%; max-width:700px; height:auto; display:block;"></a></td> </tr> <tr style="border-bottom:none !important;"> <td align="center" valign="top"> <table width="90%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="center"> <tbody> <tr style="border-bottom:none !important;"> <td style="padding-top: 5px; padding-bottom: 15px; font-family: FranklinITCProLight, FranklinITCStdLight, 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, 'Lucida Grande', sans-serif; font-size: 16px; color: #000000; text-align: center;">Subscribe on <strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/The-Daily-202s-Big-Idea/dp/B01JHJHSTA/" target="_blank" style="text-decoration: underline; color: #1955a5;">Amazon Echo</a></strong>, <strong><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/podcasts/daily-202-big-idea/?tid=pod_202news_google" target="_blank" style="text-decoration: underline; color: #1955a5;">Google Home</a></strong>, <strong><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/podcasts/daily-202-big-idea/?tid=pod_202news_homepod" target="_blank" style="text-decoration: underline; color: #1955a5;">Apple HomePod</a></strong> and other podcast players.</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <table width="100%"> <tbody> <tr> <td>&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr> <td> <table cellpadding="20" width="100%" style="background-color:#E1E1E1;border-collapse: collapse; mso-table-lspace: 0pt; mso-table-rspace: 0pt;margin-top: 1em"> <tbody> <tr> <td style="background-color:#E1E1E1;font-family:sans-serif" bgcolor="#E1E1E1">Welcome to the Daily 202, <b>PowerPost's</b> morning briefing for decision-makers.<br><a href="https://subscribe.washingtonpost.com/newsletters/?location=ENL&amp;method=SURL#/bundle/daily202" style="color: #005b88; text-decoration: none; word-wrap: break-word; border-bottom-color: #d4d4d4; border-bottom-style: solid; border-bottom-width: 1px;">Sign up to receive the newsletter.</a></td> </tr> </tbody> </table></td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <p><strong>WHILE YOU WERE SLEEPING:</strong></p> <div class="inline-content inline-video"> <div class="posttv-video-embed powa" data-org="wapo" data-uuid="bec73923-6238-4bbf-870c-e562de26b2e0" data-ad-bar="1" data-playthrough="1" data-blurb="1" data-object-id="5c753eb6d60180000b9a739e" data-youtube-id="" data-live="0" data-aspect-ratio="0.5625"> <script src="https://d1pz6dax0t5mop.cloudfront.net/prod/PoWaLoaderWapo.js?_=20181113" async></script> </div> </div> <p><strong>-- British Prime Minister Theresa May for the first time admitted that Brexit may be delayed, as a bitterly divided Parliament struggles over how — or even if — Britain should leave the European Union.</strong> <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/europe/theresa-may-acknowledges-the-possibility-that-brexit-may-not-happen-next-month/2019/02/26/ea6c970c-391d-11e9-b10b-f05a22e75865_story.html?utm_term=.7c365551faca">William Booth and Karla Adam report from London</a>: “May told lawmakers that if Parliament next month rejects her Brexit deal again, the lawmakers will be given a vote on whether to ask the European Union to allow Britain to remain a part of the trading bloc for several more months.

Johnson said she turned her head and the unwanted kiss landed on the side of her mouth. In a statement, White House press secretary Sarah Sanders dismissed Johnson’s allegation as ‘absurd on its face.’&nbsp;‘This never happened and is directly contradicted by multiple highly credible eye witness accounts,’&nbsp;she wrote. Two Trump supporters that Johnson identified as witnesses — a campaign official and Pam Bondi, then the Florida attorney general — denied seeing the alleged kiss in interviews with The Washington Post.</p> <p>“<strong>As recently as May 2017, Johnson spoke glowingly of Trump in a radio interview. ‘</strong>He is more incredible in person than I think you would even think as you see him on TV,’&nbsp;she told the Alabama-based program ‘Politics and Moore.’&nbsp;‘He’s just the nicest guy. …&nbsp;He treats everyone as if they are a part of his family.’&nbsp;She also said she expected to be given a job as the ‘second-in-command’&nbsp;at the U.S. Embassy in Lisbon. ‘I will at some point be heading over to Portugal to work in the embassy,’&nbsp;she said. The Post found the recording of the show after the first version of this story was published.&nbsp;One of Johnson’s lawyers, Hassan Zavareei, said that at the time of the radio interview, she was bound by a nondisclosure agreement and was ‘saying what she thought Trump and his supporters wanted.’&nbsp;…</p> <p><strong>“Johnson said she told her boyfriend, mother and stepfather about the alleged kiss on the day that it occurred, an account all three confirmed to The Post. </strong>Two months later, Johnson consulted a Florida attorney; he gave The Post text messages showing that he considered her ‘credible’ but did not take her case for business reasons. The attorney gave Johnson the name of a therapist, whose notes, which The Post reviewed, reference an unspecified event during the campaign that had left her distraught. … Johnson, an event planner who lives in Madison County, Ala., is seeking unspecified damages for emotional pain and suffering. <strong>The federal lawsuit, filed Monday in Florida, also alleges that the campaign discriminated against Johnson, who is black, by paying her less than her white male counterparts. </strong>A campaign spokeswoman, Kayleigh McEnany, rejected that claim as ‘off-base and unfounded.’”</p> <p><strong>-- “The most legally significant aspect of Johnson’s suit may ultimately be something the complaint does not explicitly address: the pervasive use of nondisclosure agreements by Trump during his campaign and in his Administration,”&nbsp;</strong><a href="https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/a-lawsuit-by-a-campaign-worker-is-the-latest-challenge-to-trumps-nondisclosure-agreements">Ronan Farrow adds in the New Yorker</a>. “Johnson’s suit is at least the sixth legal case in which Trump campaign or Administration employees have defied their nondisclosure agreements.
