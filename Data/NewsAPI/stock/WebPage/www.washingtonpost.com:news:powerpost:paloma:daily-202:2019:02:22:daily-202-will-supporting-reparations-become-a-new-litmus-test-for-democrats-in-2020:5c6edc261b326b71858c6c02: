Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) campaigns in Las Vegas on Sunday.&nbsp;(John Locher/AP)</p> </div> <p><strong>THE BIG IDEA:&nbsp;Barack Obama opposed reparations for the descendants of slavery when he ran for president. </strong>He <a href="https://deathpenalty.procon.org/sourcefiles/NAACPquestionnaire08.pdf">warned</a> the NAACP in 2007 that they would be used as “an excuse for some to say we’ve paid our debt and to avoid the much harder work” of enforcing anti-discrimination laws, improving public education, rehabilitating young men coming out of prisons and lifting people out of poverty.</p> <p><strong>In 2016, <a href="https://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/jan/26/bernie-s/reparations-for-slavery-sanders-obama-clinton/">neither</a> Hillary Clinton nor Bernie Sanders supported reparations for the black community as a redress for slavery. </strong>Even as he promised a revolution of democratic socialism that would include tuition-free college and Medicare-for-all, Sanders said paying reparations to African Americans was a bridge too far. “First of all, its likelihood of getting through Congress is nil,” he <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUFrErawm4c">said</a>. “Second of all, I think it would be very divisive.”</p> <p><strong>But this is not your father’s Democratic Party, and it’s not 2016 anymore. </strong></p> <p><strong>Four declared Democratic presidential candidates have signaled support for some form of reparations to specifically benefit African Americans: Elizabeth Warren, Kamala Harris, Julián Castro and Marianne Williamson. </strong>This puts more pressure on the rest of the crowded field to endorse race-conscious policies and could provide fresh fodder for President Trump to portray his 2020 challengers as outside the mainstream.</p> <p><strong>In the modern political sense, the term “reparations” is a little like “socialism.” It means very different things to different people, and the devil is in the details.</strong> Many think of direct cash payments to African Americans when they hear the word. Others think more broadly of investments that are specifically made by the government to lift communities of color. What one person calls reparations someone else might just describe as strengthening the social safety net. The fact that candidates are willing to use the term at all after generations of Democratic standard-bearers have seemed allergic to it reflects a sea change.</p> <p><strong>Like other issues where the Democratic Party is lurching leftward lately, such as the widespread embrace of the Green New Deal, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) is once again driving the pace car. </strong>She <a href="https://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/426353-ocasio-cortez-the-world-will-end-in-12-years-if-we-dont-address">expressed</a> <a href="https://dailycaller.com/2019/01/22/ocasio-cortez-reparations-germany/">support </a>for exploring the idea of reparations last month, using the pulpit that has come with her celebrity to move the issue to the front burner. “People think reparations is reparations for slavery, but really, economically speaking, reparations are for the damage done by the New Deal and redlining because that is where we saw a compounding of the existing inequity from the legacy of slavery, where we drew red lines around black communities,” Ocasio-Cortez said.</p> <p>&nbsp;<strong>-- Warren (D-Mass.) on Thursday became the latest candidate to jump on the reparations bandwagon. </strong>“We must confront the dark history of slavery and government-sanctioned discrimination in this country that has had many consequences, including undermining the ability of black families to build wealth in America for generations,” the senator said in a statement to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/21/us/politics/2020-democrats-race-policy.html">the New York Times</a>. “We need systemic, structural changes to address that.”</p> <p><strong>-- Castro expressed openness to reparations in an interview with <a href="https://www.theroot.com/in-an-interview-with-the-root-julian-castro-calls-for-1832730905">the Root</a>, a publication that caters to an African American audience, that also published yesterday. </strong>“I have long thought that this country would be better off if we did find a way to do that,” said the former secretary of housing and urban development. “I don’t find the notion challenging. What I do find challenging is the best way to do that.”</p> <div class="inline-content inline-photo inline-photo-center horizontal-photo"> <iframe width="480" height="270" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Kh_wQUjeaTk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe> </div> <p><strong>-- Harris (D-Calif.) said “yes” last week when asked explicitly whether she supports “some form of reparations for black people.” </strong>“Well, look, I think that we have got to address that,” the senator said during an appearance on “The Breakfast Club,” a radio show popular with African Americans. “Again, it goes back to the inequities. … We have got to recognize that and give people a lift up. And there are a number of ways to do it.”</p> <p>Harris <a href="https://twitter.com/saletan/status/1098782581011697669">mentioned </a>a bill she’s introduced called the LIFT Act to help people making less than $100,000 a year. “What I want to do about rent is the same thing,” she added. “What we need to do around education and understanding disparities. What we need to do around [historically black colleges and universities]. But we have a history of racism in America.”</p> <p><strong>-- The Democrat who has been most specific is Williamson, a spiritual guru who is waging a spirited long-shot campaign for the nomination that’s been capturing more attention recently. </strong>“Williamson traces many of our nation’s psychic wounds to slavery, for which she believes we need to make reparations in the form of a $100 billion, 10-year investment disseminated by a panel of black leaders across fields,” Anna Peele writes in <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/magazine/wp/2019/02/19/feature/self-help-author-marianne-williamson-wants-to-be-your-healer-in-chief/?utm_term=.58fdb531bd51">a profile that will run in our magazine this Sunday</a>.</p> <p>“When I wonder, sitting at a table in a Los Angeles neighborhood where the average home sells for $1.66 million, how she will enact her plan for reparations without seeming like a well-meaning white lady, Williamson crosses her arms and starts clomping the heel of her left foot like a dressage horse,” Peele reports. “‘I am a well-meaning white lady,’ she says, utterly exasperated. ‘Why should I apologize for being a well-meaning white lady? What is going on in this world today? I shouldn’t apologize for being white any more than you should apologize for being black.’ (I am not black, just another well-meaning white lady.) ‘I’ve been leading ritualized apologies — prayers of apology — from whites to blacks for over 20 years. I wrote a book [‘Healing the Soul of America’] on this topic. This is not something that I just came new to. I was talking about this long before it was trending.’”</p> <div class="inline-content inline-photo inline-photo-center horizontal-photo modal-3"> <img data-no-process="data-no-process" src="https://img.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https%3A%2F%2Farc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2FGWCJK3BNO4I6TB4BOY3BT4JMWQ.jpg&amp;w=908" class="zoom-in"> <p class="pb-caption">Elizabeth Warren talks with a voter in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, on Feb. 10.

She also announced a sweeping universal child-care proposal that could strongly benefit minority communities that often have limited early childhood services.”</p> <p>As people noted how relatively vague the quotes were from Harris and Warren, Herndon <a href="https://twitter.com/AsteadWesley/status/1098670862440587264">tweeted </a>that he “made it clear to campaigns that ‘policies that help black people’ did not count as reparations, but would have to be intentionally race-specific and meant to address past harms – not lift all boats.” He added that the Harris campaign did nothing to walk back her comments on “The Breakfast Club.”</p> <p>“We have to be honest that people in this country do not start from the same place or have access to the same opportunities,” Harris said in a statement. “I’m serious about taking an approach that would change policies and structures and make real investments in black communities.”</p> <div class="inline-content inline-photo inline-photo-center horizontal-photo modal-3"> <a href="http://files.kff.org/attachment/report-survey-of-americans-on-race"><img data-no-process="data-no-process" src="https://img.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https%3A%2F%2Fpalomaimages.washingtonpost.com%2Fprod%2Fkaiserreparationsfeb22_tstmp_1550847104.jpg&amp;w=908" class="zoom-in"></a> </div> <p><strong>-- Overwhelming majorities of Americans have consistently been opposed to the concept of reparations.</strong> Polling analyst Emily Guskin notes that the most recent survey she could find, <a href="http://maristpoll.marist.edu/510-reparations-for-slavery-in-the-united-states/#sthash.htOYtKFe.dpbs">a Point Taken-Marist poll from 2016</a>, found that 68 percent said the U.S. government should not pay the descendants of slaves and that 72 percent said the U.S. should not pay African Americans in general. <strong>Racial differences were significant</strong>: 81 percent of whites opposed giving any monetary compensation to descendants of slaves, compared with 35 percent of African Americans and 47 percent of Latinos. <a href="http://files.kff.org/attachment/report-survey-of-americans-on-race">A Kaiser-CNN poll from 2015</a> found 77 percent said the U.S. should not pay descendants of slaves, also with large differences by race.</p> <p><strong>Even when the questions were worded slightly differently, the findings have been relatively similar and stayed somewhat consistent over the past few decades. </strong>A 2002 survey by Gallup, CNN and USA Today found 81 percent said the government should not make cash payments to black Americans who are descendants of slaves.

(Jeff Chiu/AP)</p> </div> <p><strong>-- Based on the polls and the mood of the country, it seems like a safe bet that any Democrat who endorses the concept of reparations right now – however generically – will face immense political pressure to walk back their comments – at least somewhat – in the context of a general election.</strong></p> <p><strong>-- During an interview in his final year as president, Obama expounded at length on why endorsing reparations is bad politics.&nbsp;</strong>“It is easy to make that theoretical argument,” Obama told Ta-Nehisi Coates, an outspoken advocate for reparations, during an interview that appeared in the Atlantic. “But as a practical matter, it is hard to think of any society in human history in which a majority population has said that as a consequence of historic wrongs, we are now going to take a big chunk of the nation’s resources over a long period of time to make that right.</p> <p><strong>“You can look at examples like postwar Germany, where reparations were paid to Holocaust victims and families, but they lost the war,” Obama added.</strong>&nbsp;“Small population, finite amount of money that it was going to cost. Not multiple generations but people, in some cases, who are still alive, who can point to, ‘That was my house. Those were my paintings. Those were my mother’s family jewels.’ If you look at countries like South Africa, where you had a black majority, there have been efforts to tax and help that black majority, but it hasn’t come in the form of a formal reparations program. You have countries like India that have tried to help untouchables, with essentially affirmative-action programs, but it hasn’t fundamentally changed the structure of their societies. So the bottom line is that it’s hard to find a model in which you can practically administer and sustain political support for those kinds of efforts.</p> <p><strong>“And what makes America complicated as well is the degree to which this is not just a black/white society, and it is becoming less so every year,” the then-president continued.&nbsp;</strong>“So how do Latinos feel if there’s a big investment just in the African American community, and they’re looking around and saying, ‘We’re poor as well. What kind of help are we getting?’ Or Asian Americans who say, ‘Look, I’m a first-generation immigrant, and clearly I didn’t have anything to do with what was taking place.’ And now you start getting into trying to calibrate. …</p> <p><strong>“I’m not so optimistic as to think that you would ever be able to garner a majority of an American Congress that would make those kinds of investments above and beyond the kinds of investments that could be made in a progressive program for lifting up all people,” he concluded.&nbsp;</strong>“So to restate it: I have much more confidence in my ability, or any president or any leader’s ability, to mobilize the American people around a multiyear, multibillion-dollar investment to help every child in poverty in this country than I am in being able to mobilize the country around providing a benefit specific to African Americans as a consequence of slavery and Jim Crow. Now, we can debate the justness of that. But I feel pretty confident in that assessment politically.”</p> <table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="center"> <tbody> <tr style="border-bottom:none !important;"> <td align="center" valign="top" style="padding-top: 15px; padding-bottom: 5px;"><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/podcasts/daily-202-big-idea/" target="_blank"><img src="https://palomaimages.washingtonpost.com/pr2/45e2573b53836c50b5226cd57f0ad6ff-1400-519-70-8-Daily202_Image.jpg" width="700" alt="The Daily 202's BIG IDEA> Get James' insight into Washington every weekday on your smart speaker or favorite podcast player." border="0" style="border-width:0; width:100%; max-width:700px; height:auto; display:block;"></a></td> </tr> <tr style="border-bottom:none !important;"> <td align="center" valign="top"> <table width="90%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="center"> <tbody> <tr style="border-bottom:none !important;"> <td style="padding-top: 5px; padding-bottom: 15px; font-family: FranklinITCProLight, FranklinITCStdLight, 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, 'Lucida Grande', sans-serif; font-size: 16px; color: #000000; text-align: center;">Subscribe on <strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/The-Daily-202s-Big-Idea/dp/B01JHJHSTA/" target="_blank" style="text-decoration: underline; color: #1955a5;">Amazon Echo</a></strong>, <strong><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/podcasts/daily-202-big-idea/?tid=pod_202news_google" target="_blank" style="text-decoration: underline; color: #1955a5;">Google Home</a></strong>, <strong><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/podcasts/daily-202-big-idea/?tid=pod_202news_homepod" target="_blank" style="text-decoration: underline; color: #1955a5;">Apple HomePod</a></strong> and other podcast players.</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <table width="100%"> <tbody> <tr> <td>&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr> <td> <table cellpadding="20" width="100%" style="background-color:#E1E1E1;border-collapse: collapse; mso-table-lspace: 0pt; mso-table-rspace: 0pt;margin-top: 1em"> <tbody> <tr> <td style="background-color:#E1E1E1;font-family:sans-serif" bgcolor="#E1E1E1">Welcome to the Daily 202, <b>PowerPost's</b> morning briefing for decision-makers.<br><a href="https://subscribe.washingtonpost.com/newsletters/?location=ENL&amp;method=SURL#/bundle/daily202" style="color: #005b88; text-decoration: none; word-wrap: break-word; border-bottom-color: #d4d4d4; border-bottom-style: solid; border-bottom-width: 1px;">Sign up to receive the newsletter.</a></td> </tr> </tbody> </table></td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <p><strong>WHILE YOU WERE SLEEPING:</strong></p> <div class="inline-content inline-photo inline-photo-center horizontal-photo modal-3"> <img data-no-process="data-no-process" src="https://img.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https%3A%2F%2Farc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2FYCLUKKBWIYI6TL23WUNX74ZC5E.jpg&amp;w=908" class="zoom-in"> <p class="pb-caption">Schoolchildren walk by as U.S. troops patrol in Syria near the Turkish border in November.

So, the CIA recruited a businessman to bait them</a>,” by Zach Dorfman:</strong> “Beginning in 1975, a big black limousine with diplomatic plates would pull up once a month to the no-parking zone outside John Greenagel’s office in the handsome Merchants Exchange Building in downtown San Francisco. A man would exit the car, paper bag in hand, and ascend the stairs to Greenagel’s public relations firm. The man would hand Greenagel, then in his mid-30s, the paper bag, which always contained stale Cuban cigars and a bottle of Stolichnaya without a tax stamp. 'Compliments of Mr. Pavlov,' the man would say, and walk out. Yuri Pavlov was a diplomat based at the Soviet Consulate in San Francisco and an undercover KGB officer ... after the Soviet bag man left, Greenagel would call his CIA handler, who would pop over to his office; and they’d laugh and drink the Stoly, smoke the old Cubans and talk about Greenagel’s deepening friendship with Pavlov, which was entirely manufactured. ... Greenagel was acting as an 'access agent' — providing the CIA with key insights about Pavlov’s psychological and personality profile.”&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>-- Vanity Fair, “<a href="http://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/02/inside-elizabeth-holmess-final-months-at-theranos">‘She Never Looks Back’: Inside Elizabeth Holmes’s Chilling Final Months at Theranos</a>,” by Nick Bilton: </strong>“Since Theranos’s collapse, observers have wondered how Holmes kept the company going for so long—how she was able to convince those scientists, investors, and colleagues that her quixotic idea for a portable, revolutionary blood-testing technology could somehow come to fruition.

Over the course of about a year, I stopped into locations in six or seven cities, and in each of them I sat in front of my computer alongside other people in front of their computers and felt at once marginally more productive and slightly less unmoored.”</p> <p><strong>-- “<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/2019/02/21/something-told-me-check-vehicle-one-more-time-how-state-trooper-saved-an-infant-trapped-under-water/">‘Something told me to check the vehicle one more time’: How a state trooper saved an infant trapped underwater</a>,” by Allison Klein: </strong>“It was the middle of the shift for Oklahoma Highway Patrol Trooper Cody Enloe when he got a call for a car accident on Highway 259, deep in the rural part of the state. A pickup truck had flipped over, and the driver and her children were trapped inside. … Emergency responders and bystanders breathed a sigh of relief once the two children were out, Enloe said, and some started to walk away from the scene. ‘I kind of reverted back to my training, and something told me to check the vehicle one more time,’ Enloe said. ‘I crawled back into the truck.’ Using his flashlight, he saw another car seat, a third one — but this one was partially submerged, and he realized the baby’s face was underwater.
