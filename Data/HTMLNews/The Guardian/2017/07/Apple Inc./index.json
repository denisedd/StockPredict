                "bodyText":"With little in the way of real economic news, and with interest meetings from the Bank of Japan and European Central Bank due on Thursday, investors were in a cautious mood again. Even so, markets managed to move in the right direction. In Europe, they were lifted by a dip in the euro ahead of the ECB gathering, while in the US a stronger oil price helped to lift Wall Street. The technology heavy Nasdaq index even hit a new high, boosted by another move higher from Netflix. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished up 40.69 points or 0.55% at 7430.91 France\u2019s Cac closed up 0.17% at 12,452.05 Germany\u2019s Dax rose 0.83% to 5216.07 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB climbed 0.57% to 21,478.95 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended up 0.6% at 10,588.1 In Greece, the Athens market added 0.64% to 853.54 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently 26 points or 0.12% higher. On that note, we\u2019ll close for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. Joshua Mahony, market analyst at IG, is also cautious about the fall in US oil inventories: US crude stocks posted their third greater than expected inventories drawdown today, as the effects of driving season continue to be felt. It is worth being careful to not read too much into recent US stockpile reductions, as seasonality effects typically see US drivers raise both mileage and air conditioning usage. News that Chinese demand is on the wane is certainly not what the bulls want to hear, and despite falling US stocks, we continue to see output rise globally irrespective of the conformity rate of the recent OPEC production quota. David Madden, market analyst at CMC Markets UK, said: WTI and Brent Crude oil surged higher after the oil inventory report showed a larger than expected decline. The energy information agency (EIA) revealed that US stockpiles of oil fell by 4.72 million barrels, and the consensus was for a 3.5 million barrel decline. Last week there was drop of 7.56 million barrels. Traders would be unwise to overlook the fact that US oil production increased by 32 thousand barrels per day. US crude stocks fell by more than expected last week, giving some support to the oil price. Crude inventories dropped by 4.7m barrels compared to forecasts of a 3.2m barrel fall, while gasoline stocks were 4.4m barrels lower. Analysts had expected a decline here of 655,000. The news saw Brent crude jump 1.33% to $49.49 a barrel, a two week high. Credit Suisse has sent a shiver through the City this afternoon, by warning that Britain is \u2018flirting with recession\u2019. In a new research note, Credit Suisse argues there is a roughly one-in-three chance that Britain\u2019s economy falls into recession later this year, as the economy continues to slow. Credit Suisse estimates that next week\u2019s GDP figures will show that the UK economy only grew by 0.2% in April-June, matching the poor performance in the first three month of 2017. For the rest of the year, it expect growth to remain subdued at 0.2%-0.3% per quarter. And raises the prospect of a full-blown technical recession, defined as two quarters of negative growth in a row. Credit Suisse believes this is a real possibility, given the slowdown in consumer spending and the uncertainty created by Brexit. The bank\u2019s analysts do admit that they predicted an immediate recession if Britain voted to leave the EU. That didn\u2019t happen, of course, but that doesn\u2019t mean that the risk is averted for good. They write: That [a recession] is not our central scenario, but the risks are increasing, and the volatile political backdrop and unpredictable Brexit negotiations have increased the uncertainty of our forecasts. The reasons for expecting a recession post the EU referendum in the UK continue to haunt the economy. We acknowledge that the recession we forecast in the aftermath of the referendum did not occur. But the channels that we thought would drive negative growth \u2013 an inflation-driven squeeze on consumer spending and weaker business investment as a result of Brexit uncertainty \u2013 are materializing, albeit later than we expected. We think those drivers are only likely to worsen as political uncertainty persists after the election and the UK\u2019s future relationship with Europe remains unclear. They also single out the slide in real wages in recent months: Over in New York, shares have hit fresh record highs at the start of trading. The S&amp;P 500 index, and the tech-focused Nasdaq, both pushed higher. Over in the US, there are some upbeat housing numbers in the wake of Tuesday\u2019s fall in housebuilder confidence. Housing starts in June rose by 8.3% compared to expectations of a 6.2% increase. This means new houses are being built at the fastest rate in four months. Meanwhile May\u2019s number was revised from a 5.5% fall to a 2.8% decline. Although Glaxo is selling Horlicks in the UK, it is retaining its Indian operation where the malted drink is growing more popular by the day. That\u2019s according to Reuters, which explains: In Britain, where Horlicks is sold as a bedtime drink, the product has largely fallen out of favour and sales are very limited. Indian demand for Horlicks, by contrast, is strong and GSK has developed the malted barley milk drink into its top consumer brand in the country. Glaxo\u2019s decision to abandon plans to build a new factory in Cumbria is a major blow to the area. Five years ago, GSK announced it would create a new \u201cstate-of-the-art biopharmaceutical manufacturing facility\u201d at Ulverston. The site was expected to cost around \u00a3350m, and create 500 permanent jobs. At the time, Prime Minister David Cameron said it was \u201cexcellent news for Cumbria\u201d. \u201cA major investment that will create many highly-skilled jobs and provide a huge boost to the area.\u201d But those hopes have now been thrown into uncertainty. Breaking: Pharmaceuticals group GlaxoSmithKline is cutting more than 300 jobs in the UK. The company has announced details of a plan to \u201cimprove the efficiency and competitiveness of its manufacturing network\u201d. Under the scheme, Glaxo will sell its \u2018Horlick\u2019 brand in the UK, and shut the factory in Slough where the malt milk drink is produced. GSK is also outsourcing some manufacturing activity at its Worthing site in the UK. And in another blow, the company is abandoning plans to build a biopharmaceutical facility in Ulverston, Cumbria, as it no longer needs the additional capacity. Local MP John Woodcock says it\u2019s \u2018terrible news\u2019. Glaxo insists that it remains committed to UK manufacturing, and is today pledging an extra \u00a3140m for sites in Hertfordshire, County Durham and Montrose, in Scotland. It says: This new investment is in addition to the \u00a3275million announced last year and investment of over \u00a31.2billion in UK manufacturing since 2012. It also points out that it is a major employer: Overall, GSK employs a total of around 17000 people across the UK of which 5000 are in UK manufacturing operations. The proposals announced today for Worthing and Slough will result in a reduction of approximately 320 permanent jobs over the next 4 years. Is it Brexit\u2019s fault? Apparently not. Glaxo says: None of the announcements made today by the company have resulted from the UK\u2019s decision to leave the European Union. Morgan Stanley\u2019s results have cheered the markets: Newsflash from Wall Street: Morgan Stanley has become the latest bank to warn that bond trading has struggled. But that hasn\u2019t stopped the bank beating expectations with its financial results for the last quarter.... MS\u2019s net earnings rose to $1.8bn for the April-June quarter, up from $1.6bn a year ago. That equates to earnings of 87 cents per share, compared to forecasts of just 76 cents CEO James Gorman says it\u2019s a decent performance, given the \u2018subdued\u2019 trading conditions. And those \u2018subdued\u2019 conditions seem to have hit in MS\u2019s bond trading division. Fixed income sales and trading net revenues fell to $1.2bn, from $1.3bn, due to \u201clower volatility and sporadic activity during the quarter\u201d. Yesterday, Goldman Sachs reported a 40% slump in second-quarter bond trading revenue, which was also blamed on the current environment of low volatility. Over in Paris, the governor of the Bank of France has dropped a hint that the ECB will take a cautious approach at this week\u2019s meeting. Villeroy de Galhau, who serves on the ECB\u2019s governing council, told French MPs that the central bank has defeated the threat of deflation. However, he added, it\u2019s too early to end its asset purchase scheme or raising interest rates from their current record lows. De Galhau argued: \u201cWe have made progress, but we have not yet reached the target and so there is still a need for our accommodative monetary policy... We are adapting its intensity depending on the economic situation and progress towards the target. Here\u2019s a photo from the session: European stock markets have crept higher, helping to keep global stocks at record levels. In London the FTSE 100 has gained 6 points, with Reckitt Benckiser leading the way following the sale of its food business. That follows a decent session on Wall Street last night, where the Nasdaq tech index surged to a fresh record high. Chris Beauchamp of IG says traders are hoping that the European Central Bank doesn\u2019t drop any nasty surprises tomorrow: A record high for the Nasdaq and a fresh overnight surge in the euro\u2019s ongoing rally will be the key themes on an otherwise relatively quiet day. As the ECB meeting gets closer, the market\u2019s attention will increasingly focus on the likelihood of any further hawkish commentary from the central bank that could squeeze the euro even higher against the dollar. European markets failed to capitalise on last week\u2019s rally, hamstrung by euro strength, so the hope for this particular crowded trade is that Mario Draghi will row back on the change in language from earlier in the month. Given the bank\u2019s predilection for easing, it seems unlikely that they will err too much on the hawkish side. Quite.... Newsflash: Europe\u2019s construction sector cooled a little in May. Construction output across the eurozone shrank by 0.7%, compared to May, due to a 0.9% decline in civil engineering and a 0.7% drop in building construction by 0.6%. Across the wider EU, construction dropped by 1.1%. Eurostat explains: The largest decreases in production in construction were recorded in Slovenia (-10.6%), Sweden (-7.1%) and Slovakia (-4.9%), and the highest increases in Hungary (+7.6%), Bulgaria (+3.6%) and Italy (+2.7%). Despite the month-on-month decline, eurozone construction production was still 2.6% higher than a year ago: This may encourage the European Central Bank not to rush into unwinding its stimulus programme.... Hot news for sauce lovers! Consumer giant Reckitt Benckiser has sold off its food business in a deal worth $4.2bn (\u00a33.2bn). The division, which produces French\u2019s mustard, Franks\u2019 RedHot and Cattlemen\u2019s sauces, has been gobbled up by America\u2019s McCormick &amp; Co - which owns Schwartz herbs and spices. This follows a bid battle with Unilever and Hormel Foods, maker of Spam. The deal should allow Reckitt to focus on its cleaning and healthcare operations. Shares in the company have jumped 1.5%. Peter Rosenstreich of Swissquote Bank predicts that the Bank of Japan will reaffirm its commitment to loose monetary policy when it monetary policy meeting ends tomorrow. The BoJ is currently buying 80 trillion yen of bonds each year, hitting banks with negative interest rates, and trying to keep long-term government borrowing costs around zero, in a bid to drive inflation and growth up. But with inflation still weak, Rosenstreich doesn\u2019t believe the BoJ can consider slowing its stimulus programme yet. While most major central banks have begun tightening money supplies, the BoJ has not. The Central bank has been unable to boost inflation to its target of 2%, and success is not in sight for 2017-2018. The Bank is likely to focus on controlling the yield curve, one of its primary targets will be to pin 10-year government bond yields at 0%.... Rosenstreich adds that two hawkish BoJ policymakers are leaving the board, giving governor Haruhiko Kuroda more freedom to continue his expansive policy. Australia\u2019s stock market had a good day, driven by its banks. Shares in Australia\u2019s largest lenders rallied after regulators unveiled new capital requirements which are less onerous than feared. Bloomberg has the details: \u201cThe new requirements look relatively benign,\u201d said Anthony Ip, a credit analyst at Citigroup Inc. \u201cThe majors may well be able to meet the new requirements organically without equity raisings, assets sales or changes to dividends.\u201d ANZ Bank shares rose as much as 4.2 percent, the most in more than eight months, and Commonwealth Bank added 3.4 percent. National Australia Bank rallied as much as 3.7 percent and Westpac climbed as much as 4 percent. That sent the S&amp;P/ASX index up by 0.8% The euro is dipping this morning, down 0.2% against the pound at 88.4p. That suggests that traders expect the European Central Bank to calm expectations that it might rein in its stimulus programme soon, at tomorrow\u2019s meeting. Benjamin Schroeder, a rates strategist at ING, believes the ECB have had a rethink after president Draghi gave an upbeat speech in late June. Those upbeat comments drove the euro up, and sparked a selloff in eurozone government bonds. Schroeder adds (via Reuters): \u201cA strong euro has also raised expectations that they will not sound overly hawkish.\u201d The US dollar\u2019s weakness has boosted the Chinese yuan. Beijing just fixed its currency at the strongest level in nine months, as Trump\u2019s healthcare woes continue to weigh on the greenback. This news clearly calls for a cute panda... Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. There\u2019s an end of term feeling in the markets today. I don\u2019t think any traders have actually turned up with a Kerplunk set, but they could be forgiven for risking a quick game of Top Trumps across their trading terminals. In short, there\u2019s not much going on today. So with nothing to scare investors right now, global markets remain at their highest ever levels. MSCI\u2019s gauge of shares around the world has risen this morning, putting it on track for its fifth daily rise in a row. But although the summer lull is nearly upon us, we\u2019re not there quite yet, class. Investors need to prepare for a busy Thursday, when the Bank of Japan and the European Central Bank both hold monetary policy meetings. They could move move the markets, if policymakers offer any hints that monetary policy will be tightened soon. In particular, the ECB could provide fresh guidance on when it will start to taper its bond purchase scheme. Any bullish comments from president Draghi could send the euro spiking. Mihir Kapadia, CEO of Sun Global Investments, says: Any comments which are perceived are more hawkish then expected could result in further pressure on the US dollar. The dollar is also weaker against the yen and the pound.\u201d Over in Asia, optimism over China\u2019s economy, following this week\u2019s GDP figures, has pushed shares higher. The US dollar is languishing around a 10-month low today, following Donald Trump\u2019s inability to get healthcare changes though Congress. Investors are increasingly sceptical that that the president can implement tax reforms or push through a big infrastructure spending bill. As Michael Hewson of CMC Markets puts it... The Trump administration is also helping by appearing to undermine the US dollar at every available opportunity with what can only be described as either incompetence or sheer stupidity. Another failure to enact policy reforms this time on health care is raising serious questions as to whether this administration will deliver on any of the promises it made at the end of last year, with serious doubts now being expressed about tax and banking reform. It seems that even with a majority in both Houses the Republicans appear unable to even agree amongst themselves as to what is best for the US economy. It appears that the US government is giving the UK government a run for its money in the incompetence stakes. It doesn\u2019t help that neither country has a competent opposition to offset this. President Draghi will certainly have his work cut out in keeping a lid on the euro at this rate, as the market gears up for tomorrow\u2019s ECB rate meeting, with a move to the $1.2000 level a distinct possibility on a break of $1.1620 and last year\u2019s high. The agenda: It looks like a quiet day, but we do get new eurozone construction figures, US housing data, and new oil inventory figures this afternoon.... 10am BST: Eurozone construction output for May 1.30pm BST: US housing starts and building permits 3.30pm BST: US crude oil inventories",

The latest going-on in the White House - including the change of chief of staff following the healthcare bill failure - have helped undermine the US currency, with investors questioning how much of his promised tax reforms and spending plans will actually see the light of day.

Companies also have a large part to play in the financial wellbeing of their employees \u2013 otherwise, they too will feel the negative impact that financial stress can have on employee performance.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-597f442de4b0d340766cc2e3\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-07-31T14:53:03.369Z\">3.53pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Bank of England strike to go ahead - PA report</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The Press Association is reporting some bad news for Bank of England governor Mark Carney ahead of this week\u2019s monetary policy meeting:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/PA/status/892034466595700737\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Breaking?src=hash\">#Breaking</a> Three-day strike by Bank of England workers to go ahead from Tuesday after talks end without agreement, Unite union says</p>&mdash; Press Association (@PA) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/PA/status/892034466595700737\">July 31, 2017</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2017-07-31T14:55:37.890Z\">at 3.55pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-597f3e83e4b0dc6c3f0fe319\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-07-31T14:52:24.835Z\">3.52pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>US markets continue to be buoyant, despite a relatively quiet day in terms of economic and corporate news.

                "bodyText":"On a relatively quiet day for company and economic news, the weakness of the dollar was a dominant theme once more. The latest going-on in the White House - including the change of chief of staff following the healthcare bill failure - have helped undermine the US currency, with investors questioning how much of his promised tax reforms and spending plans will actually see the light of day. Added to that was the nervousness surrounding the latest missile tests by North Korea. So with the euro and pound benefitting from the greenback\u2019s weakness, European markets mainly ended the day lower. But the recent run of positive US company results, and hopes for the same from Apple on Tuesday, helped pushed the Dow Jones Industrial Average to new peaks. The final scores in Europe showed: The FTSE 100 edged up 3.63 points or 0.05% to 7372.00 Germany\u2019s Dax dipped 0.37% to 12,118.25 France\u2019s Cac closed 0.73% lower at 5093.77 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB finished 0.26% ahead at 21,486.91 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended down 0.32% at 10,502.2 In Greece, the Athens market fell 0.95% to 812.21 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 84 points or 0.39%, close to its intraday peak. On that note, it\u2019s time to close for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. More on the strike at the Bank of England, and here\u2019s the Bank\u2019s response: The Bank has been informed that industrial action called by Unite will commence at midnight tonight for three days. The Union balloted approximately 2% of the workforce. The Bank has plans in place so that all essential business will continue to operate as normal during this period. The Bank has been in talks with Unite up to and including today and remains ready to continue those talks at any time. The weak dollar has also seen the euro gain ground against the US currency: Sterling has hit a new 10 month high against the dollar, as the US currency continues to struggle with the uncertainties caused by the actions and comments from the president. The pound is currently up 0.35% at $1.3178, having earlier hit $1.32 for the first time since 16 September. Neil Wilson, senior market analyst at ETX Capital, said: Sterling jumped to fresh 10-month highs as the end of month 4pm fix sent cable higher. The pound exploded higher to $1.31999, having the briefest of flirts with the $1.32 handle before easing back. The move came as the dollar heads for its worst month since January. Cable is now trading at its highest since mid-September 2016 on this sustained bout of dollar weakness. Clearly it\u2019s all to do with Donald Trump saying it was too strong and the market having confidence in him\u2026more likely it is the exact opposite \u2013 concerns about the chaos in Washington and a complete lack of faith in the administration delivering any kind of meaningful economic or fiscal reforms. There is also growing doubt that the US Federal Reserve will be in a position to raise interest rates again in the immediate future. After its earlier gains on Venezuela\u2019s problems, the oil price is now on the slide. Opec crude output rose by 90,000 barrels a day this month to a high for the year, according to Reuters, as supplies from Libya continued to recover. So, ahead of a meeting next week between Opec and non-Opec producers, Brent crude is now down 0.4% at $52.28 a barrel, having earlier reached a peak for the day of $52.92. Back with the UK consumer credit figures, and TUC general secretary Frances O\u2019Grady has called for the government to take action: Wages are still lower than before financial crisis, so it\u2019s no wonder that families are being forced deeper and deeper into debt. If working people don\u2019t see extra cash in their pocket, borrowing will continue to spiral. Setting aside mortgages, household debt is likely to hit an all-time high this year. The government needs to boost investment to get wages rising again. They should start by ending public sector pay restrictions and putting the minimum wage up to \u00a310 as soon as possible. Meanwhile Elliott Silk, Head of Commercial at Sanlam UK, said: The Bank of England\u2019s actions to curtail the growth of unsecured loans has had some impact, but more action is needed. While consumer credit accounts for a fraction of household debt, people are much more likely to default on unsecured loans. A lot of this has to do with understanding the area \u2013 there is a lack of financial education on the national curriculum, which means young people often come out of education na\u00efve to the negative consequences of unsecured loans and personal debt. Companies also have a large part to play in the financial wellbeing of their employees \u2013 otherwise, they too will feel the negative impact that financial stress can have on employee performance. The Press Association is reporting some bad news for Bank of England governor Mark Carney ahead of this week\u2019s monetary policy meeting: US markets continue to be buoyant, despite a relatively quiet day in terms of economic and corporate news. But there is a lot coming up this week for investors to get their teeth into, which could well provide some volatility. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said: There wasn\u2019t all that much to drive the index higher this Monday, with investors perhaps enjoying the calm before the storm of data and earnings brought by the first few days of August. Tuesday\u2019s Markit and ISM manufacturing PMIs are joined by Fed-favourite inflation gauge the core PCE price index and, most crucially, Apple\u2019s latest earnings update. Wednesday then has the ADP employment change reading, before Thursday\u2019s double dose of services PMIs and, finally, Friday\u2019s non-farm jobs report. In other words, plenty to challenge the Dow\u2019s recent rise. The Dallas Federal Reserve manufacturing activity index has climbed from 15 in June to 16.8 in July, much better than the expected fall to 13. The production index, a key measure of state manufacturing conditions, rose 11 points to 22.8, indicating output grew at a faster pace than in June, said the Dallas Fed. But the positive data, there were more mixed responses from respondents: Business is good, not great. We are busy. The foreign competition for new equipment is extremely competitive and our company is not able to match their selling prices. Things are going poorly in the economy. We have no projects, and business is slow. We are experiencing the summertime blues. Business is very dull July to date. Washington, D.C., is still a significant contingent factor for a better or worse outlook. Prospects for better are dimming. The increases in business are small but measurable. We have been trying to add employees over the last six months, with no qualified candidates available. I cannot explain it, but we are slower than we have ever been at this time and it seems like we are not the only ones. Next on the agenda are the latest US housing figures, which have come in better than expected. Pending home sales bounced back in June after three months of decline. The National Association of Realtors said that its index of contracts to buy previously owned homes jumped1.5% to a reading of 110.2. This was higher than the 0.7% rise that analysts had been forecasting. But the market remains limited by the number of houses available to buy. Lawrence Yun, the NAR chief economist said: The first half of 2017 ended with a nearly identical number of contract signings as one year ago, even as the economy added 2.2 million net new jobs. Market conditions in many areas continue to be fast paced, with few properties to choose from, which is forcing buyers to act almost immediately on an available home that fits their criteria. Low supply is an ongoing issue holding back activity. Housing inventory declined last month and is a staggering 7.1 percent lower than a year ago. The fall in the Chicago PMI follows five straight months of rises, and is the lowest level for three months. Jamie Satchi, economist at MNI Indicators which helps compile the report, said: MNI\u2019s July Chicago Business Barometer should be viewed in the context of the underlying, upward trend in business sentiment witnessed since early 2016. Key indicators, despite reversing their June reading, remain above their respective averages set over the last twelve months, and point towards robust confidence among U.S firms. Still with the US and there is a smidgen of data due. First comes the Chicago Purchasing Managers Index, which has come in lower than expected, down from 65.7 in June to 58.9 in July. Optimism about US company earnings has helped push Wall Street higher once more. The Dow Jones Industrial Average has hit a new intraday peak of 21,885, while the Nasdaq Composite and S&amp;P 500 are both on the rise in early trading. So far around 73% of major companies reporting results have beaten expectations, and Apple is the next big name to come under the spotlight, with its results due after the market closes on Tuesday. Thurday sees the Bank of England\u2019s latest interest rate and monetary policy decisions, and ING Bank has been looking at the possibilities. And they have felt moved to drag in Game of Thrones for some reason: In another important development, UK consumer borrowing is back above \u00a3200bn for the first time since the financial crash. That\u2019s according to the latest Bank of England figures, released this morning. Unsecured consumer credit, which includes credit cards, car loans and overdrafts, grew by 10% in the year to June, to \u00a3200.9bn. It was the first time the outstanding debt had gone above \u00a3200bn since the peak of the global financial crisis in 2008. The pace of growth in consumer credit did ease off slightly in June, going up by \u00a31.5bn on the month after \u00a31.8bn in May. Ruth Gregory, UK economist at the consultancy Capital Economics said the 10% rise on the year would still be concerning for the Bank. Gregory says: \u201cThis will clearly do nothing to allay policymakers\u2019 fears that unsecured credit is growing too quickly. But this at least suggests that households remain confident enough in their financial position to increase borrowing to help smooth consumption, as their real incomes are temporarily squeezed by higher inflation.\u201d Rating agency Moody\u2019s has sounded the alarm over Britain\u2019s consumer credit market. It has downgraded the outlook on bonds backed by credit card customers, buy-to-let mortgages and car loans, and warned that some British borrowers will struggle to repay their debt as the economy weakens, and inflation eats into their salaries. In a new report Greg Davies, Moody\u2019s assistant vice president, says: \u201cHousehold debt is high and still growing, leaving consumers vulnerable to an economic downturn, while higher inflation, weaker wage growth and levels of indebtedness leaves those in lower-income brackets the most exposed.\u201d \u201cAn additional challenge is that households\u2019 capacity to draw on savings to maintain consumption and/or service their consumer debts has significantly diminished.\u201d As a result, Moody\u2019s has downgraded the collateral outlooks on most \u2018UK structured finance sectors\u2019 to negative. It believes they will perform negatively over the next 12 to 18 months. Structured finance is the process of taking a large number of individual loans, packaging them into a single security, and selling it to investors. In theory, this allows investors to get a guaranteed income stream, but with the danger of losses if the underlying loans underperform (as happened spectacularly in the subprime crisis of 2008). These are the areas which Moody\u2019s is worried about: Non-prime residential mortgages bonds: These borrowers are paying higher interest rates, and have smaller savings pots to absorb any shocks, says Moody\u2019s. Bonds backed by the UK\u2019s buy-to-let (BTL) sector: Bondholders could suffer losses if house prices fall, due to \u201cthe high proportion of interest-only underlying loans\u201d. Automobile asset-backed securities: Moody\u2019s fears that \u201cdelinquencies are likely to rise slightly\u201d as the economy deteriorates. It singles out the boom in Personal Contract Purchase (PCP) plans, which have allowed customers with poor credit histories to buy new cars. Credit card asset-backed securities: Moody\u2019s expects delinquencies and defaults on these bonds to rise, especially if unemployment increases. Moody\u2019s warning comes just a few hours after Britain\u2019s Financial Conduct Authority announced it would review the booming car loan market, amid worries that consumer debt is getting out of hand. Newsflash: Officials from the Bank of England and the Unite union have sat down at conciliation firm ACAS. It\u2019s a final attempt to stop a three-day walkout at the Bank, starting tomorrow, over a 1% pay offer to Unite staff. The threat of US sanctions on Venezuela has alarmed investors, sending them racing to ditch bonds issued by Caracas. The price of long-term Venezuelan dollar bonds fell almost one cent, according to Reuters data. Bonds issued by state oil firm Petr\u00f3leos de Venezuela also took a tumble. It buys US light crude oil, and mixes it with its own crude to create a product for export - so any sanctions would hurt the company. Meanwhile, the European Union has added its voice to the chorus of concerns over Sunday\u2019s vote: Marc Br\u00fctsch, chief economist at Swiss Life, says the drop in eurozone unemployment shows that Europe\u2019s economy is strengthening: Ken Odeluga of City Index says the data has cheered investors. But Craig Erlam of OANDA points out that the eurozone has plenty of room for improvement: Unemployment at 9.1% is still extremely high and when you break that down by country, it becomes much higher again in some places. Core inflation is also only at 1.3% which is still well below the ECB\u2019s target and with the currency appreciating strongly this year, downward pressures here will continue to build. The central bank should therefore tread very carefully when it comes to removing stimulus, as I expect it will. In another encouraging sign, youth unemployment across the eurozone has fallen by 400,000 over the last year. There are now 2.588 million young people out of work in the euro area, or 18.7% of the youth population, down from 21% in June 2016. The lowest youth unemployment rate is in Germany (6.7%), while the highest were recorded in Greece (45.5% in April 2017), Spain (39.2%) and Italy (35.4%). Boom! Unemployment across the eurozone has fallen to a new eight-year low. The euro area jobless rate has dropped to 9.1% in June, down from 9.2% in May. This level was last seen in February 2009, after the financial crisis drove Europe into recession. It indicates that Europe\u2019s economy is continuing to strengthen, on the back of solid growth figures from France and Spain last week. Unemployment in the wider European Union was stable at 7.7%, the lowest since December 2008. Despite this recovery, the eurozone\u2019s jobless rate is still much higher than the UK\u2019s 4.5% or the US, where it is just 4.4%. There are also stark regional differences, between Northern and Southern Europe: Eurostat has more details: Among the Member States, the lowest unemployment rates in June 2017 were recorded in the Czech Republic (2,9%), Germany (3.8%) and Malta (4.1%). The highest unemployment rates were observed in Greece (21.7% in April 2017) and Spain (17.1%). Separate data shows that the eurozone\u2019s inflation rate remained at 1.3% in July, some way below the European Central Bank\u2019s target of just below 2%. Newsflash: Back in the UK, the number of mortgages being approved has dipped to a nine-month low. A total of 64,684 new home loans were agreed in June, new figures from the Bank of England show, down from 65,109 in May. That\u2019s the lowest since September 2016. The figures also show that the public continued to rack up credit. Net consumer credit rose by \u00a31.458bn in June from \u00a31.769bn in May. That means consumer credit is growing by around 10% per year. Economist Rupert Seggins has tweeted the key charts: As this chart shows, Venezuela is the third-largest exporter of oil into the US market: Venezuela\u2019s public finances have been badly hurt by the fall in the oil price a couple of years ago. That loss of revenue has fuelled the country\u2019s political and economic crisis, as RBC Capital Markets explain: Many petro states have seen their finances severely strained by the oil price slump. However, no country has experienced as fast and furious fall as Venezuela has, and it now appears poised to earn the dubious distinction of being the first to fully fail. The statistics are staggering. By the end of the 2017, the Venezuelan economy will likely have shrunk by 30% in three years. The IMF forecasts that inflation will average 720% this year and top 2,000% in 2018. Half of the population is living in extreme poverty and health officials are even starting to warn of famine if current trends continue, according to the International Crisis Group. Three months of daily demonstrations and strikes have left more than a hundred dead and thousands injured. Thousands more are languishing in jail. Venezuela\u2019s new assembly will give President Nicolas Maduro and his supporters \u201cnear-total\u201d control of the levers of power, say Associated Press. AP also report that opposition parties don\u2019t accept the government\u2019s claim that over 40% of the public voted: Council president Tibisay Lucena announced just before midnight that turnout in Sunday\u2019s vote was 41.53 percent, or 8,089,320 people. The count was met with mockery and anger from members of the opposition, who said they believed between 2 million and 3 million people voted. One well-respected independent analysis said 3.6 million appeared to have voted. The electoral council\u2019s vote counts in the past have traditionally been seen as reliable and generally accurate, but Sunday\u2019s announcement appeared certain to escalate the polarization and political conflict paralyzing the country. UK foreign office minister Sir Alan Duncan has tweeted that he\u2019s \u201cappalled\u201d by the events in Venezuela: My colleague Sibylla Brodzinsky has written about the deadly clashes on the streets of Venezuela during Sunday\u2019s voting. Many voters decided against taking part in an election the opposition said would turn the country into a full-fledged dictatorship. As many as 14 people died in the protests, according to opposition leader Henrique Capriles, and the prosecutor\u2019s office confirmed at least six people were killed by gunfire, including one national guardsman. Seven policemen were wounded in an explosion in the opposition stronghold neighbourhood of Altamira. However, the leader of the ruling socialist party, Jorge Rodriguez, said there was \u201cnot one death related to the voting process today\u201d, underscoring the contrasting versions of the day presented by the two clashing sides. This chart shows how the Venezuela crisis has driven oil to a two-month high: The oil price is rallying this morning, following reports that the US government could hit Venezuela with sanctions. Brent crude has jumped to $52.85 per barrel, its highest level since late May, and US crude is back over the $50/barrel mark. The surge comes after US officials expressed anger over a controversial election held in Venezuela last weekend to choose delegates for its assembly, and to rewrite its constitution. Critics claimed that the vote was designed to shore up president Nicolas Maduro\u2019s government. It was marred by violent clashes between opposition supporters and troops, with at least three people killed over the weekend. Nikki Haley, the US ambassador to the United Nations, has already warned Maduro that the result isn\u2019t acceptable. US State Department spokesperson Heather Nauert also warned: \u201cWe will continue to take strong and swift actions against the architects of authoritarianism in Venezuela, including those who participate in the National Constituent Assembly as a result of today\u2019s flawed election,\u201d \u201cWe encourage governments in the hemisphere and around the world to take strong action to hold accountable those who undermine democracy, deny human rights,bear responsibility for violence and repression, or engage in corrupt practices. And a formal US response is expected soon, with officials briefing that they could impose sanctions on Venezuela\u2019s vital oil sector this week. Reuters has more details: The measures, which could be announced as early as Monday, are not expected to include a ban on Venezuelan oil shipments to the United States -- one of the harshest options -- but could block sale of lighter U.S. crude that Venezuela mixes with its heavy crude and then exports, the officials told Reuters. More reaction to follow... Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Today we get a new healthcheck on Britain\u2019s economy, with new figures showing how much new credit was lapped up by consumer last month, and how many people took out mortgages. With concerns over Britain\u2019s economy mounting, City investors will scrutinise the data for signs that cash-strapped households are taking too many risks. Michael Hewson of CMC Markets has the City predictions: Mortgage approvals for June are set to remain steady at 65k, while net lending is expected to slow down a touch from the numbers seen in May, as declining consumer confidence and rising inflation squeezes wages, not to mention the uncertainty created by the June election result. The main event of the morning, though, could be the latest eurozone inflation and jobs report. They could show that Europe\u2019s recovery is continues, with unemployment tipped to hit a new post-crisis low of 9.2% in June. Royal Bank of Canada\u2019s analysts warn that Europe\u2019s labour market still has black spots: The pace of improvement is still gradual, due in particular to the continued sluggish performance of the French and Italian labour markets, meaning that the considerable degree of labour market slack that exists in the euro area continues to be absorbed only slowly. Eurozone inflation, meanwhile, is expected to remain at 1.3% in July -- not high enough to worry the European Central Bank unduly. Also, the Bank of England will make a final attempt to avert its first strike in half a century. The central bank will meet with union officials today, with a three-day walkout over pay due to start tomorrow: The agenda 9.30am BST: UK consumer credit and mortgage approvals for June 10am BST: Eurozone unemployment figures for June 10am BST: Eurozone inflation data for July 3pm BST: US pending home sales",
