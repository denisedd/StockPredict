It was the strongest pace of growth since March 2013.</p> <p>Mike Coupe, the Sainsbury\u2019s group chief executive, said: \u201cWe have delivered a strong performance, driven by our differentiated strategy, offering customers quality, value and choice across food, general merchandise, clothing and financial services.\u201d</p> <p>The group, which also owns Argos, was partly helped by the timing of Easter and Mother\u2019s Day, which it said had contributed about 0.3 percentage points of the growth. Excluding that factor, the pace was still slightly ahead of City expectations of 1.9% growth.</p> <p> Coupe said shoppers were snapping up Sainsbury\u2019s own-label products after it had implemented hundreds of quality improvements and held prices on basics including milk, chicken breast and eggs.</p> <p>He said inflation, which is now running at more than 2.5% according to the CPI index, had started to hit towards the end of the period but Sainsbury\u2019s had \u201cmanaged to keep a control over prices and the impact on customers\u201d.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p> Fresh produce performed particularly well, outperforming the market with volume growth of 1% as Sainsbury\u2019s cut the price of summer favourites including Jersey Royal potatoes and British strawberries. That helped boost total grocery sales by 3% compared to 0.3% growth in the previous three months. <br></p> <p>Coupe played down the impact of the weather.

                "bodyText":"Demand for fresh fruit and veg and a dash for paddling pools, summer clothes and fans helped Sainsbury\u2019s deliver its strongest sales growth in more than four years. Sales at stores open more than a year, excluding fuel, rose by 2.3% in the 16 weeks to 1 July, up from 0.3% in the previous three months partly thanks to the warm start to the summer. It was the strongest pace of growth since March 2013. Mike Coupe, the Sainsbury\u2019s group chief executive, said: \u201cWe have delivered a strong performance, driven by our differentiated strategy, offering customers quality, value and choice across food, general merchandise, clothing and financial services.\u201d The group, which also owns Argos, was partly helped by the timing of Easter and Mother\u2019s Day, which it said had contributed about 0.3 percentage points of the growth. Excluding that factor, the pace was still slightly ahead of City expectations of 1.9% growth. Coupe said shoppers were snapping up Sainsbury\u2019s own-label products after it had implemented hundreds of quality improvements and held prices on basics including milk, chicken breast and eggs. He said inflation, which is now running at more than 2.5% according to the CPI index, had started to hit towards the end of the period but Sainsbury\u2019s had \u201cmanaged to keep a control over prices and the impact on customers\u201d. Fresh produce performed particularly well, outperforming the market with volume growth of 1% as Sainsbury\u2019s cut the price of summer favourites including Jersey Royal potatoes and British strawberries. That helped boost total grocery sales by 3% compared to 0.3% growth in the previous three months. Coupe played down the impact of the weather. He said that the number of warm days over the whole period was \u201cnot far off the same\u201d as last year. He pointed to Sainsbury\u2019s improvement in price position relative to its competitors for the group\u2019s step up in performance. Coupe also said there were signs that shoppers were choosing to eat at home rather than go out for meals as disposable income came under pressure from rising inflation. But he said: \u201cWe are not seeing a massive change in consumer behaviour.\u201d Online grocery sales rose by 8%, Sainsbury\u2019s convenience store sales were up by 10% and clothing sales rose by 7.2%. All the supermarkets have been lifted by a combination of a warm start to the summer and rising inflation. Sainsbury\u2019s said the number of transactions carried out in its stores rose by 2%. Coupe said that Sainsbury\u2019s general merchandise and clothing ranges, including Argos, outperformed the market, as its fast track delivery and collect-from-store services recorded a \u201cstellar performance\u201d during the quarter, particularly during the warm weather when customers wanted items such as paddling pools and electric fans on the day. Total sales rose 1% despite the closure of dozens of Argos and Habitat outlets in Homebase stores after the takeover of the DIY chain buy Australian firm Bunnings. Sainsbury\u2019s said it had opened 10 convenience stores in the period but made no mention of Nisa, the wholesale buying group with which it is understood to be in exclusive talks. Coupe said: \u201cLots of conversations are had and there is lots of speculation but lots of things don\u2019t come off.\u201d The supermarket is thought to be considering a \u00a3130m takeover of Nisa, which supplies and provides marketing support to thousands of small independent stores. Nisa\u2019s 1,400 members, which include the McColl\u2019s convenience store chain, operate 2,500 shops. They would have to approve any takeover and many are fiercely protective of their independence. Laith Khalaf, a senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said the bigger picture remained challenging for UK supermarkets: \u201cWeaker sterling is pushing up food prices and putting a dent in consumers\u2019 purses, while the trading environment remains as competitive as ever. \u201cIndeed the turf war the big supermarkets have been fighting against the discounters may start to look like a schoolyard skirmish if Amazon decides it wants a piece of the UK grocery market.\u201d David Alexander, the lead analyst at GlobalData, said: \u201cWith Sainsbury\u2019s receiving a significant helping hand from the upturn in fortunes for the wider grocery sector, it is too soon to judge whether this quarter represents a more positive new chapter for the grocer.

The Governor was alerted given the \u201calmost unthinkable consequences should Barings go down: not only would the failure of the City\u2019s leading accepting house inevitably bring down a host of other firms\u2026 but the very status of London would be threatened and thus the pre-eminence of the City as an international financial centre\u201d .</p> <p>Amidst much to-ing and fro-ing between the Bank of England (hereafter \u201cthe Bank\u201d), the Treasury and Downing Street, it was becoming apparent that the crisis at Barings was one not only of liquidity but also of solvency, and that there was now a palpable loss of confidence in the institution throughout the City.</p> <p>The Bank alone could not afford to act as lender of last resort so eventually the Governor of the day \u2013 Lidderdale \u2013 announced the establishment of a guarantee fund for Barings; within half an hour, the City\u2019s top institutions rushed to contribute \u2013 the likes of Raphaels (\u00a3250,000), Antony Gibbs and Brown Shipley (\u00a3200,000 apiece) and Smith Payne &amp; Smiths, Barclays, Morgan and Hambros (each contributed \u00a3100,000). Indeed, the leading joint-stock banks had put themselves down for \u00a33.25m and by mid-afternoon the fund was up to \u00a310m and climbed further to \u00a317m by the following week</p> <p> Barings was saved. But the crisis revealed something about the relationship between the state and industry at the end of the nineteenth century.

Some special purpose vehicles, derivatives, agency structures or collateral swaps carry material credit risk which escapes the detailed aspects of the capital framework.</li> <li><strong>Treatment of liquid assets</strong>. Firms can account for the value in their liquid assets buffer on a \u201chold to maturity\u201d basis. This raises the risk that \u2013 especially if gilt yields should rise \u2013 market price movements in liquid assets buffers could lead to unrealised losses.</li> <li><strong>Liquidity horizon</strong>. Some banks are seeking out funding that matures just beyond the time horizon used to calculate regulatory liquidity requirements.</li> <li><strong>For insurers, the Solvency II contract boundary</strong>. Firms cannot recognise future premiums on unit-linked savings policies that do not include any insurance cover or financial guarantee of benefits. Some have sought to amend existing contracts to extend the contract boundary and recognise more future profit.</li> </ul> <p>Woods also warns that some lenders are pushing the boundaries of prudent lending, hinting that some may have crossed the line.</p> <p>He says:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Across the wider market, we are observing \u2013 not from all firms, but definitely from a few (and some of them building societies) \u2013 a shift in credit risk appetite as lenders compete with each other to find ways of widening the pool of available borrowers, increasing the size of loans available to them, or reducing the credit premium.</p> <p>This search for marginal borrowers is a normal function of competitive markets, and does not imply that all resulting loans will turn out to be poor quality. </p> </blockquote> <p>Woods was meant to give these comments in a speech to the Building Society Association (BSA) Annual Conference in May, but had to pull out because of general election purdah rules.</p> <p>Had Woods been been there, he\u2019d have also delivered this warning....</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>That part of the reason why only 44 societies are attending this conference rather than the 60+ that came to its equivalent in 2004 lies in the fact that many of those societies were unaware of, or failed to control, the risks they were taking. </p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2017-07-10T12:23:01.550Z\">at 1.23pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-59636a32e4b0d920e0e2ac80\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-07-10T12:01:10.703Z\">1.01pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Germany Trade &amp; Invest</strong>, the federal economic development agency, is hanging out the bunting on the back of today\u2019s trade figures.<br></p> <p>It has sent round a press release jauntily titled \u201c<strong>German trade gets summer feeling\u201d, </strong>arguing that<strong> </strong>the increase in German imports and exports in May shows the global economy is chugging along nicely.</p> <p><strong>Thomas Bozoyan</strong>, Senior Manager of Economic Research, says:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\u201cGermany\u2019s strength as a manufacturing location is well-known, but the faith in that is reinforced by these export statistics.</p> <p>\u201cThe import statistic is perhaps more significant though, as it shows not only that German companies are manufacturing and doing good business, it is also creating wealth for its residents and increasing consumer demand.</p> <p>This increase in demand is being felt in other countries as well as Germany, a very good situation.</p> <p>\u201cThis all has a long-term value-creating effect for the country and will contribute to the stability of the nation and its economy, both as a residential and business location.\u201d</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-59636695e4b042dfbe78bc7c\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-07-10T11:41:31.343Z\">12.41pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>This week\u2019s Economist has <a href=\"https://www.economist.com/news/leaders/21724810-country-saves-too-much-and-spends-too-little-why-germanys-current-account-surplus-bad\">a good piece on Germany\u2019s trade surplus</a> (and a rather clever front page, see below).</strong></p> <p>It explains that there are good, admirable reasons for Germany\u2019s modern competitiveness, not merely unfair tactics as some claim.</p> <p>For example:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Underlying Germany\u2019s surplus is a decades-old accord between business and unions in favour of wage restraint to keep export industries competitive. Such moderation served Germany\u2019s export-led economy well through its postwar recovery and beyond. It is an instinct that helps explain Germany\u2019s transformation since the late 1990s from Europe\u2019s sick man to today\u2019s muscle-bound champion.</p> <p>There is much to envy in Germany\u2019s model. Harmony between firms and workers has been one of the main reasons for the economy\u2019s outperformance. Firms could invest free from the worry that unions would hold them to ransom. The state played its part by sponsoring a system of vocational training that is rightly admired.</p> </blockquote> <p>But.... Germany\u2019s whopping surplus inevitably causes ructions elsewhere in the system, with other countries inevitably running deficits:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>For a large economy at full employment to run a current-account surplus in excess of 8% of GDP puts unreasonable strain on the global trading system. To offset such surpluses and sustain enough aggregate demand to keep people in work, the rest of the world must borrow and spend with equal abandon. In some countries, notably Italy, Greece and Spain, persistent deficits eventually led to crises.</p> <p>Their subsequent shift towards surplus came at a heavy cost. The enduring savings glut in northern Europe has made the adjustment needlessly painful.</p> <p>In the high-inflation 1970s and 1980s Germany\u2019s penchant for high saving was a stabilising force.

                "bodyText":"And finally, the head of Europe\u2019s bailout mechanism is dropping some hints that Greece could potentially return to the financial markets. Klaus Regling, head of the European Stability Mechanism, says it would be wise for all involved to remember that Greece hopes to finance itself once its bailout ends. But speaking after the eurogroup meeting wrapped up in Brussels, Regling also warned Athens that investors will need confidence that it is sticking to its economic reforms. And that\u2019s all for tonight. GW After a less than riveting session, European stock markets closed a little higher tonight. In London the FTSE 100 ended 19 points higher at 7370. The smaller FTSE 250 finished in the red, though, dragged down by poor old Carillion (which lost 40% after that dire profits warning). The German DAX closed almost 0.5% higher, thanks to those trade surplus figures, while the French, Spanish and Italian markets also gained ground. Back in Greece, prime minister Alexis Tsipras has been sounding a triumphant note at the victory the country has secured in its battle to ensure that feta is sold as a purely Greek product Under the Economic Partnership Agreement the EU has signed with Japan, production of the white briny curd like cheese has been included in the 205 protected \u201cgeographical indications\u201d, meaning only feta from Greece will now be sold under that name. \u201cWhoever negotiates with a plan, achieves his goals,\u201d the leftist leader said after holding talks with the national economy and development minister Dimitris Papadimitriou and the Agriculture and Food Minister Vangelis Apostolou. Newsflash from Brussels: the Eurozone\u2019s bailout vehicle has finally disbursed Greece\u2019s long-awaited loan tranche. That facility, worth \u20ac7.7bn, is needed by Athens to repay earlier borrowings that mature this summer. But as Helena Smith reports, Greece\u2019s finance minister isn\u2019t actually attending today\u2019s euro group meeting .... She writes: Tongues are wagging in Athens at the rare sight of a euro group starting without a Greek finance minister attending. Never mind that it is one hundred plus euro groups into the Greek crisis, today\u2019s is being noticed precisely because Euclid Tsakalotos, the country\u2019s finance minister, will not be attending. Instead it is George Chouliarakis, the Greek minister\u2019s deputy, who has shown up for the meeting. Tsakalotos is said to have come down with a painful ear infection. But there is talk that the Oxford-educated economics professor may also have decided to stay away because Greece, for once, is not on the agenda. After year of waiting for a long-stalled compliance review to be completed, the debt-stricken country just received \u20ac7.7bn today \u2013 the first instalment of a third tranche of financial assistance approved by the European Stability Mechanism (ESM) on Friday. What comes in, of course, will go straight out with \u20ac6.9bn being used for debt serving needs and \u20ac0.8bn for arrears clearance. Athens will receive a further \u20ac800m \u201csubject to Greece making significant progress on arrears clearance\u201d by September 1st bringing the total amount of assistance the nation has received from the ESM to \u20ac181.2bn. Time for a quick summary: Germany\u2019s trade surplus has widened to \u20ac22bn in May, thanks to a jump in exports. Some experts say the figures will cause fresh tensions with the US government, given Donald Trump\u2019s trenchant criticism of German trade policy. But German analysts pointed out that imports and exports have both risen this year; proof that the world economy was in decent shape. So far this year, German has grown its exports by 7.2%, and its imports by 10.3% (here\u2019s the full chart) Eurozone investor confidence remains solid, according to the Sentix research group. However, worries over central banks are building, as policymakers prepare to unwind their stimulus programmes. Speaking of central banks.....The Bank of England has warned lender not to repeat the mistakes that led to the financial crisis in 2008. Deputy governor Sam Woods flagged up several areas of concern, as he urges banks, building societies and insurers to respect the spirit of the rules. Travelling by train in Britain could be stressful next month; UK commuters have been warned to expect serious disruption in August, due to a massive rail improvement programme. And the value of British infrastructure and construction firm Carillion has plunged by a third, after a shock profits warning. It\u2019s been a desperately quiet day in the markets. Wall Street just opened flat, matching the UK FTSE 100 which is now up just 10 points. The pound has dipped a little, to $1.2873 (down 0.1%), in rather subdued summer trading. Railway commuters, take a deep breath. Britain is facing an \u2018unprecedented\u2019 summer of disruption on its rail network, with major delays expected on key lines. It\u2019s all because Network Rail is planning a massive engineering works programme, that will leave some passengers queuing just to get into their station. London commuters will be particularly badly affected; Waterloo will be half-closed for three weeks, while 26-27 August will see the biggest bank holiday engineering work ever. Our transport correspondent Gwyn Topham explains: The worst of the disruption will be felt by passengers using Waterloo, the UK\u2019s busiest station, which will see about half its platforms closed for more than three weeks from 5 August, meaning many South West trains will not run. Passengers have been warned to expect queues of up to half an hour just to enter suburban stations on the network, such as Wimbledon and Surbiton, during summer rush hours. Euston will close entirely on the 26-27 August bank holiday weekend, affecting some services on the West Coast main line to Birmingham and cities north to Glasgow. London Bridge and Charing Cross will be closed to Southeastern services for a week from the same weekend. London Paddington and Liverpool Street will also be affected, with only King\u2019s Cross St Pancras, Victoria and Marylebone operating normally in the capital, although all are expected to be busier than usual to accommodate alternative journeys. Network Rail says the work will help deliver much-needed capacity; but it\u2019s going to be a painful time for passengers....

Sign up here. The Bank of England is also concerned that lenders are offering longer and longer mortgages. Deputy governor Sam Woods warns that some borrowers could find themselves still paying off their debts when they reach retirement. He says: I would highlight a recent trend in increasing loan terms: where 25 years might once have been the normal maximum term for a mortgage, now 35 years or even longer seems to be increasingly common. Of course, increasing the term reduces the level of each monthly instalment and makes the loan more affordable in the short term; however, it also increases the total amount of interest paid over the life of the loan quite significantly, and it increases the possibility that the final instalments may have to be met from post-retirement income. That should not be a problem if lenders can be confident about the availability of such retirement income, or about the scope for the borrower to downsize and use the sale proceeds to pay off the balance of the loan. But if lenders become too narrowly pre-occupied with the profile of the loan in the first 5 years (in line with MMR [mortgage market review] affordability rules), this could store up a problem for the future. Sam Woods\u2019 speech also includes a brief history of the Barings crisis of 1890, when the prestigious City institution found itself dangerously exposed to losses in Argentina. Deputy governor Woods (whose first job involved calculating Nick Leeson\u2019s losses a century later) explains how Barings came unstuck when Russia\u2019s government started withdrawing funds. Fortunately for Barings, the City rallied round, but it highlighted the challenge of the Bank of England\u2019s light-touch approach to regulating the sector, as Woods explains: Rumours began to circulate that the firm might not have any surplus left after payment of its liabilities. The Governor was alerted given the \u201calmost unthinkable consequences should Barings go down: not only would the failure of the City\u2019s leading accepting house inevitably bring down a host of other firms\u2026 but the very status of London would be threatened and thus the pre-eminence of the City as an international financial centre\u201d . Amidst much to-ing and fro-ing between the Bank of England (hereafter \u201cthe Bank\u201d), the Treasury and Downing Street, it was becoming apparent that the crisis at Barings was one not only of liquidity but also of solvency, and that there was now a palpable loss of confidence in the institution throughout the City. The Bank alone could not afford to act as lender of last resort so eventually the Governor of the day \u2013 Lidderdale \u2013 announced the establishment of a guarantee fund for Barings; within half an hour, the City\u2019s top institutions rushed to contribute \u2013 the likes of Raphaels (\u00a3250,000), Antony Gibbs and Brown Shipley (\u00a3200,000 apiece) and Smith Payne &amp; Smiths, Barclays, Morgan and Hambros (each contributed \u00a3100,000). Indeed, the leading joint-stock banks had put themselves down for \u00a33.25m and by mid-afternoon the fund was up to \u00a310m and climbed further to \u00a317m by the following week Barings was saved. But the crisis revealed something about the relationship between the state and industry at the end of the nineteenth century. Indeed, the institutional set-up explains quite a lot about the approach taken towards the oversight of financial institutions at this time.... The full speech is on the Bank of England\u2019s website, here: One of the Bank of England\u2019s top policymakers has fired a warning shot at Britain\u2019s lenders not to take undue risks. Sam Woods, the Deputy Governor for Prudential Regulation, has urged banks, building societies and insurers to stick to the spirit of financial regulation, as well as the letter. It\u2019s the latest sign that the BoE is concerned that credit is being doled out in a dangerous way, just as real wages fall and consumers are squeezed. Woods is concerned that some are indulging in \u201cpure regulatory arbitrage\u201d -- using questionable measures that make them look more secure. In particular, he highlights four ways that lenders could pull the wool over the regulator\u2019s eyes: Off-balance sheet leverage. Some special purpose vehicles, derivatives, agency structures or collateral swaps carry material credit risk which escapes the detailed aspects of the capital framework. Treatment of liquid assets. Firms can account for the value in their liquid assets buffer on a \u201chold to maturity\u201d basis. This raises the risk that \u2013 especially if gilt yields should rise \u2013 market price movements in liquid assets buffers could lead to unrealised losses. Liquidity horizon. Some banks are seeking out funding that matures just beyond the time horizon used to calculate regulatory liquidity requirements. For insurers, the Solvency II contract boundary. Firms cannot recognise future premiums on unit-linked savings policies that do not include any insurance cover or financial guarantee of benefits. Some have sought to amend existing contracts to extend the contract boundary and recognise more future profit. Woods also warns that some lenders are pushing the boundaries of prudent lending, hinting that some may have crossed the line. He says: Across the wider market, we are observing \u2013 not from all firms, but definitely from a few (and some of them building societies) \u2013 a shift in credit risk appetite as lenders compete with each other to find ways of widening the pool of available borrowers, increasing the size of loans available to them, or reducing the credit premium. This search for marginal borrowers is a normal function of competitive markets, and does not imply that all resulting loans will turn out to be poor quality. Woods was meant to give these comments in a speech to the Building Society Association (BSA) Annual Conference in May, but had to pull out because of general election purdah rules. Had Woods been been there, he\u2019d have also delivered this warning.... That part of the reason why only 44 societies are attending this conference rather than the 60+ that came to its equivalent in 2004 lies in the fact that many of those societies were unaware of, or failed to control, the risks they were taking. Germany Trade &amp; Invest, the federal economic development agency, is hanging out the bunting on the back of today\u2019s trade figures. It has sent round a press release jauntily titled \u201cGerman trade gets summer feeling\u201d, arguing that the increase in German imports and exports in May shows the global economy is chugging along nicely. Thomas Bozoyan, Senior Manager of Economic Research, says: \u201cGermany\u2019s strength as a manufacturing location is well-known, but the faith in that is reinforced by these export statistics. \u201cThe import statistic is perhaps more significant though, as it shows not only that German companies are manufacturing and doing good business, it is also creating wealth for its residents and increasing consumer demand. This increase in demand is being felt in other countries as well as Germany, a very good situation. \u201cThis all has a long-term value-creating effect for the country and will contribute to the stability of the nation and its economy, both as a residential and business location.\u201d This week\u2019s Economist has a good piece on Germany\u2019s trade surplus (and a rather clever front page, see below). It explains that there are good, admirable reasons for Germany\u2019s modern competitiveness, not merely unfair tactics as some claim. For example: Underlying Germany\u2019s surplus is a decades-old accord between business and unions in favour of wage restraint to keep export industries competitive. Such moderation served Germany\u2019s export-led economy well through its postwar recovery and beyond. It is an instinct that helps explain Germany\u2019s transformation since the late 1990s from Europe\u2019s sick man to today\u2019s muscle-bound champion. There is much to envy in Germany\u2019s model. Harmony between firms and workers has been one of the main reasons for the economy\u2019s outperformance. Firms could invest free from the worry that unions would hold them to ransom. The state played its part by sponsoring a system of vocational training that is rightly admired. But.... Germany\u2019s whopping surplus inevitably causes ructions elsewhere in the system, with other countries inevitably running deficits: For a large economy at full employment to run a current-account surplus in excess of 8% of GDP puts unreasonable strain on the global trading system. To offset such surpluses and sustain enough aggregate demand to keep people in work, the rest of the world must borrow and spend with equal abandon. In some countries, notably Italy, Greece and Spain, persistent deficits eventually led to crises. Their subsequent shift towards surplus came at a heavy cost. The enduring savings glut in northern Europe has made the adjustment needlessly painful. In the high-inflation 1970s and 1980s Germany\u2019s penchant for high saving was a stabilising force. Now it is a drag on global growth and a target for protectionists such as Mr Trump. Associated Press have a good quick take on today\u2019s German trade figures, for anyone just tuning in. German exports higher in May, trade surplus widens German exports were up 1.4 percent in May compared with the previous month, outpacing import growth and pushing the country\u2019s trade surplus higher. The Federal Statistical Office said Monday that imports to Europe\u2019s biggest economy were up 1.2 percent in May. The seasonally adjusted trade surplus was up to 20.3 billion euros ($23.1 billion), from 19.8 billion euros in April. The figures follow data last week showing that factory orders and industrial production both increased in May. ING-DiBa economist Carsten Brzeski said that: \u201cstrong domestic demand has already been around for a long while but the former growth engines, industrial production and exports have also started to gain momentum.\u201d But he cautioned that the increasing value of the euro could affect German exports in the coming months. Overnight, credit card firm Visa has provided fresh evidence that UK households are being squeezed by rising inflation. Visa\u2019s \u2018consumer spending index\u2019 fell by 0.3% between April and June compared with the same period a year earlier. That\u2019s the biggest drop since the third quarter of 2013, indicating that shoppers are cutting back now that inflation (2.9% in June) is rising rather faster than pay rises (2.1% in the March-May quarter). Data firm Markit shows how spending has fallen sharply in the last few months: Here\u2019s the full story: Back in the City, shares in infrastructure and construction firm Carillion have slumped by a third to their lowest in over 13 years. Carillion\u2019s shares plunged after the company announced that results would be below expectations, and that CEO Richard Howson was stepping down. Carillion has suffered a \u201cdeterioration in cash flows on a select number of construction contracts\u201d, forcing it to take a provision of \u00a3845m against likely losses. It is now pulling out of Qatar, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and Egypt - and will only undertake future construction work \u201con a highly selective basis\u201d. The company appears to have suffered badly from last year\u2019s EU referendum, as my colleague Julia Kollewe explains: In December, the Wolverhampton-based company, which employs nearly 50,000 people in the UK, Canada and the Middle East, blamed upheaval in Whitehall departments after the Brexit vote and change of government for a slowdown in orders. Carillion has also been affected by cuts in spending by governments in the Middle East prompted by low oil prices. Here\u2019s the full story. Over to Greece.... and new figures show that industrial output jumped by 5.4% year-on-year in May. That\u2019s much better than April\u2019s 0.9% annual rise, and may indicate that the Greek economy has turned a corner. Separately, the inflation rate in Greece has fallen to 0.9% in June, down from 1.5% in May (on an EU-harmonised basis). That\u2019s mainly due to a drop in costs for household equipment and health services, according to Elstat. Investor confidence across the euro area has dipped very slightly this month, and central bankers are to blame. Sentix\u2019s monthly survey of investor morale has dipped to 28.3 this month, down from June\u2019s 28.4. That\u2019s still a fairly high level, reflecting the strong economic data we\u2019ve seen from the eurozone in recent months. But.... there are also signs that the prospect of higher interest rates and the unwinding of central bank stimulus programmes are worrying investors. Sentix\u2019s Central Bank Policy index has slumped to -26 in July, down from -11.5 in June. That\u2019s its lowest level since the measure was created in 2005. Sentix blames recent hints by the European Central Bank that it is moving towards unwinding its bond-buying programme, given the recovery in inflation. \u201cFor a few months now, it has been clear to investors that the ECB must leave its expansive course. This expectation has intensified for investors over the past few weeks.\u201d Here\u2019s a handy chart, showing how German imports and exports have both accelerated this year. It also backs up Claus Vistesen\u2019s point about how imports have actually grown faster than exports since the start of the year. Today\u2019s trade figures are the latest in a series of strong German data. Last Thursday, we learned that factory orders rose by 1% in May, suggesting that economic growth was solid. Marc Ostwald of ADM Investor Services says: German Trade data proved to be much stronger than expected...echoing the strong foreign orders seen last week, though this will inevitably only serve to exacerbate tensions with the US, and some European countries. The DAX index of leading German companies has jumped by 0.5% this morning, as traders in Frankfurt welcome today\u2019s trade figures. Exporters such as industrial group Thyssenkrupp, carmaker BMW and tire producer Continental are all among the top risers. Other European markets are also up in early trading: Claus Vistesen of Pantheon Economics argues that the media are obsessing with Germany\u2019s trade surplus. He points out that imports have actually risen faster than exports in recent months - perhaps a sign that German consumption is picking up. Mike van Dulken of Accendo Markets is impressed by today\u2019s trade report Thomas Gitzel, VP Bank economist, says Germany is benefitted from a pick-up in global demand. \u201cThe global economy is improving, which has a positive impact on the German export economy.\u201d Gitzel also expects fresh criticism from the White House, which has accused Germany of exploiting an unfairly weak currency. \u201cThe trade balance is currently swelling, which will again lead to suspicions on the other side of the Atlantic. U.S. President Donald Trump will therefore continue his vehement criticism of the high German trade surplus.\u201d Mehreen Khan of the Financial Times agrees that Germany\u2019s \u20ac22bn trade surplus, and its \u20ac17.3bn current account surplus, will rile the US government: The size of Germany\u2019s twin surpluses has come in for criticism from the Trump administration, which has accused Berlin of exploiting an undervalued currency. The likes of the EU and the International Monetary Fund have also urged the German government to make the most of its healthy public finances and spend more money in the domestic economy. Germany ran a small deficit on services, of \u20ac2bn, during May. However, this was more than covered by the surplus of goods flowing from German factories to other countries. Destatis says that Germany\u2019s current account surplus remained buoyant: According to provisional results of the Deutsche Bundesbank, the current account of the balance of payments showed a surplus of \u20ac17.3bn in May 2017, which takes into account the balances of trade in goods including supplementary trade items (+\u20ac24.4bn), services (\u2013\u20ac2.0bn), primary income (\u2013\u20ac3.6bn) and secondary income (\u2013\u20ac1.5bn). In May 2016, the German current account recorded a surplus of 17.9 billion euros. Today\u2019s report shows that Germany ran a trade surplus with its fellow European Union states, and also with the rest of the world. Here are the details: EU: German exported \u20ac64.2bn of goods, and imported \u20ac57.8bn The eurozone: German exported \u20ac40.8bn of goods, and imported \u20ac39.1bn Non-EU members: Germany exported \u20ac23.5bn, and imported \u20ac18.7bn Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Germany has got the new week up and running by smashing City expectations for its trade figures. German exports jumped by 1.4% month-on-month in May, outstripping a 1.2% rise in imports. It\u2019s the fifth monthly rise in exports in a row, meaning Germany achieved a seasonally adjusted foreign trade balance of \u20ac20.3bn. Both figures were stronger than expected; a Reuters poll had predicted exports would rise by just 0.3%, and imports by 0.5%. On an annual basis, the figures are even more impressive. Germany exported \u20ac110.6bn worth of goods in May, a surge of 14.1% year-on year. Imports swelled by 16.2% to \u20ac88.6bn. That drove the German trade surplus up to \u20ac22.0bn in May 2017, up from \u20ac20.7bn in May 2016. In contrast, Britain posted a trade deficit of \u00a33.1bn during the month. The figures highlight that Europe\u2019s largest economy remains in rude health, and well placed to handle Brexit-related disruption. Over the weekend, German industry bodies warned that they wouldn\u2019t help Britain get a good exit deal But they will also intensify criticism that Germany\u2019s export muscle is destabilising the eurozone, effectively forcing its neighbours to run trade deficits Last week, the International Monetary Fund urged Berlin to cut its current account surplus by boosting investment spending, which would also suck more imports into Germany and tackle the trade surplus. I\u2019ll pull together some reaction shortly... Also coming up today European financial markets are expected to rise at the start of the week. Traders are in upbeat mood, after last Friday\u2019s strong US jobs figures. However, UK construction and services support firm Carillion has surprise the City with a profits warning, so that might dent the mood a little (more on that shortly too...) We get a new gauge on investor confidence across the eurozone, from German market research firm Sentix, plus a new Greek inflation report. And eurozone finance ministers will be holding a eurogroup meeting in Brussels. They\u2019ll be discussing eurozone banking, national insolvency rules, Ireland\u2019s post-bailout future, and the euro area fiscal stance for 2018 .

                "bodyText":"With this, we are closing the blog for today. Good-bye and thank you for all your great comments. We\u2019ll be back tomorrow. Wall Street has got off to flying start: US stocks have risen to fresh record highs boosted by a flurry of strong company results. The Dow Jones industrial average rose nearly 70 points, or 0.4%, to 21778.96 while the S&amp;P 500 advanced nearly 4 points, or 0.15%, to 2481.73. and the Nasdaq climbed 33 points, or 0.5%, to 6455.67. Here in London, the FTSE 100 index is still in negative territory, down nearly 13 points at 7439.65, a 0.2% drop. Investors are breathing a sigh of relief after US durable goods data showed a better than expected 6.5% gain in orders in June, says Dennis de Jong, managing director at online broker UFX.com. A downbeat assessment on current inflation levels at yesterday\u2019s Fed Reserve meeting had cast further uncertainty over the next interest rate, although today\u2019s numbers suggest the US economy remains in good health.\u201d The greenback could claw back some of yesterday\u2019s losses against major European counterparts. Attention now turns to tomorrow\u2019s all-important GDP data. The US economy must continue to meet expectations if Janet Yellen is to confirm an interest rate hike in September. Phillip Hammond has found a new Bank of England deputy governor to replace the disgraced Charlotte Hogg from within his own Treasury ranks. The chancellor has appointed the Treasury\u2019s chief economic adviser, Sir David Ramsden to replace Hogg, who resigned earlier this year after failing to disclose that her brother was a senior executive at Barclays \u2013 a bank she would have regulated. Ramsden\u2019s full title will be deputy governor of markets and banking. Hogg was also chief operating officer, but that post is going to someone else. The Bank of England will make a separate announcement about that post later today. Ramsden has a long list of responsibilities in his new role, the Treasury said, including : specific responsibility for managing the balance sheet, the government\u2019s foreign exchange reserves, and the gathering of market intelligence relevant to policy decisions. Sir Dave, as he is known, will also be a member of the monetary policy committee, the financial policy committee, the prudential regulation committee and the court of the Bank of England. The world\u2019s oil consumption could peak as early as the late 2020s as electric cars become more popular, says Royal Dutch Shell boss Ben van Beurden. But he added that oil would still be needed for several more decades, arguing that it will remain the main fuel used in planes, ships and heavy trucks. He told reporters after Shell, Europe\u2019s biggest oil company reported a sharp rise in quarterly profits: Even if the UK, France and the western world in general will all go to 100% electric vehicles, that would be great, but that wouldn\u2019t be enough... We still have less advanced economies that cannot do that switch. He even admitted that he would get an electric car the next time he buys a new vehicle, in an interview with Bloomberg. The International Energy Agency, the energy watchdog, does not expect oil demand to peak before 2040. Shell, which has been producing oil since 1907, and its rivals are increasingly switching to less-polluting natural gas. France has decided to nationalise the STX France shipyard, marking president Emmanuel Macron\u2019s first major industrial policy decision, Reuters is reporting, citing Le Monde. The French government has been in an ownership standoff with Italy over the shipyard in Saint-Nazaire, north-western France. Reuters says: As France\u2019s most pro-business leader in decades, few would have predicted the former investment banker\u2019s first big move in the corporate sector to be a nationalisation. However, his action fits with the interventionist style of other postwar French leaders. It also crosses into the strategically sensitive defence sector where many national governments prefer to wield influence over ownership. The Economy Ministry would not comment on the report when asked by Reuters, but said it would hold a news conference on the subject at 3:00 pm (1300 GMT). Economy Minister Bruno Le Maire had given the Italians until Thursday to accept an offer for 50/50 ownership of the shipyard, brandishing the threat of a temporary nationalisation to buy time to find another solution if the offer were rebuffed. \u201cThe aim is not to nationalise Saint-Nazaire, but we have to temporarily.\u201d The warm summer weather added a sizzle to Britain\u2019s high streets this month: retail sales growth hit a three-month high as shoppers updated their summer wardrobes and bought more groceries, according to a monthly survey from the CBI employers\u2019 group. Its retail sales balance rose to 22 in July from 12 in June, marking the highest reading since April. Expectations for next month were the strongest since last December, but the CBI warned it might not last. Anna Leach, head of economic intelligence at the CBI, said: While retailers expect a similar pace of growth next month, the factors underpinning their sales growth are more shaky. Although employment is strong, real incomes are falling in the wake of higher inflation, and that\u2019s expected to feed slower consumer spending growth ahead.\u201d Time for a quick market round-up. The FTSE 100 index has slipped into negative territory, trading down some 2 points at 7450.24. AstraZeneca\u2019s woes are weighing on the index, as is the stronger pound, which is rising against the dollar after a more cautious statement from the US Federal Reserve last night suggested the next interest rate hike may be some way off, and sent the greenback sliding. Sterling has risen as high as $1.3157, its highest level since mid-September \u2013 good news for holidaymakers heading to the US. It has eased back to $1.3141, but is still about 1% higher than before the Fed statement. However, the euro has also rallied against the dollar and sterling is still close to eight-week lows on expectations that the European Central Bank will tighten policy later this year. It is trading at 89.21 pence per euro. AstraZeneca is the biggest faller with a 16.1% loss to \u00a342.87 after news of a key lung cancer drug trial failure, and the stock is on track for its worst day ever. Lloyds Banking Group is also among the biggest losers after reporting another \u00a31bn charge for PPI claims. Its shares are down 2.3% at 67.49p. Drinks giant Diageo is the biggest riser, with the shares up 6.5% at \u00a324.20. The maker of Johnnie Walker and Smirnoff raised its profitability target and unveiled a share buyback programme. Sky has also reported results this morning. Our media correspondent Mark Sweney reports: Sky is to hire 300 new technology staff to keep pace with rivals such as Netflix and Amazon as the broadcaster suffered a drop in full year profits and an increase in the rate of customers defecting to rivals. Here is our full story on Lloyds. AstraZeneca boss Pascal Soriot is fielding numerous questions about whether he\u2019s leaving to join Israel\u2019s Teva. With a sigh, he said The head of Britain\u2019s financial markets watchdog just said that the UK will scrap the scandal-hit Libor interest rate benchmark from the end of 2021, when a substitute index should be in place. Libor is based on banks\u2019 submissions of interest rates they believe they would be charged for borrowing money. Andrew Bailey, chief executive of the Financial Conduct Authority, said in a speech in London that work must \u201cbegin in earnest\u201d on shifting to an alternative index, saying that aiming for the end of 2021 would ensure a smooth transition. AstraZeneca boss Pascal Soriot is speaking on a conference call to journalists after the failure of a key lung cancer drug trial sent the company\u2019s shares down more than 15%, to \u00a343.24. The stock is heading for its worst day ever. Soriot, whilst saying that the company never comments on market speculation and rumours, has tried to squash the speculation triggered by a recent media report that he could jump ship and defect to Israel\u2019s Teva, the world\u2019s biggest generics drugmaker. He said: I\u2019m impressed with the progress we\u2019ve made. I\u2019m proud to be the CEO of this company and I\u2019m looking forward to continuing on our journey ahead... I\u2019m committed to delivering our strategy of returning to growth. Travel company Thomas Cook as announced that it will start selling holidays in Tunisia again soon, after the UK changed its travel advice yesterday. Chief executive Peter Fankhauser told journalists: The foreign office came to the conclusion that it is again safe to travel. We didn\u2019t have any programme for the winter so we are setting up a really good quality offer for Tunisia and this is going to take some time. I suppose that we are gong to start during the winter season, but more towards the spring. The Walkie Talkie skyscraper in the City has been sold to a Hong Kong oyster sauce maker for \u00a31.28bn in a record-breaking deal. Land Securities has sold the building at 20 Fenchurch Street to Hong Kong-based Lee Kum Kee, a sauces company that specialises in oyster-flavoured sauce. It is the latest trophy building in London to be acquired by Asian investors, and marks the biggest sale ever of an office building in the UK. Guardian Business has launched a daily email.

Shares in AstraZeneca have crashed more than 16%, after the drugmaker suffered a major setback with the failure of an key lung cancer trial. The shares plunged as low as \u00a342.71, wiping about \u00a310bn off the company\u2019s market value. The long-awaited initial results from the Mystic study found that a combination of two injectable immunotherapy drugs, durvalumab and tremelimumab, failed to help patients. Chief medical officer Sean Bohen described the results as \u201cdisappointing\u201d but said the trial would continue to assess overall survival. The news came as Britain\u2019s second-biggest pharmaceuticals firm reported an 8% fall in revenues in the second quarter to $5.05bn at constant currencies, while core earnings per share rose 6% to 87 cents. Let\u2019s have a look at the company results. Lloyds Banking Group Lloyds has set aside another \u00a3700m to meet PPI claims, taking the PPI charge in its first half to \u00a31bn.

Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. The pound has hit $1.3146, its highest level since last September against the dollar, after last night\u2019s US Federal Reserve statement. The dollar is sliding after the Fed adopted a more cautious tone on the inflation outlook \u2013 boosting expectations that the next interest rate hike may be delayed until next year. The Fed kept rates unchanged last night and said it expected to start paring back its huge bond holdings \u201crelatively soon\u201d \u2013 cementing expectations this will start in September. But while it expects the economy to keep strengthening, it noted that inflation had declined. The Fed statement sent the dollar to 13-month lows against a basket of major currencies. The euro hit $1.1777, its highest level since early 2015. There is a raft of company results today, while the economic agenda is light. In Germany, consumer confidence reached a 16-year high, according to the GfK market research group. Its indicator rose to 10.8 going into August from 10.6 in July.

It grew by 0.3% in the second quarter of this year, with the film industry a rare bright spot, following 0.2% growth in the first quarter. Earlier this week, the International Monetary Fund downgraded its growth forecast for the UK to 1.7% this year, while upgrading the four biggest eurozone economies - Germany, France, Italy and Spain.

                "bodyText":"BT\u2019s profits fell more than 40% in the first quarter of its new financial year after it was forced to pay out \u00a3225m to two shareholders following the accounting scandal at its Italian operation. Deutsche Telekom and Orange became shareholders in BT after the company struck a \u00a312.5bn cash and shares deal to buy mobile company EE in 2015. As part of that deal the two companies were issued a warranty as a protection against a slump in BT\u2019s performance. BT\u2019s stock market value dropped by almost \u00a38bn in January after the company revealed the full extent of a \u00a3530m accounting scandal at its Italian operation. BT\u2019s share price remains more than 20% lower than it was a year ago. BT said the \u00a3225m payout represented a \u201cfull and final settlement in respect of these issues\u201d. The company\u2019s share price fell by more than 4% in early trading on Friday as investors digested the latest bad news to hit the company. Gavin Patterson, the BT chief executive, said DT and Orange \u201conly very recently\u201d raised the issue of a payment ahead of a deadline to make a claim at the end of the day on Friday. He said the settlement was better than facing a longer legal process that would have been triggered if an official claim was lodged. He added that there were still a \u201csmall number\u201d of class action suits related to the accounting scandal lodged by investors in the US. \u201cWe think we have a strong case to defend but I can\u2019t comment on those,\u201d he said. The ongoing fallout of the Italian accounting scandal has resulted in Patterson\u2019s pay for last year being slashed by \u00a34m, and prompted a restructure with the axing of 4,000 jobs, about half in the UK. The charge hurt BT\u2019s financial performance badly, with pre-tax profits slumping 42% from \u00a3717m to \u00a3418m in the three months to the end of June. Stripping out the impact of the one-off \u00a3225m payment, BT\u2019s adjusted profits still fell by 2% to \u00a31.78bn in its first quarter. The company attributed this to increased pension costs, programme rights and investing in bringing all of its call centre operations back to the UK. In March, BT paid \u00a31.18bn for Champions League football rights, 32% more than the previous deal, to fend off Sky. The rising cost of sports rights has also affected Sky, which on Thursday said a one-off \u00a3629m step-up in Premier League rights costs drove a 14% drop in profits at its UK and Ireland operation. \u201cThe days of rampant [rights cost] inflation I think are behind us,\u201d said Patterson. \u201cI think we are getting to a point where rights fees will increasingly be challenged in terms of inflation. We are prepared to walk away if the price is too high.\u201d Upcoming sports rights auctions include the Football League, which is expected to be a high-stakes bidding war with Sky, and ATP World Tour Tennis. BT added just 8,000 new TV customers, following an equally anaemic 11,000 in the first quarter of the year \u2013 close to a record low. Patterson said overall BT delivered an \u201cencouraging performance\u201d in its first quarter, with total revenues up 1% to \u00a35.8bn. BT pointed to a healthy 9% increase in broadband and TV revenue, fuelled by price rises, and a 4% rise at EE to \u00a31.3bn. The company also announced a further restructure that will see its BT Consumer division, home to its TV service and broadband operation, merged with mobile business EE. As a result the BT Consumer chief executive John Petter, a 13-year BT veteran, is to leave the company. Marc Allera, the chief executive of EE, will take control of the enlarged division. Patterson indicated that the merger was likely to lead to job cuts beyond what the company announced in May.",

                "bodyText":"After a flurry of growth reports today, it\u2019s becoming clear that Britain\u2019s economy has underperformed its rivals in the last quarter. Two days ago, we learned that the UK expanded by merely 0.3% in April-June, following a modest expansion of 0.2% in January-March. Today\u2019s data has shown that other advanced countries did rather better. Namely: France: Grew by 0.5% in Q1 and Q2 US: Grew by over 0.6% in Q2, and 0.3% in Q1 Spain: Grew by 0.9% in Q2, and 0.8% in Q1 Sweden: Grew by a rollicking 1.7% in Q2, and 0.6% in Q1 Ireland is likely to post impressive GDP figures, following the growth upgrades from its central bank today (details here). Canada is also enjoying a good quarter, judging by the surge in growth during June (details here). Many of today\u2019s GDP reports showed that trade made a positive contribution to growth in the last quarter; that\u2019s a good sign for the global economy. Britain, though, is being held back by rising inflation and concerns over Brexit. Markus Kuger, senior economist at business services firm Dun &amp; Bradstreet, says Britain is lagging behind other leading economies. While growth in Q2 has recovered somewhat from its anaemic performance in the first three months of the year, there is still a high level of political and economic uncertainty. Based on our data and analysis, we are maintaining our \u2018deteriorating\u2019 risk outlook for the UK until there is more clarity on how Brexit and the fallout from the general election will impact businesses operating in the UK market. \u201cOur advice to businesses is to continue to monitor economic indicators and how Brexit negotiations develop over the coming months. Furthermore, we are maintaining our baseline scenario of a gradually slowing economy over the next two years. Leaving the EU will undoubtedly pose challenges, especially for companies whose supply chains involve sourcing from or selling to the continent. Although the weak pound is currently providing support for some sectors, such as manufacturing and tourism, it is far from certain that this stimulus will be enough to counterbalance the adverse Brexit effects over the medium to long term.\u201d Sky News\u2019s political editor, Faisal Islam, reckons this slowdown is forcing the UK government to adjust its Brexit strategy: And on that note, it\u2019s time to stop for the day. Thanks for reading and commenting, and I hope you have a great weekend. GW European stock markets have closed in the red tonight. The FTSE 100 shed 74 points, or 1%, partly due to the slump in tobacco shares. The French and German markets also suffered losses, amid worries that the strong euro will hurt profits. David Madden of CMC Markets says: Investors in the UK market have a high threshold for being impressed by company earnings, but they are quick to punish you if the result doesn\u2019t measure up. It is almost like dealers are looking for excuses not to go long the FTSE 100. Stock markets in Continental Europe have been losing ground since between May and June, and indices like the DAX and CAC 40 can\u2019t seem to shake off the bearish sentiment surrounding them. The strength of the euro is hindering eurozone equity benchmarks, and the market chatter that the European Central Bank will rein in their very aggressive bond buying scheme is also adding to their problems. Wall Street is also down, hit by the healthcare vote debacle - and not helped by reports that North Korea has fired a missile which landed in Japanese waters. Looking back at GDP, Canada has blown past expectations by reporting 0.6% growth in May alone. That suggests its growth during the second quarter will be strong. Back in the markets, shares into tobacco companies are tumbling after US authorities announced a new clampdown on the industry. The Food and Drug Administration is planning to curb the number of deaths caused by tobacco. One of the ideas is to cut the amount of nicotine in combustible cigarettes to \u201cnon-addictive levels\u201d. The FDA\u2019s goal is to save millions of lives, says FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb: \u201cThe overwhelming amount of death and disease attributable to tobacco is caused by addiction to cigarettes \u2013 the only legal consumer product that, when used as intended, will kill half of all long-term users. \u201cUnless we change course, 5.6 million young people alive today will die prematurely later in life from tobacco use.\u201d City investors reacted swiftly to the plan, driving British American Tobacco\u2019s shares down by over 10% (it makes Dunhill, Kent, Lucky Strike, Pall Mall and Rothmans). Other major tobacco firms, including Imperial Brands and Philip Morris, are also sliding -- a sign that the FDA\u2019s plan could have a profound effect on their businesses. Back in Greece, Hollywood A-listers are giving the economy\u2019s tourist sector a boost. A steady stream of celebrities are cropping up among the record 30 million choosing the country for holidays this summer. After Australian star Hugh Jakeman spending time on the Cycladic isle of Antiparos (where Tom Hanks regularly summers and has a home), Angelina Jolie and Keanu Reeves have followed suite holidaying this week on the Ionian island of Paxos. Jolie had promised to return to Greece when in her role as ambassador of the UN refugee agency she met prime minister Alexis Tsipras in Athens last year. The record number of tourists are expected to help the debt-stricken country\u2019s growth prospects following its return to markets on Monday. But .....with visitor numbers growing the economic crime police have also been swooping on islands in a bid to crack down on tax evasion by stores and restaurants. Greece\u2019s independent public revenues body has announced it will undertake an urgent audit of a sample 2.500 hotels country-wide amid widespread speculation that, at the height of the tourist season, they are not declaring all overnight stays. Auditors have been ordered to cross-check declared income with tax remittances filed to the state. Restaurants are also thought to be in the firing line as the leftist-led government seeks to crack down on big time tax evaders. Well-known eateries on popular isles such as Mykonos and Paros are said to earn as much as one million euros a month which they fail to declare. At least some of the revenue, from catering for weddings and other socialite events, is never seen in Greece as it is deposited straight into UK bank accounts.... Oxford Economic\u2019s Gregory Daco has tweeted some useful charts, showing how America\u2019s growth rate picked up in the last quarter.... ...and how consumer spending and exports helped drive the recovery. Associated Press have a good take on today\u2019s US growth report. Here\u2019s a flavour: The U.S. economy revved up this spring after a weak start to the year, fuelled by a surge in consumer spending. But the growth spurt still fell short of the optimistic goals President Donald Trump hopes to achieve through tax cuts and regulatory relief. The Commerce Department said Friday that growth in the gross domestic product, the economy\u2019s total output of goods and services, expanded at a 2.6 percent annual rate in the April-June quarter. That\u2019s more than double the revised 1.2 percent pace in the first quarter. The improvement was powered in large part by robust consumer appetite for items such as clothing and furniture. The 2.6% GDP gain came in close to economists\u2019 expectations. \u201cConsumers continue to drive the economy\u2019s growth, but firmer business investment is also a plus,\u201d said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody\u2019s Analytics. \u201cWeaker housing construction was the only significant drag on growth in the quarter.\u201d Trump campaigned on a pledge to boost growth to rates of 4% or better. So far, his economic program has not advanced in Congress. More here: Another detail from today\u2019s growth report: Despite accelerating in the last quarter, America\u2019s economy isn\u2019t (yet) achieving the growth rates targeted by Donald Trump. Nancy Curtin, chief investment officer at Close Brothers Asset Management, explains: \u201cThe US economy has improved following a slow start to the year, in spite of a lack of fiscal stimulus so far from Trump\u2019s presidency. A strong performance in export and industrial sectors has been buoyed by weaker dollar, and we\u2019ve seen a steady increase in earnings too. We\u2019re still some way from the President\u2019s 3%+ growth target, but the good news is this wasn\u2019t priced in by the market, so any additional tax relief or infrastructure spending could support markets into year end. \u201cDespite improving growth, wage inflation remains somewhat elusive, but the labour market remains reasonably strong, and we anticipate the Fed will proceed as planned with its slow and steady programme of interest rate normalisation.\u201d John Ross of the Renmin University of China shows how growth is close to its long-term average: Andrew Hunter of Capital Economics says America\u2019s economy is benefitting from consumer spending and business investment: The 2.6% annualised gain in real GDP in the second quarter was driven by a rebound in real consumption growth, and suggests that GDP is still on track for growth of around 2.2% for 2017 as a whole. This should convince the Fed that, despite the recent weakness of core inflation, the real economy remains in good shape. Real consumption increased by 2.8% annualised, up from 1.9% in the first quarter. Furthermore, business investment posted a healthy 5.2% annualised gain, although residential investment declined by nearly 7%. The weakness in the latter is unlikely to last. Meanwhile, after subtracting a massive 1.5% points from growth in the first quarter, inventories were a negligible drag in the second. The annual revisions didn\u2019t change much, with growth in the previous two quarters revised down slightly, and growth for 2016 as a whole nudged down to 1.5%, from 1.6%. Heather Long of the Washington Post says the acceleration in US growth in the last quarter isn\u2019t exceptional. She points out that America\u2019s economy usually accelerates in April-June.... Jason Furman, one of President Obama\u2019s economy advisors, says the economy has grown at its trend level this year. Patrick Chovanec of Silvercrest Asset Management is encouraged the businesses kept investing. US companies helped the American economy grow in the last quarter, according to today\u2019s GDP report. Business spending on equipment rose by 8.2% in the last three months, the fastest since the third quarter of 2015. Spending on mining exploration, wells and shafts more than doubled, while investment on nonresidential structures increased at a 4.9% pace. Trade added 0.18 percentage point to growth, but investment on homebuilding shrank by 6.8%. Breaking: The US economy grew at an annualised rate of 2.6% in the second quarter of 2017, more than twice as fast as in Q1. That\u2019s the equivalent of 0.65% quarter-on-quarter growth; double Britain\u2019s 0.3% growth rate,and quicker than France\u2019s 0.5% growth too. American GDP was driven by consumer spending, which grew by 2.8%. Net trade also contributed to growth, with exports up 4.1% and imports up only 2.1%. This is a significant acceleration compared to the first quarter, where growth has been revised down to 1.2% annualised growth (or 0.3% quarter-on-quarter). But it\u2019s very slightly below the consensus forecast, of 2.7% annualise growth. More to follow.... It\u2019s nearly time for the biggest event of the day - the first estimate of US GDP in the second quarter of the year. Wall Street\u2019s finest minds agree that the growth rate probably rebounded after slowing in Q1, although they don\u2019t agree by how much.... These figures are all annualised, so divide by four to get the true quarterly growth rate.... The figures land at 1.30pm BST, or 8.30am in Washington.... The Economist Intelligence Unit have hailed Sweden\u2019s eye-catchingly fast growth: Economic issues are also on the agenda in Greece today, where prime minister Alexis Tsipras has been hailing its return to growth earlier this year. Helena Smith our correspondent in Athens, reports: Addressing the second in a series of regional growth conferences in the central town of Lamia, the leftist leader declared that economic recovery was now the equivalent of thrice-bailed out Greece regaining its national sovereignty. He told an audience of local business leaders, politicians and regional officials that: \u201cThe goal of growth is connected to the very existence of our nation, our national sovereignty, the prosperity of our people, our children.\u201d Tsipras said that Greece is finally heading out of seven long dark years, after returning to the financial markets on Monday with its first bond sale since 2014. The government hopes to repeat that test run soon, as it prepared to exit its current \u20ac86bn bailout programme in August 2018. The prime minister had made a similar pledge in an exclusive interview with the Guardian on Monday in which he described Greece\u2019s regaining of economic sovereignty as a \u201cpriority.\u201d There\u2019s another reason why stock markets are edgy today \u2013 Amazon. The e-commerce giant missed earnings forecasts last night, sending its shares down 3% in after-hours trading. Although Amazon\u2019s sales beat expectations, profits were lower than expected as the company spent more on infrastructure like warehouses and data centres. It\u2019s a reminder that Amazon\u2019s strong growth, and its habit of expanding into ever-new areas, comes at a price.... This meant that Amazon founder Jeff Bezos lost the crown of being the world\u2019s richest man, just a few hours after wrestling it from Bill Gates. I suspect his time will come again... Ireland\u2019s central bank has hiked its growth forecasts for this year, but warned that Brexit is a significant threat. The Central Bank of Ireland now expects GDP to surge by 4.5% this year, up from the 3.5% it expected back in April. It also raised its 2018 growth forecasts to 3.6%, from 3.2%. Central Bank Chief Economist Gabriel Fagan explained that Ireland is benefitting from Europe\u2019s recovery: \u201cRevised projections for growth this year and in 2018 reflect both stronger momentum in the domestic economy and improved prospects for external demand, especially from our European trading partners,\u201d But..... \u201cAs a small and open economy, Ireland continues to face economic risks externally. And despite there being little new information emerging to date, it is clear that the economic impact of Brexit on Ireland is set to be negative and material. At home, we must continue to prudently monitor the risk of overheating.\u201d The full economic impact depends on exactly what form of Brexit Britain ends up with. If it exits the customs union and the single market, then robust border controls would probably be reinstalled between Northern Ireland and the Republic. However, there are reports today that Dublin is pushing for border controls to be shifted to the coastline. That idea has already been attacked by Northern Ireland\u2019s unionist politicians - including the DUP, who are propping up the UK government in Westminster... European stock markets have responded to today\u2019s solid growth reports by, er, falling to their lowest level in three months. France\u2019s CAC is the worst performer, down 1.4%, with Germany and the UK not too far behind. This is partly due to the strength of the euro, which has rallied to a 2.5 year high this week. Traders are also nervous after watching the US Senate shoot down Donald Trump\u2019s latest attack on Obamacare. Mike van Dulken of Accendo Market explains: \u201cEquities are in the red mid-morning, sentiment dented by fresh dollar weakness as even a \u2018skinny\u2019 US healthcare repeal bill fails in the Senate, delivering more unwelcome pound and euro strength. Breaking! Economic confidence across the eurozone has inched up to its highest level in a decade. It\u2019s the latest in a stream of upbeat data, which underline how Europe is putting its debt crisis behind it. The European Commission\u2019s economic sentiment index, just released, has hit 111.2 for July, up from 111.1 in June. That\u2019s the highest level since the financial crisis began a decade ago. Construction firms and service sector companies reported the biggest improvement in sentiment, while consumer confidence dipped. Dennis de Jong, managing director at UFX.com, says: \u201cWhile the UK wrestles with its lowest levels of consumer confidence since the Brexit vote, things are far rosier on the continent. The latest reading suggests that spending is at healthy levels in the eurozone despite the heightened political and economic uncertainty. \u201cWith the first quarter of the year proving to be a challenge for the eurozone following UK and French general elections, spirits haven\u2019t been dampened in the aftermath and consumers refuse to be unfazed by tricky economic conditions. \u201cWith steady employment figures continuing to have a positive bearing on consumer confidence and showing no signs of letting up, Michel Barnier will feel he holds the chips while looking across the table at David Davis, as Brexit talks rumble on.\u201d Today\u2019s eurozone growth figures have helped to push the euro a little higher against the US dollar. The euro is back over $1.17 this morning, a gain of 0.2%. The dollar, though, is also suffering from Donald Trump\u2019s latest failure to dismantle Obamacare. After a dramatic late-night vote, the so-called \u201cskinny repeal\u2019 bill was rejected by the Senate, by 51 votes to 49. Crucially, veteran lawmaker John McCain was one of three Republicans to vote against the measure, which would have left millions more Americans without healthcare cover. This makes it even less likely that Trump can achieve a major infrastructure spending programme, or tax reforms (cuts). Kit Juckes of Societe General explains: The man of the moment this morning is John McCain who voted no and so the Senate failed to repeal Obamacare by a single vote. Another hurdle for President Trump\u2019s healthcare reform, another hurdle backing the funds for tax reform, another hurdle in the way of higher Treasury yields and a so nothing good for the dollar in that announcement. Update: Although McCain\u2019s vote was both dramatic and decisive, Republican senators Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski have led the battle against Trump\u2019s healthcare plans. More here: Silvia Walter of Swiss Life Asset Managers is impressed by Spain\u2019s recovery: Sweden\u2019s growth rate is \u201ccrazy strong\u201d, says Torbj\u00f6rn Isaksson of Nordea Markets. He reckons the Swedish economy continues to perform very well, mainly due to strong domestic demand. Isaksson adds: GDP rose by a full 1.7% q/q and as much as 4.0% y/y. Our call was 1.1% q/q while the Riksbank\u2019s forecast was 0.7% q/q. Moreover, the first quarter was revised upwards by 0.2% points to 0.6% q/q. The main surprises are fixed investments and inventories. Residential construction continues to be a very important growth driver (scary!), but also other investments seem to have picked up and more than forecast. Inventories weighed on growth but much less than we had in mind. Wowzers! Sweden\u2019s economy grew by a blistering 1.7% in the last quarter. That smashes analyst forecasts of 1% growth, and means Sweden\u2019s economy has expanded by an impressive 4% over the last year. Sweden appears to be benefitting from its current loose monetary policy - interest rates are negative, to encourage banks to lend..... Austria\u2019s economy grew by 0.8% in the last quarter, thanks to a boost in trade. New figures show that exports jumped by 2.4% in April to June, up from 2.0% in January to March. Spain\u2019s economy has finally reached its pre-crisis peak, thanks to the 0.9% growth recorded in the last quarter. That\u2019s an important moment, but it has come at a cost. As El Pais points out, Spain still employs 1.9 million fewer people than in 2008. Newsflash: Spain has recorded another strong quarter of growth, beating both the UK and France. Spanish GDP rose by 0.9% in the last three months, new figures from statistics body INE show. That\u2019s three times as fast Britain managed during the quarter, and nearly double France\u2019s growth rate. That\u2019s up from 0.8% in the first quarter of 2017, and means Spain\u2019s economy has now grown for 15 quarters in a row (or nearly four years). On an annual basis, Spanish GDP grew by 3.1%. More to follow.... Ouch. Shares in BT have fallen by 1.7% at the start of trading after posting a 40% drop in profits. My colleague Mark Sweney explains why.... BT\u2019s profits slumped more than 40% in the first quarter of its new financial year after it was forced to pay out \u00a3225m to two shareholders following the accounting scandal at its Italian operation. Deutsche Telekom and Orange became shareholders in BT after the company struck a \u00a312.5bn cash and shares deal to buy mobile company EE in 2015. As part of that deal the two companies were issued a warranty as a protection against a slump in BT\u2019s performance. DT and Orange triggered a claim under the warranty after BT\u2019s stock market value plunged by almost \u00a38bn, after the company revealed the extent of a \u00a3530m accounting scandal at its Italian operation. BT\u2019s share price remains more than 20% lower that it was a year ago. The news that France\u2019s economy grew by a healthy 0.5% last quarter should reassure investors, says Naeem Aslam of Think Markets: Over in Europe, the French GDP data brought more light for the Eurozone\u2019s economy. The problem child of the Eurozone is no longer a problem child, in fact, it has grown up and living up to the expectations. Bloomberg journalist Mark Deen reckons the French economy has entered a purple patch: Over in the City, Barclays has told shareholders its setting aside another \u00a3700m to cover the cost of the PPI scandal (in which customers were sold insurance they didn\u2019t need, or ask for). Barclays has also posted a net loss of \u00a31.2bn for the last six months, having losing \u00a32.2bn through the sale of its Africa business. More on that shortly.... Diego Iscaro, senior principal economist at IHS Global Insight, thinks France\u2019s economy is in decent shape. Here\u2019s his take on today\u2019s GDP figures: France\u2019s GDP rose by 0.5% q/q during the second quarter of 2017, according to seasonally-adjusted figures released by the INSEE. The economy had grown by the same magnitude during the first three months of the year. Net foreign trade was the main driver of growth during the second quarter, adding 0.8 percentage point to the total change in demand, as exports rebounded strongly. Domestic demand, excluding stocks, also made a positive contribution. Internal demand was boosted by a new increase in investment spending (although it decelerated compared to the first quarter) and a modest acceleration in private consumption. The figures show France\u2019s economy posting solid growth during the second quarter and support our view that GDP is likely to grow by around 1.6% in 2017. This would be the strongest performance in six years. We expect growth to remain healthy during the second half of the year, boosted by gradually improving labour market situation, muted inflation and solid external demand. Confidence indices suggest that firms and households are also more upbeat about the economic outlook, which should also help to support domestic demand. Investment spending should also be supported by favourable credit conditions and improving demand levels during the second half of 2017. The French economic recovery seems to be well stablished, but there are still risks on the horizon. Although hopes for the implementation of reforms \u2013 particularly on the fiscal and labour market fronts \u2013 are high, the risk of the government not delivering as expected is not negligible, despite its large majority in the National Assembly. Today\u2019s growth figures should cheer France\u2019s new leader, says Mehreen Khan of the FT. She writes: The official figures will be a boon for president Macron who has vowed to overhaul the French economy after years of lagging behind its major eurozone rival, Germany. Unemployment in France is now at its lowest since the eurozone crisis, inflation has been tamed, and business surveys are revealing the best confidence levels in a decade. Claus Vistesen of Pantheon Economics agrees that France did well in the last quarter.... Bloomberg\u2019s Fergal O\u2019Brien flags up that France\u2019s economy has now grown for a year. This chart shows how net trade boosted French growth in the last quarter. Breaking: France\u2019s economy grew by 0.5% in the second quarter of 2017. That matches economists\u2019 forecasts, and outpaces Britain\u2019s 0.3% growth in the last three months. It means that France\u2019s economy has now grown steadily for the last year, and by 0.5% per quarter for the last nine months. That\u2019s a pretty solid performance. The French economy was helped by a surge in exports - they rose by 3.1% in April to June, while imports only rose by 0.2%. Consumer spending rose too, to 0.3% from 0.1% in Q1. However, business investment slowed to 0.5% from 2.1% in January to March. On an annual basis, French GDP grew by 1.8% - again, slightly faster than Britain\u2019s 1.7% year-on-year growth. More to follow.... Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. We get two key pieces of economic data this morning - new growth figures from France and America. Together, they\u2019ll help us to see how the global economy performed in the second quarter of this year. Economists expect that both countries grew fairly solidly, with French GDP tipped to rise by 0.5% and America\u2019s by around 0.7% (or 2.7% on an annualised basis). We also find out how Canada\u2019s economy performed in May. Update: Spanish growth figures are also coming this morning. It\u2019s also another busy morning for financial news. Barclays bank, telecoms group BT, airline operator IAG and online estate agent Rightmove are among those reporting results.
