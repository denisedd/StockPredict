Joshua Mahony, market analyst at IG, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p> Indecision has once more reigned for the FTSE today...Much of the FTSE and sterling trade has been centred on this morning\u2019s CPI figures, which certainly gave the BoE some much needed breathing space after months of rising inflation and falling wage growth. Crucially, whilst much of the reduction in headline CPI has been attributed to falling energy prices, it is encouraging to see the core CPI figure also tumble, to 2.4%. Real incomes have been eroded in recent months, with the resulting cut in disposable income expected to hit consumer spending habits.</p> </blockquote> <p>In Europe a stronger euro has sent markets lower, ahead of this week\u2019s European Central Bank meeting. Neil Wilson, senior market analyst at ETX Capital, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The key driver for European stocks appeared to be the currency, with a stronger euro weighing on appetite for equities. The euro/dollar advanced around 0.9% and eased clear of $1.15 to trade at its highest since May 2016 as the euro gained momentum from fresh dollar softness in the wake of the health bill failure.</p> <p>The euro/dollar is now eyeing the May 3 high above $1.16 and, if breached, could start to target the $1.17 handle last seen in August 2015. A lot hinges on some pretty subtle language and shifts in tone by Mario Draghi and the ECB on Thursday. A removal of the easing bias in the policy statement could be enough to push it higher but we must prepare for Mr Draghi to don his dovish cap and talk down the currency lest a stronger euro gets in the way of the ECB\u2019s outlook. </p> </blockquote> <p>The final scores showed:<strong><br></strong></p> <ul> <li><strong> The FTSE 100 finished down 13.91 points or 0.19% at 7390.22<br></strong></li> <li><strong>France\u2019s Cac closed 1.25% lower at 12,430.39</strong></li> <li><strong>Germany\u2019s Dax dropped 1.09% to 5173.27</strong></li> <li><strong>Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB fell 0.59% to 21,358.20</strong></li> <li><strong>Spain\u2019s Ibex ended down 1.19% at 10,524.5</strong></li> <li><strong>In Greece, the Athens market lost 1.17% to 848.07</strong></li> </ul> <p>On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 79 points or 0.37%.</p> <p><em>On that note, it\u2019s time to close for the evening.

A shift in resources toward Spain\u2019s competitive export sector, with the services sector creating most new jobs, has played an important part in the rebound. Banking sector balance sheets are stronger, private sector debt is coming down, and credit availability is improving. As the recovery is maturing, it is time to tackle the remaining vulnerabilities related to elevated public debt and complete the still-ongoing post-crisis banking sector adjustment. At the same time, reducing structural unemployment and fostering productivity growth remain priorities. Without farther determined progress on structural reforms and rebuilding of fiscal buffers, the economy would remain vulnerable to shocks and risk leaving some segments of the population behind. </p> </blockquote> <p>The IMF has raised its economic growth forecast from 2.6% this year to 3.1%, saying:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Real GDP is projected to grow by 3.1 percent this year, and there is upside risk as the momentum created by past reforms may be bigger than estimated.</p> </blockquote> <p>But it added:<br></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>[Challenges} need to be fully addressed to offset the expected slow-down in medium-term growth and to build greater resilience.

                "bodyText":"It was a tale of banks and currencies in the markets, with investors facing losses of varying sizes almost across the board. Disappointing results from Goldman Sachs, as well as Bank of America, pushed the sector lower and undermined the rest of the market. Meanwhile, lower than expected UK inflation figures sent the pound down 0.2% but did little for the FTSE 100, suffering from falls from Barclays and Royal Bank of Scotland. Joshua Mahony, market analyst at IG, said: Indecision has once more reigned for the FTSE today...Much of the FTSE and sterling trade has been centred on this morning\u2019s CPI figures, which certainly gave the BoE some much needed breathing space after months of rising inflation and falling wage growth. Crucially, whilst much of the reduction in headline CPI has been attributed to falling energy prices, it is encouraging to see the core CPI figure also tumble, to 2.4%. Real incomes have been eroded in recent months, with the resulting cut in disposable income expected to hit consumer spending habits. In Europe a stronger euro has sent markets lower, ahead of this week\u2019s European Central Bank meeting. Neil Wilson, senior market analyst at ETX Capital, said: The key driver for European stocks appeared to be the currency, with a stronger euro weighing on appetite for equities. The euro/dollar advanced around 0.9% and eased clear of $1.15 to trade at its highest since May 2016 as the euro gained momentum from fresh dollar softness in the wake of the health bill failure. The euro/dollar is now eyeing the May 3 high above $1.16 and, if breached, could start to target the $1.17 handle last seen in August 2015. A lot hinges on some pretty subtle language and shifts in tone by Mario Draghi and the ECB on Thursday. A removal of the easing bias in the policy statement could be enough to push it higher but we must prepare for Mr Draghi to don his dovish cap and talk down the currency lest a stronger euro gets in the way of the ECB\u2019s outlook. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished down 13.91 points or 0.19% at 7390.22 France\u2019s Cac closed 1.25% lower at 12,430.39 Germany\u2019s Dax dropped 1.09% to 5173.27 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB fell 0.59% to 21,358.20 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended down 1.19% at 10,524.5 In Greece, the Athens market lost 1.17% to 848.07 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 79 points or 0.37%. On that note, it\u2019s time to close for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. After the launch of the \u00a310 in Winchester, where he said nothing about the day\u2019s inflation figures, Bank of England governor Mark Carney has been speaking to Sky about that very subject. He said the figures were consistent with the Bank\u2019s forecast that inflation would overshoot its target for some time, and the big picture remained the same: the fall in the pound pushing up prices. The FTSE 100 has slipped back after the weaker than expected inflation figures, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is down on disappointing results and the latest setback for President Trump, but the real declines are in Europe due to the strength of the euro. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, says: Over in the eurozone the Dax and Cac had a serious currency headache, dropping 1.4% and 1.1% respectively. That\u2019s because the euro\u2019s sterling-gains were joined by a similarly strong performance against the dollar, where it surged 0.9% to a fresh 2 and a half month high, now sitting just shy of $1.16. Back with the US and some more disappointing economic figures, this time from the housing market. The National Association of Home Builders housing index slipped from 66 in June to 64 this month, lower than the expected figure of 67. This is the lowest reading since last November. NAHB chairman Granger MacDonald said: Our members are telling us they are growing increasingly concerned over rising material prices, particularly lumber. This is hurting housing affordability even as consumer interest in the new-home market remains strong. Spain\u2019s economic recovery remains strong but the country still needs structural reforms to cope with any future economic shocks, says the International Monetary Fund, which has also upgraded its growth forecast. In its latest report it said: Spain\u2019s economic recovery remains strong, with consumption, investment, and net exports all contributing to a more balanced growth pattern. A shift in resources toward Spain\u2019s competitive export sector, with the services sector creating most new jobs, has played an important part in the rebound. Banking sector balance sheets are stronger, private sector debt is coming down, and credit availability is improving. As the recovery is maturing, it is time to tackle the remaining vulnerabilities related to elevated public debt and complete the still-ongoing post-crisis banking sector adjustment. At the same time, reducing structural unemployment and fostering productivity growth remain priorities. Without farther determined progress on structural reforms and rebuilding of fiscal buffers, the economy would remain vulnerable to shocks and risk leaving some segments of the population behind. The IMF has raised its economic growth forecast from 2.6% this year to 3.1%, saying: Real GDP is projected to grow by 3.1 percent this year, and there is upside risk as the momentum created by past reforms may be bigger than estimated. But it added: [Challenges} need to be fully addressed to offset the expected slow-down in medium-term growth and to build greater resilience. Public debt and structural unemployment are still high, population aging is creating fiscal pressures, and productivity lags that of EU peers. In addition, Spain\u2019s net debtor position with the rest of the world remains large, and financial sector adjustment and further reforms to strengthen and modernize the institutional arrangements are yet to be fully completed. The latest setback for Donald Trump and his healthcare plans has prompted speculation the President will struggle to get other measures passed - notably tax reform - and unsettled investors. So the Dow Jones Industrial Average has fallen 62 points or 0.29%, while the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq Composite are down similar amounts. Healthcare companies were under pressure while uninspiring results from Bank of America and Goldman Sachs saw their shares slip back. But Netflix has jumped nearly 10% after the streaming service topped 100m subscribers, helped by growth outside the US. Here is our report on the launch, from Steven Morris. And the Bank\u2019s press release and Carney\u2019s comments are here. So far no economic commentary from Bank of England governor Mark Carney, who has been praising Austen and putting the new tenner in the context of the history of banknotes. The unveiling of the \u00a310 note is underway and can be seen live here. Later this afternoon, Bank of England governor Mark Carney is at Winchester Cathedral to launch the new polymer \u00a310 note featuring Jane Austen. Given the day\u2019s inflation figures and the implications for interest rates, it will be interesting to see what, if any, comments he makes on the UK economy. The launch of the plastic fiver last June came not long before the EU referendum, so Carney stuck to the subject of banknotes rather than wider economic issues. The pound is still on the slide after the weaker than expected inflation figures suggested a Bank of England rate rise could be some way off. Against the dollar, sterling is now down 0.3% at $1.3016 and 0.9% lower against the euro at \u20ac1.1265. FXTM research analyst Lukman Otunuga reckons the pound could fall further: The fact that sterling sharply depreciated across the board on Tuesday, after British inflation rates unexpectedly dropped to 2.6% in June, continues to highlight how the currency has become increasingly sensitive to monetary policy speculation. Price action suggests that those who were heavily reliant on the possibility that higher rates would support sterling further were left empty-handed, as deceleration in inflation eroded expectations of a UK rate increase in 2017. Although the Bank of England has adopted a hawkish tone in recent weeks, today\u2019s fall in inflation is likely to ease pressure on the Bank of England taking action, consequently keeping hawks at bay... Investors should keep in mind that the fundamentals behind sterling\u2019s woes remain intact, with sellers potentially exploiting rate hike speculations and dollar weakness to install fresh rounds of selling. From a technical standpoint, a decisive breakdown and daily close below 1.3000 should encourage a further decline towards 1.2850. Time for a recap, for those of just tuning in. UK inflation fell unexpectedly in June for the first time in nine months as lower fuel prices provided some respite for cash-strapped consumers. The consumer prices index fell to 2.6% from a four-year high of 2.9% in May according to the Office for National Statistics. Economists had expected the rate to be unchanged. The fall was mainly driven by lower petrol and diesel prices, reflecting weaker global oil prices. Fuel prices fell by 1.1% between May and June, compared with a 2.2% rise over the same month a year earlier. Lower prices of games and toys also contributed to the fall. However, at 2.6% inflation is still well above the Bank of England\u2019s 2% target, and signalled a sustained fall in real wages as prices rise faster than current pay growth of 2%..... Frances O\u2019Grady, the TUC general secretary, said the government must act to halt the decline in living standards. \u201cThe government must stop this cost of living squeeze. Many working people are caught in a vice as rising prices crush their pay. Ministers claim they are listening to struggling families. But now is the time to prove it. Britain needs a pay rise across the public and private sector.\u201d A spokesperson for the Treasury acknowledged that some households were struggling financially. \u201cWhile it is encouraging that inflation was lower this month, we appreciate that some families are concerned about the cost of living. That\u2019s why we have introduced the national living wage, which is helping to boost earnings by \u00a31,400 a year, and why we\u2019ve cut taxes for millions of people to help them keep more of what they earn. We are also increasing our free childcare offer to help 400,000 working parents.\u201d.... Here\u2019s Angela Monaghan\u2019s news story on the data: Here\u2019s a reminder of the key charts: Economists have warned that families still face a cost of living squeeze. Maike Currie of Fidelity International says: Our pay packets aren\u2019t keeping up with rising prices despite the UK\u2019s unemployment rate reaching its lowest level since 1975. This is tightening the squeeze on UK households, which is bad news for an economy that relies on confident consumers spending on goods and services. Calum Bennie of Scottish Friendly adds: \u201cDespite a drop in the headline rate of inflation, many families will still be facing the same relentless pressure to make ends meet. The cost of food, household goods and furniture all became more expensive in June and with wage growth still flat those at the bottom will continue to turn to credit or rapidly deplete savings just to keep food on the table. Sterling sharply when the data was released. It has subsided further as traders concluded that UK interest rates are now less likely to rise this year. The pound is now trading at $1.3010, a whole cent lower than early this morning. Our economics editor, Larry Elliott, says consumers should cheer today\u2019s inflation data: Firstly, it means the squeeze on real incomes in 2017 and 2018 will be less severe and less pronounced than some have feared. Secondly, it removes the threat of an interest rate rise from the Bank of England. An August increase in the cost of borrowing, while never looking all that likely, is now off the agenda. Here\u2019s his full analysis: Danske Bank economist Conor Lambe fears that Britain\u2019s wage squeeze is hurting economic growth. And we could get the proof next Wednesday, when growth figures for the April-June quarter is released. Here\u2019s his take on today\u2019s inflation figures: \u201cThe CPI inflation rate in the UK was 2.6 per cent in June 2017, lower than the 2.9 per cent observed in May. This fall was mainly due to lower fuel prices. \u201cThe latest labour market data showed that the rate of nominal wage growth over the year to March-May 2017 was 2 per cent. Therefore, despite today\u2019s fall in the inflation rate, real wage growth is still in negative territory. \u201cAbove target inflation, and the accompanying negative real wage growth, is continuing to squeeze UK consumers and this is likely to be reflected in next week\u2019s preliminary estimate of GDP growth in the second quarter of this year.\u201d Here\u2019s a handy chart, showing how expectations of a UK interest rate rise this year have fallen: The Office for National Statistics has also reported that house price inflation has slowed. Average house prices in the UK rose by 4.7% in the year to May 2017, down from 5.3% in the year to April 2017. This could be another sign that the economy is slowing, and that households are feeling the squeeze from inflation and weak wage growth. The East of England saw the fastest growth, at 7.5% year on year. The lowest annual growth was in the North East, where prices increased by 1.6% over the year, followed by London at 3.0%. On a regional basis, London continues to be the region with the highest average house price at \u00a3481,000, followed by the South East and the East of England, which stand at \u00a3316,000 and \u00a3284,000 respectively. The lowest average price continues to be in the North East at \u00a3127,000. Despite the slowdown in London, prices across the capital have outstripped the rest of the country since the last recession: Guardian Business has launched a daily email. Besides the key news headlines that you\u2019d expect, there\u2019s an at-a-glance agenda of the day\u2019s main events, insightful opinion pieces and a quality feature to sink your teeth into each day. For your morning shot of financial news, sign up here: Nick Leung, research analyst at fund manager WisdomTree, says there are three reasons inflation dropped last month: \u201cToday\u2019s inflation reading is slightly softer than expected, underpinned by a combination of oil price weakness, a stabilising pound and import-cost induced inflationary pressures undermining consumers\u2019 debt-fuelled spending power.\u201d As long as wages are subdued, rising inflation is clearly bad news for families. James Brown, Partner and head of the UK Consumer &amp; Retail practice at Simon-Kucher &amp; Partners, explains why: June is the fifth consecutive month where inflation was above the Bank of England target of 2%, and also considerably higher than the 0.5% level recorded in June last year..... The current rate adds more than \u00a350 extra a month to UK households\u2019 monthly expenses covered by CPI compared to the same time last year, putting more pressure on holidays and summer outings budgets. The fall in the value of the pound last June has made foreign holidays much more expensive. But even those who say at home will feel the pinch. Brown explains: Whether families decide to register the children to a kids\u2019 club or summer camp, or whether groups of friends meet for drinks, they will have to pay more for it than they did last year. The figures for June showed that fees for recreational and sporting services went up by 3.5% and beer is 7.5% more expensive than last year. Britain\u2019s inflation target is 2%, so the Bank of England still faces some pressure to consider raising interest rates to push down the cost of living. Calum Bennie, Scottish Friendly\u2019s savings specialist, explains: \u201cDespite a drop in the headline rate of inflation, many families will still be facing the same relentless pressure to make ends meet. The cost of food, household goods and furniture all became more expensive in June and with wage growth still flat those at the bottom will continue to turn to credit or rapidly deplete savings just to keep food on the table. As long as this squeeze continues the Bank of England faces a difficult balancing act. While on the one hand raising interest rates may help to combat inflation, on the other it will cause real pain for homeowners who could see the cost of their mortgages rise.\u201d The drop in inflation in June may show that the cost of living squeeze is rippling through the economy, and making it hard for shops to raise prices. Ipek Ozkardeskaya of London Capital Markets explains: The slowdown in inflation suggests that the decline in British real wages may have started to translate into a slower consumer inflation, as anticipated by the Bank of England (BoE) Governor Mark Carney. Here\u2019s the Treasury\u2019s comment on today\u2019s inflation figures: \u2018While it is encouraging that inflation was lower this month, we appreciate that some families are concerned about the cost of living. That\u2019s why we have introduced the National Living Wage, which is helping to boost earnings by \u00a31,400 a year, and why we\u2019ve cut taxes for millions of people to help them keep more of what they earn. We are also increasing our free childcare offer to help 400,000 working parents.\u2019 No mention of the public sector pay cap, though, which has caused public splits within Theresa May\u2019s cabinet. The Unison union is also alarmed that wages are still being eroded by rising cost of living. UNISON assistant general secretary Christina McAnea says public sector workers deserve better: \u201cWith inflation much higher than wages, nurses, teaching assistants and care staff are getting poorer. \u201cThe government\u2019s harsh approach to public sector pay is completely out of step with the public mood. \u201cEvery day the pay cap stays, public sector employees are leaving for better paid jobs elsewhere. And it gets that bit harder for the NHS, police forces, schools and town halls to recruit new staff. \u201cThe Chancellor should show he understands the financial struggles of millions of families and end the pay cap now.\u201d Ben Brettell, senior economist at Hargreaves Lansdown, says the odds of a UK interest rate rise in August have shrunk. He writes: UK inflation fell unexpectedly in June to 2.6%, easing the pressure on squeezed household budgets and substantially reducing the likelihood of an August interest rate rise. The ONS said the drop was largely due to falling motor fuel prices, although core inflation \u2013 which strips out the more volatile components such as fuel and food \u2013 also fell, to 2.4%. The news sent the pound sharply lower as currency traders adjusted their outlook for interest rates. The Bank of England\u2019s rhetoric has taken an increasingly hawkish tone in recent weeks, with Mark Carney himself saying at the end of last month that \u201csome removal of monetary stimulus is likely to become necessary\u201d. Chief economist Andy Haldane also indicated he might support a rate rise this year. However if today\u2019s pullback in inflation marks the start of a sustained decline, the pressure on the Bank to raise rates will ease. You can read the inflation report online, here. This chart shows clearly how UK pay packets aren\u2019t keeping up with the cost of living, despite June\u2019s unexpected drop in inflation. It\u2019s via Maike Currie, investment director for Personal Investing at Fidelity International. She says there\u2019s little to cheer in today\u2019s inflation report: \u201cToday\u2019s inflation numbers show CPI inflation rising from 0.5% in June 2016 to 2.6% a year later - that\u2019s more than a five-fold increase in only a year. While inflation has eased back from May\u2019s reading of 2.9%, thanks largely to a fall in the oil price driving down the cost of fuel, this will be cold comfort for Britain\u2019s cash strapped consumers - inflation is still well above the Bank of England\u2019s 2% target rate and outpacing our earnings. \u201cLast week\u2019s wage growth figures show regular pay growing at just 2.0% for the three months to May, confirming that our pay packets aren\u2019t keeping up with rising prices despite the UK\u2019s unemployment rate reaching its lowest level since 1975. This is tightening the squeeze on UK households, which is bad news for an economy that relies on confident consumers spending on goods and services. Retail sales figures out on Thursday will provide a telling health check on just how spending is fairing given the mounting pressure on British households. No prizes for spotting the moment that the inflation data was released..... Katie Schmuecker of the Joseph Rowntree Foundation says the inflation squeeze is hitting poorer Britons the hardest: TUC General Secretary Frances O\u2019Grady isn\u2019t celebrating the drop in inflation. She points out that Britons are still suffering from falling real wages, and urges the government to ditch its 1% cap on public sector pay rises. O\u2019Grady says: \u201cThe government must stop this cost of living squeeze. Many working people are caught in a vice as rising prices crush their pay. \u201cMinisters claim they are listening to struggling families. But now is the time to prove it. Britain needs a pay rise across the public and private sector.\u201d ITV\u2019s Robert Peston reckons that inflation has been dampened by the slowing UK economy: This is the biggest drop in inflation in over two years, points out Jamie McGeever of Reuters: Kevin Maguire of the Mirror points out that the retail prices index (another measure of inflation) hit 3.5% in June: This chart shows how the cost of transport, and recreation activities, both dropped last month: Fuel prices fell by 1.1% between May and June 2017, the fourth successive month of price decreases. There was also a 0.1% drop in recreation - which includes cultural services, and games, toys and hobbies. However, as you can see, food, furniture and household goods all got more expensive during June. And on an annual basis, almost everything is more expensive than a year ago: The pound has fallen sharply since the inflation data was released, shedding all this morning\u2019s gains. Sterling has dropped to $1.3028, almost a cent lower. City traders think there\u2019s less chance of an early rise in UK interest rates. This is the first time UK inflation has fallen since last October. This chart shows how the consumer prices index (in yellow) had rising pretty steadily since last summer: The drop in inflation last month is mainly due to falling petrol prices, says the Office for National Statistics. Breaking! Britain\u2019s inflation rate has fallen to 2.6% in June, down from 2.9% in May. That\u2019s a smaller reading than expected; City has expected inflation to remain at last month\u2019s four-year high. But it still means that living standards are being squeezed, as wages are only rising by 2% (according to the latest data, released last week). More to follow! Tension is rising in the City, as traders get ready for the inflation figures to hit the wires.... If inflation remains at a four-year high of 2.9% in June, or even goes higher, it will intensify the debate about when UK interest rates should rise (for the first time since 2007). Danny Blanchflower and Andrew Sentance, both former members of the Bank\u2019s rate setting monetary policy, (and long-term opponents in economic theory) have been outlining their differing views on the BBC\u2019s Radio 4 Today programme. Sentance says the Bank should follow the US Fed\u2019s example and raise rates immediately: \u201cI think inflation is going to go up eventually this year to over 3% and that\u2019s squeezing the living standards of workers and people throughout the economy and I think the worry that I would have is that the bank of England hasn\u2019t responded at all to this situation. It can do something about it. If it gradually raised interest rates that would help support the value of the pound so we would get less imported inflation and that might take some of the pressure off consumers.\u201d Blanflower on the other hand thinks a rate rise now would be a \u201cself-inflicted wound\u201d. \u201cHere Andrew goes again he\u2019s been saying the same thing for the last 10 years. This is precisely the wrong thing to do. \u201cWhy would you want to have a self-inflicted wound at a time when Brexit negotiations is taking place, we\u2019ve no idea how it\u2019s going to be resolved and that\u2019s obviously a big problem, firms are sitting thinking what the heck is going to happen. So if you start to raise rates now this is precisely the wrong time to do it. Waiting and watching is sensible. My suspicion is this inflation is temporary and it will start to drop away.\u201d Zing! The pound just hit a fresh 10-month high against the US dollar. Sterling nudged $1.3126 for the first time since September 2016, as Trump\u2019s healthcare setbacks continue to weaken the dollar. City broker Panmure Gordon hopes that the worst of Britain\u2019s inflation surge may be coming to an end. They told clients this morning that the jump in import prices, following the Brexit vote, seems to have peaked a few months ago. That should mean that inflationary pressures ease a little. Here\u2019s a snapshot of their note: Economist Rupert Seggins is tweeting some useful charts on inflation: Some City economists have predicted that UK inflation could rise to 3% this morning. If so, that could send the pound soaring as it would intensify the pressure on the Bank of England to consider raising interest rates. Hussein Sayed, chief market strategist at FXTM, says: If headline inflation hits 3% or above, this will indicate a high chance of hiking rates when the BoE meets in August. However, if the numbers pull back, this would ease pressure on the central bank and traders will turn their attention to the Brexit talks. The pound has risen over $1.31 in early trading, up almost half a cent. That\u2019s close to last week\u2019s 10-month high, ahead of today\u2019s inflation report. Most currencies are gaining ground against the US dollar this morning, after president Trump\u2019s attempts to shake up America\u2019s healthcare system hit another roadblock. Overnight, two senators declared they wouldn\u2019t support Trump\u2019s push to repeal Obamacare. So, with veteran lawmaker John McCain recovering from surgery, the Republicans simply don\u2019t have the votes....especially as some senators fear that millions of Americans, especially with pre-existing conditions, would suffer if the Affordable Care Act was repealed. This has hurt the dollar, as it undermines hopes that Trump could deliver tax reforms or a big new infrastructure spending programme. This has sent the euro rallying to its highest level against the US dollar since May 2016. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. The cost of living squeeze is one of the hottest topics in Britain today, thanks to the decline in the pound last year and the government\u2019s public sector pay squeeze. So the main event today is the latest inflation figures, due at 9.30am today. They\u2019re all-but-certain to show that prices are rising faster than wages. Economists predict that the Consumer Prices Index will hit 2.9% for June, matching May\u2019s figure. That would mean that real wages are continuing to shrink, as basic pay is currently only growing by 2% per year. Prices are being driven up by the slump in the pound last June, which makes imports much dearer. So today\u2019s figures will also show the impact of Britain\u2019s vote to leave the EU. Samuel Tombs of Pantheon Economics predicts that food prices drove inflation up last month: Inflation has surged over the Bank of England\u2019s official target of 2% in recent months, as our economics editor Larry Elliott explains: Inflation was running at 0.6% when the UK voted to leave the EU in June 2016 but it has risen subsequently as a result of higher oil prices and dearer imports caused by the 12% decline in the value of the pound over the past 12 months. That has taken the annual inflation rate to its highest level in four years and close to the level where Mark Carney, the governor of the Bank of England, would be forced to write a letter to the chancellor, Philip Hammond, explaining why Threadneedle Street had failed to keep the annual increase in the cost of living to within one percentage point of the government\u2019s 2% target. Here\u2019s Larry\u2019s preview: The ONS will also publish its latest house price index, which may show that prices rose at a slower pace in May. And over at Winchester cathedral, the Bank of England is preparing to unveil the final design of its new polymer \u00a310 note. We already know it will feature Jane Austen, 200 years after the author\u2019s death.

                "bodyText":"With little in the way of real economic news, and with interest meetings from the Bank of Japan and European Central Bank due on Thursday, investors were in a cautious mood again. Even so, markets managed to move in the right direction. In Europe, they were lifted by a dip in the euro ahead of the ECB gathering, while in the US a stronger oil price helped to lift Wall Street. The technology heavy Nasdaq index even hit a new high, boosted by another move higher from Netflix. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished up 40.69 points or 0.55% at 7430.91 France\u2019s Cac closed up 0.17% at 12,452.05 Germany\u2019s Dax rose 0.83% to 5216.07 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB climbed 0.57% to 21,478.95 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended up 0.6% at 10,588.1 In Greece, the Athens market added 0.64% to 853.54 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently 26 points or 0.12% higher. On that note, we\u2019ll close for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. Joshua Mahony, market analyst at IG, is also cautious about the fall in US oil inventories: US crude stocks posted their third greater than expected inventories drawdown today, as the effects of driving season continue to be felt. It is worth being careful to not read too much into recent US stockpile reductions, as seasonality effects typically see US drivers raise both mileage and air conditioning usage. News that Chinese demand is on the wane is certainly not what the bulls want to hear, and despite falling US stocks, we continue to see output rise globally irrespective of the conformity rate of the recent OPEC production quota. David Madden, market analyst at CMC Markets UK, said: WTI and Brent Crude oil surged higher after the oil inventory report showed a larger than expected decline. The energy information agency (EIA) revealed that US stockpiles of oil fell by 4.72 million barrels, and the consensus was for a 3.5 million barrel decline. Last week there was drop of 7.56 million barrels. Traders would be unwise to overlook the fact that US oil production increased by 32 thousand barrels per day. US crude stocks fell by more than expected last week, giving some support to the oil price. Crude inventories dropped by 4.7m barrels compared to forecasts of a 3.2m barrel fall, while gasoline stocks were 4.4m barrels lower. Analysts had expected a decline here of 655,000. The news saw Brent crude jump 1.33% to $49.49 a barrel, a two week high. Credit Suisse has sent a shiver through the City this afternoon, by warning that Britain is \u2018flirting with recession\u2019. In a new research note, Credit Suisse argues there is a roughly one-in-three chance that Britain\u2019s economy falls into recession later this year, as the economy continues to slow. Credit Suisse estimates that next week\u2019s GDP figures will show that the UK economy only grew by 0.2% in April-June, matching the poor performance in the first three month of 2017. For the rest of the year, it expect growth to remain subdued at 0.2%-0.3% per quarter. And raises the prospect of a full-blown technical recession, defined as two quarters of negative growth in a row. Credit Suisse believes this is a real possibility, given the slowdown in consumer spending and the uncertainty created by Brexit. The bank\u2019s analysts do admit that they predicted an immediate recession if Britain voted to leave the EU. That didn\u2019t happen, of course, but that doesn\u2019t mean that the risk is averted for good. They write: That [a recession] is not our central scenario, but the risks are increasing, and the volatile political backdrop and unpredictable Brexit negotiations have increased the uncertainty of our forecasts. The reasons for expecting a recession post the EU referendum in the UK continue to haunt the economy. We acknowledge that the recession we forecast in the aftermath of the referendum did not occur. But the channels that we thought would drive negative growth \u2013 an inflation-driven squeeze on consumer spending and weaker business investment as a result of Brexit uncertainty \u2013 are materializing, albeit later than we expected. We think those drivers are only likely to worsen as political uncertainty persists after the election and the UK\u2019s future relationship with Europe remains unclear. They also single out the slide in real wages in recent months: Over in New York, shares have hit fresh record highs at the start of trading. The S&amp;P 500 index, and the tech-focused Nasdaq, both pushed higher. Over in the US, there are some upbeat housing numbers in the wake of Tuesday\u2019s fall in housebuilder confidence. Housing starts in June rose by 8.3% compared to expectations of a 6.2% increase. This means new houses are being built at the fastest rate in four months. Meanwhile May\u2019s number was revised from a 5.5% fall to a 2.8% decline. Although Glaxo is selling Horlicks in the UK, it is retaining its Indian operation where the malted drink is growing more popular by the day. That\u2019s according to Reuters, which explains: In Britain, where Horlicks is sold as a bedtime drink, the product has largely fallen out of favour and sales are very limited. Indian demand for Horlicks, by contrast, is strong and GSK has developed the malted barley milk drink into its top consumer brand in the country. Glaxo\u2019s decision to abandon plans to build a new factory in Cumbria is a major blow to the area. Five years ago, GSK announced it would create a new \u201cstate-of-the-art biopharmaceutical manufacturing facility\u201d at Ulverston. The site was expected to cost around \u00a3350m, and create 500 permanent jobs. At the time, Prime Minister David Cameron said it was \u201cexcellent news for Cumbria\u201d. \u201cA major investment that will create many highly-skilled jobs and provide a huge boost to the area.\u201d But those hopes have now been thrown into uncertainty. Breaking: Pharmaceuticals group GlaxoSmithKline is cutting more than 300 jobs in the UK. The company has announced details of a plan to \u201cimprove the efficiency and competitiveness of its manufacturing network\u201d. Under the scheme, Glaxo will sell its \u2018Horlick\u2019 brand in the UK, and shut the factory in Slough where the malt milk drink is produced. GSK is also outsourcing some manufacturing activity at its Worthing site in the UK. And in another blow, the company is abandoning plans to build a biopharmaceutical facility in Ulverston, Cumbria, as it no longer needs the additional capacity. Local MP John Woodcock says it\u2019s \u2018terrible news\u2019. Glaxo insists that it remains committed to UK manufacturing, and is today pledging an extra \u00a3140m for sites in Hertfordshire, County Durham and Montrose, in Scotland. It says: This new investment is in addition to the \u00a3275million announced last year and investment of over \u00a31.2billion in UK manufacturing since 2012. It also points out that it is a major employer: Overall, GSK employs a total of around 17000 people across the UK of which 5000 are in UK manufacturing operations. The proposals announced today for Worthing and Slough will result in a reduction of approximately 320 permanent jobs over the next 4 years. Is it Brexit\u2019s fault? Apparently not. Glaxo says: None of the announcements made today by the company have resulted from the UK\u2019s decision to leave the European Union. Morgan Stanley\u2019s results have cheered the markets: Newsflash from Wall Street: Morgan Stanley has become the latest bank to warn that bond trading has struggled. But that hasn\u2019t stopped the bank beating expectations with its financial results for the last quarter.... MS\u2019s net earnings rose to $1.8bn for the April-June quarter, up from $1.6bn a year ago. That equates to earnings of 87 cents per share, compared to forecasts of just 76 cents CEO James Gorman says it\u2019s a decent performance, given the \u2018subdued\u2019 trading conditions. And those \u2018subdued\u2019 conditions seem to have hit in MS\u2019s bond trading division. Fixed income sales and trading net revenues fell to $1.2bn, from $1.3bn, due to \u201clower volatility and sporadic activity during the quarter\u201d. Yesterday, Goldman Sachs reported a 40% slump in second-quarter bond trading revenue, which was also blamed on the current environment of low volatility. Over in Paris, the governor of the Bank of France has dropped a hint that the ECB will take a cautious approach at this week\u2019s meeting. Villeroy de Galhau, who serves on the ECB\u2019s governing council, told French MPs that the central bank has defeated the threat of deflation. However, he added, it\u2019s too early to end its asset purchase scheme or raising interest rates from their current record lows. De Galhau argued: \u201cWe have made progress, but we have not yet reached the target and so there is still a need for our accommodative monetary policy... We are adapting its intensity depending on the economic situation and progress towards the target. Here\u2019s a photo from the session: European stock markets have crept higher, helping to keep global stocks at record levels. In London the FTSE 100 has gained 6 points, with Reckitt Benckiser leading the way following the sale of its food business. That follows a decent session on Wall Street last night, where the Nasdaq tech index surged to a fresh record high. Chris Beauchamp of IG says traders are hoping that the European Central Bank doesn\u2019t drop any nasty surprises tomorrow: A record high for the Nasdaq and a fresh overnight surge in the euro\u2019s ongoing rally will be the key themes on an otherwise relatively quiet day. As the ECB meeting gets closer, the market\u2019s attention will increasingly focus on the likelihood of any further hawkish commentary from the central bank that could squeeze the euro even higher against the dollar. European markets failed to capitalise on last week\u2019s rally, hamstrung by euro strength, so the hope for this particular crowded trade is that Mario Draghi will row back on the change in language from earlier in the month. Given the bank\u2019s predilection for easing, it seems unlikely that they will err too much on the hawkish side. Quite.... Newsflash: Europe\u2019s construction sector cooled a little in May. Construction output across the eurozone shrank by 0.7%, compared to May, due to a 0.9% decline in civil engineering and a 0.7% drop in building construction by 0.6%. Across the wider EU, construction dropped by 1.1%. Eurostat explains: The largest decreases in production in construction were recorded in Slovenia (-10.6%), Sweden (-7.1%) and Slovakia (-4.9%), and the highest increases in Hungary (+7.6%), Bulgaria (+3.6%) and Italy (+2.7%). Despite the month-on-month decline, eurozone construction production was still 2.6% higher than a year ago: This may encourage the European Central Bank not to rush into unwinding its stimulus programme.... Hot news for sauce lovers! Consumer giant Reckitt Benckiser has sold off its food business in a deal worth $4.2bn (\u00a33.2bn). The division, which produces French\u2019s mustard, Franks\u2019 RedHot and Cattlemen\u2019s sauces, has been gobbled up by America\u2019s McCormick &amp; Co - which owns Schwartz herbs and spices. This follows a bid battle with Unilever and Hormel Foods, maker of Spam. The deal should allow Reckitt to focus on its cleaning and healthcare operations. Shares in the company have jumped 1.5%. Peter Rosenstreich of Swissquote Bank predicts that the Bank of Japan will reaffirm its commitment to loose monetary policy when it monetary policy meeting ends tomorrow. The BoJ is currently buying 80 trillion yen of bonds each year, hitting banks with negative interest rates, and trying to keep long-term government borrowing costs around zero, in a bid to drive inflation and growth up. But with inflation still weak, Rosenstreich doesn\u2019t believe the BoJ can consider slowing its stimulus programme yet. While most major central banks have begun tightening money supplies, the BoJ has not. The Central bank has been unable to boost inflation to its target of 2%, and success is not in sight for 2017-2018. The Bank is likely to focus on controlling the yield curve, one of its primary targets will be to pin 10-year government bond yields at 0%.... Rosenstreich adds that two hawkish BoJ policymakers are leaving the board, giving governor Haruhiko Kuroda more freedom to continue his expansive policy. Australia\u2019s stock market had a good day, driven by its banks. Shares in Australia\u2019s largest lenders rallied after regulators unveiled new capital requirements which are less onerous than feared. Bloomberg has the details: \u201cThe new requirements look relatively benign,\u201d said Anthony Ip, a credit analyst at Citigroup Inc. \u201cThe majors may well be able to meet the new requirements organically without equity raisings, assets sales or changes to dividends.\u201d ANZ Bank shares rose as much as 4.2 percent, the most in more than eight months, and Commonwealth Bank added 3.4 percent. National Australia Bank rallied as much as 3.7 percent and Westpac climbed as much as 4 percent. That sent the S&amp;P/ASX index up by 0.8% The euro is dipping this morning, down 0.2% against the pound at 88.4p. That suggests that traders expect the European Central Bank to calm expectations that it might rein in its stimulus programme soon, at tomorrow\u2019s meeting. Benjamin Schroeder, a rates strategist at ING, believes the ECB have had a rethink after president Draghi gave an upbeat speech in late June. Those upbeat comments drove the euro up, and sparked a selloff in eurozone government bonds. Schroeder adds (via Reuters): \u201cA strong euro has also raised expectations that they will not sound overly hawkish.\u201d The US dollar\u2019s weakness has boosted the Chinese yuan. Beijing just fixed its currency at the strongest level in nine months, as Trump\u2019s healthcare woes continue to weigh on the greenback. This news clearly calls for a cute panda... Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. There\u2019s an end of term feeling in the markets today. I don\u2019t think any traders have actually turned up with a Kerplunk set, but they could be forgiven for risking a quick game of Top Trumps across their trading terminals. In short, there\u2019s not much going on today. So with nothing to scare investors right now, global markets remain at their highest ever levels. MSCI\u2019s gauge of shares around the world has risen this morning, putting it on track for its fifth daily rise in a row. But although the summer lull is nearly upon us, we\u2019re not there quite yet, class. Investors need to prepare for a busy Thursday, when the Bank of Japan and the European Central Bank both hold monetary policy meetings. They could move move the markets, if policymakers offer any hints that monetary policy will be tightened soon. In particular, the ECB could provide fresh guidance on when it will start to taper its bond purchase scheme. Any bullish comments from president Draghi could send the euro spiking. Mihir Kapadia, CEO of Sun Global Investments, says: Any comments which are perceived are more hawkish then expected could result in further pressure on the US dollar. The dollar is also weaker against the yen and the pound.\u201d Over in Asia, optimism over China\u2019s economy, following this week\u2019s GDP figures, has pushed shares higher. The US dollar is languishing around a 10-month low today, following Donald Trump\u2019s inability to get healthcare changes though Congress. Investors are increasingly sceptical that that the president can implement tax reforms or push through a big infrastructure spending bill. As Michael Hewson of CMC Markets puts it... The Trump administration is also helping by appearing to undermine the US dollar at every available opportunity with what can only be described as either incompetence or sheer stupidity. Another failure to enact policy reforms this time on health care is raising serious questions as to whether this administration will deliver on any of the promises it made at the end of last year, with serious doubts now being expressed about tax and banking reform. It seems that even with a majority in both Houses the Republicans appear unable to even agree amongst themselves as to what is best for the US economy. It appears that the US government is giving the UK government a run for its money in the incompetence stakes. It doesn\u2019t help that neither country has a competent opposition to offset this. President Draghi will certainly have his work cut out in keeping a lid on the euro at this rate, as the market gears up for tomorrow\u2019s ECB rate meeting, with a move to the $1.2000 level a distinct possibility on a break of $1.1620 and last year\u2019s high. The agenda: It looks like a quiet day, but we do get new eurozone construction figures, US housing data, and new oil inventory figures this afternoon.... 10am BST: Eurozone construction output for May 1.30pm BST: US housing starts and building permits 3.30pm BST: US crude oil inventories",

                "bodyText":"ITV is banking on hits including Love Island and returning drama Victoria to attract viewers as it faces the worst year for UK TV advertising in almost a decade. The broadcaster said TV advertising slumped 8% to \u00a3769m in the first half of the year \u2013 the worst fall since the final quarter of 2008 \u2013 and blamed marketers for holding back budgets due to \u201congoing economic and political uncertainty\u201d. ITV\u2019s pre-tax profits slumped 16% to \u00a3259m in the first six months of 2017. June was a particularly difficult month, with advertising revenue plummeting 18% year on year against a tough comparison with the same month in 2016, when ITV had European Championship football coverage. ITV said it expected to perform better in the third quarter, with TV ad revenue improving to a 4% decline. The broadcaster praised the performance of Love Island \u2013 which set viewing records for ITV2 and drove its share of advertising viewed by 16- to 34-year-olds, who are leaving traditional TV in droves, by 15%. ITV\u2019s chairman, Sir Peter Bazalgette, responsible for bringing Big Brother to the UK, said the show had its own identity as escape TV as the public faces increasingly tough economic times. \u201cLove Island is Love Island,\u201d said Bazalgette, who admitted he was one of the 2.6 million viewers of Monday night\u2019s final. \u201cIt is a really delightful show. I think it hits the mood of the times. It is romantic, positive, upbeat. Love Island demonstrates that young viewers engage in great TV content.\u201d The show has spawned catchphrases such as \u201c100% my type on paper\u201d, which Primark has struck a deal to use as a slogan on clothing, and more than 75,000 of the personalisable water bottles given to the contestants have been sold. The show, which ran from early June, will help the broadcaster\u2019s performance in the second half of the year. ITV said the second half of the year would prove to be better with a \u201cbuild-up of programme stock\u201d, including Victoria and Cold Feet, set to bolster its advertising performance. The broadcaster saw a healthy 4% bump in share price in early trading as analysts, who had factored in the poor first half performance, were buoyed by more positive outlook for the second half of the year. Analysts expect ITV\u2019s ad revenue to be down about 6% for the full year, which will be its worst annual performance since a 9.4% fall in 2009. However, the broadcaster said it expected to outperform the wider UK TV ad market. \u201cWe are in a very different environment to then [2009],\u201d said finance chief Ian Griffith, who is running ITV as chief operating officer until the arrival of Carolyn McCall to replace Adam Crozier as chief executive in January. \u201cWe are a much more scaled and resilient business. We are very different compared to the last time the market had to face a downturn in advertising.\u201d Bazalgette said he expects McCall, who joins from easyJet on 8 January, to lead a \u201crefresh\u201d at ITV. However, he added that the broadcaster would stick to its current strategy of diversifying away from a reliance on advertising by expanding its TV production business, ITV Studios, and building online revenues. \u201cEvery strategy of every company benefits from being refreshed and that is the job we will be doing with Carolyn McCall in the new year,\u201d he said. \u201cYes, we do wish to be an integrated producer broadcaster, we do wish to rebalance the company and we do wish to continue to strengthen our studios business.\u201d Griffith said he had not seen a \u201csignificant shift\u201d in ad spend from Google or Facebook into TV following widespread concerns about ads running online next to inappropriate content such as extremist material and fake news. Asked about the threat of Netflix, which last week announced strong growth breaking the 100 million global subscriber mark, Bazalgette classified it as a \u201cfrenemy\u201d. ITV competes with services such as Netflix for viewers but also produces and sells it shows through ITV Studios, maker of shows including The Voice, Come Dine With Me and Coronation Street. \u201cITV family [of channels] has a 21% share of viewing in the UK, Netflix [if it was measured] would have a 4% share,\u201d he said. \u201cThey have the share [size] of one of the healthier digital channels.\u201d ITV also said that it intends to press ahead with trying to force Virgin Media to pay to carry its channels, after an arcane law that protects cable platforms from having to pay copyright or retransmission fees to public service broadcasters is repealed on 31 July. Analysts optimistically hope that ITV can make tens of million of pounds charging retransmission fees not just to Virgin Media, but also other rivals. \u201cFrom [31 July] we look forward to negotiating for proper value on all channels,\u201d said Bazalgette.",

                "bodyText":"With this, we are closing the blog for today. Good-bye and thank you for all your great comments. We\u2019ll be back tomorrow. Wall Street has got off to flying start: US stocks have risen to fresh record highs boosted by a flurry of strong company results. The Dow Jones industrial average rose nearly 70 points, or 0.4%, to 21778.96 while the S&amp;P 500 advanced nearly 4 points, or 0.15%, to 2481.73. and the Nasdaq climbed 33 points, or 0.5%, to 6455.67. Here in London, the FTSE 100 index is still in negative territory, down nearly 13 points at 7439.65, a 0.2% drop. Investors are breathing a sigh of relief after US durable goods data showed a better than expected 6.5% gain in orders in June, says Dennis de Jong, managing director at online broker UFX.com. A downbeat assessment on current inflation levels at yesterday\u2019s Fed Reserve meeting had cast further uncertainty over the next interest rate, although today\u2019s numbers suggest the US economy remains in good health.\u201d The greenback could claw back some of yesterday\u2019s losses against major European counterparts. Attention now turns to tomorrow\u2019s all-important GDP data. The US economy must continue to meet expectations if Janet Yellen is to confirm an interest rate hike in September. Phillip Hammond has found a new Bank of England deputy governor to replace the disgraced Charlotte Hogg from within his own Treasury ranks. The chancellor has appointed the Treasury\u2019s chief economic adviser, Sir David Ramsden to replace Hogg, who resigned earlier this year after failing to disclose that her brother was a senior executive at Barclays \u2013 a bank she would have regulated. Ramsden\u2019s full title will be deputy governor of markets and banking. Hogg was also chief operating officer, but that post is going to someone else. The Bank of England will make a separate announcement about that post later today. Ramsden has a long list of responsibilities in his new role, the Treasury said, including : specific responsibility for managing the balance sheet, the government\u2019s foreign exchange reserves, and the gathering of market intelligence relevant to policy decisions. Sir Dave, as he is known, will also be a member of the monetary policy committee, the financial policy committee, the prudential regulation committee and the court of the Bank of England. The world\u2019s oil consumption could peak as early as the late 2020s as electric cars become more popular, says Royal Dutch Shell boss Ben van Beurden. But he added that oil would still be needed for several more decades, arguing that it will remain the main fuel used in planes, ships and heavy trucks. He told reporters after Shell, Europe\u2019s biggest oil company reported a sharp rise in quarterly profits: Even if the UK, France and the western world in general will all go to 100% electric vehicles, that would be great, but that wouldn\u2019t be enough... We still have less advanced economies that cannot do that switch. He even admitted that he would get an electric car the next time he buys a new vehicle, in an interview with Bloomberg. The International Energy Agency, the energy watchdog, does not expect oil demand to peak before 2040. Shell, which has been producing oil since 1907, and its rivals are increasingly switching to less-polluting natural gas. France has decided to nationalise the STX France shipyard, marking president Emmanuel Macron\u2019s first major industrial policy decision, Reuters is reporting, citing Le Monde. The French government has been in an ownership standoff with Italy over the shipyard in Saint-Nazaire, north-western France. Reuters says: As France\u2019s most pro-business leader in decades, few would have predicted the former investment banker\u2019s first big move in the corporate sector to be a nationalisation. However, his action fits with the interventionist style of other postwar French leaders. It also crosses into the strategically sensitive defence sector where many national governments prefer to wield influence over ownership. The Economy Ministry would not comment on the report when asked by Reuters, but said it would hold a news conference on the subject at 3:00 pm (1300 GMT). Economy Minister Bruno Le Maire had given the Italians until Thursday to accept an offer for 50/50 ownership of the shipyard, brandishing the threat of a temporary nationalisation to buy time to find another solution if the offer were rebuffed. \u201cThe aim is not to nationalise Saint-Nazaire, but we have to temporarily.\u201d The warm summer weather added a sizzle to Britain\u2019s high streets this month: retail sales growth hit a three-month high as shoppers updated their summer wardrobes and bought more groceries, according to a monthly survey from the CBI employers\u2019 group. Its retail sales balance rose to 22 in July from 12 in June, marking the highest reading since April. Expectations for next month were the strongest since last December, but the CBI warned it might not last. Anna Leach, head of economic intelligence at the CBI, said: While retailers expect a similar pace of growth next month, the factors underpinning their sales growth are more shaky. Although employment is strong, real incomes are falling in the wake of higher inflation, and that\u2019s expected to feed slower consumer spending growth ahead.\u201d Time for a quick market round-up. The FTSE 100 index has slipped into negative territory, trading down some 2 points at 7450.24. AstraZeneca\u2019s woes are weighing on the index, as is the stronger pound, which is rising against the dollar after a more cautious statement from the US Federal Reserve last night suggested the next interest rate hike may be some way off, and sent the greenback sliding. Sterling has risen as high as $1.3157, its highest level since mid-September \u2013 good news for holidaymakers heading to the US. It has eased back to $1.3141, but is still about 1% higher than before the Fed statement. However, the euro has also rallied against the dollar and sterling is still close to eight-week lows on expectations that the European Central Bank will tighten policy later this year. It is trading at 89.21 pence per euro. AstraZeneca is the biggest faller with a 16.1% loss to \u00a342.87 after news of a key lung cancer drug trial failure, and the stock is on track for its worst day ever. Lloyds Banking Group is also among the biggest losers after reporting another \u00a31bn charge for PPI claims. Its shares are down 2.3% at 67.49p. Drinks giant Diageo is the biggest riser, with the shares up 6.5% at \u00a324.20. The maker of Johnnie Walker and Smirnoff raised its profitability target and unveiled a share buyback programme. Sky has also reported results this morning. Our media correspondent Mark Sweney reports: Sky is to hire 300 new technology staff to keep pace with rivals such as Netflix and Amazon as the broadcaster suffered a drop in full year profits and an increase in the rate of customers defecting to rivals. Here is our full story on Lloyds. AstraZeneca boss Pascal Soriot is fielding numerous questions about whether he\u2019s leaving to join Israel\u2019s Teva. With a sigh, he said The head of Britain\u2019s financial markets watchdog just said that the UK will scrap the scandal-hit Libor interest rate benchmark from the end of 2021, when a substitute index should be in place. Libor is based on banks\u2019 submissions of interest rates they believe they would be charged for borrowing money. Andrew Bailey, chief executive of the Financial Conduct Authority, said in a speech in London that work must \u201cbegin in earnest\u201d on shifting to an alternative index, saying that aiming for the end of 2021 would ensure a smooth transition. AstraZeneca boss Pascal Soriot is speaking on a conference call to journalists after the failure of a key lung cancer drug trial sent the company\u2019s shares down more than 15%, to \u00a343.24. The stock is heading for its worst day ever. Soriot, whilst saying that the company never comments on market speculation and rumours, has tried to squash the speculation triggered by a recent media report that he could jump ship and defect to Israel\u2019s Teva, the world\u2019s biggest generics drugmaker. He said: I\u2019m impressed with the progress we\u2019ve made. I\u2019m proud to be the CEO of this company and I\u2019m looking forward to continuing on our journey ahead... I\u2019m committed to delivering our strategy of returning to growth. Travel company Thomas Cook as announced that it will start selling holidays in Tunisia again soon, after the UK changed its travel advice yesterday. Chief executive Peter Fankhauser told journalists: The foreign office came to the conclusion that it is again safe to travel. We didn\u2019t have any programme for the winter so we are setting up a really good quality offer for Tunisia and this is going to take some time. I suppose that we are gong to start during the winter season, but more towards the spring. The Walkie Talkie skyscraper in the City has been sold to a Hong Kong oyster sauce maker for \u00a31.28bn in a record-breaking deal. Land Securities has sold the building at 20 Fenchurch Street to Hong Kong-based Lee Kum Kee, a sauces company that specialises in oyster-flavoured sauce.

Pretax profits dropped to \u00a33.8m in the six months to June, from \u00a310.5m a year earlier. Chief executive Nic Budden said: Our performance has been resilient in the context of a London property market that has been further impacted by unprecedented economic and political uncertainty. Whilst sales commissions in the second quarter as a whole were down 3% versus prior year, sales exchanges and our under offer pipeline weakened through June and the early part of July. Shares in AstraZeneca have crashed more than 16%, after the drugmaker suffered a major setback with the failure of an key lung cancer trial. The shares plunged as low as \u00a342.71, wiping about \u00a310bn off the company\u2019s market value. The long-awaited initial results from the Mystic study found that a combination of two injectable immunotherapy drugs, durvalumab and tremelimumab, failed to help patients. Chief medical officer Sean Bohen described the results as \u201cdisappointing\u201d but said the trial would continue to assess overall survival. The news came as Britain\u2019s second-biggest pharmaceuticals firm reported an 8% fall in revenues in the second quarter to $5.05bn at constant currencies, while core earnings per share rose 6% to 87 cents. Let\u2019s have a look at the company results. Lloyds Banking Group Lloyds has set aside another \u00a3700m to meet PPI claims, taking the PPI charge in its first half to \u00a31bn. However it has also reported its biggest first-half profit in eight years \u2013 a statutory pretax profit of \u00a32.5bn, 4% higher than last year \u2013 and lifted the interim dividend. Lloyds is reporting its first results since the government sold the last chunk of its shareholding in the lender in May, after rescuing during the financial crisis with a \u00a320.3bn bailout. Its chief executive Ant\u00f3nio Horta Os\u00f3rio has just told journalists on a call: \u201cI have no intention of going anywhere,\u201d trying to squash speculation that he could be on the way out. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. The pound has hit $1.3146, its highest level since last September against the dollar, after last night\u2019s US Federal Reserve statement. The dollar is sliding after the Fed adopted a more cautious tone on the inflation outlook \u2013 boosting expectations that the next interest rate hike may be delayed until next year. The Fed kept rates unchanged last night and said it expected to start paring back its huge bond holdings \u201crelatively soon\u201d \u2013 cementing expectations this will start in September. But while it expects the economy to keep strengthening, it noted that inflation had declined. The Fed statement sent the dollar to 13-month lows against a basket of major currencies. The euro hit $1.1777, its highest level since early 2015. There is a raft of company results today, while the economic agenda is light. In Germany, consumer confidence reached a 16-year high, according to the GfK market research group. Its indicator rose to 10.8 going into August from 10.6 in July. Here in the UK, the latest retail sales survey from the CBI should shed some light on what\u2019s going on on the high street, a day after official figures showed that the British economy remains stuck in a soft patch. It grew by 0.3% in the second quarter of this year, with the film industry a rare bright spot, following 0.2% growth in the first quarter. Earlier this week, the International Monetary Fund downgraded its growth forecast for the UK to 1.7% this year, while upgrading the four biggest eurozone economies - Germany, France, Italy and Spain.

BT\u2019s stock market value dropped by almost \u00a38bn in January after the company revealed the full extent of a \u00a3530m accounting scandal at its Italian operation. BT\u2019s share price remains more than 20% lower than it was a year ago. BT said the \u00a3225m payout represented a \u201cfull and final settlement in respect of these issues\u201d. The company\u2019s share price fell by more than 4% in early trading on Friday as investors digested the latest bad news to hit the company. Gavin Patterson, the BT chief executive, said DT and Orange \u201conly very recently\u201d raised the issue of a payment ahead of a deadline to make a claim at the end of the day on Friday. He said the settlement was better than facing a longer legal process that would have been triggered if an official claim was lodged. He added that there were still a \u201csmall number\u201d of class action suits related to the accounting scandal lodged by investors in the US. \u201cWe think we have a strong case to defend but I can\u2019t comment on those,\u201d he said. The ongoing fallout of the Italian accounting scandal has resulted in Patterson\u2019s pay for last year being slashed by \u00a34m, and prompted a restructure with the axing of 4,000 jobs, about half in the UK. The charge hurt BT\u2019s financial performance badly, with pre-tax profits slumping 42% from \u00a3717m to \u00a3418m in the three months to the end of June. Stripping out the impact of the one-off \u00a3225m payment, BT\u2019s adjusted profits still fell by 2% to \u00a31.78bn in its first quarter. The company attributed this to increased pension costs, programme rights and investing in bringing all of its call centre operations back to the UK. In March, BT paid \u00a31.18bn for Champions League football rights, 32% more than the previous deal, to fend off Sky. The rising cost of sports rights has also affected Sky, which on Thursday said a one-off \u00a3629m step-up in Premier League rights costs drove a 14% drop in profits at its UK and Ireland operation. \u201cThe days of rampant [rights cost] inflation I think are behind us,\u201d said Patterson. \u201cI think we are getting to a point where rights fees will increasingly be challenged in terms of inflation. We are prepared to walk away if the price is too high.\u201d Upcoming sports rights auctions include the Football League, which is expected to be a high-stakes bidding war with Sky, and ATP World Tour Tennis. BT added just 8,000 new TV customers, following an equally anaemic 11,000 in the first quarter of the year \u2013 close to a record low. Patterson said overall BT delivered an \u201cencouraging performance\u201d in its first quarter, with total revenues up 1% to \u00a35.8bn. BT pointed to a healthy 9% increase in broadband and TV revenue, fuelled by price rises, and a 4% rise at EE to \u00a31.3bn. The company also announced a further restructure that will see its BT Consumer division, home to its TV service and broadband operation, merged with mobile business EE. As a result the BT Consumer chief executive John Petter, a 13-year BT veteran, is to leave the company. Marc Allera, the chief executive of EE, will take control of the enlarged division. Patterson indicated that the merger was likely to lead to job cuts beyond what the company announced in May.",
