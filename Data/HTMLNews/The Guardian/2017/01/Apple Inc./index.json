The pound is currently down 0.8% against the dollar at $1.2304 and 0.5% lower against the euro at \u20ac1.1521. Jasper Lawler, senior market analyst at London Capital Group, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Trading on the FTSE was muted the day after suffering its biggest loss in six months. The British pound, drifting lower in a correction of its biggest daily gain since 2008, helped the UK equity benchmark to modest gains.</p> <p>We view the move in the British pound following Prime Minister\u2019s speech as a game-changer and as such don\u2019t anticipate a near-term resumption of the record winning streak for the FTSE 100.

Nina Skero, managing economist at the Centre for Economics and Business Research, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Given the low unemployment rate and still modest, but accelerating wage growth it may be difficult to think of the labour market as anything but robust. However, other indicators suggest that a labour market softening may not be far off. The latest employment figures saw a decline of 9,000 persons compared to the June to August period. Correspondingly, the proportion of people in work decreased by 0.1 percentage points compared to June to August 2016 and now stands at 74.5%.</p> <p>The Claimant Count statistics, which are considered experimental by the ONS but are the most timely, also suggest that the labour market may be losing some steam. In December 2016, the number of people claiming unemployment related benefits declined by 10,100 compared to November 2016 but was 26,900 higher than in December 2015.</p> <p>With the economy set for a slowdown in 2017 and 2018, many firms will be more reluctant to hire. A worst case scenario could even see some businesses lay off existing staff. For instance, many companies that rely on imports find themselves in a tricky situation given that a weaker pound has increased their production costs but they are unable to raise prices drastically due to fear of losing market share. One option for such firms will be to cut down on spending by reducing head counts.</p> <p>On the bright side, although the labour market may soften in the coming year it is starting its marginal decline from a place of strength. While we expect the unemployment rate to increase from current levels in 2017, it will remain below rates seen for much of 2015 and 2014. The real risk lies within wage growth which despite the acceleration in the most recent data has been unimpressive in the post-crisis period and now stands to be overtaken by inflation.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"12a7e6083aaa417a392190b443e07f9dddc22a5e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/12a7e6083aaa417a392190b443e07f9dddc22a5e/598_201_4714_3300/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Unemployment rate holds steady but could start to rise\" width=\"1000\" height=\"700\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Unemployment rate holds steady but could start to rise</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Global Warming Images/REX</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Sam Hill, senior UK economist at RBC Europe, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The main headlines from the UK labour market report continued the recent run of relatively optimistic news on the state of the economy. The unemployment rate held at 4.8%, the fall in the level of employment of 9k 3m/3m was smaller than the 35k decrease expected and average earnings growth picked up to 2.8% 3m/y (inc. bonuses), the strongest since September 2015.</p> <p>Private sector average earnings growth is now above 3% 3m/y and above 4% 3m/y in the retail/restaurant sector, each for the first time since Q3 2015. The relative weakness in terms of private sector pay is the financial and business service sector where growth is just 1.9% 3m/y. As with the inflation data yesterday, this development won\u2019t ease the MPC\u2019s concerns about the anticipated period of above-target CPI.</p> <p>In our assessment there is a very good chance that unemployment rises to 4.9% next month, but the more concerning element of the report is the news on total hours worked (but also note the highest number of redundancies at 123k since Q1 2014). In the three months to November 2016 total hours worked fell 1.2mn compared to the three months to August. This comprises both the modest fall in the level of employment as well as a reduction in average hours worked to 31.9/wk...</p> <p>As we flagged recently, the near-term risk to our 1.2% 2017 GDP forecast is that the headwinds we have identified don\u2019t materialise as quickly as expected at the start of the year, with survey evidence on the outlook remaining impressive at the end of 2016.

                "bodyText":"The official Davos sessions are now over for the day, although there are plenty of working dinners taking place (most off the record, alas). In the hall, it\u2019s Dalian Night - with trays of delicious Chinese food* for the throng, washed down with wine or Tsingtao beer. *stir-fried beef, cabbage and celery, oodles of noodles, with Lychees and Tapioka-coconut pudding and mango to follow. So that\u2019s all from us for today, unless any major news breaks out. Back tomorrow for Theresa May\u2019s special address to Davos, and a lot more.... GW It wouldn\u2019t be Davos without a dose of eurozone angst; and Jamie Dimon, the CEO of JP Morgan, has provided it. Dimon told Bloomberg TV tonight that the euro area could break up unless politicians address the populist anger that has built up. He said: \u201cWhat went wrong is going wrong for everybody, not just going wrong for Britain, but in some ways it looks like they\u2019re kind of doubling down. [Unless leaders address underlying concerns] you\u2019re going to have the same political things about immigration, the laws of the country, how much power goes to Brussels.\u201d The United States may flip at the end of this week from being a climate leader, to being the leading climate change denier, says Thomas Friedman, the author chairing the climate change session. How will Trump\u2019s election, and the changes in Europe, affect the climate agenda? Norway\u2019s prime minister, Erna Solberg, is optimistic that Brexit won\u2019t change the climate agenda I believe the Brits are going to continue being active on this, and that my sister party the Conservatives will hold firm to an agenda against emissions. But the United States could be a different story once Trump is in charge. The Paris Agreement is in place, it\u2019s a long process to get out of it. But of course, not implementing it is a possibility for a new administration. The bottom line is that those who believe in the climate change fight must keep putting the effort in, Solberg continues. People who continue to deny will fall back, and lose out in the future. And we shouldn\u2019t forget that America has never been in the front line of the fight against climate change. As Friedman wryly points out, it\u2019s a little worrying that there are Neo-nazi parties in Europe who believe in climate change, while one of America\u2019s two major political parties doesn\u2019t. Former US vice-president Al Gore is speaking about climate change now, saying there are only three questions remaining on the climate crisis: Must we change? Can we change? Will we change? Gore than takes a swipe at Donald Trump\u2019s administration, saying: On the first question, must we change, most people in the world are now convinced; but we are reminded by some recent elections and appointments that not everyone is there. It\u2019s just been confirmed that 2016 was the hottest year in recorded history, Gore continues, for the third year running. And he adds that the public are seeing the consequences: Every night on the television news now is like a nature hike through the Book of Revelations. People are connecting the dots and coming to the realisation that the answer to that first question is yes. On \u2018can we change?\u2019, Gore says the cost of renewable energy is coming down as dramatically as computer chips. And on \u2018will we change?\u2019, Gore says the Paris Agreement is \u201cthe most inspiring and greatest accomplishment since the whole negotiating process began\u201d. It has sent a signal to business, individuals, civil society - that signal has been received and had a dramatic change. The link between the pound and the FTSE 100 continues to hold. A dip in sterling - partly on profit taking after Tuesday\u2019s gains in the wake of UK prime minister Theresa May\u2019s Brexit speech - has given a lift to the leading index. The FTSE 100 - which is full of overseas earners who benefit when the pound is weaker - closed up 27.23 points or 0.38% at 7247.61. The pound is currently down 0.8% against the dollar at $1.2304 and 0.5% lower against the euro at \u20ac1.1521. Jasper Lawler, senior market analyst at London Capital Group, said: Trading on the FTSE was muted the day after suffering its biggest loss in six months. The British pound, drifting lower in a correction of its biggest daily gain since 2008, helped the UK equity benchmark to modest gains. We view the move in the British pound following Prime Minister\u2019s speech as a game-changer and as such don\u2019t anticipate a near-term resumption of the record winning streak for the FTSE 100. UK multinationals, like Burberry, still stand to benefit from a weak pound. The shift in sentiment in the pound means that gains could now be more concentrated in specific companies and industries, rather than the entire UK stock market. In Europe, Germany\u2019s Dax added 0.51% to 11,599.39 while France\u2019s Cac has closed 0.13% higher at 4853.40. On Wall Street the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently 20 points or 0.1% lower. Just 21% of delegates at WEF this year are female, despite years of pressure (companies can send an extra delegate as long as one member of the party is a woman). IMF chief Christine Lagarde has highlighted the scale of the problem. We just ran into Liam Fox, the UK\u2019s secretary of state for international trade, as he arrived at WEF. Fox says he\u2019s at Davos make the the case for free trade, and make sure that global markets don\u2019t \u201csilt up\u201d. He\u2019s also here to support Theresa May, who gives a special address to Davos on Thursday morning. Sitting alongside Pierre Moscovici, economist Joseph Stiglitz says that if Europe can\u2019t build the institutions to make the euro work it should admit that it has failed. Unless there is such a mechanism, he says, Europe should \u201cface reality, say this has been an interesting experiment but currencies come and go.\u201d Stiglitz says Europe should not give up on integration, but should simply go about it in a different way. The euro, he says, has \u201cundermined solidarity\u201d. The answer to Europe\u2019s problems is to have more Europe, not less, Moscovici adds (isn\u2019t it always?!). \u201cWe need more convergence, more policy tools, a budget and a minster of finance for the EU. We must invest more.\u201d Pierre Moscovici, the EU commissioner for the economy, is speaking at a session on The European Disunion. He admits that people are not happy. \u201cPeople suffer from too weak growth, too high unemployment and too much debt. There\u2019s economic anger and cultural anger.\u201d But he insists that the \u201cEU is solid and a unique model\u201d. The three things Europe needs are economic efficiency, to protect its citizens, and to be more democratic and accountability. Guy Standing, professor at the School of Oriental and African Studies (SOAS)  has been telling Davos that the time has come for a universal income for all citizens. Standing says he has been making the case for a basic income to be paid to everyone regardless of whether they are rich or poor for many years but the idea has recently started to get attention because of the fears of job losses from automation. \u201cA basic income is not a panacea but it is part of the new redistribution we should be building for the 21st Century.\u201d Standing says there are three arguments for a basic income: social justice, freeing people from those wielding arbitrary power, and the provision of basic security.He says a basic income is easily affordable and could be paid for by taking the proceeds of \u201crentier capitalism. \u201cThe returns to property and intellectual property and natural resources are going to a minority and we must do something about that.\u201d Standing bemoans the fact that Britain did not use its oil revenues during the North Sea boom to set up a sovereign wealth fund. \u201cHad Britain set up a sovereign wealth fund, as Norway did, it could be paying out more than a basic income\u201d, he said. In one of those \u2018only at Davos\u2019 moments, 17 Pok\u00e9mon Go \u201cPok\u00e9stops\u201d have been set up around the ski resort to (possibly) raise awareness of inequality. It\u2019s the brainchild of film director Richard Curtis\u2019s development agency, called Project Everyone. Stops include worthy causes like \u201cZero Hunger\u201d and \u201cGood Health.\u201d According to Business Insider, Olympic medal-winning sprinter Michael Johnson and celebrity chef Jamie Oliver have been spotted playing the game. Curtis is hoping that others follow suit, saying: \u201cI\u2019m hoping a surprising number might think it is quite an amusing thing to do. I\u2019ve noticed the Davos audience are quite willing to laugh at even quite weak jokes, because they\u2019re looking for entertainment!\u201d Just be careful on those icy pavements... Away from Davos for a moment once more, and US consumer prices rose in December, up 2.1% year on year mainly due to higher fuel prices as crude recovered more ground from its recent lows. That was the biggest year on year gain since the middle of 2014 and rose from a figure of 1.7% in November, although it was in line with analysts\u2019 expectations. The month on month figure showed a rise of 0.3% in the consumer price index, compared to 0.2% in November. With price pressures increasing - especially if Donald Trump follows through with his promises to boost spending - the chances of a US rate hike are also rising. When the Federal Reserve increased rates in December, it predicted three more rises this year. James Knightley, senior economist at ING Bank, said: Both headline and core inflation are rising faster than 2% year on year, helping to build the case for further Fed rate hikes. US consumer price inflation came in exactly in line for December with the headline rate rising 0.3% month on month leading to an annual inflation rate of 2.1% versus 1.7% in November. The core (ex food and energy) rose 0.2% month on month leaving the annual rate at 2.2% versus 2.1% previously. This is the first time that both headline and core US inflation is rising at 2% or more since the second quarter of 2014. Fuel prices were the main culprit with energy prices rising 1.5% month on month and transportation costs increasing 1% month on month. Most other components rose 0.2% or 0.3% but there was some softness in food (flat on the month) and apparel (-0.7% month on month). With headline inflation likely to move up towards 2.5% in the second half of the year and President Trump promising pro-growth and pro-job policies in what already is a fairly strong story, it means further Federal Reserve rate hikes are not far away. We expect the next one in March with a further move higher in the third quarter of 2017. Europe needs to spend more on defence to protect the Transatlantic Alliance, says Germany\u2019s defence minister. Ursula von der Leyen told a panel that: Europe has to take a fair share of the burden. It\u2019s not at that point that now, so we have to invest more in defence. We want a strong European pillar within Nato, she continues, and the ability to tackle more problems in Africa. Nato\u2019s future bas been cast into doubt by Donald Trump; von der Leyen see a bright future, though. I\u2019m very confident that this wonderful and precious friendship will last long. Von der Leyen says the Alliance between the US and Europe goes beyond military issues; it is based on a long period of friendship and trust, and shared values: We are fighting for something \u2014 for democracy, for the open society, the rule of law. Frederick Pempe, CEO of The Atlantic Council, agrees, saying that he\u2019s caution against seeing the \u2018death knell\u2019 of the Transatlantic Alliance. Currently, the US spends $600bn per year on military spending, while European countries spend $300bn. Facebook\u2019s Sheryl Sandberg is also on this panel about \u2018positive narratives\u2019. She explains how it\u2019s important that people have a \u2018common understanding\u2019 of the past, to help create a shared identity. That\u2019s not helped, of course, by the flood of fake news and online misinformation we\u2019ve seen recently on places like, well, Facebook..... If you look at the history of mankind, you see that societal change and progress is a messy thing, Meg Whitman continues. Her message to leaders at Davos is to \u201cbe the change you want to create\u201d. Sometimes these problems are so overwhelming that if you carve out something that matters to you, that you can make a big difference to, that can push the ball down the field. Technology has pulled 100s of millions of people out of poverty, it has connected a lot of people, it has modernised agriculture and medicine. But it\u2019s also creating economic dislocation, the HP boss continues. It\u2019s up to leaders in this room, particularly in the technology field, to think \u2018how do we help manage the transition of people who have been disrupted by robotics or automation\u2019 -- which by the way is a far bigger cause of job losses in the US than economic globalisation. That includes retraining workforces, pooling hiring across companies, to create opportunities for people where they are. Despite the gloom in the global economy, is there a \u2018positive narrative\u2019 out there? On a panel session in the main hall (livefeed here), documentary maker Sharmeen Obaid- Chinoy says technology is giving people more control. People want to take ownership of their stories, especially young people. There are a lot of anxieties. Violence against women in many parts of the world has gone up, but so has access to technology and women are now more aware of their rights. Young people are now beginning to break free. Their anxieties focus on if they\u2019ll have the same opportunities as their grandparents. Will they be told what do by the leaders in their countries, or will they break through? I see less anxiety in the places I work, and more hope. Christine Lagarde, head of the IMF, says that there needs to be a better discussion about the impact that technology has on jobs. Meg Whitman of HP is blunter, saying that \u201csome of the chickens have come home to roost\u201d. That includes: Declining trust in institutions Economic dislocation leading to the refugee crisis Economic dislocation caused by technology. And technology will only have a bigger impact, she warns, as AI, robotics and 3D printing all develop. So \u201cwe need to create a new narrative\u201d, Whitman adds, based on the right thing for the economy, and giving more hope to people who have been dislocated by technology. Here\u2019s a video clip of Joe Biden telling the global elite at Davos to pull their weight. Mike Gregoire, the chief executive of software giant CA Technologies, has criticised the idea that simply taxing the 1% richest more will solve our economic problems. Speaking to me at Davos, he says the key is to invest more in science, technology, engineering and mathematics skills, to help people in the new economy (a theme Joe Biden touched on in his speech too). Gregoire says: The lack of both business and governments, and I say both, focusing on retraining people in STEM education for the jobs of the future, rather than trying to protect a job of the past, needs a lot more work. The notion of this 1% - it\u2019s a very convenient argument. The math doesn\u2019t work. If you want to talk about taxpayers - I\u2019m a 60% taxpayer, and my company is a 30% taxpayer. If you charge every company and every person, you can\u2019t tax them enough that it would make a difference if you haven\u2019t attacked the fundamental problem. The fundamental problem is that the economy is changing, and the value curve is changing, and the skill sets are changing, and that\u2019s what we should focus our attention on. Gregoire adds that modern manufacturing is much cleaner than in the past, has fewer people and it\u2019s highly automated - and that automation will increase. So what are you doing to prepare people for that economy, rather than the economy of the past? CA supports several organisations that promote STEM skills, including Tech Girls Rock. Gregoire is also a board member of Npower, which helps minorities develop the skills to get a tech job. Gregoire explains why this is important: We\u2019re talking about a whole generation of folks who could add value to our economy, and they just don\u2019t have the skills because they haven\u2019t been trained to be able to participate. That\u2019s something we can all help lean into. Here\u2019s foreign policy expert David Rothkopf on Biden\u2019s farewell speech. While Joe Biden was criticising Russia, his predecessor Al Gore was speaking at the Davos Arctic Camp - set up by climate scientists to focus attention on global warning. We should hear more from Gore later today (he\u2019s on a climate panel at 6pm Davos time) Here\u2019s our economics editor Larry Elliott on today\u2019s top-level panel on the middle class crisis. The head of the International Monetary Fund, Christine Lagarde, has called for urgent action to tackle a middle-class crisis as she warned that inequality, distrust and a lack of hope were fuelling growing political populism. Speaking at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Lagarde said she had first highlighted the dangers of rising inequality four years ago but had been ignored. \u201cI hope people will listen now,\u201d she said. Lagarde said the gulf between rich and poor was evident from an Oxfam report showing that eight billionaires own the same amount of wealth as the poorest half of the world\u2019s population \u2013 3.6 billion people. \u201cWith lower growth, more inequality and much more transparency, you have the good ingredients for a crisis of the middle classes in the advanced economies,\u201d she said. Here\u2019s the full story: Away from Davos briefly and some more reaction to the UK jobs numbers. Some analysts, while acknowleding the latest figures are generally positive, wonder if the momentum can continue. Nina Skero, managing economist at the Centre for Economics and Business Research, said: Given the low unemployment rate and still modest, but accelerating wage growth it may be difficult to think of the labour market as anything but robust. However, other indicators suggest that a labour market softening may not be far off. The latest employment figures saw a decline of 9,000 persons compared to the June to August period. Correspondingly, the proportion of people in work decreased by 0.1 percentage points compared to June to August 2016 and now stands at 74.5%. The Claimant Count statistics, which are considered experimental by the ONS but are the most timely, also suggest that the labour market may be losing some steam. In December 2016, the number of people claiming unemployment related benefits declined by 10,100 compared to November 2016 but was 26,900 higher than in December 2015. With the economy set for a slowdown in 2017 and 2018, many firms will be more reluctant to hire. A worst case scenario could even see some businesses lay off existing staff. For instance, many companies that rely on imports find themselves in a tricky situation given that a weaker pound has increased their production costs but they are unable to raise prices drastically due to fear of losing market share. One option for such firms will be to cut down on spending by reducing head counts. On the bright side, although the labour market may soften in the coming year it is starting its marginal decline from a place of strength. While we expect the unemployment rate to increase from current levels in 2017, it will remain below rates seen for much of 2015 and 2014. The real risk lies within wage growth which despite the acceleration in the most recent data has been unimpressive in the post-crisis period and now stands to be overtaken by inflation. Sam Hill, senior UK economist at RBC Europe, said: The main headlines from the UK labour market report continued the recent run of relatively optimistic news on the state of the economy. The unemployment rate held at 4.8%, the fall in the level of employment of 9k 3m/3m was smaller than the 35k decrease expected and average earnings growth picked up to 2.8% 3m/y (inc. bonuses), the strongest since September 2015. Private sector average earnings growth is now above 3% 3m/y and above 4% 3m/y in the retail/restaurant sector, each for the first time since Q3 2015. The relative weakness in terms of private sector pay is the financial and business service sector where growth is just 1.9% 3m/y. As with the inflation data yesterday, this development won\u2019t ease the MPC\u2019s concerns about the anticipated period of above-target CPI. In our assessment there is a very good chance that unemployment rises to 4.9% next month, but the more concerning element of the report is the news on total hours worked (but also note the highest number of redundancies at 123k since Q1 2014). In the three months to November 2016 total hours worked fell 1.2mn compared to the three months to August. This comprises both the modest fall in the level of employment as well as a reduction in average hours worked to 31.9/wk... As we flagged recently, the near-term risk to our 1.2% 2017 GDP forecast is that the headwinds we have identified don\u2019t materialise as quickly as expected at the start of the year, with survey evidence on the outlook remaining impressive at the end of 2016. That is likely to lead the Bank of England to revise up its GDP forecast at the February Inflation Report but the scale of any such optimistic revisions should be tempered given the context of less encouraging news on the quantity of labour being used in the economy. London mayor Sadiq Khan is in Davos today, as part of his push to protect the capital, and its financial centre, from harm from Britain\u2019s exit from the EU. He\u2019s holding various meeting, and will also address business leaders tonight at a Morgan Stanley dinner. According to his office, he will say: \u201cSecuring privileged access to the single market must be the top priority for the negotiations. It\u2019s critical for London. Nothing else will do. It can\u2019t be brushed aside \u2013 as it was yesterday. \u201cA hard-line approach to Brexit \u2026\u2026. could rip Britain apart. \u201cAnd if we continue on this path - towards a \u2018Hard Brexit\u2019 \u2013 we risk having to explain to future generations why we knowingly put their economy, their prosperity and their place on the world stage in such peril.\u201d Biden left the stage to a rousing standing ovation - but I suspect it won\u2019t be last time we see him at Davos: The FT\u2019s Katie Martin has a good take on Joe Biden\u2019s sting criticism of Russia, in his final speech as vice-president. US vice president Joe Biden has pointed the finger of blame specifically at Russia for seeking to \u201cwhittle away at the edges of the European project.\u201d The country, he said, is \u201ctesting the fault lines between western nations.\u201d Mr Biden described himself as a committed supporter of globalisation, while issuing a plea to defend the \u201cliberal international order\u201d and the close ties between the US and Europe that he describes as key to securing prosperity and security. \u201cImpulses to hunker down, to build walls, are precisely the wrong answer,\u201d he said. Here\u2019s the full story: Biden ends his final speech as US vice-president with a rousing call for Europe and the US to \u201clead the fight\u201d to defend the values that created today\u2019s world. That means: A fight for democracy, a fight to reject isolationism and protectionism\u201d. Quite a way to bow out of office. Biden then turns to geopolitics, and singles out Russia. Under president Putin, Russia has been testing the fault lines in other nations, says Biden. It is trying to return to a world of \u2018spheres of influences\u2019, even sending \u2018little green men\u2019 across borders to stir up separatism in Ukraine. And he insists that Nato\u2019s \u2018sacred\u2019 commitment to defend each other from attacks can never be questioned (a nudge towards Donald Trump, who has suggested the alliance is obsolete) Looking into his audience of global leaders in Davos, Biden says a \u201cprogressive tax system\u201d where everyone pays a fair share will help address the crisis. And he appeals to their better nature, saying: I told a group of you last night - the top 1%\u2019s not carrying their weight You\u2019re not bad guys, you\u2019re good guys. If you speak to the public and ask if they\u2019d rather have free college education, or a raise - they\u2019d take the free college education, Biden continues. Biden also says that people also need \u201ccontinuing education\u201d through their lives to help them adjust to technology change, and we must ensure basic protections for workers. Millions of people around the world have benefitted from globalisation and new technology, Biden continues. But in other places, factories are closing and jobs are being lost. Taken together, these forces are effectively hollowing out the middle-class, the traditional engine of economic growth and social stability in Western nations. We cannot undo the changes that technology has wrought in our world, nor should we try. But we can and we must take action to mitigate the economic trends that are stoking unrest in so many advanced economies and undermining people\u2019s basic sense of dignity. Biden is speaking about how the liberal world order pioneered by the US and Europe after world war 2 delivered unprecedented growth and security; but it is now at threat. He explains how his father had explained that a job was about more than just a pay cheque; it was also about self respect and worth. And he talks about how workers are losing out: In my country, there used to be a basic bargain since the mid-20th century, agreed by both parties.... If you contributed to the success of the enterprise that you were engaged, you got to share the success and the profits. Biden begins by telling that there is \u201cpalpable uncertainty about the state of the world.\u201d And he doesn\u2019t mean the transfer of power in America this week. In two days there will be a new president of the United States...  calls out one delegate. No, Biden replies. The challenges we face, and the choices we must make as an international community doesn\u2019t hinge exclusively on Washington\u2019s leadership. Whether we reinforce the ties that bind us or whether we unravel under the current pressure. These choices must be made by very single nation. Davos delegates have flooding into the main hall here to watch the set-piece event of the morning, vice-president Joe Biden\u2019s final speech in office. Biden gets a warm, standing ovation as he arrives on stage. And he gets a second round of applause as he introduces himself as \u201cvice-president for the next 48 hours, and after that I\u2019ll be able to say what I really think\u201d. You can watch it live here: The number of people in work in the UK dipped slightly in the three months to November compared to the previous quarter, but average weekly earnings came in higher than expected and the claimant count for December fell by more than forecast. The jobless rate for the three months held at an 11 year low of 4.8%, in line with forecasts, and unemployment fell from 1.65m to 1.6m. But the number of people in work fell by 9,000 to just over 31.8m. This is the second report in a row to show a dip in the number of people in work, perhaps suggesting a slight degree of reluctance among employers in the wake of the Brexit vote. Average weekly earnings including bonuses rose from 2.6% to 2.8% compared to expectations of a figure of 2.6%. The number of people claiming unemployment benefits fell by 10,100 in December after rising by 1,300 in the previous month. Analysts had expected a rise of 5,000 in the claimant figures. Naeem Aslam, chief market analyst at ThinkMarkets UK, said: We had another set of promising economic data today which has shown that average earnings have increased and unemployment claims have fallen. It was important that the average earning index picks up pace to keep up with inflation. The inflation data released earlier has already brought headache for the MPC members and it is not a good news for consumers because their purchase power is going to see a dramatic impact. Households will have to dig deeper in their pockets and if their earnings do not match inflation, we have a problem. Suren Thiru, head of economics at the British Chambers of Commerce, said: Overall, with employment levels still close to record levels and unemployment continuing to fall, the latest indicators confirm that the UK jobs market remains a major bright spot for the UK economy. While labour market conditions could soften over the next year as economic growth slows, the high degree of flexibility in the jobs market will help limit the extent of any uptick in unemployment. Although there was a welcome pick-up in average earnings growth, the gap between wage and price growth is narrowing. If this continues as we expect, real household incomes will be squeezed further, stifling consumer spending, which is a key driver of UK economic growth. Elsewhere in Davos, delegates have been discussing the gender divide, and how fighting stereotypes can fix it: Do any of the global elite do their own laundry, I wonder... Another takeaway from that session: Italian finance minister Pier Carlo Padoan concludes the session on the middle class crisis with a three-point plan. 1) We need to take populists seriously, he argues, and not just paint them as the bad guys. Often they are the good guys, with genuine concerns about the future. 2) There is no \u201csilver bullet\u201d or short cut to fixing the economic problems fuelling populism. The solutions are complicated 3) Policymakers must deliver a vision of a better future; something that is lacking in Europe right now. Lagarde insists there is still time for \u201ccourageous\u201d politicians to reconnect with the people. They must create policies that address concerns such, as what future their children face and what safety net will be in place. There is hope, and I don\u2019t think we should be resigned to taking the situation as it is. Lagarde argues that globalisation needs to take \u201ca new turn\u201d, and we need more analytical work how jobs are being lost to new technologies. She says: To turn our back to globalisation, to helping development, is entirely the wrong approach. She also cites Oxfam\u2019s warning that the 8th richest people own as much wealth as the poorest half of the population. More from Larry Summers: Hedge fund chief Ray Dalio warns that the age of globalisation may be over, as provincialism and nationalism rise. Larry Summers, though, points out that Dalio won\u2019t suffer -- he\u2019ll manage to position himself in the markets whatever happens. The people who will be the victims of populist policies are the lower income and middle class people in whose name the policy is offered. Italy\u2019s finance minister points out that many Europeans blame the leaders in Brussels, or the central bankers in Frankfurt, for the situation today. Larry Summers, though, disputes whether concerns over income inequality really explain the crisis in the middle classes. The US has just elected the world\u2019s biggest example of conspicuous consumption, he says That is a bizarre manifestation of a concern over inequality. Many people think \u201ctoo much is being done for the poor, rather than that too little is being done for the poor\u201d. Summers argues that the surge in support for populism is due to issues like \u201cnational unity and strength\u201d, not just envy over wealth. Lagarde reveals that she felt a backlash from economists, including in the IMF, after she warned about rising inequality in 2013. Policymakers need to get the signal now, and really think about how to address the public discontent. That means fiscal and structural reforms, and effective monetary policies, but it also includes redistributing wealth better, the IMF chief says: It needs to be granular, it needs to be regional, it needs to be focused on what will people get out of it. It probably includes more redistibution than we have in place at the moment. Bridgewater\u2019s Ray Dalio says populism is now the biggest issue in the global economy, overtaking central banks. Harvard professor Larry Summers says that populism is on the rise because many people in the middle classes of advanced economies feel their governments aren\u2019t fighting for them. They feel the governments are fighting for people in developing countries, for people who have recently come into their countries, for minority groups who used to suffer discrimination, but not the people \u201cin the centre of the country\u201d. They feel they are not being heard, and they\u2019ve expressed that in the Brexit vote, the Italian referendum and in the US election. Italian finance minister Pier Carlo Padoan agrees with Christine Lagarde that the middle classes are in crisis. It is hard to find a country where there isn\u2019t dissatisfaction with the situation today, says Padoan. He cites changes in wealth and income distribution - and about people\u2019s expectations. The middle class is disillusion about the future, disappointed about the figure of their children, and unhappy about the benefits they\u2019re receiving from the state. The session gets under way - here\u2019s a live feed: Christine Lagarde speaks first, and agrees that the middle classes in advanced economies are now in crisis. The middle class is both growing and shrinking, she points out.. Globally, it\u2019s grown from 7% of the global population to 13%. But in America, it\u2019s shrunk from 60-ish% to 50-ish% -- with more money accumulating at the top. That is combined with signs of lack of trust, lack of hope, disenchantment with the vision of the future. With lower growth, more inequality and much more transparency, you have the good ingredients for a crisis of the middle classes in the advanced economies. Speaking of things that make people angry... Here\u2019s the pitch for the first big session of the morning: Squeezed and Angry: How to Fix the Middle-Class Crisis The middle class is squeezed and aggrieved. Once the lynchpin of developed economies, it\u2019s now threatened by job losses and stagnant wages, paving the way for the rise of populism. In emerging markets, middle class growth rates are stalling. Have middle class problems been forgotten? What can be done? IMF Managing Director Christine Lagarde, Italian Finance Minister Pier Carlo Padoan and Founder, Chairman and Co-CIO of Bridgewater Associates, Ray Dalio, discuss what\u2019s needed to restore growth in the middle class and confidence in the future. Good morning from Davos, where the second day of the World Economic Forum is getting underway. Today, some of the world\u2019s richest and most powerful people will be discussing why the rest of the population are increasingly angry and disillusioned with the state of the world. The managing director of the International Monetary Fund, Christine Lagarde, will ponder how to fix the middle class crisis, alongside Italian finance minister Pier Carlo Padoan and Harvard professor Larry Summers. Plus, (this is Davos after all) a billionaire! Ray Dalio, founder of hedge fund Bridgewater Associates, will also chip in. Hopefully we\u2019ll get some decent ideas on how to boost employment prospects and income growth. After yesterday\u2019s focus on globalisation, potential trade wars and president Trump, today will also focus on climate change. A group of scientists has set up an Arctic base camp in Davos, to highlight the dangers of climate change and the warming ice caps. And we salute them for sleeping out in tents last night -- when it was minus 16 degrees C. Europe is also on the agenda, with panel sessions on Brexit, the European Union, and the Transatlantic Alliance. There\u2019s also going to be a scrum to see Joe Biden address delegates, on his final overseas trip as vice-president. Here\u2019s some of the key events today: 9am Davos time/8am GMT: Panel: How to fix the middle-class crisis 10am/9am GMT: Arctic basecamp press conference 10.30am/9.30am GMT: Special address by Joe Biden 1.45pm/12.45pm GMT: Is the Transatlantic Alliance at a tipping point? 2.45pm/1.45pm Fixing European disunion 5pm/4pm GMT: How to accelerate the fight against climate change, with Al Gore",

Good results from Logitech and Banco Santander were also a factor in the confident mood on the continent.</p> <p>But with the dollar weakening and pushing the pound to six week highs - sterling is now up 0.8% at $1.2620 - the FTSE 100 has missed out on much of the gains. The leading UK index is packed with overseas earners who have benefited from a weak pound but tend to lose ground when sterling strengthens. So the final scores in Europe showed:</p> <ul> <li><strong>The FTSE 100 edged up 0.2% or 14.09 points to 7164.43</strong></li> <li><strong>Germany\u2019s Dax rose 1.82% to 11,806.05</strong></li> <li><strong>France\u2019s Cac climbed 0.99% to 4877.67</strong></li> <li><strong>Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB finished 0.42% higher at 19,582.23</strong></li> <li><strong>Spain\u2019s Ibex ended up 1.73% at 9549.3</strong></li> <li><strong>In Greece, the Athens market added 1.96% to 659.19</strong></li> </ul> <p>On Wall Street the Dow is now up 144 points or 0.7% at 20,056.</p> <p><em>On that note, it\u2019s time to close for the evening.

But Laith Khalaf, senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Stock indices in the US and UK may well be at or near record highs, however when the earnings generated by companies in these markets are factored in, stock valuations show neither the extreme pessimism of 2008, nor the irrational exuberance of 1999. This means they are trading somewhere in the middle of their range, so are neither exceptionally cheap or hideously expensive. In the short term the stock market could move in either direction, but for long term investors it still makes sense to keep a healthy slug of their portfolio in equities.</p> <p>Meanwhile bonds have come under pressure of late, as it looks like the US central bank is in the mood to raise interest rates this year. However there have been many false dusks for the bond market, which has defied expectations since ultra-loose monetary policy was initiated all those years ago in response to the financial crisis. Central banks in the UK, Europe and Japan are still engaged in stimulative activity, and while the US Fed is starting to push in the opposite direction, it\u2019s likely to err on the side of caution lest by raising rates too soon it damages the US economy, and propels an already strong dollar even further upwards. While the best days for the bond market may be behind us, there\u2018s no sign that interest rates are going to return to pre-crisis levels any time soon, which acts as an anchor on rising yields.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5888d840e4b0cea1f09276aa\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-01-25T16:55:10.715Z\">4.55pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>And here\u2019s the response to the Dow crossing 20,000 from the man most analysts say helped the recent surge in stock markets.

Reuters writes:</p> <blockquote> <p>Italy\u2019s constitutional court said on Wednesday that part of a contested electoral law was invalid, but left much of the system intact in a ruling that could open the way for early elections in 2017. </p> <p> In a written verdict, the court rejected the idea that national elections could be held over two rounds, but agreed that any party which took at least 40 percent of the vote straight out should win an automatic parliamentary majority. </p> <p> The court said the amended law could now be used immediately if elections were called. A vote is not scheduled until early 2018 but former Prime Minister Matteo Renzi, who still heads the ruling Democratic Party, has said he wants a ballot held as soon as possible.</p> </blockquote> <p>The news has taken some of the shine off the Italian stock market, with the FTSE MIB losing much of its earlier gains. It is now up 0.43% at 19579 having at one point reached 19746.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5888cb8de4b0cea1f0927647\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-01-25T16:05:13.128Z\">4.05pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>It is not just the Dow in uncharted territory.</p> <p>The S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq Composite both ended at new highs on Tuesday, and in morning trading they have added to their gains. The S&amp;P is currently 0.6% higher, while Nasdaq is 0.74% better.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5888c68be4b086d04fad003b\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-01-25T15:42:25.290Z\">3.42pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>And some seem confident the US rally will continue. Jasper Lawler, senior market analyst at London Capital Group, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>For all the supposed uncertainty surrounding the new President, it only took two full days in office for the Dow to breach 20,000. It comes a day after the S&amp;P 500 hit a new record high.</p> <p>Dow 20k came on the same day President Trump was preparing to sign an executive order to build a wall on the US-Mexican border. The big industrial giants including Caterpillar and General Electric led the gains on the expectation of an increase in infrastructure spending under Trump. A lot of diggers will be needed to build the wall! In reality, Trump can start the building, but will need help from Congress to get it finished.</p> <p>Building a Wall on the US-Mexican border was Donald Trump\u2019s most famous and probably most controversial campaign promise. He will also sign an executive order designed to limit immigration. Actually following through with his \u201cGreat Wall\u201d is a sign of intent. It is our view that the gains in the stock market are not just a function of companies winning infrastructure business. Investors are gaining certainty from Trump turning his promises to reality.</p> <p>There are a number of psychological factors at work when the stock market crosses these big barriers that we will be watching. Widespread reporting of Dow 20k will create a FOMO (fear of missing out) effect on the under-invested, generating more buying interest. On the other hand, the 20,000 level will attract profit-taking from some long-time stock market bulls, causing a counteracting selling force.</p> <p>We remain confident in the durability of the US stock market rally. If Donald Trump will build a wall, there\u2019s every reason to believe he will cut taxes, increase spending and cut regulation- all good things for US companies.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7f455e286f8c1584cb93e646184a2db02932ab0a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7f455e286f8c1584cb93e646184a2db02932ab0a/0_137_4096_2459/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The New York Stock Exchange.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The New York Stock Exchange.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andrew Gombert/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5888c4d0e4b029dbeb0a6509\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-01-25T15:32:47.420Z\">3.32pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>There was some relief among analysts that the Dow had finally made it. Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>In all honesty it couldn\u2019t have come a moment too soon, finally putting us out of our misery so we can start to focus on something else more important.</p> <p>On a serious note, while it\u2019s important to acknowledge the breaking of a significant milestone, in the broader scheme of things it probably doesn\u2019t matter that much, apart from giving investors a feel good boost.</p> <p>Of more importance is whether or not it is able to sustain these gains at a time when US stocks are already considered expensive.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5888c3cde4b029dbeb0a6501\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-01-25T15:30:11.361Z\">3.30pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>It looked for a while as if the Trump rally which followed the election of the US president was about to run out of steam, as the Dow tried and failed a couple of times to breach the 20,000 barrier. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The Trump rally seemed to have disappeared as Christmas turned into the New Year. However, with the thin-skinned President now in power and talking about stripping back regulations and building his infamous wall, investors have begun to get excited all over again. Following yesterday\u2019s late rally the Dow Jones rose by 130 points as the bell rang on Wall Street, in the process breaking that 20,000 psychological barrier.</p> <p>These good vibes travelled over to Europe, where the DAX and CAC rocketed 2% and 1.2% respectively. That leaves the German index at its highest point since May 2015, and only 600 points from its own all-time record.</p> <p>It wasn\u2019t all explosive growth for the Western markets this Wednesday. The FTSE could only manage a paltry 0.3% rise, laughable in the face of what was produced elsewhere, thanks to the pound\u2019s continued recovery. With Theresa May announcing that the government would produce a Brexit whitepaper sterling\u2019s early growth was firmed up, the currency benefiting from the increasing clarity on the how Britain intends to divorce the EU. Against the dollar it jumped by 0.7%, hitting its best level since mid-December, while against the euro it crossed 1.17 for the first time since January 6<sup>th</sup>. It will be interesting to see if the pound can continue to build on these gains tomorrow, especially if a bill on Article 50 is actually produced.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5888c0cee4b0cea1f09275f5\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-01-25T15:17:18.980Z\">3.17pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Here\u2019s CNBC covering the moment the Dow passed 20,000, pointing out that unlike the last time it attempted to cross this level, this move comes after a number of businesses including Boeing have reported well received updates.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/CNBCnow/status/824269343550820352\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">WATCH: The moment that the Dow hit 20,000 for the first time ever <a href=\"https://t.co/0fvzncrKtP\">pic.twitter.com/0fvzncrKtP</a></p>&mdash; CNBC Now (@CNBCnow) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/CNBCnow/status/824269343550820352\">January 25, 2017</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5888bd1ce4b029dbeb0a64d0\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-01-25T14:59:27.717Z\">2.59pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>And here are the big movers so far in the Dow:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8163a38b820b08b7c9f9124b67606e825222bea1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8163a38b820b08b7c9f9124b67606e825222bea1/0_0_637_684/466.jpg\" alt=\"Dow movers\" width=\"466\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dow movers</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Thomson Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Boeing is up after its results, while the likes of Caterpillar are expected to benefit from Trump\u2019s plans to build a wall on the Mexican border.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2017-01-25T15:46:34.880Z\">at 3.46pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5888ba23e4b0cea1f09275d0\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-01-25T14:53:49.677Z\">2.53pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The Dow has breached the 20,000 barrier just two months after crossing through 19,000, as the rally following Donald Trump\u2019s election as US president hit its stride.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4f277db240626654a853183303a47ca30dfb87e1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4f277db240626654a853183303a47ca30dfb87e1/0_0_1180_759/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Dow hits 20,000\" width=\"1000\" height=\"643\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dow hits 20,000</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Thomson Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5888b93ee4b0cea1f09275cb\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/dominic-rushe\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-01-25T14:43:41.039Z\">2.43pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The new Wall Street record comes after a few attempts at the 20,000 barrier.

It broke the barrier of Wednesday after infrastructure stocks rose sharply ahead of the market\u2019s open, boosted by Trump\u2019s renewed pledge to build a wall along the Mexican border and talks of massive infrastructure investment.

                "bodyText":"The global market surge which has led to the Dow Jones Industrial Average finally breaking through the 20,000 has also seen other markets move higher. The records set by the Dow, S&amp;P and Nasdaq Composite, boosted by the Trump rally and reasonable updates from US stalwarts such as Boeing, have helped lift European markets. Good results from Logitech and Banco Santander were also a factor in the confident mood on the continent. But with the dollar weakening and pushing the pound to six week highs - sterling is now up 0.8% at $1.2620 - the FTSE 100 has missed out on much of the gains. The leading UK index is packed with overseas earners who have benefited from a weak pound but tend to lose ground when sterling strengthens. So the final scores in Europe showed: The FTSE 100 edged up 0.2% or 14.09 points to 7164.43 Germany\u2019s Dax rose 1.82% to 11,806.05 France\u2019s Cac climbed 0.99% to 4877.67 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB finished 0.42% higher at 19,582.23 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended up 1.73% at 9549.3 In Greece, the Athens market added 1.96% to 659.19 On Wall Street the Dow is now up 144 points or 0.7% at 20,056. On that note, it\u2019s time to close for the evening. Thanks for your comments, and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. There is much talk about whether the current stock market levels mean we are in a new bubble phase (leading fund manager Neil Woodford recently compared the euphoria of recent months to the dotcom boom and bust). But Laith Khalaf, senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: Stock indices in the US and UK may well be at or near record highs, however when the earnings generated by companies in these markets are factored in, stock valuations show neither the extreme pessimism of 2008, nor the irrational exuberance of 1999. This means they are trading somewhere in the middle of their range, so are neither exceptionally cheap or hideously expensive. In the short term the stock market could move in either direction, but for long term investors it still makes sense to keep a healthy slug of their portfolio in equities. Meanwhile bonds have come under pressure of late, as it looks like the US central bank is in the mood to raise interest rates this year. However there have been many false dusks for the bond market, which has defied expectations since ultra-loose monetary policy was initiated all those years ago in response to the financial crisis. Central banks in the UK, Europe and Japan are still engaged in stimulative activity, and while the US Fed is starting to push in the opposite direction, it\u2019s likely to err on the side of caution lest by raising rates too soon it damages the US economy, and propels an already strong dollar even further upwards. While the best days for the bond market may be behind us, there\u2018s no sign that interest rates are going to return to pre-crisis levels any time soon, which acts as an anchor on rising yields. And here\u2019s the response to the Dow crossing 20,000 from the man most analysts say helped the recent surge in stock markets. Via Twitter of course: Away from the Dow for a moment, and early elections in Italy could be on the cards after a call ruling. Reuters writes: Italy\u2019s constitutional court said on Wednesday that part of a contested electoral law was invalid, but left much of the system intact in a ruling that could open the way for early elections in 2017. In a written verdict, the court rejected the idea that national elections could be held over two rounds, but agreed that any party which took at least 40 percent of the vote straight out should win an automatic parliamentary majority. The court said the amended law could now be used immediately if elections were called. A vote is not scheduled until early 2018 but former Prime Minister Matteo Renzi, who still heads the ruling Democratic Party, has said he wants a ballot held as soon as possible. The news has taken some of the shine off the Italian stock market, with the FTSE MIB losing much of its earlier gains. It is now up 0.43% at 19579 having at one point reached 19746. It is not just the Dow in uncharted territory. The S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq Composite both ended at new highs on Tuesday, and in morning trading they have added to their gains. The S&amp;P is currently 0.6% higher, while Nasdaq is 0.74% better. And some seem confident the US rally will continue. Jasper Lawler, senior market analyst at London Capital Group, said: For all the supposed uncertainty surrounding the new President, it only took two full days in office for the Dow to breach 20,000. It comes a day after the S&amp;P 500 hit a new record high. Dow 20k came on the same day President Trump was preparing to sign an executive order to build a wall on the US-Mexican border. The big industrial giants including Caterpillar and General Electric led the gains on the expectation of an increase in infrastructure spending under Trump. A lot of diggers will be needed to build the wall! In reality, Trump can start the building, but will need help from Congress to get it finished. Building a Wall on the US-Mexican border was Donald Trump\u2019s most famous and probably most controversial campaign promise. He will also sign an executive order designed to limit immigration. Actually following through with his \u201cGreat Wall\u201d is a sign of intent. It is our view that the gains in the stock market are not just a function of companies winning infrastructure business. Investors are gaining certainty from Trump turning his promises to reality. There are a number of psychological factors at work when the stock market crosses these big barriers that we will be watching. Widespread reporting of Dow 20k will create a FOMO (fear of missing out) effect on the under-invested, generating more buying interest. On the other hand, the 20,000 level will attract profit-taking from some long-time stock market bulls, causing a counteracting selling force. We remain confident in the durability of the US stock market rally. If Donald Trump will build a wall, there\u2019s every reason to believe he will cut taxes, increase spending and cut regulation- all good things for US companies. There was some relief among analysts that the Dow had finally made it. Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK, said: In all honesty it couldn\u2019t have come a moment too soon, finally putting us out of our misery so we can start to focus on something else more important. On a serious note, while it\u2019s important to acknowledge the breaking of a significant milestone, in the broader scheme of things it probably doesn\u2019t matter that much, apart from giving investors a feel good boost. Of more importance is whether or not it is able to sustain these gains at a time when US stocks are already considered expensive. It looked for a while as if the Trump rally which followed the election of the US president was about to run out of steam, as the Dow tried and failed a couple of times to breach the 20,000 barrier. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said: The Trump rally seemed to have disappeared as Christmas turned into the New Year. However, with the thin-skinned President now in power and talking about stripping back regulations and building his infamous wall, investors have begun to get excited all over again. Following yesterday\u2019s late rally the Dow Jones rose by 130 points as the bell rang on Wall Street, in the process breaking that 20,000 psychological barrier. These good vibes travelled over to Europe, where the DAX and CAC rocketed 2% and 1.2% respectively. That leaves the German index at its highest point since May 2015, and only 600 points from its own all-time record. It wasn\u2019t all explosive growth for the Western markets this Wednesday. The FTSE could only manage a paltry 0.3% rise, laughable in the face of what was produced elsewhere, thanks to the pound\u2019s continued recovery. With Theresa May announcing that the government would produce a Brexit whitepaper sterling\u2019s early growth was firmed up, the currency benefiting from the increasing clarity on the how Britain intends to divorce the EU. Against the dollar it jumped by 0.7%, hitting its best level since mid-December, while against the euro it crossed 1.17 for the first time since January 6th. It will be interesting to see if the pound can continue to build on these gains tomorrow, especially if a bill on Article 50 is actually produced. Here\u2019s CNBC covering the moment the Dow passed 20,000, pointing out that unlike the last time it attempted to cross this level, this move comes after a number of businesses including Boeing have reported well received updates. And here are the big movers so far in the Dow: Boeing is up after its results, while the likes of Caterpillar are expected to benefit from Trump\u2019s plans to build a wall on the Mexican border. The Dow has breached the 20,000 barrier just two months after crossing through 19,000, as the rally following Donald Trump\u2019s election as US president hit its stride. The new Wall Street record comes after a few attempts at the 20,000 barrier. Dominic Rushe writes: The Dow Jones industrial average finally broke through the 20,000 barrier on Wednesday morning \u2013 a historic high for the leading stock market index and one it has been close to breaching since Christmas. The Dow, which first nearly topped 20,000 on 13 December and again on 6 January, when it came within 0.37 points of the landmark, finally broke through after the opening bell was rung on Wall Street by Ashton Poole, CEO of lender Triangle Capital. The closing bell will be rung by executives from InBev, brewers of Stella Artois but whether the Dow\u2019s rise will go flat by then remains to be seen. The market had rallied sharply in the wake of Donald Trump\u2019s presidential victory but seemed to loose steam ahead of his first day in office. It broke the barrier of Wednesday after infrastructure stocks rose sharply ahead of the market\u2019s open, boosted by Trump\u2019s renewed pledge to build a wall along the Mexican border and talks of massive infrastructure investment. The Dow record comes as the S&amp;P 500 index, tech-heavy Nasdaq and London\u2019s FTSE 100 stock market index have all hit record highs. So is this a bubble or something sustainable? Neil Wilson at ETX Capital said The Dow has capped a remarkable rally since Donald Trump\u2019s election by finally breaking the 20,000 level. It\u2019s psychologically huge and, after a bit of pullback ahead of the inauguration, really confirms that the \u2018great rotation\u2019 from bonds to stocks is definitely upon us. Fears about protectionism are running second to optimism about inflation and growth \u2013 for now at least. Donald Trump\u2019s election victory, far from roiling markets, has been greeted with universal optimism about what it means for global growth. Something like $3trillion has been pulled from bonds and $3trillion pumped into equities. President Trump is bound to take credit for the rally, and he may well be justified to some degree... The question now is how long can this last? Economists are usually unwise to make predictions, so it\u2019s worth considering both potential outcomes. One argument says that Trump will usher in a Reaganesque shift in the US economy, fuelling a massive reallocation of investment from cash to productive capital... Trump\u2019s first steps as president have confirmed much of what investors had hoped for and that he\u2019s extremely pro-business and light on regulation for energy and financials. That\u2019s what\u2019s driving this renewed rally. The other argument claims that this is a massive bubble, irrational exuberance of the worst kind that will come unstuck when Trump fails to deliver the reflationary policies that the market is pinning its hopes on... However, bull markets normally only turn into bear markets on an expected downturn in the real economy. There is little evidence that the US is heading for recession \u2013 quite the reverse as Trump is ushering a new era of pro-business policies that affirm growth prospects. We are seeing a massive shift in investor sentiment that has seen money pour out of bonds and into equities around the world. This is a major recalibration in global stocks and bond markets \u2013 ie, not a bubble in the pure sense, although it might be rising faster than is natural. [If] this is a real rotation from bonds into stocks, ending a 30-year bond bull market, there is still a huge amount of cash piled up that could yet pour into equities and power further gains through 2017. It might not be too long before 21,000 is in sight. And it\u2019s there! The Dow Jones Industrial Average is up 116 points and has crossed through 20,000 for the first time. Just a couple of minutes now until Wall Street opens and the futures are suggesting the Dow Jones Industrial Average could indeed make 20,000 for the first time. The Trump rally and some positive trading updates from the likes of Boeing and hard drive maker Seagate look set to help push markets higher. Elsewhere, shares in BT are struggling to make any ground after Tuesday\u2019s 21% slump in the wake of an accounting scandal at its Italian business and a weak outlook for a couple of its other divisions. They have edged up 0.7% to 305.1p, but this is not exactly a big dent in Tuesday\u2019s \u00a38bn loss. Meanwhile Italian prosecutors have confirmed they are investigating BT Italy. Milan prosecutor Fabio De Pasquale told FastFT that the probe was focused on allegations of \u201cfalse accounting and embezzlement\u201d, as reported on Tuesday. And to add to BT\u2019s woes, the situation is also being looked at by the Financial Reporting Council, which said: \u201dWe are aware of BT\u2019s statement about its review of accounting issues in its Italian business and we will consider if these matters require the FRC to investigate whether the auditors fulfilled their duties.\u201d Elsewhere, the head of BT Europe Corrado Sciolla was said on Tuesday to be resigning over the scandal, and now Reuters is reporting that Luis Alvarez, the head of BT Global Service, is expected to take over the running of the European division. IG reckon that Wall Street traders can get the Dow 20k hats out. New York trading begins in 90 minutes time.... After weeks of near-misses, could the Dow Jones finally hit the 20,000 point mark today? The global stock market rally today is raising speculation that the Dow could hit this benchmark for the first time; it closed at 19,912 on Tuesday night. With every European stock market up today, the futures market suggests Wall Street will follow suit, helped by optimism that Donald Trump\u2019s plans for infrastructure spending will boost corporate profits. 20,000 is just a number, of course - but some traders would be happy to get the issue out of the way. If it does happen, expect @realDonaldTrump to take the credit.... The US dollar has dipped to a seven-week low against a basket of other major currencies (including the pound) this morning. Chris Saint, senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown Currency Services, says there is \u201cbroad-based selling pressure on the dollar\u201d. Bloomberg has more details: Boom! The pound just hit $1.26 for the first time since December 14. Newsflash from parliament: Theresa May has just revealed that the government will publish a white paper outlining its Brexit plan. That may please the City, as it will more insight into the government\u2019s ambitions for the EU exit negotiations. Andrew Sparrow\u2019s Politics Live blog has all the details: France\u2019s credit rating could come under threat if populist far-right Marine Le Pen reached the final stage of the country\u2019s presidential race, an official from Moody\u2019s has said. Reuters has the story: Asked whether Le Pen progressing to the second round would prompt Moody\u2019s to move the outlook on France\u2019s Aa2 credit rating to negative, Dietmar Hornung said, \u201cThat is the obvious thing.\u201d He gave the example of how Moody\u2019s waited until after Britain\u2019s vote to leave the European Union to put the UK\u2019s rating on a negative outlook, however. The negative impact of the rating \u201cwouldn\u2019t persist if then in the second round Fillon or Macron or whoever wins,\u201d he told Reuters. Le Pen is currently second favourite to win the presidential race, behind right-winger Francois Fillon. The latest Guardian Brexit dashboard is out! Our monthly healthcheck on the UK economy shows that the fall in the pound following the EU referendum is hurting the economy, pushing inflation higher. The latest retail sales, house prices and trade figures were all disappointing too, although the economy does seem to still be growing steadily (we get new GDP figures tomorrow). My colleague Katie Allen, who compiles the report explains: Seven months on from the referendum, the Guardian\u2019s monthly tracker of economic news shows the weaker pound is being felt in the real economy more keenly than ever, as it raises the cost of imports such as energy and food and that gets passed on to consumers as higher prices in the shops. To gauge the impact of the Brexit vote on a monthly basis, the Guardian has chosen eight economic indicators, along with the value of the pound and the performance of the FTSE. The dashboard for January shows a worse than expected performance in four of the eight categories. Two were better than expected and unemployment was as expected. Inflation was higher than economists had forecast, hitting its highest level for more than two years in December. Here\u2019s the full story: Here\u2019s the key charts: And here\u2019s Danny Blanchflower and Andrew Sentance, both former Bank of England policymakers, on the numbers. Just in: UK manufacturers are their most upbeat since January 2015, according to the latest Industrial Trends survey from the CBI. Factories also reported that domestic orders have grown strongly over the last quarter, but export growth has dipped back. The survey shows that the pound\u2019s tumble is pushing up import prices, but it\u2019s also making UK firms more competitive in the global market. And a quarter of companies reported that they are worried they can\u2019t hire skilled staff - that\u2019s the highest level since July 1989. Here\u2019s the report. Optimism over Donald Trump\u2019s spending plans are expected to push shares higher on Wall Street later today. The futures markets shows the S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq rising by 0.3%, having hit record highs on Tuesday. Relief that the supreme court\u2019s Brexit ruling is out of the way is pushing the pound towards $1.26, says Joshua Mahony, Market Analyst at IG. Despite yesterday\u2019s court decision, markets continue to enjoy a degree of clarity over the UK\u2019s path that has not been seen since June\u2019s referendum result. With Citibank and Credit Suisse the latest banks to voice their plans to move jobs out of London, it is clear that Theresa May needs to have a robust and dramatic jobs strategy if we are going to see the UK maintain growth over the coming years. The UK pound is having a good morning, rising 0.5% to hit a six-week high of $1.2598 against the dollar. This recovers yesterday\u2019s losses, which came after the supreme court\u2019s Brexit ruling. Traders are now watching to see what legislation the government brings to trigger the exit process from the EU. Rebellious Conservative MPs are now pushing for a full debate on the Brexit plan, and are concerned about Britain\u2019s likely exit from the single market and the customs union. So the pound is likely to remain volatile. Marc Ostwald of ADM Investor Services says the length of this Act will be critical: For all the furore (aka political windbagging) around yesterday\u2019s UK Constitutional Court ruling, the only real question is how \u201ctight\u201d the wording of the Act of Parliament (to trigger Article 50) will be. The trick to stopping opponents tagging on conditions would be to make the Act very short, say as little as one paragraph, which would then make it very difficult to change as the rules state that \u201camendments must be ruled to be within the scope of the original text\u201d. It should be emphasized that \u2018no one won anything\u2019 with the ruling, it is a simple principle that Parliament has to be consulted, if a proposed statute implies a change to the UK\u2019s basic law - Article 50 clearly fits that principle 100%. The pound is also up 0.4% against the euro at \u20ac1.171, meaning one euro is worth 85.3p. That will be welcomed by UK holidaymakers, and eurozone firms who export goods into the UK, points out Dublin-based broker Paul Sommerville. Here\u2019s Neil Wilson of ETX Capital on today\u2019s market moves: There\u2019s something of the Trump bump about all this. For instance, rising copper prices are a sign that global growth is turning positive off the back of his expected reflationary policies. But another leading indicator, the Baltic Dry Index, has slumped of late, a signal that fears of protectionist policies are very high. It\u2019s a mixed picture for miners and uncertain for sure. BHP Billiton was up nearly 2% as it looks set to benefit from rising metal prices. Fresnillo edged lower despite reporting record annual silver and gold production, as prices for the two metals slipped. Shares in UK eateries group Restaurant Group have slumped by 10% this morning, after another disappointing trading update. The company, which runs Frankie &amp; Benny\u2019s. Garfunkel\u2019s, Brunning &amp; Price, Chiquito and other chains, posted a 3.9% drop in like-for-like sales. It also predicted a \u2018difficult\u2019 trading performance over the next six months, as it tries to shake up its offerings to tempt customers Restaurant Group also admitted that the slump in the pound will drive up input costs, and said the apprenticeship levy, proposed increases in business rates and higher energy taxes will bring extra cost pressures. Oof!! Confidence among German executives has weakened to a five-month low. The IFO survey of German business confidence has missed forecasts, falling to 109.8 this month from 111 in December. Economists expected a small rise to 111.3 Clemens Fuest, head of the IFO economic institute, says German firms are happy with the current situation, but less optimistic about the outlook over the next six months. At times like this, we all need a laugh. And strong sales of spoof humour books and growing customer numbers at airport shops gave WH Smith reason for cheer in its latest trading update. A comic revival of Enid Blyton\u2019s Famous Five characters helped to lift like-for-like sales 1% at the retailer over the 21 weeks to 21 January, with Five on Brexit Island and Five Give up the Booze among the best-sellers. Sales at its network of shops in travel locations such as motorway service stations and airports were up 5%, but down 3% at its shops on UK high streets. The retailer, which this year celebrates its 225th birthday, said that strong sales of spoof humour books and seasonal stationery were offset by year-on-year sales figures for adult colouring books that were tough to beat, having sold really well over the same period last year. Chief executive Stephen Clarke sounded a broadly positive note: \u201cAs a result of the performance in travel we expect group profit growth for the year to be slightly ahead of plan. \u201cWhile there is some uncertainty in the broader economic environment, we remain confident that the group is well positioned for the year ahead as we continue to focus on profitable growth, cash generation and investing in new opportunities.\u201d And the verdict from veteran retail analyst Nick Bubb? \u201cAlthough the comparisons were tough, the business has come through well. How far the 225th Anniversary celebrations of the company help trade this year remains to be seen, but the City will be relieved by the strong Christmas trading performance.\u201d Shares were up 7.6% at \u00a315.93 in early trading, making the retailer the biggest riser on the FTE 250 in early trading. The Mexican Peso has weakened by 0.15% today, to 21.56 peso to the US dollar. It\u2019s suffering from president Trump\u2019s threat to erect a wall on the US-Mexico border. Kit Juckes of Societe Generale says: Trump tweets continue to drive sentiment and the President\u2019s most recent - \u201cBig day planned fort NATIONAL SECURITY tomorrow. Among other things, we will build the wall!\u201d - saw the Mexican peso reverse Monday/Tuesday gains. German government bond prices are falling this morning, pushing the yield (or interest rate) on bunds to a six-week high. That shows that investors are moving money out of safe-haven assets and into shares. The pound is holding firm at $1.252 this morning, as the City waits for the government to publish its bill on exiting the European Union. The pan-European Stoxx 600 index has gained almost 1% this morning, putting it on track for its biggest gain of 2017. Solid earning figures from Santander, which posted a 4% increase in revenue, are helping the mood. Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 index of blue-chip shares has gained nearly 0.7% this morning, as it gains 48 points to 7199. Mining group Antofagasta is leading the rally, up over 5%, after reporting a solid production report. Other miners are also on the up because commodity prices are bouncing ahead, on hopes of a US spending boost from Trump. Mike Van Dulken of Accendo Markets says this strength in base metals is driving the markets up. Copper in particular up on restricted supply (BHP Billiton cut guidance; prolonged strikes could make matters worse) and growth/inflation expectations from US infrastructure spending plans as Trump sticks to his campaign hymn sheet. Aluminium, Iron Ore, Lead and Zinc are all tagging along while Oil holds around $53/55, near the mid-point of a $50-60 range as US production increases challenge OPEC cuts. Traders have a lot to fret about right now, from Donald Trump\u2019s protectionist threats to Britain\u2019s push towards Brexit. But today, shares are rising on optimism that the global economy may strengthen this year, as Trump starts to delivers on fiscal stimulus boost he promised during his campaign. Last night, America\u2019s S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq indices both hit new record highs, as Trump controversially approved two energy projects. This pushed shares up on Wall Street, as Art Hogan, chief market strategist at Wunderlich Securities, told CNBC: \u201cI think the real lift in the market was the second round of executive orders from the White House. This is very much a Trump-infrastructure rally.\u201d This has fed through to Asia where most markets rallied, with Japan\u2019s Topix index up 1%. There\u2019s a positive start in Europe too, with the main markets gaining ground in early trading. Donald Trump has alarmed many observers with his early moves as president, with environmentalists aghast that he is reviving the Keystone XL and Dakota Access pipelines. But in the cold-hearted world of the markets, the \u2018Trump rally\u2019 is back on, as Kathleen Brooks of City Index puts it. US stock markets have showed renewed signs of life this week, and the Nasdaq made a fresh record high on Tuesday as the market toyed with the idea of reigniting the \u2018Trump rally\u2019 that we saw in the aftermath of the presidential election last November. Based on Tuesday\u2019s performance, it looks like the market is happy with the first flourish of Trump\u2019s executive orders. History suggests that there could be further upside for stocks.... Trump also advanced the Keystone Pipeline project on Tuesday, something that President Obama slapped down. These first steps may not please climate change activists, but, as expected, they suggest that President Trump is \u2018business friendly\u2019 and the markets are greeting this with approval. Thus, stocks are in a strong position as we move to the middle of the week. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Here\u2019s what\u2019s coming up today. 9am GMT: German IFO confidence report for January, showing how optimistic business leaders in the eurozone\u2019s largest economy are this month. 11am: CBI Industrial trends survey, showing how Britain\u2019s factories are faring 3.30pm: US crude oil inventory figures 4pm: Bank of England governor Mark Carney is speaking at a banking conference in Wiesbaden, Germany.
