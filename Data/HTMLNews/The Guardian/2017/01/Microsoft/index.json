In a report published to coincide with the start of the week-long World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, Oxfam said it was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153beyond grotesque\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd that a handful of rich men headed by the Microsoft founder Bill Gates are worth $426bn (\u00c2\u00a3350bn), equivalent to the wealth of 3.6 billion people. The development charity called for a new economic model to reverse an inequality trend that it said helped to explain Brexit and Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s victory in the US presidential election. Oxfam blamed rising inequality on aggressive wage restraint, tax dodging and the squeezing of producers by companies, adding that businesses were too focused on delivering ever-higher returns to wealthy owners and top executives. The World Economic Forum (WEF) said last week that rising inequality and social polarisation posed two of the biggest risks to the global economy in 2017 and could result in the rolling back of globalisation. Oxfam said the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s poorest 50% owned the same in assets as the $426bn owned by a group headed by Gates, Amancio Ortega, the founder of the Spanish fashion chain Zara, and Warren Buffett, the renowned investor and chief executive of Berkshire Hathaway.

Its senior UK economist Kallum Pickering said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>While UK prime minister Theresa May has previously stated that she doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t recognise the concept of a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dchard Brexit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 the market clearly does. Comments by May hinting at a hard Brexit sent the pound lower over the weekend. But is any of it new information? No, not really. May has stated on several occasions that she will prioritise regaining control of the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s borders and laws over access to the single market. In May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s speech tomorrow we expect her to reiterate the same message, again.</p> <p>While the prime minister hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t gone so far as to plainly state the potential impacts of such an arrangement, her broad aims for post-EU Britain have been consistently clear for some time now. The commonly heard \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcuncertainty\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 about May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s intentions is hard to justify. Unless May does a complete U-turn from here, any hope of full single market access for post-EU Britain is more or less out of the question. We can presume also, given that May has gone to the effort of setting up a trade department, currently headed by MP Liam Fox, and has stated on a number of occasions that the UK should be able to strike its own trade deals independently of the EU, that an exit from the EU customs union is likely too.</p> <p>We do not expect May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s speech to alter our base case by much, if at all. We currently expect the UK and EU27 to agree a deal in which the UK maintains a good level of access to the EU\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s goods markets and limited access to the less developed services markets.

This \u00e2\u20ac\u0153recovery\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd is also typical after a move below a key technical level such as 1.20 in the pound/dollar, and thus may only be temporary.</p> </blockquote> <blockquote> <p>Looking ahead, we think that the pound is likely to remain vulnerable, and, in the short term, the market could once again test the air below 1.20, and the lows from October\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s flash crash. Volatility levels in the pound/dollar as measured by the options market, have risen once again on Monday, taking the 1-month GBP/USD volatility level to a fresh 4-month high. This suggests that investors are expecting further large moves from the pound in the short term.</p> <p>Some have wondered why the foreign exchange market continues to be \u00e2\u20ac\u0153shocked\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd by news about a hard Brexit, after all the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s exit from the single market has always been on the cards and is not a new concept. I would argue that the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcBrexit theme as bad news for the pound\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 is such an ingrained trend at this stage that it really doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t matter what May says or fails to say on Tuesday.

Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The weakness of the pound has been one of the key catalysts as to why the FTSE100 has managed to push strongly above its previous all-time highs, as well managing to break record after record in closing higher every day since just before Christmas.</p> <p>This pattern looks set to continue again, with a higher open for the UK benchmark, as we head into a new week after the pound fell below the 1.2000 level for the first time since the flash crash lows in October last year in Asia overnight.</p> <p>It would appear that the main catalyst behind this sell-off is speculation that UK Prime Minister Theresa May will set out tomorrow the UK government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s position when it comes to coming to deal with the EU with respect to its negotiation position ahead of the expected triggering of article 50 in March, though this could still be derailed by the Supreme Court ruling which is due any day now.</p> <p>The expectation is that the Prime Minister\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s insistence on being able to better control immigration as well as the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s law making, will result in the UK announcing its intention to leave the single market and customs union, which most investors appear to assign as being exceedingly negative for the pound.</p> </blockquote> <p>Elsewhere it is a fairly quiet day on the corporate and economic front, but later the annual jamboree in Davos begins, with full coverage in the blog by my colleague Graeme Wearden.</p> </div>   </div>",
                "bodyText":"Hello again. Davos has been busy tonight with meetings, nobnobbing, some exclusive private dinner, and plenty of armed police to deter anyone from sneaking around where they shouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t. But before that all started, WEF\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s founder, Klaus Schwab, told delegates that they need to up their game and deliver responsive and responsible leadership (the theme of this year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Forum). Schwab said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Responsive means that we listen to and interact with those who have entrusted us with leadership. It is always important to prioritize the public social good over our own interests. We must emphasize humanization over robotization.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Schwab is hoping that this week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meeting will find ways to reform capitalism and boost growth, adding: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Sometimes it seems that the world is overwhelmed by pessimism and cynicism. But we have to look in a confident way into the future.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Full marks for optimism, after a year that has demolished the Davos world view. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll find out this week if WEF can rise to the challenge.... Goodnight! GW Elsewhere in Davos, PricewaterhouseCoopers has reported that many bosses are losing faith in globalisation (a journey that many people took a while ago). My colleague Larry Elliott explains: Executives running the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s leading companies share public scepticism about the benefits of globalisation and doubt whether breaking down barriers to trade has helped tackle climate change or inequality. The annual health check of global boardrooms conducted by the consultancy firm PwC found the mood more upbeat than a year ago, despite the shockwaves caused in 2016 by the vote for Brexit and the victory of Donald Trump in the US presidential election. But the survey, published to coincide with the World Economic Forum in Davos, found that the bullishness about the benefits of globalisation had diminished in the 19 years since PwC first polled executives at the end of the 1990s. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the full story: WEF\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s final Crystal Award goes to actor Forest Whitaker, for his work on conflict resolution in the developing world. The star of The Last King of Scotland explains that his Foundation helps young people to become the change they want to see in the world (hat-tip to Gandhi). These \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcyouth peacemakers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 are working on the front line to achieve humanitarian breakthroughs. For example, in Uganda, former child soldiers are now setting up electronics shops and salons. In Mexico, they are leading skills-building sessions in prisons and tackling bullying in schools. And in one case (I missed the country, sorry), they even negotiated with an army occupying a school, persuading them to leave. Shakira, the Columbian performer and singer, also receives a Crystal Award from WEF for her humanitarian work. She talks about the crisis of child poverty in her country. Children who don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t receive the food and stimulation they need, who aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t played with and read to, will never reach their full potential, she says. This means that being born into poverty means never getting out of it. In Columbia, there are 250 million children trapped in poverty -- that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s almost the population of the United States. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s babies will create tomorrow\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s businesses and solve tomorrow\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s problems; but those who are economically disadvantaged need more help to succeed and achieve their potential. Those with power, and money, cannot simply sit back and leave this to governments, she continues. Shakira says her Foundation has achieved \u00e2\u20ac\u0153jaw-dropping\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd results by funding schools in the most remote parts of Columbia. Students responded academically \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcso well\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, so that children who would have joined the guerillas are heading to university instead. Investment in education can create miracles -- it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a better feeling than winning a Grammy, she jokes. And she wants those at WEF to help provide more funding for ECD (early childhood development), and to \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcinvest in humans\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the smart thing to do, the strategic thing to do, and the just thing to do.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Over in the WEF congress hall, violinist Anne-Sophie Mutter is receiving a crystal award from the Forum for her work helping young musicians. She says that music can play a role in making a better, more peaceful world as it has no ideology. Then she turns to the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hunger crisis; 24 children have died through malnutrition in the last four minutes. Eight million people die from hunger each year; that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s one every three seconds. She reminds the audience that the UN\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sustainable development goals includes the total eradication of hunger by 2030. but not enough is being done. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no shortage of talk, Mutter says pointedly, as: If one could eat resolutions and words, no-one would starve. Everyone in this audience can help, she concludes. You must ignore the sirens of ever greater wealth, and instead do more to protect the poor and the weak. Outgoing US vice-president Joe Biden is telling the World Economic Forum that he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s optimistic that cancer can be beaten. On his final overseas trip as VP, Biden is updating Davos on the Cancer Moonshot - his effort to dramatically boost the fight against cancer. He says that the initiative has made real progress, by bolstering collaboration between research groups, doctor and drugs companies. Biden says there is an \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcenormous\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 opportunity to build on this collaboration; he hopes that other countries will provide more support to help \u00e2\u20ac\u0153double-down\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd on the battle. And Biden also hopes that his successor, Mike Pence, will continue this work. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve already spoken to the vice-president elect who is a good man, about my willingness to continue to work with him and the incoming administration, to be as committed and enthusiastic as we are about the goal of ending cancer as we know it. My prayer is that they will do that as well. Whatever happens, Biden continues, those in the private sector, philanthropists, academics will continue to work together as there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s just \u00e2\u20ac\u02dctoo much momentum\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, thanks to the improved collaboration between cancer centres, researchers, the government, etc. Biden insists that he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s optimistic, thanks to the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153absolute commitment and sheer brilliance\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd of the researchers, scientists and institutions he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s worked with. In time, more people will get the right cure first time, cancer prevention will be improved, and care will be personalised. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The one thing i can tell you, there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hope.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Biden\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s son, Beau, died of brain cancer in 2015. And the VP ends his speech today by citing JFK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s dream of putting a man on the moon: It was a moving speech, confirming that Biden\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s going to be missed. The Davos security people aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t taking any chances this year -- Bloomberg reports that they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re carrying guns to shoot down any drones that approach WEF. Over in Davos, the 2017 World Economic Forum is now getting underway. The biggest global gathering of world leaders and business chiefs will be formally opened at 6.15pm Swiss time by Klaus Schwab, who founded WEF back in the 1970s. WEF will also award its traditional Crystal Awards, to violin Anne-Sophie Mutter, singer and performer Shakira and actor Forest Whitaker. That will tee up four days of meetings, speeches and behind-the scenes talk about issues like Donald Trump, Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s exit from the EU, populism, climate change, artificial intelligence, and a lot more, under extra-tight security. Oxfam has the set the scene, with its warning that eight billionaires own as much net wealth as the poorest half of the country. And WEF itself is pushing for more inclusive, socially beneficial economic policies - having calculated that average incomes in many countries have shrank since 2008 (see earlier post). The pound has stabilised a little after its plunge to a three month low earlier in the day. But the fears of a hard Brexit, prompted by comments from the UK government ahead of prime minister Theresa May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s speech on Tuesday, mean that sterling is still down around 1% against the dollar. It is currently down 0.8% at $1.2078 against the dollar and 0.6% against the euro at \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.1384. But despite the boost to overseas earners from the weak pound, the FTSE 100 has fallen back from its record intra-day level and is now down 0.11% at 7327. If the index closes lower it will end an unprecedented winning streak, with 12 successive days of record closes and fourteen days of rises. Financial shares are leading the fallers, hit by worries that a hard Brexit would cause problems for their ability to operate in Europe in the future. On that note, we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll close for the moment. But Graeme Wearden will be back later with the first reports from this year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Davos gathering. The UK Treasury has welcomed the upgrade to its forecasts by the IMF. It said: The fundamentals of the UK economy are strong, and today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s IMF forecasts confirm their view that the UK was the fastest-growing major advanced economy last year. We have reduced the deficit by almost two thirds, cut taxes for millions of working people, and employment is at a near-record high. The Autumn Statement reaffirmed the government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s commitment to return the public finances to balance as soon as practicable, while providing flexibility to support the economy as we exit the EU. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s business community has weighed into the Brexit debate ahead of an update by Theresa May on Tuesday: Britain risks a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153disorderly crash landing\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd if it assumes it can safely walk away from troublesome Brexit talks, business leaders have said, in a last-ditch plea for a negotiated settlement with Europe. As Theresa May prepares to reveal an uncompromising set of UK objectives on Tuesday, pressure is mounting on the prime minister to take a firm line with other member states and ultimately fall back on World Trade Organisation tariffs if no deal can be agreed. But the CBI is calling on politicians to wake up to the limitations of the WTO and dangers of a disorderly or \u00e2\u20ac\u0153train crash\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Brexit, despite the long and painful concessions that may be necessary if the UK is to obtain a replacement free-trade agreement when it leaves the single market. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The practicalities of a disorderly crash-landing need to be understood,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Carolyn Fairbairn, director general of the CBI, in an interview with the Guardian. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We have had conversations with some of the proponents of just walking away and we will again talk to them about what we see from our members about the consequences of that. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153An exit into WTO at the stroke of midnight without the proper planning and preparation in place would be very serious for the UK economy. There are some signs that there is more conversation around that being an outcome. Our job is to demonstrate how difficult that would be because of all of these unanswered questions.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The full story is here: Ahead of Davos the International Monetary Fund has issued a new warning on the global economy. Katie Allen writes: The global economy faces a multitude of risks in 2017, ranging from rising protectionism spearheaded by Donald Trump to a severe slowdown in China, the International Monetary Fund has warned. The Washington-based fund used an update to its economic forecasts to highlight popular antipathy towards international trade and a widening in the gap between rich and poor. It called on governments to tackle inequality by helping people find work in fast-changing jobs markets shaken up by technology and globalisation. The IMF made no changes to its October forecast for global economic growth to edge up this year after a sluggish 2016. But it upgraded its outlook for the UK economy, bringing the IMF more in line with other forecasters following signs that the British economy grew at a solid pace in the second half of 2016, despite the Brexit vote. The UK outlook for 2018 was cut, however. The full story is here: Now over to Greece. The prospect of further instability in the eurozone is mounting as consternation grows over the inability of Greece and its creditors to complete a second bailout review of the debt-stricken economy. Helena Smith reports from Athens: Fears are growing in Greece and abroad over continued friction between Athens and its creditors. Prolonged foot dragging over completion of a second bailout review has triggered mounting speculation that the debt-stricken country could be headed for new polls if it fails to come to some accord with lenders. The prospect of the IMF not participating in the current programme - mooted last week by Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s powerful finance minister Wolfgang Schauble who suggested the European Stability Mechanism could assume the role instead \u00e2\u20ac\u201c may have elicited thinly disguised euphoria in Greece but has been met with angst elsewhere. Schauble also hinted that departure of the IMF could mean even stricter terms for Greece \u00e2\u20ac\u201c in short, a fourth bailout programme for a country now in its eighth year of austerity-induced depression. This morning the ESM\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s managing director Klaus Regling highlighted concerns saying whatever happened the German Bundestag would have to ratify the move. Berlin is the biggest contributor of the three rescue programmes that since 2011 have kept Greek bankruptcy at bay and had originally said it would only continue disbursing funds if the IMF was on board. If the review\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s conclusion is delayed for much longer officials worry Greece will miss the next target: of getting Greek bonds included in the European Central Banks QE programme in March. All off which has put Athens\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 leftist led administration under additional pressure to come up with alternatives to the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153illogical\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd demands it says the IMF is now making \u00e2\u20ac\u201c starting with the body\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s insistence that it legislate further multi-year pension cuts and income-tax hikes worth \u00e2\u201a\u00ac4.5bn to ensure that primary surplus targets are met. Speculation of euro exit is once again gaining currency despite fiscal adjustment and the immense sacrifices the country has already made. Amid talk of the drachma returning, the government has signalled it is now working on new proposals for lenders which it will present at the next euro group of euro area finance ministers on January 26. The World Economic Forum has also found that incomes across many advanced countries shrank since 2008; another sign that economic policies need to change. WEF\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new report on economic inclusivity (see last post) shows that median income shrank by almost 2.5% between 2008 and 2013 across the 26 advanced economies where data is available. And 51% of countries saw a decline in their inclusion score during the same period; driven by a surge in wealth inequality since the financial crisis. With public anger against the the political and economic establishment on the rise, WEF is urging politicians to do more to improve living standards, boosting quality of life and making people feel more secure. Richard Samans, a member of the Forum\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Managing Board, argues: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153To respond more effectively to social concerns, economic policy needs a new compass setting, broad-based progress in living standards, and a new mental map in which structural reform is reimagined and reapplied to this task, with chief economic advisers and finance ministers prioritizing it every bit as much their traditional focus on macroeconomic, financial supervisory and trade policy.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd We may hear more about this issue tonight, when Davos gets underway. Back in snowy Switzerland, a new report from the World Economic Forum makes rather dispiriting reading for the UK. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s wealth and gender inequality, generation gap and weak productivity growth mean it lags behind many rival advanced economies when it comes to economic inclusivity. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s according to WEF\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Inclusive Growth and Development Report 2017\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, which ranks Britain just 21th out of 30 fellow advanced economies. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s online here. The report, launched at Davos, looks at 12 performance measures that try to get deeper than simply measuring overall GDP. It found that the UK came 17th for \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcgrowth and development\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, a section that covered GDP per person, labour productivity and life expectancy. The UK also came in the bottom half for \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcinclusion;, which looked at how fairly income and wealth is distributed. WEF\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Intergenerational equity index placed the UK in 23rd place, given the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s high net debt (which must be paid off by future generations) and its dependency ratio (measuring the economic burden of pensioners and children on working people). Digging into the report shows that the UK scored well on other measures such as entrepreneurship (8th out of 30), the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcconcentration of rents\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 (5th) and the tax code (where the UK was ranked top). But Britain was also ranked just 25 out of 30 on \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcwage and non-wage compensation\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, dragged down by the gap in earnings between men and women, and the amount of pay swallowed up by childcare. Norway topped the charts, followed by Luxembourg, Sweden and Iceland. WEF\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s message is that politicians need to look beyond simple growth rates, and consider whether their economies are serving wider society. Otherwise, citizens are justified in turning to populist parties for answers. This recognition and the rebalancing of policy priorities it implies is what is required for governments to respond more effectively to decelerating growth and rising inequality \u00e2\u20ac\u201c to take seriously the social frustrations increasingly being expressed through the ballot box and on the street. Such frustrations have an essential validity. The implicit income distribution system within many countries is in fact severely underperforming or relatively underdeveloped, but this is due to a lack of attention rather than an iron law of capitalism. The world economic recovery is still weak, according to China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s president Xi Jinping. Speaking in the Swiss capital Bern before he heads off to Davos, he added that China would make its contribution to the recovery and his country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy was peforming steadily overall. He said the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s GDP was expected to have grown by 6.7% in 2016, missing the 7% top end of the planned target range but still among the highest of major economies. More on the eurozone trade figures from IHS Markit chief economist Howard Archer: An improved traded good performance in November is supportive to belief that Eurozone GDP growth improved in the fourth quarter of 2016. While it is still questionable as to whether net trade contributed positively to fourth-quarter 2016 Eurozone GDP growth, November\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s improved trade performance at the very least dilutes the likelihood that net trade was an appreciable drag on activity. Net trade made a marginally negative contribution to Eurozone GDP growth in the third quarter, therefore being a factor limiting GDP growth to 0.3% quarter-on-quarter. In real terms, exports of goods and services edged up just 0.1% quarter-on-quarter in the third quarter while imports rose by 0.2% quarter-on-quarter. We believe that Eurozone GDP growth may well have improved to 0.5% quarter-on-quarter in the fourth quarter of 2016 (from 0.3% quarter-on-quarter in both the third and second quarters). It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a thin day for data but there have been some eurozone trade figures, showing an increase in the trade surplus: The European banking sector is also losing ground after agency DBRS cut Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s credit rating on Friday, a move which could raise borrowing costs for the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s financial businesses. UBS said: The downgrade will impact haircuts applied to Italian govies [government bonds] used as collateral by banks in monetary policy operations with the ECB. Haircuts are calculated based on the best available rating for an issuer and DBRS had the last A rating on Italy (S&amp;P: BBB-, Moody\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s: Baa2, Fitch: BBB+). As a consequence and depending on the maturity of the Italian govies pledged, we estimate the downgrade could lead to the need for a 6-9% top-up of the govies used as collateral. The comments from Theresa May over the weekend are nothing new, says Berenberg. Its senior UK economist Kallum Pickering said: While UK prime minister Theresa May has previously stated that she doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t recognise the concept of a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dchard Brexit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 the market clearly does. Comments by May hinting at a hard Brexit sent the pound lower over the weekend. But is any of it new information? No, not really. May has stated on several occasions that she will prioritise regaining control of the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s borders and laws over access to the single market. In May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s speech tomorrow we expect her to reiterate the same message, again. While the prime minister hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t gone so far as to plainly state the potential impacts of such an arrangement, her broad aims for post-EU Britain have been consistently clear for some time now. The commonly heard \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcuncertainty\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 about May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s intentions is hard to justify. Unless May does a complete U-turn from here, any hope of full single market access for post-EU Britain is more or less out of the question. We can presume also, given that May has gone to the effort of setting up a trade department, currently headed by MP Liam Fox, and has stated on a number of occasions that the UK should be able to strike its own trade deals independently of the EU, that an exit from the EU customs union is likely too. We do not expect May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s speech to alter our base case by much, if at all. We currently expect the UK and EU27 to agree a deal in which the UK maintains a good level of access to the EU\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s goods markets and limited access to the less developed services markets. Crucially, we expect the UK to lose its EU financial services passport. This follows from the UK raising some modest barriers to migration from the EU. Which is one reason why, as we mentioned earlier, financial shares are coming under renewed pressure, with Royal Bank of Scotland and Barclays among the leading fallers. This in turn has seen the FTSE 100 come off its best levels, with the index currently around 4 points lower. Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s desire for a UK-US trade deal to be ready as soon as Britain leaves the EU came in an interview with Michael Gove, and is being covered by my colleague Andrew Sparrow in the politics live blog: Theresa May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s speech on Brexit is not the only event which could influence the pound: The pound has come off its worst levels, but is still down more than 1% at $1.2041. Kathleen Brooks, research director at City Index, said: After falling below the key 1.20 level on Sunday, [the pound] has since staged a comeback.... The was partly driven by comments from Donald Trump in an interview with The Times newspaper where he said that the UK was at the top of a list for a trade deal with the US, and that the UK did a great thing by leaving the EU. Other factors that have soothed the pound this morning include some reassurances from the UK Treasury that it will address investors concerns that may arise from Theresa May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s speech on Tuesday. This \u00e2\u20ac\u0153recovery\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd is also typical after a move below a key technical level such as 1.20 in the pound/dollar, and thus may only be temporary. Looking ahead, we think that the pound is likely to remain vulnerable, and, in the short term, the market could once again test the air below 1.20, and the lows from October\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s flash crash. Volatility levels in the pound/dollar as measured by the options market, have risen once again on Monday, taking the 1-month GBP/USD volatility level to a fresh 4-month high. This suggests that investors are expecting further large moves from the pound in the short term. Some have wondered why the foreign exchange market continues to be \u00e2\u20ac\u0153shocked\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd by news about a hard Brexit, after all the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s exit from the single market has always been on the cards and is not a new concept. I would argue that the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcBrexit theme as bad news for the pound\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 is such an ingrained trend at this stage that it really doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t matter what May says or fails to say on Tuesday. Instead, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s all about market dynamics, and right now the balance of market participants are shorting the pound. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a bit like a tipping point, once a trend gets critical mass, like the pound downtrend, then news headlines can have big impacts, as they generate another wave of selling. Ahead of the Davos gathering, the World Economic Forum warned on the risk of rising inequality, and here is more evidence. Larry Elliott writes: The world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s eight richest billionaires control the same wealth between them as the poorest half of the globe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s population, according to a charity warning of an ever-increasing and dangerous concentration of wealth. In a report published to coincide with the start of the week-long World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, Oxfam said it was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153beyond grotesque\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd that a handful of rich men headed by the Microsoft founder Bill Gates are worth $426bn (\u00c2\u00a3350bn), equivalent to the wealth of 3.6 billion people. The development charity called for a new economic model to reverse an inequality trend that it said helped to explain Brexit and Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s victory in the US presidential election. Oxfam blamed rising inequality on aggressive wage restraint, tax dodging and the squeezing of producers by companies, adding that businesses were too focused on delivering ever-higher returns to wealthy owners and top executives. The World Economic Forum (WEF) said last week that rising inequality and social polarisation posed two of the biggest risks to the global economy in 2017 and could result in the rolling back of globalisation. Larry\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s full report is here: With little in the way of economic or corporate news, and the US markets shut for Martin Luther King day, the fall in the pound is likely to dominate investor sentiment. No surprise given the influence of the weak pound on its overseas constituents, but the FTSE 100 has reached a new peak in early trading. The leading index is up 0.2% to an intra-day high of 7354, despite a fall in banking shares after Goldman Sachs cut its recommendation on Royal Bank of Scotland from buy to neutral. The financial sector is also being undermined by worries about the repercussions of a hard Brexit on the City. Mining shares are dominating the risers, accounting for seven of the top ten best performers. Sterling could fall as low as $1.10 according to Neil Wilson, senior market analyst at ETX Capital: Cable is now clinging to the $1.20 handle for dear life and seems to have steadied a little as trading commences in London \u00e2\u20ac\u201c pound trading in Asia is often quite volatile because of thin liquidity. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve also got the pound trading at its weakest level against the euro since November. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s looking more and more like a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dchard\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Brexit is in the offing and markets are responding. The currency market is the most efficient and swiftest to price it in. However the full effects of a hard Brexit are not yet completely discounted by the markets and so we could have further to run depending on what is said tomorrow. We now have to assume May will prioritise immigration controls and the price to pay will be to exit the single market. That could send the pound a lot lower still, perhaps towards $1.10 in the coming weeks. The Supreme Court\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ruling on the triggering of Article 50 is another risk factor that is likely to increase volatility in pound crosses. May probably won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t give everything away and explain the government bargaining position in detail, but it looks like she will sound more hawkish and steer the tone towards a hard Brexit. The PM\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s statements have a habit of hitting sterling pretty hard and today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s moves are clear signs of nervousness in the fx market. The PM could, however, strike a more soothing tone than markets expect and that could spark a significant short-term reversal in cable, although long-term it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s going to be hard to shake the bears. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the pound\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s continuing decline: The pressure on the pound is only likely to get worse, with volatility increasing, according to economists at UniCredit: [We] believe that sterling is a sell on any potential rallies. Even in the event of a more \u00e2\u20ac\u0153conciliatory\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd tone (by Mrs. May hinting at seeking out a transitional agreement with the European Union, for instance) the respite on sterling is very likely to be only temporary. As long as control over immigration remains the UK government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s anchoring point, it is virtually impossible to envision anything other than an exit from the EU\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s single market. With the pound weaker, the FTSE 100 is indeed expected to hit new heights: Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. The pound has come under renewed pressure ahead of a key speech by UK prime minister Theresa May on Tuesday, where she is expected to spell out Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s negotiating strategy for Brexit talks. Investors fear that she will indicate the UK will leave the single market and the customs union, and a so-called hard Brexit will be on the cards. That has combined to send the pound down to its lowest levels since the flash crash of October last year. It fell as low as $1.1983 in Asian trading before recovering some ground. It is currently down 1.45% at $1.2002, while against the euro it has fallen 1.24% to \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.1312. The strength of the dollar is also hitting the pound, with investors still anxious to hear details of president-elect Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tax and spending plans to boost the US economy. But with the weak pound one of the driving forces behind the rise of the FTSE 100 to record levels, since it boosts the business of overseas earners, markets are expected to open higher. Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK, said: The weakness of the pound has been one of the key catalysts as to why the FTSE100 has managed to push strongly above its previous all-time highs, as well managing to break record after record in closing higher every day since just before Christmas. This pattern looks set to continue again, with a higher open for the UK benchmark, as we head into a new week after the pound fell below the 1.2000 level for the first time since the flash crash lows in October last year in Asia overnight. It would appear that the main catalyst behind this sell-off is speculation that UK Prime Minister Theresa May will set out tomorrow the UK government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s position when it comes to coming to deal with the EU with respect to its negotiation position ahead of the expected triggering of article 50 in March, though this could still be derailed by the Supreme Court ruling which is due any day now. The expectation is that the Prime Minister\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s insistence on being able to better control immigration as well as the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s law making, will result in the UK announcing its intention to leave the single market and customs union, which most investors appear to assign as being exceedingly negative for the pound. Elsewhere it is a fairly quiet day on the corporate and economic front, but later the annual jamboree in Davos begins, with full coverage in the blog by my colleague Graeme Wearden.",

Around 700,000 people own less than 1,600 shares, a legacy of the telecoms group\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s privatisation in 1984.</p> <p>And they as much as anyone will be shocked by the 20% plunge in the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shares after it revealed a worse than expected hit to its figures from an accounting scandal in Italy, not to mention a warning of a slowdown in business elsewhere.</p> <p>Some \u00c2\u00a38bn was wiped off the value of BT as its shares fell from 382.55p to 303p, its lowest level since June 2013.</p> <p>That in turn knocked 26 points off the FTSE 100, which would otherwise have been firmly in positive territory rather than slipping slightly into the red.</p> <p>So where now for BT shares? Neil Wilson, senior market analyst at ETX Capital, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>BT\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 20% drop today fairly rattled the City. It was one of the biggest ever single-day falls for a company of this sort. Blue chips like BT just don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t make those kinds of losses on one announcement about a part of the business that accounts for just 1% of earnings.</p> <p>So is this a golden buying opportunity for investors, or does BT merit a fundamental recalibration of its stock price based on the news?</p> <p>First, the upside. BT is now looking very cheap on a price to forward earnings ratio (about 10 times). That appears like mightily good value for a company that pays juicy dividends and says it will continue to increase these by 10% a year over the next two years. That could mean a roughly 4% yield for buyers entering now, which if it can manage to deliver is a pretty attractive return.</p> <p>It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also dodged a bullet or two by retaining control of Openreach, the jewel in the crown, despite pressure from Ofcom. The acquisition of EE enables to become a genuine quad-play provider. Sports broadcasting is also improving revenues but at a fairly hefty cost.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3666cbfd73f92985ec2bf9d36a6bbcf5f937183f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3666cbfd73f92985ec2bf9d36a6bbcf5f937183f/0_45_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"BT Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s headquarters in Milan,\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">BT Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s headquarters in Milan,</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Stefano Rellandini/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <blockquote> <p>The downside, however, looks ominous. The Italian fiasco will gobble up a whopping \u00c2\u00a3500m in free cash in 2016/2017 and a further \u00c2\u00a3500m in 2017/18. Although BT has largely completed its investigation, there is a risk that this could blow up further and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s wise to be cautious. The Financial Reporting Council could take this further.</p> <p>Operating costs seem to be rising, as are debts. Acquisition of EE, while a strategic long-term play, has meant net debts have risen to nearly \u00c2\u00a310bn. That is also the figure for BT\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pension black hole, which it has to review this year.</p> <p>Another red flag is the outlook for UK public sector and international corporate markets, which BT says has deteriorated, meaning it expects a double-digit year-on-year percentage decline in fourth quarter underlying EBITDA adjusted for the acquisition of EE. That is a big concern and signals that investment is drying up. All this points to growing pressure on free cash, which BT needs to keep growing the dividends.</p> </blockquote> <p><em>On that note, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time to close for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be back tomorrow.</em></p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-58877a62e4b0d7c340749709\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-01-24T17:10:14.617Z\">5.10pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">European markets end higher but FTSE 100 hit by BT fall</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>There is a degree of caution around the markets, as investors await more decisions from US president Donald Trump after his protectionist rhetoric so far. And with the US reporting season underway, they are also looking to see whether companies can justify their hefty valuations with their results.</p> <p>Overall, with Wall Street higher by the time Europe closed - with the Dow Jones Industrial Average up 61 points or 0.3% - continental markets ended the day higher.</p> <p>News that the UK parliament had won the right to a vote on Brexit did little to support the pound, which is currently unchanged at $1.2530 having earlier fallen as low as $1.2419. Jasper Lawler, senior market analyst at London Capital Group, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The [UK supreme] court ruling sent the British pound lower, though it finished well off its lows. There was an element of \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcbuy the rumour, sell the fact\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 in currency markets to the well-telegraphed decision. In all likelihood Article 50 will still be triggered in March irrespective of the supreme court. In many ways this is just one less roadblock out of the way before the UK leaves the EU. If anything, the net effect leans towards a harder Brexit in that Scotland and the devolved assemblies, which mostly voted to Remain in the EU, will have less say.</p> </blockquote> <p>So with the pound failing to gain ground, the FTSE 100 was open to reacting to any shocks, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/jan/24/bt-loses-7bn-in-value-as-italian-accounting-scandal-deepens\">an unexpected profit warning from BT after worse than expected accounting irregularities in Italy</a> certainly fitted the bill. BT\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decline knocked 26 points off the leading index, which otherwise would have been well in positive territory.

Lawrence Yun, the association\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chief economist, said the housing market\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s best year since the Great Recession ended on a healthy but somewhat softer note:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Solid job creation throughout 2016 and exceptionally low mortgage rates translated into a good year for the housing market. However, higher mortgage rates and home prices combined with record low inventory levels stunted sales in much of the country in December.</p> <p>While a lack of listings and fast rising home prices was a headwind all year, the surge in rates since early November ultimately caught some prospective buyers off guard and dimmed their appetite or ability to buy a home as 2016 came to an end. </p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-58876bcbe4b0d7c3407496b4\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-01-24T15:04:29.033Z\">3.04pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Better than forecast US manufacturing data adds to rate rise expectations</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>US manufacturing has got off to a good start in 2017, with overall conditions improving at the quickest pace for two years.</p> <p>The initial Markit manufacturing purchasing managers index for January came in at 55.1, compared to expectations of a figure of 54.5 and a rise from December\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s final figure of 54.3. Chris Williamson, Chief Business Economist at IHS Markit said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>US manufacturers are seeing a bumper start to 2017, with production surging higher in January on the back of rising inflows of new orders.</p> <p>New work is growing at the fastest rate for over two years, thanks mainly to rising demand from customers in the home market. Export growth remains subdued, stymied by the strong dollar.</p> <p>The survey results suggest that faster manufacturing growth and inventory rebuilding should help boost GDP in the first quarter if current trends persist in coming months.

Just as brokers and investors were prepping for FY results on Friday, the company delivers a profits warning linked to an existing accounting scandal at its Italian business. Continued investigation since October (internal + external) has shown the extent of impropriety (sales, purchase, leasing) and overstatement of profits to be far greater than initially thought. Management has been forced to more than triple its expected write-down to \u00c2\u00a3530m and admit that FY revenues, profits and cash flow will be lower than consensus. Last October\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s suggestion of a \u00c2\u00a3145m charge didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t cause too many ripples as regulatory issues and a rising pension deficit hogged the headlines. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s admission adds this to these nasty headwinds, especially as it could weigh on profits for the next two years.</p> <p>Even management isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t sure what the final figure will be. The group still expects 10% dividend increases for the next two years but is this enough to appease disgruntled shareholders who had already been wearing a 20% downtrend since early 2016. The increases may, however, attract newbies via a 4% yield.

                "bodyText":"It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been a day to forget for BT, its executives and of course its army of small shareholders. Around 700,000 people own less than 1,600 shares, a legacy of the telecoms group\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s privatisation in 1984. And they as much as anyone will be shocked by the 20% plunge in the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shares after it revealed a worse than expected hit to its figures from an accounting scandal in Italy, not to mention a warning of a slowdown in business elsewhere. Some \u00c2\u00a38bn was wiped off the value of BT as its shares fell from 382.55p to 303p, its lowest level since June 2013. That in turn knocked 26 points off the FTSE 100, which would otherwise have been firmly in positive territory rather than slipping slightly into the red. So where now for BT shares? Neil Wilson, senior market analyst at ETX Capital, said: BT\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 20% drop today fairly rattled the City. It was one of the biggest ever single-day falls for a company of this sort. Blue chips like BT just don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t make those kinds of losses on one announcement about a part of the business that accounts for just 1% of earnings. So is this a golden buying opportunity for investors, or does BT merit a fundamental recalibration of its stock price based on the news? First, the upside. BT is now looking very cheap on a price to forward earnings ratio (about 10 times). That appears like mightily good value for a company that pays juicy dividends and says it will continue to increase these by 10% a year over the next two years. That could mean a roughly 4% yield for buyers entering now, which if it can manage to deliver is a pretty attractive return. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also dodged a bullet or two by retaining control of Openreach, the jewel in the crown, despite pressure from Ofcom. The acquisition of EE enables to become a genuine quad-play provider. Sports broadcasting is also improving revenues but at a fairly hefty cost. The downside, however, looks ominous. The Italian fiasco will gobble up a whopping \u00c2\u00a3500m in free cash in 2016/2017 and a further \u00c2\u00a3500m in 2017/18. Although BT has largely completed its investigation, there is a risk that this could blow up further and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s wise to be cautious. The Financial Reporting Council could take this further. Operating costs seem to be rising, as are debts. Acquisition of EE, while a strategic long-term play, has meant net debts have risen to nearly \u00c2\u00a310bn. That is also the figure for BT\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pension black hole, which it has to review this year. Another red flag is the outlook for UK public sector and international corporate markets, which BT says has deteriorated, meaning it expects a double-digit year-on-year percentage decline in fourth quarter underlying EBITDA adjusted for the acquisition of EE. That is a big concern and signals that investment is drying up. All this points to growing pressure on free cash, which BT needs to keep growing the dividends. On that note, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time to close for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be back tomorrow. There is a degree of caution around the markets, as investors await more decisions from US president Donald Trump after his protectionist rhetoric so far. And with the US reporting season underway, they are also looking to see whether companies can justify their hefty valuations with their results. Overall, with Wall Street higher by the time Europe closed - with the Dow Jones Industrial Average up 61 points or 0.3% - continental markets ended the day higher. News that the UK parliament had won the right to a vote on Brexit did little to support the pound, which is currently unchanged at $1.2530 having earlier fallen as low as $1.2419. Jasper Lawler, senior market analyst at London Capital Group, said: The [UK supreme] court ruling sent the British pound lower, though it finished well off its lows. There was an element of \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcbuy the rumour, sell the fact\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 in currency markets to the well-telegraphed decision. In all likelihood Article 50 will still be triggered in March irrespective of the supreme court. In many ways this is just one less roadblock out of the way before the UK leaves the EU. If anything, the net effect leans towards a harder Brexit in that Scotland and the devolved assemblies, which mostly voted to Remain in the EU, will have less say. So with the pound failing to gain ground, the FTSE 100 was open to reacting to any shocks, and an unexpected profit warning from BT after worse than expected accounting irregularities in Italy certainly fitted the bill. BT\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decline knocked 26 points off the leading index, which otherwise would have been well in positive territory. The final scores in Europe showed: The FTSE 100 dipped 0.84 points or 0.01% to 7150.34 Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax added 0.43% to 11,594.94 France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac closed up 0.18% at 4830.03 Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB finished up 0.89% at 19,499.54 Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ibex ended up 0.89% at 9387.2 In Greece, the Athens market added 1.13% to 646.51 Back with BT, and Reuters is reporting that Italian prosecutors are opening their own investigation into alleged false accounting and embezzlement at BT Italia. Meanwhile a number of US law firms which specialise in shareholder class action cases say they are looking at whether BT violated federal securities laws. But existing home sales in the US fell by more than expected in December, as the supply of houses on the market dropped to levels not seen since 1999. The National Association of Realtors said existing home sales fell 2.8% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.49m units, compared to forecasts of a 1.1% decline to 5.52m. But overall sales for 2016 rose to 5.45m, the highest since 2006, from 5.25m the previous year. Lawrence Yun, the association\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chief economist, said the housing market\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s best year since the Great Recession ended on a healthy but somewhat softer note: Solid job creation throughout 2016 and exceptionally low mortgage rates translated into a good year for the housing market. However, higher mortgage rates and home prices combined with record low inventory levels stunted sales in much of the country in December. While a lack of listings and fast rising home prices was a headwind all year, the surge in rates since early November ultimately caught some prospective buyers off guard and dimmed their appetite or ability to buy a home as 2016 came to an end. US manufacturing has got off to a good start in 2017, with overall conditions improving at the quickest pace for two years. The initial Markit manufacturing purchasing managers index for January came in at 55.1, compared to expectations of a figure of 54.5 and a rise from December\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s final figure of 54.3. Chris Williamson, Chief Business Economist at IHS Markit said: US manufacturers are seeing a bumper start to 2017, with production surging higher in January on the back of rising inflows of new orders. New work is growing at the fastest rate for over two years, thanks mainly to rising demand from customers in the home market. Export growth remains subdued, stymied by the strong dollar. The survey results suggest that faster manufacturing growth and inventory rebuilding should help boost GDP in the first quarter if current trends persist in coming months. Rising factory employment should also help improve consumer morale and spending. However, with such strong growth being signalled and price pressures rising, speculation around the next Fed rate hike will intensify. With US investors awaiting more details of President Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tax and spending plans, the main impetus for the market has been his protectionist stance on trade, including pulling out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership. So Wall Street is currently searching for direction, as the US reporting season gathers pace. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is up 13 points or 0.07% while the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq Composite both opened marginally higher. Shares in broadcaster ITV have jumped by over 5% today, on speculation that a bid battle could be coming. The rally sparked by the Evening Standard\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Jamie Nimmo, who reported that several US companies are interested.... He writes: Chatter in the Square Mile that Liberty Global could buy out ITV is nothing new, but rumour has it that the Virgin Media owner may face competition from some of the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest companies. The word on the street is that major shareholders of ITV have been sounded out by tech giants Apple, Amazon and Netflix about a possible takeover. They are thought to have been enticed by the cheap pound and ITV\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s production arm \u00e2\u20ac\u201d behind shows such as Mr Selfridge and which has been growing over the past few years through acquisitions. The gossip suggests the US giants are willing to pay 300p a share, valuing ITV at around \u00c2\u00a312 billion. More here: ITV\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shares are currently changing hands at around 210p - a long way from 300p, suggesting the City isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t convinced a bid is coming. One to watch though.... Software giant Microsoft has just released a statement, insisting that it remains committed to the UK following reports that Brexit might disrupt its operations. The company says: The comments reported today by a Microsoft employee were not reflective of the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s view. As we have said both before and after the EU referendum vote, Microsoft\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s commitment to the UK is unchanged. In particular, those customers in our UK data centres should continue to rely on Microsoft\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s significant investment plans there. Which employee, I hear you cry... ...well, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Microsoft\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s UK government affairs manager Owen Larter. Yesterday, he told a webinar that importing hardware to the UK could become too pricey, if tariffs were imposed after Britain leave the EU. Larter said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153If all of a sudden there are huge import [tariffs] on server racks from China or from eastern Europe, where a lot of them are actually assembled, that might change our investment decisions and perhaps we build out our datacenters across other European countries.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd TechRepublic has the full story. The pound is falling further as the UK government pushes on with its Brexit plans following today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s supreme court ruling. Sterling is currently down 0.5% at $1.246. having hit $1.253 earlier in the day. It fell as Brexit secretary David Davis told MPs that a bill seeking permission to trigger Article 50 will be introduced within days. FXTM research analyst Lukman Otunuga says \u00e2\u20ac\u02dchard Brexit fears\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 have been fuelled by the judges\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 ruling that the devolved administrations needn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t give their approval for Article 50 to be triggered. Although today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ruling has provided some clarity in the short term on the steps needed for Brexit to happen; the pending Brexit fuelled debates with the Parliament and potential complications could create a new layer of uncertainty consequently weakening the Pound. Breaking: UK bank HSBC has announced plans to shut 62 branches across the UK. The move will cost 180 jobs, and is part of the bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s cost-cutting programme. With more customers using electronic banking services, HSBC argues that it needs fewer physical branches. The BBC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Simon Gompertz has got hold of a list; it includes branches in Blackpool, Chipping Norton, Newquay and Warwick. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tumble makes BT\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shares rather more attractive to investors on a price/earnings basis. The company still expects to grow its dividend by 10% per share this financial year, and in 2017-18. But the Italian accountancy scandal, and the warning that BT\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s public sector business is slowing, are reasons to be cautious. Chris Beauchamp of IG says: At ten times forward earnings, the shares are now the cheapest they have been since early 2013, but the fundamental case for investing, aside from the dividend, has still to be proved. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Nick Fletcher\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s news story on BT\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Italian problems: The BBC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Simon Jack is reporting that the head of BT\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Continental Europe division, Corrado Sciolla, will resign today. Sciolla is a former boss of BT Italy, who was promoted to become president of Continental Europe four years ago. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s his biography, from BT\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s website: Corrado is responsible for making sure we grow quickly and profitably across Europe - where we serve big brands like Fiat, ENI, Syngenta and The European Parliament. Corrado\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s career started as a McKinsey consultant, then he had various directorships at Stream (an Italian pay-TV firm), Syntek Capital, and Wind Telecomunicazioni (Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s second-biggest fixed and mobile telecoms operator). In 2004, he became managing director of Albacom, a joint venture between BNL and BT. When BT bought Albacom outright in 2006, he became CEO of BT Italy and \u00e2\u20ac\u201c in 2011 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c president of BT France as well. Corrado is Italian. He has an electronic engineering degree from the Polytechnic University of Turin and an MBA from the INSEAD business school. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no respite for BT\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s share price this morning; it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s still down almost 18% at 314p, which knocks over \u00c2\u00a36bn off its value. The accounting scandal in Italy (details), and the news that BT\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s UK business is slowing too, are alarming the City. George Salmon, equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, says there were already concerns about BT\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s debt and its pension black hole: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The revelation that accounting deficiencies in Italy are worse than previously thought is a bitter, and needless to say unwelcome, pill to swallow for BT investors. With news that its Business and Public Sector division is coming under pressure too, worries about the group\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ability to fund its generous dividend policy will surely grow. Full year profits are now expected to be around \u00c2\u00a3300m lower than had been hoped, with around \u00c2\u00a3500m of 2016/17 free cash flow disappearing. Just about the only guidance that was left unchanged is the dividend, where the group is still targeting at least 10% increases this year and next. With the group\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s net debts pushing \u00c2\u00a39.6bn following the acquisition of EE, and a review of the how to fund the \u00c2\u00a39.5bn pension deficit coming up in June, there were already a few jitters around the stock so this was the last thing the group needed.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd On the surface, the latest figures on the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s public finances were worse than expected, with a marginally bigger deficit than predicted in December. But the release should still provide some cheer to chancellor Philip Hammond with revisions to November\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s figures meaning he now looks more likely to hit his borrowing target for the full year. Public sector net borrowing decreased by \u00c2\u00a30.4bn to \u00c2\u00a36.9bn in December 2016, compared with December 2015, the Office for National Statistics said. The consensus forecast was for a bigger drop to 6.7bn in a Reuters poll of economists. In the current financial year-to-date (April to December 2016), the public sector borrowed \u00c2\u00a363.8bn. That was \u00c2\u00a310.6bn lower than in the previous financial year-to-date, helped by a smaller deficit than previously thought for November. The Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) is forecasting full-year (April 2016-March 2017) public sector net borrowing of \u00c2\u00a368.2bn. Scott Bowman, UK economist at the consultancy Capital Economics said the fall in borrowing in December continued the recent trend of a gradual improvement in the public finances. Explaining the pattern, he said: The improvement was mainly driven by a 5.6% annual rise in central government receipts, while spending actually fell slightly on a year earlier. And looking through some of the monthly volatility, receipts growth has been on a slight upward trend since May \u00e2\u20ac\u201c adding to the evidence that the economy has held up well following the vote to leave the EU... We think borrowing should come in slightly below the OBR\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s current \u00c2\u00a368bn forecast for the 2016/17 fiscal year.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Suren Thiru, head of economics at the British Chambers of Commerce (BCC), sounds a cautious note about the future state of the public finances as the Brexit process unfolds. The UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fiscal position, which was weakened significantly by the financial crisis, is likely to come under increasing pressure in the near-term if UK economic growth weakens as expected. A slowing economy would further restrict the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s capacity to collect enough tax revenue to consistently achieve deficit reduction in the coming years. More needs to be done to boost business confidence, to help firms to deliver the sort of growth, investment and job creation needed to achieve a sustainable strengthening of the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tax base.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd As predicted in our agenda, the pound has flailed around as Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s top judges delivered their verdict on Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s exit from the EU. The supreme court ruled by 8 votes to 3 that the government cannot trigger Article 50 without parliamentary approval. That sent the pound up to $1.2535, suggesting traders reckon this could slow the Brexit process. But the pound then fell back as the judges announced that the devolved assemblies in Scotland and Northern Ireland do not need to give their own assent. That removes one possible hurdle to Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s exit from the EU. Andy Sparrow\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s politics liveblog has full details and rolling reaction. In other news, Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s factories and service sector firms have made a solid start to 2017. Data firm Markit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s monthly eurozone PMI has come in at 54.3, down slightly from 54.4. Any reading over 50 shows growth. Firms added new jobs at the fastest rate in 9 years too, while factory growth hit a five-year high. Encouraging stuff. BT\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shares are popular with small shareholders, some of whom will have held them since the company was privatised in 1984. So today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s share plunge will have hit them in the pocket (although BT says it hopes to keep raising its dividend over the next couple of years) The Share Centre, a retail stockbroker, have put their \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcbuy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 recommendation on review. Helal Miah, investment research analyst, says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153On top of BT\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s big pension deficit and grumbles amongst rivals and users of its infrastructure network, today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s news has further dented investors\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 confidence in the group. We too, have become more cautious and have placed our current \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcbuy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 recommendation under review. However, this may be an attractive idea for investors taking a contrarian position and, provided the group maintains its dividend, then it could become a good income option.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Mike van Dulken of Accendo Markets on BT shock warning: This morning sees BT Group (BT/A) shares -16% to trade levels last seen in mid-2013. Just as brokers and investors were prepping for FY results on Friday, the company delivers a profits warning linked to an existing accounting scandal at its Italian business. Continued investigation since October (internal + external) has shown the extent of impropriety (sales, purchase, leasing) and overstatement of profits to be far greater than initially thought. Management has been forced to more than triple its expected write-down to \u00c2\u00a3530m and admit that FY revenues, profits and cash flow will be lower than consensus. Last October\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s suggestion of a \u00c2\u00a3145m charge didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t cause too many ripples as regulatory issues and a rising pension deficit hogged the headlines. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s admission adds this to these nasty headwinds, especially as it could weigh on profits for the next two years. Even management isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t sure what the final figure will be. The group still expects 10% dividend increases for the next two years but is this enough to appease disgruntled shareholders who had already been wearing a 20% downtrend since early 2016. The increases may, however, attract newbies via a 4% yield. Assuming this can be honoured\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll get more colour on BT\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s business on Friday, when it publishes its third-quarter financial results. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s announcement was rushed out once the company had calculated the full cost of its Italian accounting problems. Under City rules, a company can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t keep a problem of this magnitude to itself. Q: Why were the accounting irregularities BT Italy not discovered a lot sooner? BT says that it \u00e2\u20ac\u0153needs to reflect\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd on why they were not spotted by BT Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s management, the wider Group, or by its auditors. But it is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153far too premature\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to say anything about the auditors this morning This is turning into a full-blow rout: This is a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153dark day\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd for BT, says city analyst Neil Wilson of ETX Capital. He says investors are selling up, on fears that there are deeper problems at the telecoms firm. The group\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s own investigation of accounting malpractice in its Italian business shows the situation is far worse than it first thought \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the bill is now thought to be around \u00c2\u00a3530m, well above the \u00c2\u00a3145m initially forecast. According to BT, this will mean a reduction in Q3 adjusted revenue and adjusted EBITDA of around \u00c2\u00a3120m. Free cash flow will be \u00c2\u00a3100m worse off. For 2016/17 as a whole the problems will have a negative revenue impact of around \u00c2\u00a3200m, while denting normalised free cash flow by up to \u00c2\u00a3500m. The impact on 2017/18 is expected to be just as bad and that is likely to have a material impact on its ability to return cash to shareholders, although BT says it still expects to grow dividend per share by 10% in each of those years. The problem is that investors will fear that this is not the end \u00e2\u20ac\u201c what else will be uncovered? The costs could yet rise and that fear is driving the selling this morning.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd BT\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shares are now down 19%, which wipes \u00c2\u00a36bn off its market capitalisation. The Italian business will need a lot of work before it can be a growth business, Patterson says, predicting that it has probably been unprofitable for a number of years. CEO Gavin Patterson also warns that BT is feeling the impact of higher inflation, so 2017 will be a lot tougher Q: Is BT now inspecting its other overseas businesses for signs of accounting problems? Yes, Patterson replies, and BT doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t believe an issue like this exists elsewhere in its business. This accounting scandal appears to be \u00e2\u20ac\u0153specific\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to the Italian business, he continues. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a very complex set of manipulations, involving a lot of people over many years. As if BT didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have enough problems right now, it is also warning that the UK market is slowing. The outlook for UK public sector and international corporate markets has deteriorated, says CEO Gavin Patterson. That is potentially down to the wider economy, and potentially down to the Brexit vote. BT CEO Gavin Patterson is briefing City analysts on a conference call now. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve dialled in. Patterson says he is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153deeply disappointed\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd by the inappropriate behaviour uncovered at BT Italy, and confirms that several executives have left the company after being suspended. Financial results have been overstated for several years, Patterson says, so BT is now working out the full impact on the overall Group\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s results. We take the situation at our Italian business extremely seriously, and are taking efforts to strengthen its procedures, Patterson continues. BT shares have hit their lowest level in two and a half years, and are on track for their worst day since the financial crisis of 2008. The City really isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t impressed by these serious accounting mistakes at the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Italian arm. Boom! BT shares have plunged by 15% at the start of trading. That wipes more than \u00c2\u00a35.5bn off the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s value, and sends it sprawling to the bottom of the FTSE 100. City analyst Louise Cooper says this scandal does not reflect well on the City: And this is from Reuters\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Amanda Cooper: BT shares could tumble by 8% in early trading, warns City veteran David Buik. Telecoms group BT has just shocked the City by announcing that the accounting scandal at its Italian division is much worse than previously thought. The FTSE-listed company is slashing its revenue, earnings and free cash flow forecasts for this year, and next year. It has also suspended several senior executives from BT Italy who have already left the company. An investigation by KPMG has uncovered that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the extent and complexity of inappropriate behaviour in the Italian business were far greater than previously identified.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd KPMG found that the division used \u00e2\u20ac\u0153improper accounting practices\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and a complex set of improper sales, purchase, factoring and leasing transactions. This has driven the cost of the scandal up to \u00c2\u00a3530m, sharply higher than the \u00c2\u00a3145m which BT announced in October. This is going to have a serious impact on BT\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s business. It is now predicting no revenue growth over the next two years, and cutting its guidance for EBITDA profits from \u00c2\u00a37.9bn to \u00c2\u00a37.6bn. Gavin Patterson, chief executive of BT Group, says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We are deeply disappointed with the improper practices which we have found in our Italian business. We have undertaken extensive investigations into that business and are committed to ensuring the highest standards across the whole of BT for the benefit of our customers, shareholders, employees and all other stakeholders.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd BT has appointed a new boss of BT Italy. He takes charge on 1 February, and will work on improving the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153governance, compliance and financial safeguards in our Italian business\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. In short, this is pretty serious. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll pull together some reaction now. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Investors in City have plenty to think about today. At 9.30am, the UK supreme court will rule on whether parliament must give its approval before Britain can begin its departure from the European Union. That news will be liveblogged in another place, but we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be watching too as the decision will move the markets. Owen Bowcott, our legal affairs correspondent, explains how the ruling will affect the Brexit timetable: The ruling by the 11 justices will resolve whether the government, through its inherited use of royal prerogative powers, can formally initiate article 50 of the treaty on European Union (TEU) without the explicit approval of MPs and peers. Article 50 begins the process of the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s withdrawal from the EU. If a majority of justices decide, as is widely expected, that parliamentary support is required, then the judgment could specify that legislation is needed. We also get the latest UK public finance figures at 9.30am, covering December. Economists predict that Britain borrowed around \u00c2\u00a36.5bn to balance the books last month. Data firm Markit is reporting its latest PMI surveys for the eurozone this morning, showing how manufacturing and service companies are faring this month. Over in parliament, the Business, Innovations and Skills committee is holding a hearing into executive pay and boardroom diversity, also starting at 9.30am. They\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll hear from Sir Philip Hampton who chaired a review into how to get more women into City boards, along with Baroness Sarah Hogg, Tom Gosling of PWC, Simon Fraser of Investor Forum, Ken Olisa of the Institute of Directors, and Andrew Ninian of Investment Association.",

Jasper Lawler, senior market analyst at London Capital Group, said:<strong> </strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The unenthusiastic reaction by currency traders [to the UK GDP figures] reflects a sense that this could be as good as it gets for UK growth. So far the only major fallout from the EU referendum has been the drop in the pound which will inevitably feed through to higher prices and act as headwind to consumer spending.</p> <p>Markets are forward-discounting mechanisms, and while the growth was faster than expected, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s already well-understood the much lamented Brexit slowdown never happened. By that token, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also evident the Bank of England was completely wrong-footed by the resilience of the UK economy. What\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s less clear is the extent to which markets will be self-correcting. If the pound recovers under a more neutral outlook for UK rates, the resulting inflation will not be as strong and not such a headwind to growth.</p> <p>The data came at time when a rise in political certainty has carried the pound to close to its highest since October\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s flash crash. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s still politics (not economic growth) that is the driving force for sterling.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-588a12a4e4b0b3e971af2fc5\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-01-26T15:21:19.936Z\">3.21pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">US home sales drop in December</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Another set of US data, this time showing a sharp fall in home sales in December after three months of strong gains.</p> <p>New single family home sales fell by 10.4% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 536,000 units last month, a ten month low.

                "bodyText":"In the US the Dow Jones Industrial Average may have continued to head higher in early trading following Wednesday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s long-awaited breach of the 20,000 barrier, but the picture was less clear in Europe. Some support was given by Johnson &amp; Johnson\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s $30bn deal to buy Swiss biotech firm Actelion, but some mixed results from the likes of Unilever and Sage (badly received) and Diageo (positive) left markets struggling for direction. In the event only Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax managed to end the day in positive territory although the declines elsewhere were limited. In the UK the pound dipped on continuing concerns about Brexit, despite better than expected GDP figures, but the FTSE 100 failed to take advantage. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 slipped 2.94 points or 0.04% to 7161.49 Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax rose 0.36% to 11,848.63 France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac closed down 0.21% to 4867.24 Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB fell 0.73% to 19,439.65 Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ibex ended down 0.38% at 9512.8 In Greece, the Athens market added 0.21% to 660.59 On Wall Street the Dow is currently up 28 points at 20,096. On that note it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time to close for the evening. Thanks for your comments, and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be back tomorrow. News that Mexico\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s president Enrique Pe\u00c3\u00b1a Nieto.has called off a proposed meeting with Donald Trump next week as the two side argue about who should pay for the new US president\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s infamous wall plan has hit the Mexican currency: The pound continues to be weaker, slipping back from its six week highs. Despite the better than expected UK GDP figures, concerns about the evenutal outcome of Brexit have helped push sterling down 0.49% against the dollar to $1.2568. Jasper Lawler, senior market analyst at London Capital Group, said: The unenthusiastic reaction by currency traders [to the UK GDP figures] reflects a sense that this could be as good as it gets for UK growth. So far the only major fallout from the EU referendum has been the drop in the pound which will inevitably feed through to higher prices and act as headwind to consumer spending. Markets are forward-discounting mechanisms, and while the growth was faster than expected, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s already well-understood the much lamented Brexit slowdown never happened. By that token, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also evident the Bank of England was completely wrong-footed by the resilience of the UK economy. What\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s less clear is the extent to which markets will be self-correcting. If the pound recovers under a more neutral outlook for UK rates, the resulting inflation will not be as strong and not such a headwind to growth. The data came at time when a rise in political certainty has carried the pound to close to its highest since October\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s flash crash. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s still politics (not economic growth) that is the driving force for sterling. Another set of US data, this time showing a sharp fall in home sales in December after three months of strong gains. New single family home sales fell by 10.4% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 536,000 units last month, a ten month low. November\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s figure was revised up from 592,000 to 598,000. Economists had expected a fall, but only 1% to around 588.000. The positive US service sector figures come after news earlier this week than manufacturing was also performing well in January, and together they point to further Federal Reserve interest rises, said survey compiler IHS Markit. Chris Williamson, its chief business economist, said: The improvement in service sector business conditions follows the news earlier in the week that manufacturing also enjoyed a bumper start to the year. The two PMI surveys collectively point to the economy growing at an annualised rate of just over 2.5% in January, and puts the US on a strong footing to achieve faster growth in 2017. IHS Markit currently forecasts that the US economy will grow by 2.3% in 2017, up from 1.6% in 2016. Although the strong dollar is hitting exports, domestic demand clearly remains buoyant. Companies reported one of the highest inflows of new business for a year and a half as demand lifted higher at the start of 2017. Job creation also remained encouragingly solid, and especially impressive given current high overall levels of employment in the economy. Job gains are linked to increased optimism about the economic outlook. Business expectations of future growth are at their highest for just over one and a half years. The strong start to 2017 and bullish mood for the year ahead adds to our expectation that we will see the Fed hike rates a further three times in 2017. The US services sector has performed slightly better than expected in January, according to initial estimates. Markit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s flash service sector PMI came in at 55.1, up from 53.9 in December and higher than the forecast figure of 54.4. The composite index - which includes services and manufacturing - was 55.4, up from 54.1 in December. Earlier the advance goods trade balance dipped from -$65.3bn to -$65. After Wednesday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s record breaking run for the Dow Jones Industrial Average, which surged through the 20,000 barrier for the first time, US markets have opened the new trading day on a positive note. The Dow is up 21 points at 20,089 , while both the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq Composite have hit new highs, albeit with marginal percentage gains so far. The moves come despite a mixed bag of company results, with Caterpillar and Whirlpool issuing disappointing numbers but cable operator Comcast and eBay both pleasing the market with their latest updates. Just in: More Americans than expected signed on for jobless benefits last week. The closely watched Initial Claims figure rose to 259,000 in the seven days to January 21st (the day after Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s inauguration), from 237,000 the previous week. Economists had expected a smaller rise, to 247,000. The number of Americans who remained on unemployment support also picked up. Called the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dccontinued claims\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 figure, it rose to 2.1 million, from 2.059 million the week before. Over in America, construction and equipment giant Caterpillar has surprised Wall Street by posting a 13% drop in sales in the last three months. Caterpillar, seen as a bellwether for global growth, was also cautious about its prospects, warning that the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153overall environment remains challenging\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Time for a recap, with links to the key points in the blog Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy has beaten expectations by posting growth of 0.6% in the final three months of last year. Service sector companies provided the growth, while pharmaceuticals firms helped UK manufacturing to expand. But construction only grew 0.1% and industrial production was flat. Here are the details: The Office for National Statistics said the economy ended 2016 with \u00e2\u20ac\u0153steady growth\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Chancellor Philip Hammond said Britain is well-positioned to handle \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcuncertainty\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 this year. But the TUC is worried that real incomes will be squeezed this year as inflation rises. The figures are the latest sign that Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy has not been knocked off course by last June\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s EU referendum. GDP growth over the second half of 2016 was faster than in the first six months. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s what people are saying about that. This means Britain was probably the fastest growing G7 economy this year - that will be confirmed once we get GDP from the US, the eurozone, Canada and Japan in the coming days. However, growth was less impressive on a per-capita basis, adjusting for increases in population. Here are some good charts. Several economists expect growth to slow this year. Personal finance experts say families need to get ready now. The pound has fallen back from this morning\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s six-week highs, and is now trading around $1.256, a fall of 0.5%. This morning\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decent growth figures should have supported sterling, but instead traders are worrying about Brexit again. So says Fawad Razaqzada of Forex.com, who writes: This morning\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s UK GDP figures surprised to the upside, yet the pound failed to respond positively to the news as it suffered in a typical \u00e2\u20ac\u0153buy the rumour, sell the fact\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd type of a reaction, except that there were no rumours per se. Sterling has been appreciating noticeably in recent days as traders continued to unwind their Brexit trades \u00e2\u20ac\u201c until today. The economic outlook for the UK remains bleak even if the Brexit vote itself hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t had any material impact on the economy yet. The pound would do very well to get back to $1.40s again. The full impact of Brexit will not be felt for months \u00e2\u20ac\u201c or even years \u00e2\u20ac\u201c but the uncertainty will most likely prevent sterling from appreciating significantly in the interim. So get used to seeing see more chop and churn in GBP for the foreseeable future. Personal finance experts are urging families to get ready for a financial squeeze in 2017, as higher inflation eats into household incomes. Hannah Maundrell, editor in chief of money.co.uk says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a real relief to see the economy has proved resilient against the Brexit backdrop, this puts us in a solid position to navigate the uncertain year ahead. Households haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t been scared out of spending by doom and gloom projections of life outside of the EU and this has really helped to push growth forward. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153My biggest concern right now is how households will cope with rising costs over the coming year. Already two thirds of working households say they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re just about managing to make their money stretch and with few having enough savings to back them up, lots of people will feel the pinch. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a real risk this could impact growth. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s really worth everyone giving their bank balance a health check now. Knowing how much you have coming in each month, checking where your money is going and looking at how you can make simple savings is the best way to make sure you can cope as life gets more expensive.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd And here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Calum Bennie, Scottish Friendly\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s savings specialist: The cheaper pound may be bad news for those queuing at the checkout, as rising import costs push up prices, but it provides new opportunities for UK exporters and a boost for the UK tourism industry. We mustn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t let the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s strong economic output mask the issues facing Brits up and down the country. Consumers are already battling rising food, transport and energy costs, and with an interest rate rise also possible in 2017, households will find little comfort in the macro-economic picture. Even so, people shouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t cut back on putting money aside if they can. Building a nest egg and having the comfort of a lump sum to fall back on is invaluable when money starts to tighten.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Chancellor Philip Hammond has told City reporters not to expect a thrilling budget in March: If the Remain Campaign\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s warnings had been accurate, this is the day that Britain would have officially entered recession. But rather than two quarters of contraction, today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s figures show the economy actually grew by 1.2% in the last six months after the EU referendum. Of course, Britain hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t triggered Article 50 yet, let alone actually leave the EU. But our economics editor Larry Elliott thinks there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s more to it than that: A better explanation for the robust performance of the economy is that consumers have carried on spending. The factors that underpinned domestic demand ahead of the referendum \u00e2\u20ac\u201c low unemployment, rising house prices and rock-bottom interest rates \u00e2\u20ac\u201c are still in place. The Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision to cut rates and to deliver another dollop of quantitative easing in August has, if anything, created even more growth-friendly conditions. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Larry\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s analysis of today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s numbers, following a meeting with Philip Hammond at Microsoft\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s HW. Joanna Partridge of ITV News flags up that Britain probably outperformed its major rivals last year. US GDP figures are released on Friday, followed by eurozone growth figures next Tuesday. Brexit uncertainty is likely to dampen growth this year, according to several City experts, despite the resilient growth in the last three months of 2016. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Andrew Sentance, senior economic adviser at PwC: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Strong consumer spending has supported growth over the past three months and this has more than offset the dampening impact of Brexit uncertainty in investment. As a result, the services sector has continued to be the driving force for the UK economy in recent quarters. The world economy has also helped economic growth with positive indicators in all the main economic regions - Europe, North America and Asia. \u00e2\u20ac\u01532017 will be a more testing year for the UK economy as consumer spending will be squeezed by rising inflation. Despite this, we should expect the underlying resilience of the UK economy and healthy global growth to support economic activity in the year ahead. That should enable GDP to grow by close to 1.5% in 2017 even though Brexit uncertainties will have a dampening effect.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd This is from Ian Kernohan, economist at Royal London Asset Management: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Far from plunging into recession after the vote to leave the EU, the UK was actually the fastest growing G7 economy in 2016. GDP grew by 0.6% quarter on quarter in the final three months of 2016, faster than expected. This included strong contributions from consumer-focused activities, business services and finance. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Looking ahead to 2017, the major question is whether a squeeze on real household incomes, and the impact of Brexit uncertainty on the corporate sector, will be offset by the benefits of cheaper sterling against a stronger backdrop of global economic growth.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Ms Lee Hopley, Chief Economist at EEF, the manufacturers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 organisation, also sees a slowdown this year. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Challenges abound for forecasters in 2017, but we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d caution against complacency. Consumers won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be ramping up spending thanks to rising inflation and sluggish wage growth, and businesses\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 appetite to sign off big investments will depend on how they view the progress of Brexit negotiations. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s every chance that this rate of expansion is the high point for the next couple of years Jo Michell, economics lecturer at Bristol Business School, is worried that consumers are relying on borrowing: Several people are pointing out that there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no sign that Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s vote to leave the EU has hurt the economy (yet anyway). This is from Alan Clarke of Scotia Bank: The first 6 months since the Brexit vote have seen growth of almost 2.5% annualised, which is above trend. Clearly, life goes on, despite the Brexit vote. There isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t an awful lot of detail in the breakdown at this stage. But what we do have shows that services output continues to do all the heavy lifting, while construction output remains the problem child of the UK economy. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s columnist Matthew Lynn: Dr Gerald Lyons, former advisor to Boris Johnson, reckons the EU vote - and the interest rate cut by the Bank of England - actually helped the economy. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s journalist and BBC presenter Andrew Neil: But.... Ranko Berich, head of market analysis at Monex Europe, believes a slowdown is coming: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The latest retail sales data shows a slowdown in spending, and inflation is only just beginning to bite. Businesses now also have a clearer picture of the path of Brexit, so investment behaviour is likely to change in 2017. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This all adds up to a potential slowdown in the economy this year - the Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s gloom about the economic consequences of Brexit could well prove justified in the end, despite the cheery tone of this morning\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s data.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Matt Whittaker of Resolution Foundation is tweeting some interesting GDP charts. This shows how the recovery since the 2008 crash has been much slower than earlier recessions, on a GDP-per-capita basis (growth divided by population). But overall, Britain has done better than its European rivals: Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a recording of Bobby Kennedy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s famous speech on the problems with GDP, from 1968. TUC General Secretary Frances O\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Grady is worried that workers will suffer in 2017, if wages don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t keep pace with inflation: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Our economy may have been resilient in the face of the Brexit vote, but GDP growth is stuck in the slow lane. And people are still feeling the financial crisis in their pockets. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t a time for government complacency. 2017 will be a challenging year, so ministers can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t let us sleep walk into another living standards crisis. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Working people mustn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be forced to pay the price for Brexit. March\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s budget must set out a plan to boost wages, and seriously invest in developing our infrastructure and public services.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The 0.7% jump in manufacturing output last quarter is mainly due to a large rise in the erratically performing pharmaceuticals industry. Economist Rupert Seggins flags up that Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s service sector has been dominant for decades now: Chancellor Philip Hammond has welcomed today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s growth figures, but warned that the economy still faces uncertainty. He says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Every major sector of the economy grew last year, which is further evidence of the fundamental strength and resilience of the UK economy. There may be uncertainty ahead as we adjust to a new relationship with Europe, but we are ready to seize the opportunities to create a competitive economy that works for all.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Hammond is visiting Microsoft\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s HQ in Reading to discuss the economy, so we should hear more from him later... Digging into the GDP report, we can see that Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s retail sector was fastest growing part of the economy. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a worry, as it suggests the UK is still reliant on consumer spending (often on imports) rather than a strong manufacturing base. And if households do cut back in 2017, retail will take a hit. Darren Morgan, the head of GDP at the ONS, says Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy ended last year with \u00e2\u20ac\u0153steady growth\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Strong consumer spending supported the expansion of the dominant services sector and although manufacturing bounced back from a weaker third quarter, both it and construction remained broadly unchanged over the year as a whole.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy has now enjoyed four years of uninterrupted growth. It is now 8.7% higher than its pre-crisis peak in 2008. But on a per capita basis (adjusted for population changes), it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s only 1.9% larger. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s manufacturing sector grew by 0.7% during the last quarter, nearly as fast as the services sector. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s service sector drove growth in the last quarter, expanding by 0.8%, while construction and industrial output lagged behind (again). Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the key points from today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s GDP report: Growth during Quarter 4 was dominated by services, with a strong contribution from consumer-focused industries such as retail sales and travel agency services. Following falls in Quarter 3 (July to Sept) 2016, construction and production provided negligible positive contributions to GDP growth in Quarter 4 2016. UK GDP was estimated to have increased by 2.0% during 2016, slowing slightly from 2.2% in 2015 and from 3.1% in 2014. GDP per head was estimated to have increased by 0.4% during Quarter 4 2016 and by 1.3% during 2016. On an annual basis, the UK economy grew by 2.2% in the last quarter - stronger than the 2.1% growth expected. Breaking: Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy expanded by 0.6% in the final three months of 2016. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stronger than the 0.5% expected by City economists. It matches the growth in the July-September, and shows little sign of any Brexit impact on the UK economy. Five minutes to go! Economists have already warned that the UK economy will slow in 2017, even if last year ended on a high note. The fall in the pound will drive up inflation thus year, eating into household disposable income and ultimately meaning slower growth, according to some City experts. More here: Over in the City, drinks giant Diageo said it had benefited from the slide in the pound against the US dollar and the euro since the Brexit vote. It is estimated to have boosted net sales by about \u00c2\u00a31.4bn and operating profits by \u00c2\u00a3460m in the year to 30 June. The maker of Johnnie Walker whiskey and Smirnoff vodka toasted a 28% rise in first-half operating profits to \u00c2\u00a32.06bn and hiked its interim dividend by 5%. Diageo\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shares rose 4.8% on the news. Unilever fared less well. Its shares slid more than 4% after the Anglo-Dutch consumer giant posted lower-than-expected sales growth of 2.2% for the fourth quarter. It blamed Brazil\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s weak economy along with India\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s move to withdraw high-value rupee notes to fight corruption. Unilever\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chief financial officer Graeme Pitkethly told Reuters that its European prices were starting to move up again after price deflation in many countries \u00e2\u20ac\u201c partly due to price hikes pushed through in the UK to counteract impact of the weaker pound on the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s costs. The price rises led to a public spat with Tesco last year, known as Marmitegate. We shouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t forge that GDP is a somewhat flawed measure - notable for what it omits, as well as what it includes. GDP is calculated by adding up all the money spent and earned in an economy, and the value of the goods and services produced. That gives a measure of the size of the economy, which you can divide by the population total to get GDP per capita. But it doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t include, for example, unpaid work by carers. It doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t consider the environmental damage caused by economic growth. Inequality isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t factored in, nor is the fact that the Internet means we now get many services for free, where once we paid for them. In short, it doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t show if life is better or worse. Bobby Kennedy summed GDP up wonderfully in 1968, three months before he was assassinated, when he said: It counts special locks for our doors and the jails for the people who break them. It counts the destruction of the redwood and the loss of our natural wonder in chaotic sprawl. It counts napalm and counts nuclear warheads and armored cars for the police to fight the riots in our cities. It counts Whitman\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rifle and Speck\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s knife, and the television programs which glorify violence in order to sell toys to our children. Yet the gross national product does not allow for the health of our children, the quality of their education or the joy of their play. It does not include the beauty of our poetry or the strength of our marriages, the intelligence of our public debate or the integrity of our public officials. It measures neither our wit nor our courage, neither our wisdom nor our learning, neither our compassion nor our devotion to our country, it measures everything in short, except that which makes life worthwhile. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s service sector makes up almost 80% of the economy; this chart from Bloomberg shows how it has provided most of the growth in the last three years: Sterling has hit a new six-week high, as traders await the UK GDP figures in an hour\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time. One pound is now worth $1.266, its highest level since 14 December. The Treasury have published a guide to GDP: It concludes that: GDP matters because it shows how healthy the economy is Rising GDP means the economy is growing, and the resources available to people in the country \u00e2\u20ac\u201c goods and services, wages and profits \u00e2\u20ac\u201c are increasing. Analysts at RBC Capital Markets predict that the UK economy ended 2016 in solid shape, after a wobble in October. News on economic output was very weak for October (the service sector aside) but the November story saw a reversal for the production sector at least. Together with strong survey evidence for December that prompted us recently to revise up our Q4 GDP growth forecast to 0.5% q/q as a robust contribution from the service sector is expected once again. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s GDP figures may show if the prospect of a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dchard Brexit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 has hurt the economy. The fourth quarter of 2016 began with prime minister Theresa May pledging to trigger Article 50 by the end of March 2017, and making immigration control a top priority. Kathleen Brooks of City Index says: We should remember that the prospect of a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcHard Brexit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 only raised its head in October, so there could be an even larger decline in business investment in the final three months of the year Although this may have no bearing on growth right now, it is likely to impact GDP levels and confidence levels at some point in 2017, so a sharp decline in this figure is worth noting. Good morning. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time for another healthcheck on the UK economy, as we press on towards triggering Article 50 and leaving the EU. At 9.30am, new GDP figures will be released showing how Britain performed between October and December 2016. This was a busy time, dominated by the Brexit debate and Donald Trump winning the US election. Did this drama and uncertainty hit the economy, or were consumers and businesses undaunted? Economists are expecting another quarter of solid growth, with GDP expanding by 0.5%. That would be a slight slowdown on the 0.6% recorded between July and September, but well away from the the recession some predicted if Britain voted to leave the EU. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s figures are only preliminary, so we won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get too much information about the state of the economy. But it will give a breakdown by sector, so we can see if the service sector continued to drive growth, and whether manufacturers are being helped by the weak pound. Also coming up today: Stock markets are expected to rise, after the US Dow Jones index smashed through 20,000 yesterday. Daily Mail and General Trust, Unilever, Sky, Whitbread, Jimmy Choo and Diageo are all reporting results. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also a flurry of excitement in the City as Royal Bank of Scotland announces it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s setting aside another \u00c2\u00a33.1bn to cover the cost of misselling toxic bonds. Will it never end?....",

Cuban, who campaigned for Hillary Clinton during the election, told CNBC that in person Trump seemed reasonable and open-minded. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153But all that is thrown out the window when he tweets and when he communicates with the media,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This dichotomy makes things very difficult for business.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Cuban said that Google, Microsoft and others had already had their businesses disrupted by Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s travel restrictions and that they were making life more confusing for employers of foreign-born workers. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Now you have to give consideration to where they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re from, what their circumstances are, what type of travel that person is doing. Are they a risk? How does that impact my future hiring?\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd",
