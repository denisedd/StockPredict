Jasper Lawler, senior market analyst at London Capital Group, said:<strong> </strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The unenthusiastic reaction by currency traders [to the UK GDP figures] reflects a sense that this could be as good as it gets for UK growth. So far the only major fallout from the EU referendum has been the drop in the pound which will inevitably feed through to higher prices and act as headwind to consumer spending.</p> <p>Markets are forward-discounting mechanisms, and while the growth was faster than expected, it\u2019s already well-understood the much lamented Brexit slowdown never happened. By that token, it\u2019s also evident the Bank of England was completely wrong-footed by the resilience of the UK economy. What\u2019s less clear is the extent to which markets will be self-correcting. If the pound recovers under a more neutral outlook for UK rates, the resulting inflation will not be as strong and not such a headwind to growth.</p> <p>The data came at time when a rise in political certainty has carried the pound to close to its highest since October\u2019s flash crash.

As a result, the services sector has continued to be the driving force for the UK economy in recent quarters. The world economy has also helped economic growth with positive indicators in all the main economic regions - Europe, North America and Asia.</p> <p>\u201c2017 will be a more testing year for the UK economy as consumer spending will be squeezed by rising inflation. Despite this, we should expect the underlying resilience of the UK economy and healthy global growth to support economic activity in the year ahead. That should enable GDP to grow by close to 1.5% in 2017 even though Brexit uncertainties will have a dampening effect.\u201d</p> </blockquote> <p> This is from <strong>Ian Kernohan</strong>, economist at <strong>Royal London Asset Managemen</strong>t:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\u201cFar from plunging into recession after the vote to leave the EU, the UK was actually the fastest growing G7 economy in 2016. GDP grew by 0.6% quarter on quarter in the final three months of 2016, faster than expected. This included strong contributions from consumer-focused activities, business services and finance. </p> <p>\u201cLooking ahead to 2017, the major question is whether a squeeze on real household incomes, and the impact of Brexit uncertainty on the corporate sector, will be offset by the benefits of cheaper sterling against a stronger backdrop of global economic growth.\u201d</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Ms Lee Hopley</strong>, Chief Economist at <strong>EEF</strong>, the manufacturers\u2019 organisation, also sees a slowdown this year.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\u201cChallenges abound for forecasters in 2017, but we\u2019d caution against complacency.</p> <p>Consumers won\u2019t be ramping up spending thanks to rising inflation and sluggish wage growth, and businesses\u2019 appetite to sign off big investments will depend on how they view the progress of Brexit negotiations.

                "bodyText":"In the US the Dow Jones Industrial Average may have continued to head higher in early trading following Wednesday\u2019s long-awaited breach of the 20,000 barrier, but the picture was less clear in Europe. Some support was given by Johnson &amp; Johnson\u2019s $30bn deal to buy Swiss biotech firm Actelion, but some mixed results from the likes of Unilever and Sage (badly received) and Diageo (positive) left markets struggling for direction. In the event only Germany\u2019s Dax managed to end the day in positive territory although the declines elsewhere were limited. In the UK the pound dipped on continuing concerns about Brexit, despite better than expected GDP figures, but the FTSE 100 failed to take advantage. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 slipped 2.94 points or 0.04% to 7161.49 Germany\u2019s Dax rose 0.36% to 11,848.63 France\u2019s Cac closed down 0.21% to 4867.24 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB fell 0.73% to 19,439.65 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended down 0.38% at 9512.8 In Greece, the Athens market added 0.21% to 660.59 On Wall Street the Dow is currently up 28 points at 20,096. On that note it\u2019s time to close for the evening. Thanks for your comments, and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. News that Mexico\u2019s president Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto.has called off a proposed meeting with Donald Trump next week as the two side argue about who should pay for the new US president\u2019s infamous wall plan has hit the Mexican currency: The pound continues to be weaker, slipping back from its six week highs. Despite the better than expected UK GDP figures, concerns about the evenutal outcome of Brexit have helped push sterling down 0.49% against the dollar to $1.2568. Jasper Lawler, senior market analyst at London Capital Group, said: The unenthusiastic reaction by currency traders [to the UK GDP figures] reflects a sense that this could be as good as it gets for UK growth. So far the only major fallout from the EU referendum has been the drop in the pound which will inevitably feed through to higher prices and act as headwind to consumer spending. Markets are forward-discounting mechanisms, and while the growth was faster than expected, it\u2019s already well-understood the much lamented Brexit slowdown never happened. By that token, it\u2019s also evident the Bank of England was completely wrong-footed by the resilience of the UK economy. What\u2019s less clear is the extent to which markets will be self-correcting. If the pound recovers under a more neutral outlook for UK rates, the resulting inflation will not be as strong and not such a headwind to growth. The data came at time when a rise in political certainty has carried the pound to close to its highest since October\u2019s flash crash. It\u2019s still politics (not economic growth) that is the driving force for sterling. Another set of US data, this time showing a sharp fall in home sales in December after three months of strong gains. New single family home sales fell by 10.4% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 536,000 units last month, a ten month low. November\u2019s figure was revised up from 592,000 to 598,000. Economists had expected a fall, but only 1% to around 588.000. The positive US service sector figures come after news earlier this week than manufacturing was also performing well in January, and together they point to further Federal Reserve interest rises, said survey compiler IHS Markit. Chris Williamson, its chief business economist, said: The improvement in service sector business conditions follows the news earlier in the week that manufacturing also enjoyed a bumper start to the year. The two PMI surveys collectively point to the economy growing at an annualised rate of just over 2.5% in January, and puts the US on a strong footing to achieve faster growth in 2017. IHS Markit currently forecasts that the US economy will grow by 2.3% in 2017, up from 1.6% in 2016. Although the strong dollar is hitting exports, domestic demand clearly remains buoyant. Companies reported one of the highest inflows of new business for a year and a half as demand lifted higher at the start of 2017. Job creation also remained encouragingly solid, and especially impressive given current high overall levels of employment in the economy. Job gains are linked to increased optimism about the economic outlook. Business expectations of future growth are at their highest for just over one and a half years. The strong start to 2017 and bullish mood for the year ahead adds to our expectation that we will see the Fed hike rates a further three times in 2017. The US services sector has performed slightly better than expected in January, according to initial estimates. Markit\u2019s flash service sector PMI came in at 55.1, up from 53.9 in December and higher than the forecast figure of 54.4. The composite index - which includes services and manufacturing - was 55.4, up from 54.1 in December. Earlier the advance goods trade balance dipped from -$65.3bn to -$65. After Wednesday\u2019s record breaking run for the Dow Jones Industrial Average, which surged through the 20,000 barrier for the first time, US markets have opened the new trading day on a positive note. The Dow is up 21 points at 20,089 , while both the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq Composite have hit new highs, albeit with marginal percentage gains so far. The moves come despite a mixed bag of company results, with Caterpillar and Whirlpool issuing disappointing numbers but cable operator Comcast and eBay both pleasing the market with their latest updates. Just in: More Americans than expected signed on for jobless benefits last week. The closely watched Initial Claims figure rose to 259,000 in the seven days to January 21st (the day after Donald Trump\u2019s inauguration), from 237,000 the previous week. Economists had expected a smaller rise, to 247,000. The number of Americans who remained on unemployment support also picked up. Called the \u2018continued claims\u2019 figure, it rose to 2.1 million, from 2.059 million the week before. Over in America, construction and equipment giant Caterpillar has surprised Wall Street by posting a 13% drop in sales in the last three months. Caterpillar, seen as a bellwether for global growth, was also cautious about its prospects, warning that the \u201coverall environment remains challenging\u201d. Time for a recap, with links to the key points in the blog Britain\u2019s economy has beaten expectations by posting growth of 0.6% in the final three months of last year. Service sector companies provided the growth, while pharmaceuticals firms helped UK manufacturing to expand. But construction only grew 0.1% and industrial production was flat. Here are the details: The Office for National Statistics said the economy ended 2016 with \u201csteady growth\u201d. Chancellor Philip Hammond said Britain is well-positioned to handle \u2018uncertainty\u2019 this year. But the TUC is worried that real incomes will be squeezed this year as inflation rises. The figures are the latest sign that Britain\u2019s economy has not been knocked off course by last June\u2019s EU referendum. GDP growth over the second half of 2016 was faster than in the first six months. Here\u2019s what people are saying about that. This means Britain was probably the fastest growing G7 economy this year - that will be confirmed once we get GDP from the US, the eurozone, Canada and Japan in the coming days. However, growth was less impressive on a per-capita basis, adjusting for increases in population. Here are some good charts. Several economists expect growth to slow this year. Personal finance experts say families need to get ready now. The pound has fallen back from this morning\u2019s six-week highs, and is now trading around $1.256, a fall of 0.5%. This morning\u2019s decent growth figures should have supported sterling, but instead traders are worrying about Brexit again. So says Fawad Razaqzada of Forex.com, who writes: This morning\u2019s UK GDP figures surprised to the upside, yet the pound failed to respond positively to the news as it suffered in a typical \u201cbuy the rumour, sell the fact\u201d type of a reaction, except that there were no rumours per se. Sterling has been appreciating noticeably in recent days as traders continued to unwind their Brexit trades \u2013 until today. The economic outlook for the UK remains bleak even if the Brexit vote itself hasn\u2019t had any material impact on the economy yet. The pound would do very well to get back to $1.40s again. The full impact of Brexit will not be felt for months \u2013 or even years \u2013 but the uncertainty will most likely prevent sterling from appreciating significantly in the interim. So get used to seeing see more chop and churn in GBP for the foreseeable future. Personal finance experts are urging families to get ready for a financial squeeze in 2017, as higher inflation eats into household incomes. Hannah Maundrell, editor in chief of money.co.uk says: \u201cIt\u2019s a real relief to see the economy has proved resilient against the Brexit backdrop, this puts us in a solid position to navigate the uncertain year ahead. Households haven\u2019t been scared out of spending by doom and gloom projections of life outside of the EU and this has really helped to push growth forward. \u201cMy biggest concern right now is how households will cope with rising costs over the coming year. Already two thirds of working households say they\u2019re just about managing to make their money stretch and with few having enough savings to back them up, lots of people will feel the pinch. There\u2019s a real risk this could impact growth. \u201cIt\u2019s really worth everyone giving their bank balance a health check now. Knowing how much you have coming in each month, checking where your money is going and looking at how you can make simple savings is the best way to make sure you can cope as life gets more expensive.\u201d And here\u2019s Calum Bennie, Scottish Friendly\u2019s savings specialist: The cheaper pound may be bad news for those queuing at the checkout, as rising import costs push up prices, but it provides new opportunities for UK exporters and a boost for the UK tourism industry. We mustn\u2019t let the UK\u2019s strong economic output mask the issues facing Brits up and down the country. Consumers are already battling rising food, transport and energy costs, and with an interest rate rise also possible in 2017, households will find little comfort in the macro-economic picture. Even so, people shouldn\u2019t cut back on putting money aside if they can. Building a nest egg and having the comfort of a lump sum to fall back on is invaluable when money starts to tighten.\u201d Chancellor Philip Hammond has told City reporters not to expect a thrilling budget in March: If the Remain Campaign\u2019s warnings had been accurate, this is the day that Britain would have officially entered recession. But rather than two quarters of contraction, today\u2019s figures show the economy actually grew by 1.2% in the last six months after the EU referendum. Of course, Britain hasn\u2019t triggered Article 50 yet, let alone actually leave the EU. But our economics editor Larry Elliott thinks there\u2019s more to it than that: A better explanation for the robust performance of the economy is that consumers have carried on spending. The factors that underpinned domestic demand ahead of the referendum \u2013 low unemployment, rising house prices and rock-bottom interest rates \u2013 are still in place. The Bank\u2019s decision to cut rates and to deliver another dollop of quantitative easing in August has, if anything, created even more growth-friendly conditions. Here\u2019s Larry\u2019s analysis of today\u2019s numbers, following a meeting with Philip Hammond at Microsoft\u2019s HW. Joanna Partridge of ITV News flags up that Britain probably outperformed its major rivals last year. US GDP figures are released on Friday, followed by eurozone growth figures next Tuesday. Brexit uncertainty is likely to dampen growth this year, according to several City experts, despite the resilient growth in the last three months of 2016. Here\u2019s Andrew Sentance, senior economic adviser at PwC: \u201cStrong consumer spending has supported growth over the past three months and this has more than offset the dampening impact of Brexit uncertainty in investment. As a result, the services sector has continued to be the driving force for the UK economy in recent quarters. The world economy has also helped economic growth with positive indicators in all the main economic regions - Europe, North America and Asia. \u201c2017 will be a more testing year for the UK economy as consumer spending will be squeezed by rising inflation. Despite this, we should expect the underlying resilience of the UK economy and healthy global growth to support economic activity in the year ahead. That should enable GDP to grow by close to 1.5% in 2017 even though Brexit uncertainties will have a dampening effect.\u201d This is from Ian Kernohan, economist at Royal London Asset Management: \u201cFar from plunging into recession after the vote to leave the EU, the UK was actually the fastest growing G7 economy in 2016. GDP grew by 0.6% quarter on quarter in the final three months of 2016, faster than expected. This included strong contributions from consumer-focused activities, business services and finance. \u201cLooking ahead to 2017, the major question is whether a squeeze on real household incomes, and the impact of Brexit uncertainty on the corporate sector, will be offset by the benefits of cheaper sterling against a stronger backdrop of global economic growth.\u201d Ms Lee Hopley, Chief Economist at EEF, the manufacturers\u2019 organisation, also sees a slowdown this year. \u201cChallenges abound for forecasters in 2017, but we\u2019d caution against complacency. Consumers won\u2019t be ramping up spending thanks to rising inflation and sluggish wage growth, and businesses\u2019 appetite to sign off big investments will depend on how they view the progress of Brexit negotiations. There\u2019s every chance that this rate of expansion is the high point for the next couple of years Jo Michell, economics lecturer at Bristol Business School, is worried that consumers are relying on borrowing: Several people are pointing out that there\u2019s no sign that Britain\u2019s vote to leave the EU has hurt the economy (yet anyway). This is from Alan Clarke of Scotia Bank: The first 6 months since the Brexit vote have seen growth of almost 2.5% annualised, which is above trend. Clearly, life goes on, despite the Brexit vote. There isn\u2019t an awful lot of detail in the breakdown at this stage. But what we do have shows that services output continues to do all the heavy lifting, while construction output remains the problem child of the UK economy. Here\u2019s columnist Matthew Lynn: Dr Gerald Lyons, former advisor to Boris Johnson, reckons the EU vote - and the interest rate cut by the Bank of England - actually helped the economy. Here\u2019s journalist and BBC presenter Andrew Neil: But.... Ranko Berich, head of market analysis at Monex Europe, believes a slowdown is coming: \u201cThe latest retail sales data shows a slowdown in spending, and inflation is only just beginning to bite. Businesses now also have a clearer picture of the path of Brexit, so investment behaviour is likely to change in 2017. \u201cThis all adds up to a potential slowdown in the economy this year - the Bank of England\u2019s gloom about the economic consequences of Brexit could well prove justified in the end, despite the cheery tone of this morning\u2019s data.\u201d Matt Whittaker of Resolution Foundation is tweeting some interesting GDP charts. This shows how the recovery since the 2008 crash has been much slower than earlier recessions, on a GDP-per-capita basis (growth divided by population). But overall, Britain has done better than its European rivals: Here\u2019s a recording of Bobby Kennedy\u2019s famous speech on the problems with GDP, from 1968. TUC General Secretary Frances O\u2019Grady is worried that workers will suffer in 2017, if wages don\u2019t keep pace with inflation: \u201cOur economy may have been resilient in the face of the Brexit vote, but GDP growth is stuck in the slow lane. And people are still feeling the financial crisis in their pockets. \u201cThis isn\u2019t a time for government complacency. 2017 will be a challenging year, so ministers can\u2019t let us sleep walk into another living standards crisis. \u201cWorking people mustn\u2019t be forced to pay the price for Brexit. March\u2019s budget must set out a plan to boost wages, and seriously invest in developing our infrastructure and public services.\u201d The 0.7% jump in manufacturing output last quarter is mainly due to a large rise in the erratically performing pharmaceuticals industry. Economist Rupert Seggins flags up that Britain\u2019s service sector has been dominant for decades now: Chancellor Philip Hammond has welcomed today\u2019s growth figures, but warned that the economy still faces uncertainty. He says: \u201cEvery major sector of the economy grew last year, which is further evidence of the fundamental strength and resilience of the UK economy. There may be uncertainty ahead as we adjust to a new relationship with Europe, but we are ready to seize the opportunities to create a competitive economy that works for all.\u201d Hammond is visiting Microsoft\u2019s HQ in Reading to discuss the economy, so we should hear more from him later... Digging into the GDP report, we can see that Britain\u2019s retail sector was fastest growing part of the economy. That\u2019s a worry, as it suggests the UK is still reliant on consumer spending (often on imports) rather than a strong manufacturing base. And if households do cut back in 2017, retail will take a hit. Darren Morgan, the head of GDP at the ONS, says Britain\u2019s economy ended last year with \u201csteady growth\u201d. \u201cStrong consumer spending supported the expansion of the dominant services sector and although manufacturing bounced back from a weaker third quarter, both it and construction remained broadly unchanged over the year as a whole.\u201d Britain\u2019s economy has now enjoyed four years of uninterrupted growth. It is now 8.7% higher than its pre-crisis peak in 2008. But on a per capita basis (adjusted for population changes), it\u2019s only 1.9% larger. Britain\u2019s manufacturing sector grew by 0.7% during the last quarter, nearly as fast as the services sector. Britain\u2019s service sector drove growth in the last quarter, expanding by 0.8%, while construction and industrial output lagged behind (again). Here\u2019s the key points from today\u2019s GDP report: Growth during Quarter 4 was dominated by services, with a strong contribution from consumer-focused industries such as retail sales and travel agency services. Following falls in Quarter 3 (July to Sept) 2016, construction and production provided negligible positive contributions to GDP growth in Quarter 4 2016. UK GDP was estimated to have increased by 2.0% during 2016, slowing slightly from 2.2% in 2015 and from 3.1% in 2014. GDP per head was estimated to have increased by 0.4% during Quarter 4 2016 and by 1.3% during 2016. On an annual basis, the UK economy grew by 2.2% in the last quarter - stronger than the 2.1% growth expected. Breaking: Britain\u2019s economy expanded by 0.6% in the final three months of 2016. That\u2019s stronger than the 0.5% expected by City economists. It matches the growth in the July-September, and shows little sign of any Brexit impact on the UK economy. Five minutes to go! Economists have already warned that the UK economy will slow in 2017, even if last year ended on a high note. The fall in the pound will drive up inflation thus year, eating into household disposable income and ultimately meaning slower growth, according to some City experts. More here: Over in the City, drinks giant Diageo said it had benefited from the slide in the pound against the US dollar and the euro since the Brexit vote. It is estimated to have boosted net sales by about \u00a31.4bn and operating profits by \u00a3460m in the year to 30 June. The maker of Johnnie Walker whiskey and Smirnoff vodka toasted a 28% rise in first-half operating profits to \u00a32.06bn and hiked its interim dividend by 5%. Diageo\u2019s shares rose 4.8% on the news. Unilever fared less well. Its shares slid more than 4% after the Anglo-Dutch consumer giant posted lower-than-expected sales growth of 2.2% for the fourth quarter. It blamed Brazil\u2019s weak economy along with India\u2019s move to withdraw high-value rupee notes to fight corruption. Unilever\u2019s chief financial officer Graeme Pitkethly told Reuters that its European prices were starting to move up again after price deflation in many countries \u2013 partly due to price hikes pushed through in the UK to counteract impact of the weaker pound on the company\u2019s costs. The price rises led to a public spat with Tesco last year, known as Marmitegate. We shouldn\u2019t forge that GDP is a somewhat flawed measure - notable for what it omits, as well as what it includes. GDP is calculated by adding up all the money spent and earned in an economy, and the value of the goods and services produced. That gives a measure of the size of the economy, which you can divide by the population total to get GDP per capita. But it doesn\u2019t include, for example, unpaid work by carers. It doesn\u2019t consider the environmental damage caused by economic growth. Inequality isn\u2019t factored in, nor is the fact that the Internet means we now get many services for free, where once we paid for them. In short, it doesn\u2019t show if life is better or worse. Bobby Kennedy summed GDP up wonderfully in 1968, three months before he was assassinated, when he said: It counts special locks for our doors and the jails for the people who break them. It counts the destruction of the redwood and the loss of our natural wonder in chaotic sprawl. It counts napalm and counts nuclear warheads and armored cars for the police to fight the riots in our cities. It counts Whitman\u2019s rifle and Speck\u2019s knife, and the television programs which glorify violence in order to sell toys to our children. Yet the gross national product does not allow for the health of our children, the quality of their education or the joy of their play. It does not include the beauty of our poetry or the strength of our marriages, the intelligence of our public debate or the integrity of our public officials. It measures neither our wit nor our courage, neither our wisdom nor our learning, neither our compassion nor our devotion to our country, it measures everything in short, except that which makes life worthwhile. Britain\u2019s service sector makes up almost 80% of the economy; this chart from Bloomberg shows how it has provided most of the growth in the last three years: Sterling has hit a new six-week high, as traders await the UK GDP figures in an hour\u2019s time. One pound is now worth $1.266, its highest level since 14 December. The Treasury have published a guide to GDP: It concludes that: GDP matters because it shows how healthy the economy is Rising GDP means the economy is growing, and the resources available to people in the country \u2013 goods and services, wages and profits \u2013 are increasing. Analysts at RBC Capital Markets predict that the UK economy ended 2016 in solid shape, after a wobble in October. News on economic output was very weak for October (the service sector aside) but the November story saw a reversal for the production sector at least. Together with strong survey evidence for December that prompted us recently to revise up our Q4 GDP growth forecast to 0.5% q/q as a robust contribution from the service sector is expected once again. Today\u2019s GDP figures may show if the prospect of a \u2018hard Brexit\u2019 has hurt the economy. The fourth quarter of 2016 began with prime minister Theresa May pledging to trigger Article 50 by the end of March 2017, and making immigration control a top priority. Kathleen Brooks of City Index says: We should remember that the prospect of a \u2018Hard Brexit\u2019 only raised its head in October, so there could be an even larger decline in business investment in the final three months of the year Although this may have no bearing on growth right now, it is likely to impact GDP levels and confidence levels at some point in 2017, so a sharp decline in this figure is worth noting. Good morning. It\u2019s time for another healthcheck on the UK economy, as we press on towards triggering Article 50 and leaving the EU. At 9.30am, new GDP figures will be released showing how Britain performed between October and December 2016. This was a busy time, dominated by the Brexit debate and Donald Trump winning the US election. Did this drama and uncertainty hit the economy, or were consumers and businesses undaunted? Economists are expecting another quarter of solid growth, with GDP expanding by 0.5%. That would be a slight slowdown on the 0.6% recorded between July and September, but well away from the the recession some predicted if Britain voted to leave the EU. Today\u2019s figures are only preliminary, so we won\u2019t get too much information about the state of the economy. But it will give a breakdown by sector, so we can see if the service sector continued to drive growth, and whether manufacturers are being helped by the weak pound. Also coming up today: Stock markets are expected to rise, after the US Dow Jones index smashed through 20,000 yesterday. Daily Mail and General Trust, Unilever, Sky, Whitbread, Jimmy Choo and Diageo are all reporting results. There\u2019s also a flurry of excitement in the City as Royal Bank of Scotland announces it\u2019s setting aside another \u00a33.1bn to cover the cost of misselling toxic bonds. Will it never end?....",
