In particular, Luxembourg representatives said they would fundamentally object to any proposal to publish arguments made by Luxembourg in the committee.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd A later cable read: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It is impressive to see how some member states present themselves outwardly as proponents of [international tax reforms] and at the same time to watch how they actually behave in EU discussions, protected by confidentiality.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The Guardian contacted Juncker\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s office for comment. A spokesperson said it was not for the European commission to respond to questions about negotiating positions Luxembourg had taken, or about the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s past tax policies. Damaging revelations Jean-Claude Juncker\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s record as Luxembourg\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s prime minister has cast an enduring shadow over his presidency of the European commission. On paper, his marathon 18-year stint at the helm of the EU\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s second smallest member state might be hailed a triumph. He recast the fading steel-based economy into a booming hub for international business, and when he departed in 2013 Luxembourg had been transformed into one of the richest countries in the world per capita. Hundreds of the multinational corporations rushed to channel international profits through subsidiaries in the country, among them McDonald\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s, Fiat, Amazon, Shire Pharmaceuticals and Skype. The secret to this success was exposed in 2014 when the Luxleaks scandal revealed the terms hidden within hundreds of private deals, known as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153tax rulings\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, that Luxembourg had handed out to multinational businesses behind closed doors. The rulings effectively rubber-stamped complex tax structures that global corporations used to access ultra-low tax rates, often less than 1%, for profits shifted to Luxembourg. Juncker conceded the scandal had damaged his reputation. While not illegal, he admitted Luxembourg\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tax system was also \u00e2\u20ac\u0153not always in line with fiscal fairness\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and may have breached \u00e2\u20ac\u0153ethical and moral standards\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Since then, Juncker has made a point of supporting the EU\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s competition commissioner, Margrethe Vestager, as she pursues high-profile investigations into specific tax rulings, including deals Luxembourg granted separately to McDonald\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s and Amazon. The investigations are examining whether the deals were so generous that they amounted to illegal state aid from Juncker\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Luxembourg. Juncker has also campaigned hard for greater tax cooperation among member states in the battle against international businesses that avoid tax. The latest leaked cables, however, raise further questions about whether he is the right person to champion such reforms.",

                "bodyText":"Morrisons had its best Christmas for seven years after the supermarket chain revamped its premium ranges, opened more tills and cut fewer prices. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fourth-largest retailer reported a 2.9% increase in sales excluding fuel in the nine weeks to 1 January, with fresh fruit and vegetables, beers, wine and spirits, and its new upmarket The Best range faring well. Sales of Morrisons\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Nutmeg clothing range were up by 30%, while performance was lifted by a 0.6% rise in online sales, partly thanks to its tie-up with Amazon. It was Morrisons\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 biggest quarterly sales rise at stores open for more than a year since Christmas 2009, and well ahead of the 1.6% growth reported in the previous quarter. Total sales excluding fuel went up by 2%, the first rise since November 2013, despite store closures over the year. David Potts, the chief executive of the Bradford-based supermarket, said stores had been more prepared to meet demand than in previous years, with better-stocked shelves and improved service. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We are delighted to have found our mojo,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Every year does bring its challenges, but so far we haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t seen any change in consumer sentiment. Customers splashed out over Christmas and wanted to trade up.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd He said the company had sold 50,000 packs of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153shimmering macarons\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and sold out online of a Christmas tree-shaped chocolate gateau before it could reach stores, as shoppers snapped up 100 new premium festive products. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The Best was a gamechanger for us this Christmas,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Potts said. But he insisted that Morrisons had done better \u00e2\u20ac\u0153across the board\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, and the sales increase was to do with more than premium food and cheap alcohol. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We are becoming more relevant to more people as we turn the company around,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Potts said. Morrisons\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 figures were also underpinned by a big drop in price deflation. The company said its prices were down by only 0.2% during the Christmas period, compared with a 1% fall in the previous quarter. The squeeze on prices was felt across the whole market, with grocery prices rising by 0.2% in the 12 weeks to 1 January, the first inflation in just over two years, according to market data released by Kantar Worldpanel on Tuesday. But Trevor Strain, the Morrisons chief financial officer, said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Despite commodity pressures, our Christmas basket was still very competitive.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Morrisons is thought to have outperformed its major competitors, but smaller chains including Aldi, Iceland and the Co-operative also did well over the Christmas period. The Co-op announced on Tuesday that sales increased by 3.5% at stores open more than a year in the three weeks to New Year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Eve. The convenience store group said its biggest-selling line was own-label prosecco, but frozen ready meals and fresh produce also sold well. Phil Dorrell, a partner at consultancy Retail Remedy, described the Christmas sales jump at Morrisons as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153quite remarkable\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Potts has turned this ship around and while navigating a big tanker like this takes time, his grip on the tiller is both clear and strong. Morrisons\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Christmas marketing campaign was fresh and delivered a relevant food quality feel,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said. Bruno Monteyne, an analyst at Bernstein, said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This strong result reflects good execution by Morrisons as customers lost over the past few years come back to stores. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We also expect it to reflect an overall strong Christmas by UK food retailers, with this result boding well for Sainsbury\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s and Tesco results later this week.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Potts said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This Christmas we made further improvements to the customer shopping trip. We stocked more of what our customers wanted to buy, more tills were open more often, and product availability improved as more than half of sales went through our new ordering system. Both like for like and total sales grew, which was very encouraging.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The company raised its full-year guidance following the better than expected festive trading season. It expects underlying pretax profit for the full 2016-17 year to be between \u00c2\u00a3330m and \u00c2\u00a3340m, ahead of analysts\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 expectations of about \u00c2\u00a3326m. Morrisons maintained its guidance that net debt would be about \u00c2\u00a31.2bn at the end of the financial year. Morrisons\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 share price rose by nearly 4% following the upbeat update, which also helped boost Tesco\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shares by nearly 6% and Sainsbury\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s by 1.6%.",

Investments in new technology put a premium on workers with higher education and better skills, leaving the unskilled to languish on low pay, while globalisation has raised the incomes of the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s poorer workers at the expense of those in the west. </p> <p>The discontent this brings about \u00e2\u20ac\u0153has now become an election-winning proposition\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd that demands action, says the WEF.</p> <h2>2 Changing climate</h2> <p>Climate change is ranked as the second biggest risk for this year, due in part to the increasingly frequent extreme weather that it heralds. While the end of the cyclical global weather phenomenon El Ni\u00c3\u00b1o means 2017 is unlikely to top 2016 as the hottest on record, the Met Office forecasts it will still globally be one of the warmest ever. </p> <p>The heat is also likely to be cooler in political circles after last year, which saw the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/paris-climate-agreement\">Paris climate agreement</a> ratified at breakneck speed and several other climate deals agreed. </p> <p>This year governments must get on with actually delivering the carbon curbs they promised at Paris \u00e2\u20ac\u201c as the WEF points out, the pace at which emissions are being cut is not yet fast enough to avoid dangerous global warming.</p> <h2>3 Increasing polarisation in societies</h2> <p>The WEF is concerned that democracy itself is in crisis. Policymakers and managers of public and private institutions have become divorced from their electorates both in terms of their cultural backgrounds and their pay and benefits. </p> <p>Post-truth news media is undermining trust in pillars of the constitution, such as the judiciary. Austerity is hacking back at welfare provision for the vulnerable in society. And multiculturalism is under pressure from nationalism. </p> <p>\u00e2\u20ac\u0153This could be a pivotal moment in political history,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd the WEF said, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153and it requires courageous new thinking about how best to manage the relationship between citizens and their elected representatives.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd</p> <h2>4 Rising cyber dependency</h2> <p>Amazon Echo\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s virtual assistant Alexa <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/shortcuts/2017/jan/09/alexa-amazon-echo-goes-rogue-accidental-shopping-dolls-house\">adding unwanted items including doll\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s houses to shopping lists</a> is just one example of the problems arising from an ever more interconnected world. </p> <p>An increasing amount of critical infrastructure relies, not just on information technology in general, but on the open internet in particular. This has brought great benefits but it also provides more opportunity for anyone hoping to wreak havoc through hacking attacks. </p> <p>Beyond critical infrastructure, the developed world relies on the open net for a large proportion of economic activity. An estimated 10% of British GDP comes from the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153internet economy\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd.</p> <h2>5 Ageing population</h2> <p>A quarter of Japan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s population is aged over 65, and the proportion is on track to reach 40%. Japanese people younger than 19 comprised 40% of the population in 1960, but are projected to make up just 13% of the population in 2060. The rest of the developed world, and much of the developing world, is heading in the same direction. </p> <p>To fund welfare programmes, including a long-term care insurance begun in 2000 that ranks as one of the most generous in the world, Tokyo has run up a debt to GDP ratio of 240%. </p> <p>This culminated in a plea for the fit elderly to look after the unfit, the disabled and ill. It could be argued that Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s current healthcare crisis is largely due to successive governments ignoring the lessons from Japan. </p> <p>China is getting old at the point it gets rich, forcing it to address care and healthcare issues decades before western countries at a similar stage of development.</p> <p>\u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 This article was amended on 13 January 2017. An earlier version referred to Japan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s budget deficit where its debt to GDP ratio was meant.</p>",

Before its annual meeting in Davos next week, the WEF said the gap between rich and poor had been behind the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Brexit vote and Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s election victory in the US. And it warned that there were new threats to social cohesion from the robotics and artificial intelligence revolution. The organisation said fundamental reform of capitalism may be needed to tackle public anger. The WEF\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s annual global risks report \u00e2\u20ac\u201c culled from 700 experts \u00e2\u20ac\u201c found that rising income and wealth disparity, and increasing polarisation of sectors of society, were ranked first and third among the underlying trends that will determine the shape of the world in the next decade. Climate change was considered the second most important underlying trend, with the WEF noting that environmental concerns were more prominent in the report than ever before. Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s inauguration on 20 January coincides with next week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Davos meeting and the founder of the WEF, Klaus Schwab, said 2017 would be a pivotal moment for the global community. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The threat of a less cooperative, more inward-looking world also creates the opportunity to address global risks and the trends that drive them,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said.

The global risks report said Brexit, the US presidential election result and the referendum defeat suffered by former Italian prime minister Matteo Renzi last month meant some people were now questioning whether \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the west has reached a tipping point and might now embark on a period of deglobalisation\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. The US economist Dani Rodrik has coined the phrase \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the globalisation trilemma\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to capture the idea that countries cannot have democracy, national sovereignty and globalisation; they can only ever have two out of the three. The WEF said recent events in Europe and the US suggested an \u00e2\u20ac\u0153appetite for rebalancing towards democracy and national sovereignty\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. The WEF said it had been pointing out the dangers of rising inequality and political polarisation for more than a decade, but that the slow pace of recovery from the deep recession of 2008 had intensified income gaps within countries. Emergency measures such as quantitative easing \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the creation of money by central banks \u00e2\u20ac\u201c had become permanent features of economic policy, and had exacerbated inequality by boosting the returns of those holding financial assets.

This year governments must get on with actually delivering the carbon curbs they promised at Paris \u00e2\u20ac\u201c as the WEF points out, the pace at which emissions are being cut is not yet fast enough to avoid dangerous global warming. 3 Increasing polarisation in societies The WEF is concerned that democracy itself is in crisis. Policymakers and managers of public and private institutions have become divorced from their electorates both in terms of their cultural backgrounds and their pay and benefits. Post-truth news media is undermining trust in pillars of the constitution, such as the judiciary. Austerity is hacking back at welfare provision for the vulnerable in society. And multiculturalism is under pressure from nationalism. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This could be a pivotal moment in political history,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd the WEF said, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153and it requires courageous new thinking about how best to manage the relationship between citizens and their elected representatives.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd 4 Rising cyber dependency Amazon Echo\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s virtual assistant Alexa adding unwanted items including doll\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s houses to shopping lists is just one example of the problems arising from an ever more interconnected world. An increasing amount of critical infrastructure relies, not just on information technology in general, but on the open internet in particular. This has brought great benefits but it also provides more opportunity for anyone hoping to wreak havoc through hacking attacks. Beyond critical infrastructure, the developed world relies on the open net for a large proportion of economic activity. An estimated 10% of British GDP comes from the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153internet economy\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. 5 Ageing population A quarter of Japan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s population is aged over 65, and the proportion is on track to reach 40%. Japanese people younger than 19 comprised 40% of the population in 1960, but are projected to make up just 13% of the population in 2060. The rest of the developed world, and much of the developing world, is heading in the same direction. To fund welfare programmes, including a long-term care insurance begun in 2000 that ranks as one of the most generous in the world, Tokyo has run up a debt to GDP ratio of 240%. This culminated in a plea for the fit elderly to look after the unfit, the disabled and ill. It could be argued that Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s current healthcare crisis is largely due to successive governments ignoring the lessons from Japan. China is getting old at the point it gets rich, forcing it to address care and healthcare issues decades before western countries at a similar stage of development. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 This article was amended on 13 January 2017. An earlier version referred to Japan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s budget deficit where its debt to GDP ratio was meant.",

                "bodyText":"The world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s eight richest billionaires control the same wealth between them as the poorest half of the globe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s population, according to a charity warning of an ever-increasing and dangerous concentration of wealth. In a report published to coincide with the start of the week-long World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, Oxfam said it was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153beyond grotesque\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd that a handful of rich men headed by the Microsoft founder Bill Gates are worth $426bn (\u00c2\u00a3350bn), equivalent to the wealth of 3.6 billion people. The development charity called for a new economic model to reverse an inequality trend that it said helped to explain Brexit and Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s victory in the US presidential election. Oxfam blamed rising inequality on aggressive wage restraint, tax dodging and the squeezing of producers by companies, adding that businesses were too focused on delivering ever-higher returns to wealthy owners and top executives. The World Economic Forum (WEF) said last week that rising inequality and social polarisation posed two of the biggest risks to the global economy in 2017 and could result in the rolling back of globalisation. Oxfam said the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s poorest 50% owned the same in assets as the $426bn owned by a group headed by Gates, Amancio Ortega, the founder of the Spanish fashion chain Zara, and Warren Buffett, the renowned investor and chief executive of Berkshire Hathaway. The others are Carlos Slim Hel\u00c3\u00ba: the Mexican telecoms tycoon and owner of conglomerate Grupo Carso; Jeff Bezos: the founder of Amazon; Mark Zuckerberg: the founder of Facebook; Larry Ellison, chief executive of US tech firm Oracle; and Michael Bloomberg; a former mayor of New York and founder and owner of the Bloomberg news and financial information service. Last year, Oxfam said the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 62 richest billionaires were as wealthy as half the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s population. However, the number has dropped to eight in 2017 because new information shows that poverty in China and India is worse than previously thought, making the bottom 50% even worse off and widening the gap between rich and poor. With members of the forum due to arrive on Monday in Switzerland, where guests will range from the Chinese president Xi Jinping, to pop star Shakira, the WEF released its own inclusive growth and development report in which it said median income had fallen by an average of 2.4% between 2008 and 2013 across 26 advanced nations. Norway, Luxembourg, Switzerland, Iceland and Denmark filled the top five places in the WEF\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s inclusive development index, with Britain 21st and the US 23rd. The body that organises the Davos event said rising inequality was not an \u00e2\u20ac\u0153iron law of capitalism\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, but a matter of making the right policy choices. The WEF report found that 51% of the 103 countries for which data was available saw their inclusive development index scores decline over the past five years, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153attesting to the legitimacy of public concern and the challenge facing policymakers regarding the difficulty of translating economic growth into broad social progress\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Basing its research on the Forbes rich list and data provided by investment bank Credit Suisse, Oxfam said the vast majority of people in the bottom half of the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s population were facing a daily struggle to survive, with 70% of them living in low-income countries. It was four years since the WEF had first identified inequality as a threat to social stability, but that the gap between rich and poor has continued to widen, Oxfam added. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153From Brexit to the success of Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s presidential campaign, a worrying rise in racism and the widespread disillusionment with mainstream politics, there are increasing signs that more and more people in rich countries are no longer willing to tolerate the status quo,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd the report said. The charity said new information had shown that poor people in China and India owned even fewer assets than previously thought, making the wealth gap more pronounced than it thought a year ago, when it announced that 62 billionaires owned the same wealth as the poorest half of the global population. Mark Goldring, chief executive of Oxfam GB, said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s snapshot of inequality is clearer, more accurate and more shocking than ever before.

As, we suspect, is the chief executive\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tenure.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Pearson has issued five profit warnings in the four years since Fallon took over running the company from Marjorie Scardino in 2013. He formerly ran Pearson\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s international division. He has pocketed more than \u00c2\u00a36m since becoming chief executive. This includes an estimate for his pay in 2016, which will not be made public until Pearson publishes its annual report later this year, as well as about \u00c2\u00a31.5m in total annual and long-term incentive payments. Pearson said it was taking actions including investing a further \u00c2\u00a350m in speeding up the digital element of its education business, and reducing ebook prices by up to 50% for 2,000 titles, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153making digital rental the best option for price-conscious students\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Fallon said that its \u00c2\u00a31.3bn higher education business in the US, which is about 50% tied to print text books, needed to move to a 75% digital model by 2020. He said that while currently Pearson gets one fee of more than $200 for its textbooks for three-year course use, services such as Amazon were eating away at its business by offering repeat rental options for each book to multiple students. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Amazon and others buy in year one and rent five or six times over the course of three years,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153What rental has done is eat into new book sales and that has had bigger impact than we thought. If that $200 textbook is used by six students over three years we are not getting $200 per use, it is divided by six. In a digital model we get $70 to $110 every time.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Fallon said as Pearson moves to a predominantly digital model, which will mean 5-6% declines in the US business each year while this happens, then its business \u00e2\u20ac\u0153can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be disrupted in this way any more\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153You know this is a business that is going to be a winner from the analogue to digital process,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153[It will be] a much more stable, reliable, repeatable business [and] at least as profitable.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd",

Around 700,000 people own less than 1,600 shares, a legacy of the telecoms group\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s privatisation in 1984.</p> <p>And they as much as anyone will be shocked by the 20% plunge in the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shares after it revealed a worse than expected hit to its figures from an accounting scandal in Italy, not to mention a warning of a slowdown in business elsewhere.</p> <p>Some \u00c2\u00a38bn was wiped off the value of BT as its shares fell from 382.55p to 303p, its lowest level since June 2013.</p> <p>That in turn knocked 26 points off the FTSE 100, which would otherwise have been firmly in positive territory rather than slipping slightly into the red.</p> <p>So where now for BT shares? Neil Wilson, senior market analyst at ETX Capital, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>BT\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 20% drop today fairly rattled the City. It was one of the biggest ever single-day falls for a company of this sort. Blue chips like BT just don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t make those kinds of losses on one announcement about a part of the business that accounts for just 1% of earnings.</p> <p>So is this a golden buying opportunity for investors, or does BT merit a fundamental recalibration of its stock price based on the news?</p> <p>First, the upside. BT is now looking very cheap on a price to forward earnings ratio (about 10 times). That appears like mightily good value for a company that pays juicy dividends and says it will continue to increase these by 10% a year over the next two years. That could mean a roughly 4% yield for buyers entering now, which if it can manage to deliver is a pretty attractive return.</p> <p>It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also dodged a bullet or two by retaining control of Openreach, the jewel in the crown, despite pressure from Ofcom. The acquisition of EE enables to become a genuine quad-play provider. Sports broadcasting is also improving revenues but at a fairly hefty cost.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3666cbfd73f92985ec2bf9d36a6bbcf5f937183f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3666cbfd73f92985ec2bf9d36a6bbcf5f937183f/0_45_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"BT Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s headquarters in Milan,\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">BT Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s headquarters in Milan,</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Stefano Rellandini/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <blockquote> <p>The downside, however, looks ominous. The Italian fiasco will gobble up a whopping \u00c2\u00a3500m in free cash in 2016/2017 and a further \u00c2\u00a3500m in 2017/18. Although BT has largely completed its investigation, there is a risk that this could blow up further and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s wise to be cautious. The Financial Reporting Council could take this further.</p> <p>Operating costs seem to be rising, as are debts. Acquisition of EE, while a strategic long-term play, has meant net debts have risen to nearly \u00c2\u00a310bn. That is also the figure for BT\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pension black hole, which it has to review this year.</p> <p>Another red flag is the outlook for UK public sector and international corporate markets, which BT says has deteriorated, meaning it expects a double-digit year-on-year percentage decline in fourth quarter underlying EBITDA adjusted for the acquisition of EE. That is a big concern and signals that investment is drying up. All this points to growing pressure on free cash, which BT needs to keep growing the dividends.</p> </blockquote> <p><em>On that note, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time to close for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be back tomorrow.</em></p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-58877a62e4b0d7c340749709\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-01-24T17:10:14.617Z\">5.10pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">European markets end higher but FTSE 100 hit by BT fall</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>There is a degree of caution around the markets, as investors await more decisions from US president Donald Trump after his protectionist rhetoric so far. And with the US reporting season underway, they are also looking to see whether companies can justify their hefty valuations with their results.</p> <p>Overall, with Wall Street higher by the time Europe closed - with the Dow Jones Industrial Average up 61 points or 0.3% - continental markets ended the day higher.</p> <p>News that the UK parliament had won the right to a vote on Brexit did little to support the pound, which is currently unchanged at $1.2530 having earlier fallen as low as $1.2419. Jasper Lawler, senior market analyst at London Capital Group, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The [UK supreme] court ruling sent the British pound lower, though it finished well off its lows. There was an element of \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcbuy the rumour, sell the fact\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 in currency markets to the well-telegraphed decision. In all likelihood Article 50 will still be triggered in March irrespective of the supreme court. In many ways this is just one less roadblock out of the way before the UK leaves the EU. If anything, the net effect leans towards a harder Brexit in that Scotland and the devolved assemblies, which mostly voted to Remain in the EU, will have less say.</p> </blockquote> <p>So with the pound failing to gain ground, the FTSE 100 was open to reacting to any shocks, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/jan/24/bt-loses-7bn-in-value-as-italian-accounting-scandal-deepens\">an unexpected profit warning from BT after worse than expected accounting irregularities in Italy</a> certainly fitted the bill. BT\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decline knocked 26 points off the leading index, which otherwise would have been well in positive territory.

Lawrence Yun, the association\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chief economist, said the housing market\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s best year since the Great Recession ended on a healthy but somewhat softer note:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Solid job creation throughout 2016 and exceptionally low mortgage rates translated into a good year for the housing market. However, higher mortgage rates and home prices combined with record low inventory levels stunted sales in much of the country in December.</p> <p>While a lack of listings and fast rising home prices was a headwind all year, the surge in rates since early November ultimately caught some prospective buyers off guard and dimmed their appetite or ability to buy a home as 2016 came to an end. </p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-58876bcbe4b0d7c3407496b4\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-01-24T15:04:29.033Z\">3.04pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Better than forecast US manufacturing data adds to rate rise expectations</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>US manufacturing has got off to a good start in 2017, with overall conditions improving at the quickest pace for two years.</p> <p>The initial Markit manufacturing purchasing managers index for January came in at 55.1, compared to expectations of a figure of 54.5 and a rise from December\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s final figure of 54.3.

Just as brokers and investors were prepping for FY results on Friday, the company delivers a profits warning linked to an existing accounting scandal at its Italian business. Continued investigation since October (internal + external) has shown the extent of impropriety (sales, purchase, leasing) and overstatement of profits to be far greater than initially thought. Management has been forced to more than triple its expected write-down to \u00c2\u00a3530m and admit that FY revenues, profits and cash flow will be lower than consensus. Last October\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s suggestion of a \u00c2\u00a3145m charge didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t cause too many ripples as regulatory issues and a rising pension deficit hogged the headlines.

The group still expects 10% dividend increases for the next two years but is this enough to appease disgruntled shareholders who had already been wearing a 20% downtrend since early 2016. The increases may, however, attract newbies via a 4% yield.

                "bodyText":"It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been a day to forget for BT, its executives and of course its army of small shareholders. Around 700,000 people own less than 1,600 shares, a legacy of the telecoms group\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s privatisation in 1984. And they as much as anyone will be shocked by the 20% plunge in the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shares after it revealed a worse than expected hit to its figures from an accounting scandal in Italy, not to mention a warning of a slowdown in business elsewhere. Some \u00c2\u00a38bn was wiped off the value of BT as its shares fell from 382.55p to 303p, its lowest level since June 2013. That in turn knocked 26 points off the FTSE 100, which would otherwise have been firmly in positive territory rather than slipping slightly into the red. So where now for BT shares? Neil Wilson, senior market analyst at ETX Capital, said: BT\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 20% drop today fairly rattled the City. It was one of the biggest ever single-day falls for a company of this sort. Blue chips like BT just don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t make those kinds of losses on one announcement about a part of the business that accounts for just 1% of earnings. So is this a golden buying opportunity for investors, or does BT merit a fundamental recalibration of its stock price based on the news? First, the upside. BT is now looking very cheap on a price to forward earnings ratio (about 10 times). That appears like mightily good value for a company that pays juicy dividends and says it will continue to increase these by 10% a year over the next two years. That could mean a roughly 4% yield for buyers entering now, which if it can manage to deliver is a pretty attractive return. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also dodged a bullet or two by retaining control of Openreach, the jewel in the crown, despite pressure from Ofcom. The acquisition of EE enables to become a genuine quad-play provider. Sports broadcasting is also improving revenues but at a fairly hefty cost. The downside, however, looks ominous. The Italian fiasco will gobble up a whopping \u00c2\u00a3500m in free cash in 2016/2017 and a further \u00c2\u00a3500m in 2017/18. Although BT has largely completed its investigation, there is a risk that this could blow up further and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s wise to be cautious. The Financial Reporting Council could take this further. Operating costs seem to be rising, as are debts. Acquisition of EE, while a strategic long-term play, has meant net debts have risen to nearly \u00c2\u00a310bn. That is also the figure for BT\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pension black hole, which it has to review this year. Another red flag is the outlook for UK public sector and international corporate markets, which BT says has deteriorated, meaning it expects a double-digit year-on-year percentage decline in fourth quarter underlying EBITDA adjusted for the acquisition of EE. That is a big concern and signals that investment is drying up. All this points to growing pressure on free cash, which BT needs to keep growing the dividends. On that note, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time to close for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be back tomorrow. There is a degree of caution around the markets, as investors await more decisions from US president Donald Trump after his protectionist rhetoric so far. And with the US reporting season underway, they are also looking to see whether companies can justify their hefty valuations with their results. Overall, with Wall Street higher by the time Europe closed - with the Dow Jones Industrial Average up 61 points or 0.3% - continental markets ended the day higher. News that the UK parliament had won the right to a vote on Brexit did little to support the pound, which is currently unchanged at $1.2530 having earlier fallen as low as $1.2419. Jasper Lawler, senior market analyst at London Capital Group, said: The [UK supreme] court ruling sent the British pound lower, though it finished well off its lows. There was an element of \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcbuy the rumour, sell the fact\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 in currency markets to the well-telegraphed decision. In all likelihood Article 50 will still be triggered in March irrespective of the supreme court. In many ways this is just one less roadblock out of the way before the UK leaves the EU. If anything, the net effect leans towards a harder Brexit in that Scotland and the devolved assemblies, which mostly voted to Remain in the EU, will have less say. So with the pound failing to gain ground, the FTSE 100 was open to reacting to any shocks, and an unexpected profit warning from BT after worse than expected accounting irregularities in Italy certainly fitted the bill. BT\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decline knocked 26 points off the leading index, which otherwise would have been well in positive territory. The final scores in Europe showed: The FTSE 100 dipped 0.84 points or 0.01% to 7150.34 Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax added 0.43% to 11,594.94 France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac closed up 0.18% at 4830.03 Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB finished up 0.89% at 19,499.54 Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ibex ended up 0.89% at 9387.2 In Greece, the Athens market added 1.13% to 646.51 Back with BT, and Reuters is reporting that Italian prosecutors are opening their own investigation into alleged false accounting and embezzlement at BT Italia. Meanwhile a number of US law firms which specialise in shareholder class action cases say they are looking at whether BT violated federal securities laws. But existing home sales in the US fell by more than expected in December, as the supply of houses on the market dropped to levels not seen since 1999. The National Association of Realtors said existing home sales fell 2.8% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.49m units, compared to forecasts of a 1.1% decline to 5.52m. But overall sales for 2016 rose to 5.45m, the highest since 2006, from 5.25m the previous year. Lawrence Yun, the association\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chief economist, said the housing market\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s best year since the Great Recession ended on a healthy but somewhat softer note: Solid job creation throughout 2016 and exceptionally low mortgage rates translated into a good year for the housing market. However, higher mortgage rates and home prices combined with record low inventory levels stunted sales in much of the country in December. While a lack of listings and fast rising home prices was a headwind all year, the surge in rates since early November ultimately caught some prospective buyers off guard and dimmed their appetite or ability to buy a home as 2016 came to an end. US manufacturing has got off to a good start in 2017, with overall conditions improving at the quickest pace for two years. The initial Markit manufacturing purchasing managers index for January came in at 55.1, compared to expectations of a figure of 54.5 and a rise from December\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s final figure of 54.3. Chris Williamson, Chief Business Economist at IHS Markit said: US manufacturers are seeing a bumper start to 2017, with production surging higher in January on the back of rising inflows of new orders. New work is growing at the fastest rate for over two years, thanks mainly to rising demand from customers in the home market. Export growth remains subdued, stymied by the strong dollar. The survey results suggest that faster manufacturing growth and inventory rebuilding should help boost GDP in the first quarter if current trends persist in coming months. Rising factory employment should also help improve consumer morale and spending. However, with such strong growth being signalled and price pressures rising, speculation around the next Fed rate hike will intensify. With US investors awaiting more details of President Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tax and spending plans, the main impetus for the market has been his protectionist stance on trade, including pulling out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership. So Wall Street is currently searching for direction, as the US reporting season gathers pace. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is up 13 points or 0.07% while the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq Composite both opened marginally higher. Shares in broadcaster ITV have jumped by over 5% today, on speculation that a bid battle could be coming. The rally sparked by the Evening Standard\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Jamie Nimmo, who reported that several US companies are interested.... He writes: Chatter in the Square Mile that Liberty Global could buy out ITV is nothing new, but rumour has it that the Virgin Media owner may face competition from some of the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest companies. The word on the street is that major shareholders of ITV have been sounded out by tech giants Apple, Amazon and Netflix about a possible takeover. They are thought to have been enticed by the cheap pound and ITV\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s production arm \u00e2\u20ac\u201d behind shows such as Mr Selfridge and which has been growing over the past few years through acquisitions. The gossip suggests the US giants are willing to pay 300p a share, valuing ITV at around \u00c2\u00a312 billion. More here: ITV\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shares are currently changing hands at around 210p - a long way from 300p, suggesting the City isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t convinced a bid is coming. One to watch though.... Software giant Microsoft has just released a statement, insisting that it remains committed to the UK following reports that Brexit might disrupt its operations. The company says: The comments reported today by a Microsoft employee were not reflective of the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s view. As we have said both before and after the EU referendum vote, Microsoft\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s commitment to the UK is unchanged. In particular, those customers in our UK data centres should continue to rely on Microsoft\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s significant investment plans there. Which employee, I hear you cry... ...well, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Microsoft\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s UK government affairs manager Owen Larter. Yesterday, he told a webinar that importing hardware to the UK could become too pricey, if tariffs were imposed after Britain leave the EU. Larter said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153If all of a sudden there are huge import [tariffs] on server racks from China or from eastern Europe, where a lot of them are actually assembled, that might change our investment decisions and perhaps we build out our datacenters across other European countries.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd TechRepublic has the full story. The pound is falling further as the UK government pushes on with its Brexit plans following today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s supreme court ruling. Sterling is currently down 0.5% at $1.246. having hit $1.253 earlier in the day. It fell as Brexit secretary David Davis told MPs that a bill seeking permission to trigger Article 50 will be introduced within days. FXTM research analyst Lukman Otunuga says \u00e2\u20ac\u02dchard Brexit fears\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 have been fuelled by the judges\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 ruling that the devolved administrations needn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t give their approval for Article 50 to be triggered. Although today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ruling has provided some clarity in the short term on the steps needed for Brexit to happen; the pending Brexit fuelled debates with the Parliament and potential complications could create a new layer of uncertainty consequently weakening the Pound. Breaking: UK bank HSBC has announced plans to shut 62 branches across the UK. The move will cost 180 jobs, and is part of the bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s cost-cutting programme. With more customers using electronic banking services, HSBC argues that it needs fewer physical branches. The BBC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Simon Gompertz has got hold of a list; it includes branches in Blackpool, Chipping Norton, Newquay and Warwick. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tumble makes BT\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shares rather more attractive to investors on a price/earnings basis. The company still expects to grow its dividend by 10% per share this financial year, and in 2017-18. But the Italian accountancy scandal, and the warning that BT\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s public sector business is slowing, are reasons to be cautious. Chris Beauchamp of IG says: At ten times forward earnings, the shares are now the cheapest they have been since early 2013, but the fundamental case for investing, aside from the dividend, has still to be proved. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Nick Fletcher\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s news story on BT\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Italian problems: The BBC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Simon Jack is reporting that the head of BT\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Continental Europe division, Corrado Sciolla, will resign today. Sciolla is a former boss of BT Italy, who was promoted to become president of Continental Europe four years ago. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s his biography, from BT\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s website: Corrado is responsible for making sure we grow quickly and profitably across Europe - where we serve big brands like Fiat, ENI, Syngenta and The European Parliament. Corrado\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s career started as a McKinsey consultant, then he had various directorships at Stream (an Italian pay-TV firm), Syntek Capital, and Wind Telecomunicazioni (Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s second-biggest fixed and mobile telecoms operator). In 2004, he became managing director of Albacom, a joint venture between BNL and BT. When BT bought Albacom outright in 2006, he became CEO of BT Italy and \u00e2\u20ac\u201c in 2011 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c president of BT France as well. Corrado is Italian. He has an electronic engineering degree from the Polytechnic University of Turin and an MBA from the INSEAD business school. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no respite for BT\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s share price this morning; it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s still down almost 18% at 314p, which knocks over \u00c2\u00a36bn off its value. The accounting scandal in Italy (details), and the news that BT\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s UK business is slowing too, are alarming the City. George Salmon, equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, says there were already concerns about BT\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s debt and its pension black hole: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The revelation that accounting deficiencies in Italy are worse than previously thought is a bitter, and needless to say unwelcome, pill to swallow for BT investors. With news that its Business and Public Sector division is coming under pressure too, worries about the group\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ability to fund its generous dividend policy will surely grow. Full year profits are now expected to be around \u00c2\u00a3300m lower than had been hoped, with around \u00c2\u00a3500m of 2016/17 free cash flow disappearing. Just about the only guidance that was left unchanged is the dividend, where the group is still targeting at least 10% increases this year and next. With the group\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s net debts pushing \u00c2\u00a39.6bn following the acquisition of EE, and a review of the how to fund the \u00c2\u00a39.5bn pension deficit coming up in June, there were already a few jitters around the stock so this was the last thing the group needed.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd On the surface, the latest figures on the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s public finances were worse than expected, with a marginally bigger deficit than predicted in December. But the release should still provide some cheer to chancellor Philip Hammond with revisions to November\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s figures meaning he now looks more likely to hit his borrowing target for the full year. Public sector net borrowing decreased by \u00c2\u00a30.4bn to \u00c2\u00a36.9bn in December 2016, compared with December 2015, the Office for National Statistics said. The consensus forecast was for a bigger drop to 6.7bn in a Reuters poll of economists. In the current financial year-to-date (April to December 2016), the public sector borrowed \u00c2\u00a363.8bn. That was \u00c2\u00a310.6bn lower than in the previous financial year-to-date, helped by a smaller deficit than previously thought for November. The Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) is forecasting full-year (April 2016-March 2017) public sector net borrowing of \u00c2\u00a368.2bn. Scott Bowman, UK economist at the consultancy Capital Economics said the fall in borrowing in December continued the recent trend of a gradual improvement in the public finances. Explaining the pattern, he said: The improvement was mainly driven by a 5.6% annual rise in central government receipts, while spending actually fell slightly on a year earlier. And looking through some of the monthly volatility, receipts growth has been on a slight upward trend since May \u00e2\u20ac\u201c adding to the evidence that the economy has held up well following the vote to leave the EU... We think borrowing should come in slightly below the OBR\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s current \u00c2\u00a368bn forecast for the 2016/17 fiscal year.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Suren Thiru, head of economics at the British Chambers of Commerce (BCC), sounds a cautious note about the future state of the public finances as the Brexit process unfolds. The UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fiscal position, which was weakened significantly by the financial crisis, is likely to come under increasing pressure in the near-term if UK economic growth weakens as expected. A slowing economy would further restrict the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s capacity to collect enough tax revenue to consistently achieve deficit reduction in the coming years. More needs to be done to boost business confidence, to help firms to deliver the sort of growth, investment and job creation needed to achieve a sustainable strengthening of the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tax base.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd As predicted in our agenda, the pound has flailed around as Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s top judges delivered their verdict on Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s exit from the EU. The supreme court ruled by 8 votes to 3 that the government cannot trigger Article 50 without parliamentary approval. That sent the pound up to $1.2535, suggesting traders reckon this could slow the Brexit process. But the pound then fell back as the judges announced that the devolved assemblies in Scotland and Northern Ireland do not need to give their own assent. That removes one possible hurdle to Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s exit from the EU. Andy Sparrow\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s politics liveblog has full details and rolling reaction. In other news, Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s factories and service sector firms have made a solid start to 2017. Data firm Markit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s monthly eurozone PMI has come in at 54.3, down slightly from 54.4. Any reading over 50 shows growth. Firms added new jobs at the fastest rate in 9 years too, while factory growth hit a five-year high. Encouraging stuff. BT\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shares are popular with small shareholders, some of whom will have held them since the company was privatised in 1984. So today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s share plunge will have hit them in the pocket (although BT says it hopes to keep raising its dividend over the next couple of years) The Share Centre, a retail stockbroker, have put their \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcbuy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 recommendation on review. Helal Miah, investment research analyst, says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153On top of BT\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s big pension deficit and grumbles amongst rivals and users of its infrastructure network, today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s news has further dented investors\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 confidence in the group. We too, have become more cautious and have placed our current \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcbuy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 recommendation under review. However, this may be an attractive idea for investors taking a contrarian position and, provided the group maintains its dividend, then it could become a good income option.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Mike van Dulken of Accendo Markets on BT shock warning: This morning sees BT Group (BT/A) shares -16% to trade levels last seen in mid-2013. Just as brokers and investors were prepping for FY results on Friday, the company delivers a profits warning linked to an existing accounting scandal at its Italian business. Continued investigation since October (internal + external) has shown the extent of impropriety (sales, purchase, leasing) and overstatement of profits to be far greater than initially thought. Management has been forced to more than triple its expected write-down to \u00c2\u00a3530m and admit that FY revenues, profits and cash flow will be lower than consensus. Last October\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s suggestion of a \u00c2\u00a3145m charge didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t cause too many ripples as regulatory issues and a rising pension deficit hogged the headlines. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s admission adds this to these nasty headwinds, especially as it could weigh on profits for the next two years. Even management isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t sure what the final figure will be. The group still expects 10% dividend increases for the next two years but is this enough to appease disgruntled shareholders who had already been wearing a 20% downtrend since early 2016. The increases may, however, attract newbies via a 4% yield. Assuming this can be honoured\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll get more colour on BT\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s business on Friday, when it publishes its third-quarter financial results. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s announcement was rushed out once the company had calculated the full cost of its Italian accounting problems. Under City rules, a company can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t keep a problem of this magnitude to itself. Q: Why were the accounting irregularities BT Italy not discovered a lot sooner? BT says that it \u00e2\u20ac\u0153needs to reflect\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd on why they were not spotted by BT Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s management, the wider Group, or by its auditors. But it is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153far too premature\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to say anything about the auditors this morning This is turning into a full-blow rout: This is a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153dark day\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd for BT, says city analyst Neil Wilson of ETX Capital. He says investors are selling up, on fears that there are deeper problems at the telecoms firm. The group\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s own investigation of accounting malpractice in its Italian business shows the situation is far worse than it first thought \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the bill is now thought to be around \u00c2\u00a3530m, well above the \u00c2\u00a3145m initially forecast. According to BT, this will mean a reduction in Q3 adjusted revenue and adjusted EBITDA of around \u00c2\u00a3120m. Free cash flow will be \u00c2\u00a3100m worse off. For 2016/17 as a whole the problems will have a negative revenue impact of around \u00c2\u00a3200m, while denting normalised free cash flow by up to \u00c2\u00a3500m. The impact on 2017/18 is expected to be just as bad and that is likely to have a material impact on its ability to return cash to shareholders, although BT says it still expects to grow dividend per share by 10% in each of those years. The problem is that investors will fear that this is not the end \u00e2\u20ac\u201c what else will be uncovered? The costs could yet rise and that fear is driving the selling this morning.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd BT\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shares are now down 19%, which wipes \u00c2\u00a36bn off its market capitalisation. The Italian business will need a lot of work before it can be a growth business, Patterson says, predicting that it has probably been unprofitable for a number of years. CEO Gavin Patterson also warns that BT is feeling the impact of higher inflation, so 2017 will be a lot tougher Q: Is BT now inspecting its other overseas businesses for signs of accounting problems? Yes, Patterson replies, and BT doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t believe an issue like this exists elsewhere in its business. This accounting scandal appears to be \u00e2\u20ac\u0153specific\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to the Italian business, he continues. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a very complex set of manipulations, involving a lot of people over many years. As if BT didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have enough problems right now, it is also warning that the UK market is slowing. The outlook for UK public sector and international corporate markets has deteriorated, says CEO Gavin Patterson. That is potentially down to the wider economy, and potentially down to the Brexit vote. BT CEO Gavin Patterson is briefing City analysts on a conference call now. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve dialled in. Patterson says he is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153deeply disappointed\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd by the inappropriate behaviour uncovered at BT Italy, and confirms that several executives have left the company after being suspended. Financial results have been overstated for several years, Patterson says, so BT is now working out the full impact on the overall Group\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s results. We take the situation at our Italian business extremely seriously, and are taking efforts to strengthen its procedures, Patterson continues. BT shares have hit their lowest level in two and a half years, and are on track for their worst day since the financial crisis of 2008. The City really isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t impressed by these serious accounting mistakes at the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Italian arm. Boom! BT shares have plunged by 15% at the start of trading. That wipes more than \u00c2\u00a35.5bn off the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s value, and sends it sprawling to the bottom of the FTSE 100. City analyst Louise Cooper says this scandal does not reflect well on the City: And this is from Reuters\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Amanda Cooper: BT shares could tumble by 8% in early trading, warns City veteran David Buik. Telecoms group BT has just shocked the City by announcing that the accounting scandal at its Italian division is much worse than previously thought. The FTSE-listed company is slashing its revenue, earnings and free cash flow forecasts for this year, and next year. It has also suspended several senior executives from BT Italy who have already left the company. An investigation by KPMG has uncovered that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the extent and complexity of inappropriate behaviour in the Italian business were far greater than previously identified.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd KPMG found that the division used \u00e2\u20ac\u0153improper accounting practices\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and a complex set of improper sales, purchase, factoring and leasing transactions. This has driven the cost of the scandal up to \u00c2\u00a3530m, sharply higher than the \u00c2\u00a3145m which BT announced in October. This is going to have a serious impact on BT\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s business. It is now predicting no revenue growth over the next two years, and cutting its guidance for EBITDA profits from \u00c2\u00a37.9bn to \u00c2\u00a37.6bn. Gavin Patterson, chief executive of BT Group, says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We are deeply disappointed with the improper practices which we have found in our Italian business. We have undertaken extensive investigations into that business and are committed to ensuring the highest standards across the whole of BT for the benefit of our customers, shareholders, employees and all other stakeholders.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd BT has appointed a new boss of BT Italy. He takes charge on 1 February, and will work on improving the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153governance, compliance and financial safeguards in our Italian business\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. In short, this is pretty serious. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll pull together some reaction now. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Investors in City have plenty to think about today. At 9.30am, the UK supreme court will rule on whether parliament must give its approval before Britain can begin its departure from the European Union. That news will be liveblogged in another place, but we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be watching too as the decision will move the markets. Owen Bowcott, our legal affairs correspondent, explains how the ruling will affect the Brexit timetable: The ruling by the 11 justices will resolve whether the government, through its inherited use of royal prerogative powers, can formally initiate article 50 of the treaty on European Union (TEU) without the explicit approval of MPs and peers. Article 50 begins the process of the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s withdrawal from the EU. If a majority of justices decide, as is widely expected, that parliamentary support is required, then the judgment could specify that legislation is needed. We also get the latest UK public finance figures at 9.30am, covering December. Economists predict that Britain borrowed around \u00c2\u00a36.5bn to balance the books last month. Data firm Markit is reporting its latest PMI surveys for the eurozone this morning, showing how manufacturing and service companies are faring this month. Over in parliament, the Business, Innovations and Skills committee is holding a hearing into executive pay and boardroom diversity, also starting at 9.30am. They\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll hear from Sir Philip Hampton who chaired a review into how to get more women into City boards, along with Baroness Sarah Hogg, Tom Gosling of PWC, Simon Fraser of Investor Forum, Ken Olisa of the Institute of Directors, and Andrew Ninian of Investment Association.",

Under Obama, the US managed to avoid a second Great Depression and embarked on a somewhat lacklustre recovery starting in 2010. But, although the economy added a fair amount of jobs and the economic situation of many US households has improved considerably after the crisis, some downsides remain. </p> <p>Notably, the labour force participation rate has failed to pick up in line with what would be expected during the recovery of a sharp recession. Moreover, the US economy - similarly to the situation in the UK \u00e2\u20ac\u201c is ailing from slow productivity growth. Most importantly, it seems that much of the increase in wages and job opportunities of the last six years has intensified already existing inequalities in the country.</p> <p>In terms of Mr Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economic policy programme, it is still unclear whether the administration will go ahead with the announced boost to infrastructure spending and additional tax cuts. If so we expect the Fed to raise interest rates in the second quarter of 2017 at the latest.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-588b5d2ae4b0f1550c0d9295\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-01-27T14:51:06.476Z\">2.51pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">FTSE outperforms European peers</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The FTSE 100 is the only major European index making gains this afternoon, albeit small ones (up 8 points).

                "bodyText":"That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s it for today. Thank you for reading the blog and for all the comments below the line. Have a good weekend. AM Kay Daniel Neufeld at the Centre for Economics and Business Research, looks back at the US economy under President Obama: The mixed picture for GDP growth in 2016 has been characteristic of the economic performance of the outgoing Obama administration. Under Obama, the US managed to avoid a second Great Depression and embarked on a somewhat lacklustre recovery starting in 2010. But, although the economy added a fair amount of jobs and the economic situation of many US households has improved considerably after the crisis, some downsides remain. Notably, the labour force participation rate has failed to pick up in line with what would be expected during the recovery of a sharp recession. Moreover, the US economy - similarly to the situation in the UK \u00e2\u20ac\u201c is ailing from slow productivity growth. Most importantly, it seems that much of the increase in wages and job opportunities of the last six years has intensified already existing inequalities in the country. In terms of Mr Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economic policy programme, it is still unclear whether the administration will go ahead with the announced boost to infrastructure spending and additional tax cuts. If so we expect the Fed to raise interest rates in the second quarter of 2017 at the latest. The FTSE 100 is the only major European index making gains this afternoon, albeit small ones (up 8 points). Tesco is still the biggest riser, with shares up 10.5%. FTSE 100: +0.1% at 7,170 Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s DAX: -0.2% at 11,822 France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s CAC: -0.6% at 4,840 Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB: -0.7% at 19,308 Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s IBEX: -0.4% at 9,478 Harm Bandholz, chief US economist at UniCredit Research is fairly positive about the outlook for the American economy. We think that the economy is on track to expand by 2% to 2.25% in the first half of the year. Under the assumption that the new administration will pass a fiscal stimulus in time without derailing global trade, growth in the second half of 2017 will most likely be faster. US markets have opened (very) slightly higher: Dow Jones: +0.01% at 20,103 S&amp;P 500: +0.1% at 2,299 Nasdaq: +0.2% at 5,667 Ian Kernohan, economist at fund manager Royal London Asset Management, said the US economy could grow by more than 3% by 2018. US GDP growth was estimated at 1.9% on an annualised basis in the final quarter of 2016, and just 1.6% for the calendar year. However, this relatively slow expansion was still sufficient to drive employment levels higher and unemployment lower, leading to a pick-up in wage growth. Going forward, much will depend on the scale and timing of any fiscal stimulus by the new Trump administration, which could push US GDP growth to over 3% by 2018. We do not expect the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates again until May, when they will have greater visibility on the new administration\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s plans. US growth in 2016 overall was 1.6%, the slowest since 2011 and far weaker than the 2.6% growth achieved in 2015. It was also a slower rate than the UK, which grew by 2% in 2016 - probably faster than any other G7 economy (we haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t got all the figures yet). Here is our full story on the US figures: IG traders expect US markets to open higher Rob Carnell, chief international economist at ING, says the slowdown in US growth will not deter the Federal Reserve from raising interest rates in March. Q4 GDP of 1.9% is not a bad figure, when taken together with the unrevised 3.5% growth in Q3, and suggests that the US economy picked up momentum in the second half of the year. With few shocks in the data, the main source of interest we think is the business investment figure, which rose by 3.1% (annualised quarter on quarter), following four quarters of declines. Fed hawks will take heart from this data. This is another clue that markets are still too cautious with respect to the timing of the next Fed rate hike. We see few reasons why the Fed should wait until June, and look for a March hike. Growth in the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest economy was held back in the fourth quarter by plunging shipments of soybeans, which in turn dragged exports lower. Household spending was a key driver of the 1.9% headline rate of economic growth, the US department of commerce said. Worth pointing out that the US quarterly growth figures are annual rates... Alternatively... Breaking: Growth in the US slowed more than expected in the fourth quarter of 2016 to 1.9% from 3.5% in the third quarter. Economists predicted growth of 2.2%. More soon. Growth in the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest economy slowed to 2.2% in the final quarter of 2016, from 3.5% in the third, figures out in less than an hour are expected to show. It will provide investors with a steer on what shape the economy was in as Obama handed Trump the keys to the White House. Failure to break the impasse of deadlocked bailout talks at Thursday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Eurogroup meeting saw the Athens Stock Exchange shed 2.9% today with bank shares plummeting by more than 5%. The next tranche of emergency funding from Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s third \u00e2\u201a\u00ac86bn bailout hinges on the conclusion of a review by creditors of Greek progress on reforms. If the funds are not released, a re-run of the Greek debt crisis looms. Athens has to meet around \u00e2\u201a\u00ac10.5bn in debt repayments as of July \u00e2\u20ac\u201c money it currently does not have. Prime minister Alexis Tsipras\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 leftist-led government has been keen to wrap up the review so that Greece can join the European Central Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s quantitative easing programme \u00e2\u20ac\u201c viewed as essential if Greece is to regain access to international capital markets. But to do this Tsipras will have to agree to imposing more austerity once the current aid programme expires in mid 2018. As eurozone finance ministers met, the International Monetary Fund reiterated its belief that Greek debt is unsustainable, predicting it would become \u00e2\u20ac\u0153explosive\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd after 2030. In Greece, fears of euro expulsion and fresh elections are growing. Either Tsipras bows to demands at a time when his government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s popularity has nosedived, or he calls early polls ushering in a period of renewed uncertainty for the EU\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s weakest member state. Greek shares are down today after lack of progress between Greece and its fellow eurozone members at Thursday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Eurogroup meeting. Eurogroup President Jeroen Dijsselbloem called on Greece to move faster on reforms so that its creditors\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 could return to Athens as soon as possible and resume negotiations about the next tranche of funding. The Athens stock exchange is down 2.9%, with banking stocks the biggest fallers: Sticking with currencies, the European Central Bank has revealed that it withdrew about \u00e2\u201a\u00ac17,000 worth of fake \u00e2\u201a\u00ac500 bank notes from circulation in the second half of 2016. The latest figures from the ECB show that almost 4.9% of the \u00e2\u201a\u00ac353,000 withdrawn were \u00e2\u201a\u00ac500 notes. The ECB said: Some 353,000 counterfeit euro banknotes were withdrawn from circulation in the second half of 2016, a slight increase compared with the first half of 2016 and 20.7% fewer than in the second half of 2015. The number of counterfeits remains very low in comparison with the increasing number of genuine banknotes in circulation (over 19 billion during the second half of 2016). The vast majority of counterfeits were \u00e2\u201a\u00ac20 and \u00e2\u201a\u00ac50 notes, accounting for 80%. The ECB has already announced that it will scrap the \u00e2\u201a\u00ac500 note over fears that the high denomination notes are used to finance crime. The pound has slipped from a five-week high this morning but is still on track for a weekly gain. Investors have been encouraged by better-than-expected growth figures which showed the economy grew by 0.6% in the final quarter of 2016. The pound is currently down 0.4% against the dollar at $1.2539. The number of individuals to be declared financially bust in 2013 rose 13% in 2016 to 90,930 (from 80,404). The figures from the government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Insolvency Service cover England and Wales. It was the first rise in six years. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It is very distressing to live with unsustainable personal debt so it is important for people to seek advice\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, said Sarah Albon, chief executive of the service. National Debtline which provides free advice online and over the phone, said the figures point to tougher times ahead for families. Joanna Elson, chief executive of the Money Advice Trust which runs National Debtline, said: While the government is rightly focused on those who are \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcjust about managing\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, these figures are a reminder that a smaller but growing number of households are not managing at all. The rise in insolvencies in 2016 points to tougher times ahead for UK households. At National Debtline we are already seeing our busiest January in years, with calls up 17% on last January and a rise of 55% in the number people seeking advice online. With household debt levels growing significantly and inflation now beginning to rise, we expect demand for debt advice to continue to be significantly higher this year than last. Not much sympathy for BT from blog readers commenting below the line... but shares are not suffering too much this morning, off 0.5%. That said, they did fall off a cliff on Tuesday, down 21% wiping almost \u00c2\u00a38bn off the value of the company after the extent of the problems in Italy were laid bare. The share price graph tells the story: Over in France, households don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t appear to be concerned about uncertainty surrounding elections, Brexit, the future of the eurozone, or anything else. Consumer confidence hit the a nine-year high in January according to the official statistics agency, Insee. The headline index hit 100 for the first time since November 2007. Julien Manceaux, ING senior economist covering France, says the upturn in sentiment and other positive indicators would be encouraging for the next French president. It is the first time since 2007 that French consumers have been that positive about the future. Consumer confidence has been improving since mid-2014, but it took until recently to see all components improving. In January, consumers were particularly optimistic on the future of unemployment and on their purchase intentions, although their current capacity to save remains limited. All in all, if this is another significant improvement (business confidence rebounded as well and industrial production was remarkably strong in the fourth quarter of 2016), there is still some way to go before to label it a full-speed recovery. However, these more positive signs have been awaited for a long time. If they are too late to save President Hollande\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s legacy, they are a strong starting point for the next French president. Here is our full story on the latest from BT, including a 37% slump in third-quarter profits. Investors are clearly happy about Tesco\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00c2\u00a33.7bn deal with Booker. Tesco shares are now up almost 10%. Booker shares are up 16%. Laith Khalaf, senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, says Tesco is taking \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a bold new direction\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. The deal with Booker shows Tesco is not going to sit on its hands and wait for its dominant market position to slowly leak away to competitors. The UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s supermarkets are engaged in new strategies to cope with the brave new world, where the discounters have stolen market share and consumers have turned away from big superstores, preferring instead to do their shopping in convenience stores or on their mobile phones. Sainsbury bought Argos, Morrisons is flirting with Amazon, and now Tesco has revealed its plans to drive further growth. Nick Bubb, independent retail analyst, says the deal is likely to come under scrutiny from the competition regulator: Our instant reaction is that the Competition and Markets Authority will have a field day with this, as although Tesco is mainly a retailer in the UK and Booker a wholesaler, Tesco does own the One Stop convenience store chain that competes with Booker\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s interest in symbol groups and convenience store retailing (via Premier and Londis etc), so it is by no means clear that the CMA will allow things to proceed very far without having a good look at the overlap. The mystery behind Richard Cousins\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 departure from Tesco has been solved... Cousins, the chief executive of catering group Compass, quit as senior independent director of Tesco on 3 January just days before the supermarket chain revealed its Christmas trading figures. Dave Lewis, Tesco chief executive confirmed today that Cousins resigned because he didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t agree with the Booker deal. Lewis described the discussions as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153good governance\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and said he respected Cousins\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 decision. The rest of the board was behind the deal, he added. The John Lewis Partnership and pension trustee have agreed a 10-year plan to eliminate the pension deficit. John Lewis reduced its defined benefit pension scheme to \u00c2\u00a3479m (as at 31 March 2016), from a previous valuation of \u00c2\u00a3840m. The plan to eliminate the deficit includes a \u00c2\u00a3303m cash contribution from the company, of which \u00c2\u00a3183m is due to be paid before the end of March 2017. Gavin Patterson, BT\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chief executive, has commented on what the accounting scandal might mean for his pay package (\u00c2\u00a35.3m last year): [The issue is] for another day. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s that then.. Some more comments from BT boss Gavin Patterson. He has told reporters that while shareholders have a right to be angry about the accounting scandal in its Italian business, the situation was now under control: Frankly I am angry that the integrity of BT has been undermined by the wrongdoing of a few individuals in one part of the business. The situation is now under control, we have already appointed new management and as you would expect we are proactively providing assistance for the Italian authorities. We mustn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t lose sight of the fact that BT is in good health overall. BT shares are down about 0.4%. The company has already said it will look at executive pay in light of the improper behaviour in Italy. Patterson earned \u00c2\u00a35.3m last year including an annual bonus of just over \u00c2\u00a31m and share awards worth \u00c2\u00a33m. The finance director, Tony Chanmugam, who was already due to step down in July, received \u00c2\u00a32.8m, including a \u00c2\u00a3587,000 bonus. Philip Hammond, UK chancellor, has arrived in Brussels for the Ecofin meeting of finance ministers. He told reporters that Britain will respect its obligations under European Union rules as its seeks to strengthen trade ties around the world. It comes as Theresa May prepares to meet US President Trump later today, with a UK/US trade deal expected to be high on the agenda. Hammond said in Brussels: Of course we want to strengthen our trade ties with the very many trade partners we have around the world. But we are very mindful of our obligations under the treaty and will follow them precisely. Britain remains a fully engaged member of the European Union. We will continue to abide by the rules, regulations and the laws of the European Union for so long as we are members. Most of Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s major markets are down in early trading.

Tesco\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chief executive Dave Lewis had this to say (he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s calling it a merger): Tesco has made significant progress in turning around our UK retail business. This merger with Booker will further enhance Tesco\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s growth prospects by creating the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s leading food business with combined expertise in retail, wholesale, supply chain and digital. Wherever food is prepared and eaten - \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcin home\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 or \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcout of home\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 - we will meet this opportunity with the widest choice and best service available. Booker says it is the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest food wholesaler, serving a total of 1.3m customers. Customers are varied, and include the prison service in England and Wales, Marks &amp; Spencer and most of the cinema chains in the UK. Here is our full story on the deal: Also coming up... Finance ministers of the European Union are gathering for the latest Ecofin meeting. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll bring you any interesting snippets from the sidelines. And it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s GDP day in the US! At 13.30 UK time we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll get fourth-quarter growth figures from the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest economy. They will be Obama\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sign-off, as Michael Hewson from CMC markets explains: Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s first iteration of US Q4 GDP will be the final legacy of the Obama Presidency, and the economy that he has left for the new incumbent. How the US economy performs from here will largely be down to Donald Trump, even if Obama laid the foundations. Expectations are for a modest slowdown from the 3.5% growth seen in Q3 to 2.2%. A large part of this slowdown is likely to be as a result of lower exports, given that the high Q3 number was boosted by a large jump in soybean exports, due to a shortage in South America. This isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t likely to be repeated, while personal consumption is also expected to come in lower. Traders at IG in the City are predicting markets will open lower across Europe: Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Some major corporate news this morning from two of the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest firms. BT has revealed that Corrado Sciolla, head of its continental Europe business, is leaving after an accounting scandal in the Italian business wiped almost \u00c2\u00a38bn off the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s value on Tuesday. According to Reuters, BT put it plainly: Corrado is leaving the business, this happened on his watch. Announcing third quarter results this morning, BT\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chief executive Gavin Patterson said: We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve undertaken extensive investigations into our Italian business, including an independent review by KPMG, and I am deeply disappointed with the unacceptable practices by some that we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve found. This has no place at BT, and it undermines the good work we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re doing elsewhere in the Group. We are committed to ensuring the highest standards across the whole of BT. In other news, Tesco is buying the food wholesaler Booker in a \u00c2\u00a33.7bn deal. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest supermarket chain said that buying Booker, which owns Budgens and Londis, would help speed up the turnaround of Tesco (was hit by its own accounting scandal a couple of years ago). More on both stories soon.",

Cuban, who campaigned for Hillary Clinton during the election, told CNBC that in person Trump seemed reasonable and open-minded. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153But all that is thrown out the window when he tweets and when he communicates with the media,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This dichotomy makes things very difficult for business.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Cuban said that Google, Microsoft and others had already had their businesses disrupted by Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s travel restrictions and that they were making life more confusing for employers of foreign-born workers. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Now you have to give consideration to where they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re from, what their circumstances are, what type of travel that person is doing. Are they a risk? How does that impact my future hiring?\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd",
