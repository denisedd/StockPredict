                "bodyText":"Apple is considering moving into the studio famous for films such as Gone With The Wind and The Matrix as it vies to become a major player in TV and film. The tech company plans to invest $1bn on original TV programming over the next year and is reportedly in discussions with the Culver Studios, close to the Culver City offices of Beats, which it acquired from co-founders Dr Dre and Jimmy Iovine for $3bn two years ago. The studio, which has been owned by RKO, Howard Hughes and Cecil B DeMille, has more than a dozen soundstages for TV and film work. However, Apple is mainly looking for office space, according to the Financial Times. Moving the management of its original content division to such a status symbol location would mark Apple\u2019s latest signal that it is to ramp up its challenge to streaming giants Netflix and Amazon as well as traditional TV broadcasters. Apple made no comment on the talks and Culver Studios was unavailable for comment at the time of publication. In June, Apple recruited Jamie Erlicht and Zack Van Amburg from Sony as its new TV chiefs. The pair have been responsible for striking a \u00a3100m co-production deal with Netflix to make The Crown, and have overseen production of hit shows including Breaking Bad and The Black List. Apple has so far only dipped its toe in original programming, striking a deal to spin James Corden\u2019s popular Carpool Karaoke segment from his late night TV show in the US into a 16-episode series featuring stars such as Will Smith. There was also Planet of the Apps \u2013 a sort of Dragon\u2019s Den featuring Gwyneth Paltrow, will.i.am, Jessica Alba and entrepreneur Gary Vaynerchuk on a panel that sees app developers competing for funding \u2013 which Apple Music made available in June. In development are documentaries about Sean \u201cP Diddy\u201d Combs and Clive Davis, as well as a six-part series on Dr Dre. Given Apple\u2019s huge resources \u2013 it has a stock value of $815bn, almost twice Jeff Bezos\u2019s Amazon ($474bn), five times Disney ($168bn), and more than 10 times Netflix ($77bn) \u2013 its intent to enter original programming makes it a serious new player in the TV market. Netflix has committed $6.6bn to buying and creating TV programmes and it makes about 1,000 hours of its owns shows annually; HBO, the Game of Thrones and Sopranos maker, spends about $2bn a year. Amazon, which paid up to \u00a3150m to lure former Top Gear presenters Jeremy Clarkson, Richard Hammond and James May, is estimated to spend about $4.5bn annually on its Prime Video service. Analysts had speculated that Apple could buy Disney to bolster its content strategy.",

Tuesday\u2019s event, with the iPhone 8 the star attraction, will strive to meet investors\u2019 \u2013 and customers\u2019 \u2013 vaulting expectations.</p> <p>But what will Apple tempt users with to justify Wall Street\u2019s faith in its future profits? An Apple spokesman declined to discuss what will be revealed at the event in the company\u2019s $5bn, spaceship-shaped Cupertino headquarters. However, although Apple is always tight-lipped, this year leaks from its suppliers, and from the company itself (through details embedded in a software update) have told us much about what\u2019s coming.</p> <h2><strong>iPhone</strong></h2> <p>The smartphone market is more competitive than ever, with sophisticated devices available for much less than the rumoured \u00a3900 cost of the iPhone&#xa0;8. Most rivals are swallowing losses by cutting prices to win sales but Apple is heading upmarket to protect the iPhone, which is crucial to its success.</p> <p>Three new models are expected: two updating its present 7 and 7 Plus models (probably called the 7S and 7S Plus), and one entirely new \u2013 the iPhone 8. Internally known as \u201cD22\u201d, its screen will unlock via facial recognition, potentially replacing the fingerprint unlock system used since 2013.

                "bodyText":"Apple\u2019s stock market value is heading towards a new milestone and its latest product launch on 12 September could push the tech giant closer to becoming the first ever $1tn (\u00a3760bn) company. At the end of last week, the company\u2019s market capitalisation hovered around $830bn, continuing a 10-year run that has generally headed upwards since a low of $69bn in January 2009, during the financial crisis. Tuesday\u2019s event, with the iPhone 8 the star attraction, will strive to meet investors\u2019 \u2013 and customers\u2019 \u2013 vaulting expectations. But what will Apple tempt users with to justify Wall Street\u2019s faith in its future profits? An Apple spokesman declined to discuss what will be revealed at the event in the company\u2019s $5bn, spaceship-shaped Cupertino headquarters. However, although Apple is always tight-lipped, this year leaks from its suppliers, and from the company itself (through details embedded in a software update) have told us much about what\u2019s coming. iPhone The smartphone market is more competitive than ever, with sophisticated devices available for much less than the rumoured \u00a3900 cost of the iPhone 8. Most rivals are swallowing losses by cutting prices to win sales but Apple is heading upmarket to protect the iPhone, which is crucial to its success. Three new models are expected: two updating its present 7 and 7 Plus models (probably called the 7S and 7S Plus), and one entirely new \u2013 the iPhone 8. Internally known as \u201cD22\u201d, its screen will unlock via facial recognition, potentially replacing the fingerprint unlock system used since 2013. The screen will also cover more of the front, allowing the display to go right to the edges. And the screen will use a technology bought from Samsung \u2013 called Amoled, or active matrix organic light-emitting diode \u2013 which gives brighter colours. It could also mean the new phone will have a longer battery life because it does not need to be backlit, unlike the LCD screens Apple uses presently. But none of these technological tweaks are cheap \u2013 hence the \u00a3900 price tag, compared to the \u00a3719 starting price of the larger iPhone 7 Plus. The new phone will be a tricky sell, says Jan Dawson, who runs US-based tech consultancy Jackdaw Research. \u201cIt has to get the balance just right, giving people a compelling upgrade in the successors to the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus, while also offering up a higher tier,\u201d he explains. \u201cIt has to do that without alienating people who can\u2019t afford or justify spending the higher price for the new device, but don\u2019t want to settle for second best.\u201d The last time Apple had a \u201csecond best\u201d phone, the plastic iPhone 5C in 2013, its sales were slower than expected, while demand for the top-end 5S outstripped supply.

                "bodyText":"One of the UK\u2019s largest recruitment firms is to tear up its 60-year-old structure and become a \u201csocial enterprise\u201d with a pay cap and profit-sharing plan, in a move the family who own the company hope will inspire others businesses to follow suit. Cordant, which sends 125,000 temporary staff every year to work for 5,000 clients such as Amazon and Tesco, will announce the radical overhaul this week. Its largest shareholder, Phillip Ullmann, whose father founded the Cordant Group in 1957, said he hoped to convince clients to follow suit by improving workers\u2019 conditions, predicting a Brexit-related shortage of workers that would give low-paid staff more bargaining power. The new ethos, cemented by a change to the company\u2019s articles of association, will include a fixed limit on its pay ratio, the gap between its highest- and lowest-paid employees. Top earners will not be able to take home more than 20 times the salary of its lowest-paid staff, some of whom earn the minimum wage, effectively meaning a salary cap of \u00a3400,000. There will also be a ceiling on dividends paid to its owners, several branches of the Ullmann family, who will not be able take more than \u00a33m out of the business between them in any single year. Profit, above what is paid to shareholders, will be shared with the company\u2019s 1,500 permanent staff, while company money will be channelled into projects that \u201caddress the needs of society\u201d, Cordant said. It has yet to finalise its plans but this will include offering staff and IT systems to the NHS at cost rather than for profit, which it says will save the health service \u201cmillions of pounds\u201d. Cordant also plans to plough cash into education initiatives to help teachers and improve workplace skills. As well as overhauling its own model, the company hopes in time to convince some of its clients to adopt similar measures, such as profit shares for the low-paid temporary staff they employ via Cordant. Ullmann, who lists his favourite film as Mission Impossible, said: \u201cWith Brexit there will be a shortage of minimum wage workers so there should be more power to the workers.\u201d \u201cBrexit will focus the mind,\u201d he added. He came up with the plan after a discussion with the accountancy firm Deloitte and sought approval from fellow family members, who between them control the company. Ullmann, whose profile on the Cordant website describes him as \u201cchief energiser\u201d, said: \u201cI was a traditional capitalist. I wanted to make more money and increase the size of the wealth. \u201cNow I\u2019ve found gold dust, that\u2019s how it feels to me. It will give more satisfaction than just doing more of the same.\u201d Ullmann said the company would share some its profits with its 1,500 permanent staff, a scheme reminiscent of John Lewis\u2019s annual staff bonus scheme, and would encourage businesses that use its temporary staff to do the same. But he admitted he could not force clients such as Tesco and Amazon, which use Cordant workers in their warehouses, to come up with similar plans. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to tell clients to put up wages or we won\u2019t work for them,\u201d he said. \u201cIf I decided what they pay, wages would be high. It\u2019s a more subtle journey than that.\u201d He said workers would also benefit from plans to give them more choice in where they work, rate temporary employers and sign up for extra shifts when they want them. But Cordant\u2019s ambitions to cap its dividend and profits could be limited by its ability to produce them, according to accounts filed at Companies House. The Uxbridge-based company made a pre-tax loss of \u00a39m last year, although it posted a profit of \u00a33.9m in 2015, and it has not paid a dividend in either of the past two years. \u201cI recognise the ladder we\u2019re trying to climb but I\u2019m not daunted by the challenges in the way,\u201d said Ullmann. \u201cWe are all in. We\u2019re not going to reverse.\u201d Cordant also has some way to go to win the hearts and minds of its workers, according to posts on the jobs website Glassdoor, which carries reviews of hundreds of employers.

When these one-off costs were stripped out, pre-tax profit was down almost 5% at \u00a383m as higher costs ate into margins. Group sales rose by 2.3% over the period, to \u00a35.4bn. The department stores performed better than the Waitrose supermarket side of the group. Underlying profits increased 9.7% at the John Lewis stores to nearly \u00a340m, while Waitrose profits fell 17.4% to \u00a3101m as costs rose three times faster than a 1.5% rise in prices. Waitrose boss Rob Collins said inflation in meat, fish and dairy had been very strong. Mayfield said the retailer had not passed on to shoppers the full extent of its own rising costs resulting from the fall in the value of sterling. \u201cWe are not expecting these headwinds to diminish.\u201d he said. Aside from the cost of restructuring at John Lewis, Mayfield said profits had predominantly been affected by a squeeze on margins as tough competition was forcing the company to keep prices down despite rising costs. But it was a different story at Morrisons, where bosses said they had kept profit margins steady despite cost inflation by increasing sales and improving efficiency in its supply chain, much of which is managed in house. Underlying pretax profits at the recovering retail group rose 12.7% to \u00a3177m as sales rose 4.8% to \u00a38.4bn. The chief executive, David Potts, said the retailer\u2019s set-up, with two-thirds of its products sourced in the UK and much of its meat fish and vegetables processed in-house, meant the company \u201cshould be giving it your best shot to be holding inflation down for customers\u201d. He said it was not possible to \u201cdefy gravity\u201d on some products, such as butter and cream, where inflation had been very heady. But new avenues of distribution for Morrisons products, including selling Safeway-branded goods to the McColl\u2019s convenience store chain from next year, supplying Amazon with groceries and a tie-up with petrol forecourt operator Rontec would all help boost productivity and margins despite rising inflation. Mayfield said sales were rising so far in the second half, but warned that a number of factors would weigh on profits. \u201cSales growth has continued in the first few weeks of the second half. We are well set for our all-important seasonal peak, but we expect the headwinds that have dampened consumer demand and put pressure on margins to continue into next year,\u201d he said. In March, when John Lewis announced full-year results for 2016, the bonus for staff was cut to just 6% of salary, the lowest level since the 1950s and down from 10% the year before. Mayfield said the second half of the year would be crucial to determining the staff bonus for next year, because the business makes two-thirds of profits during the latter half.",

Surely the US economy is strong enough to withstand both after registering annualised GDP growth of 3% in the past quarter.</p> <p>Yellen is quite rightly concerned about falling consumer prices and the prospect of entering 2018 with a plan for raising rates while forecasts show inflation heading back to 1% \u2013 and missing its 2% target by a country mile.</p> <p>She has tried to explain away some of the drop in inflation by blaming one-off factors, but has conceded that core inflation, a measure that strips out volatile factors, will not head back to 2% until 2019, a year later than previously forecast.</p> <p>Another argument against a rate rise or unwinding of QE is the relationship between wages and inflation. The Fed had hoped that low unemployment and strong growth in new jobs would send wages through the roof. This would give the economy a solid foundation for growth, allow shops to increase prices and be the perfect pretext for raising interest rates.</p> <p>However, the US recovery is built on the same flimsy foundations as the UK\u2019s. There are millions of low-paid jobs in the leisure and hospitality industries, the transport industry delivering Amazon parcels and in wholesalers\u2019 distribution warehouses. There are no wage rises to be had in these workplaces, no fringe benefits and no job security.</p> <p>That\u2019s why consumer spending growth in the US, like in the UK, is largely fuelled by consumer borrowing.</p> <p>Worse, there is some evidence that lenders in the US are loosening the criteria they use for consumer lending, especially car loans, which could be sowing the seeds of the next crash.</p> <p>It is true that increasing the cost of credit could choke off demand for the riskiest loans. It is more likely to simply raise the cost of borrowing for millions of people, who will be forced further into debt. In this context, tightening monetary policy is a misstep.</p> <h2>The smartphone wars are over \u2013 and both sides were victorious</h2> <p>Ten years ago, they stood in rapturous lines. On Friday, the first person in the world to buy a new iPhone 8 Plus, in Australia, wasn\u2019t even getting it for himself; he was queueing for the attention, and will give the phone to his mother. He\u2019s waiting for the even-pricier iPhone X, with face recognition, animated emoji and a Samsung-made OLED screen, which won\u2019t be available until November, and surely in short supply even then.</p> <p>While the queues have died down compared to the past because Apple and the mobile networks sell a lot of phones online now, and in more countries \u2013 removing the need for \u201cgrey market\u201d buyers \u2013 all the talk is about the forthcoming top-end phone, whose \u00a3999 starting price is also a standout feature of sorts.</p> <p>But has Apple snookered itself? The last time it released a \u201clow-end\u201d iPhone, with the 5C in 2013 alongside the \u201chigh-end\u201d 5S, demand for the latter outstripped supply, while the \u201cunashamedly plastic\u201d 5C sat on shelves. Online ordering suggests the two iPhone 8 models are in plentiful supply, with only a few specific versions hard to get. Given that new iPhones have looked almost identical externally since 2014, perhaps Foxconn has got better at making them in huge volumes.</p> <p>Perhaps. But more likely is that people are slavering at the idea of the X, just as they did for the 5S. Even so, Apple can now rely on a huge base of users who will upgrade over time at a predictable rate. If they can\u2019t get an X (and it\u2019s likely many will be disappointed because production seems to be severely limited), they\u2019ll satisfy themselves with an 8. The smartphone wars are essentially over: the number of people switching in either direction between iPhones and phones using Google\u2019s Android is tiny compared with the billions of users worldwide.</p> <p>Now the iPhone\u2019s look is changing, the 8 may be the last of its kind. It\u2019s almost certain next year\u2019s models will have the X\u2019s OLED screen, adding LG as a supplier. And the queues? We\u2019ve probably seen the last of those too.</p> <h2>M&amp;S duck \u00e0 l\u2019orange delivered in an hour: is it a good gig?</h2> <p>Having waited a decade longer than its rivals, M&amp;S is finally taking its upmarket food halls online. Despite it being official that the internet has caught on, M&amp;S chief executive Steve Rowe is treading carefully with two modest trials: a fast home delivery service in central London akin to Amazon and apps such as UberEats; and what is basically a click and collect service in Berkshire.</p> <p>After a strong run, M&amp;S food no longer sets the heather on fire, so seeking the sweet spot in Britain\u2019s \u00a3180bn grocery market would seem wise. But M&amp;S needs to tread more carefully than most in the controversial gig economy. In London, its orders are delivered by courier firm Gophr \u2013 which uses self-employed riders \u2013 but the retailer says it is \u201cculturally aligned\u201d with its own business.</p> <p>Rowe had better hope it truly is: his is not any online grocery service, this is a Marks &amp; Spencer food delivery service. It needs to be truly special.</p>",

However, the US recovery is built on the same flimsy foundations as the UK\u2019s. There are millions of low-paid jobs in the leisure and hospitality industries, the transport industry delivering Amazon parcels and in wholesalers\u2019 distribution warehouses. There are no wage rises to be had in these workplaces, no fringe benefits and no job security. That\u2019s why consumer spending growth in the US, like in the UK, is largely fuelled by consumer borrowing. Worse, there is some evidence that lenders in the US are loosening the criteria they use for consumer lending, especially car loans, which could be sowing the seeds of the next crash. It is true that increasing the cost of credit could choke off demand for the riskiest loans. It is more likely to simply raise the cost of borrowing for millions of people, who will be forced further into debt. In this context, tightening monetary policy is a misstep. The smartphone wars are over \u2013 and both sides were victorious Ten years ago, they stood in rapturous lines. On Friday, the first person in the world to buy a new iPhone 8 Plus, in Australia, wasn\u2019t even getting it for himself; he was queueing for the attention, and will give the phone to his mother. He\u2019s waiting for the even-pricier iPhone X, with face recognition, animated emoji and a Samsung-made OLED screen, which won\u2019t be available until November, and surely in short supply even then. While the queues have died down compared to the past because Apple and the mobile networks sell a lot of phones online now, and in more countries \u2013 removing the need for \u201cgrey market\u201d buyers \u2013 all the talk is about the forthcoming top-end phone, whose \u00a3999 starting price is also a standout feature of sorts. But has Apple snookered itself? The last time it released a \u201clow-end\u201d iPhone, with the 5C in 2013 alongside the \u201chigh-end\u201d 5S, demand for the latter outstripped supply, while the \u201cunashamedly plastic\u201d 5C sat on shelves. Online ordering suggests the two iPhone 8 models are in plentiful supply, with only a few specific versions hard to get. Given that new iPhones have looked almost identical externally since 2014, perhaps Foxconn has got better at making them in huge volumes. Perhaps. But more likely is that people are slavering at the idea of the X, just as they did for the 5S. Even so, Apple can now rely on a huge base of users who will upgrade over time at a predictable rate. If they can\u2019t get an X (and it\u2019s likely many will be disappointed because production seems to be severely limited), they\u2019ll satisfy themselves with an 8. The smartphone wars are essentially over: the number of people switching in either direction between iPhones and phones using Google\u2019s Android is tiny compared with the billions of users worldwide. Now the iPhone\u2019s look is changing, the 8 may be the last of its kind. It\u2019s almost certain next year\u2019s models will have the X\u2019s OLED screen, adding LG as a supplier. And the queues? We\u2019ve probably seen the last of those too. M&amp;S duck \u00e0 l\u2019orange delivered in an hour: is it a good gig? Having waited a decade longer than its rivals, M&amp;S is finally taking its upmarket food halls online. Despite it being official that the internet has caught on, M&amp;S chief executive Steve Rowe is treading carefully with two modest trials: a fast home delivery service in central London akin to Amazon and apps such as UberEats; and what is basically a click and collect service in Berkshire. After a strong run, M&amp;S food no longer sets the heather on fire, so seeking the sweet spot in Britain\u2019s \u00a3180bn grocery market would seem wise. But M&amp;S needs to tread more carefully than most in the controversial gig economy. In London, its orders are delivered by courier firm Gophr \u2013 which uses self-employed riders \u2013 but the retailer says it is \u201cculturally aligned\u201d with its own business. Rowe had better hope it truly is: his is not any online grocery service, this is a Marks &amp; Spencer food delivery service. It needs to be truly special.",
