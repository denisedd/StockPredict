                "bodyText":"This mornings\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s weak retail sales report helped to deprive us of another record closing high on the FTSE 100. The blue-chip closed down 49 points at 7513. Other European markets also dropped. Next, M&amp;S both shed 1% and Kingfisher lost 2.9%, while security firm G4S tumbled 4.7% after lowering its forecasts. Tomorrow M&amp;as releases its own sales figures, so traders will be keen to discover how it is faring..... On that note, goodnight and thanks for reading and commenting. GW SSE\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hopes of combining its UK operations with nPower could fall foul of comjpetition authorities. Neil Wilson of ETX Capital reckons these concerns could sink the deal. He says: Cutting the big six down to a big five would hardly help competition, which is exactly what the government wants. A merger would create the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest household energy supplier with a 24% market share, ahead of British Gas\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 22%. The problem and arguably the rationale is that the big six are losing customers at a record pace to smaller suppliers. Smaller suppliers now account for more than 8% of market share, up from 1% just three years ago, according to Ofgem data. The big six also face a hit from price caps \u00e2\u20ac\u201c consolidation has its appeal in this kind of environment \u00e2\u20ac\u201c just look at the gambling industry\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s raft of deals. Npower has been on the ropes for some time, racking up losses and losing customers quickly following well documented customer service troubles and higher costs. Cost cutting has been severe but not enough to full offset worsening market conditions and reduced margins. Profits in the first half fell 114% from a year ago and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s on course for a third consecutive annual loss. Years of problems have led to restructuring but it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s clearly not working quickly enough. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s big news in the British energy market this afternoon, with SSE and npower announcing plans to create a new UK energy provider. If they succeed, it would leave Britain with just five major suppliers. That could threaten competition at a time when public anger over rising energy bills is palpable. My colleague Adam Vaughan explains: SSE and npower, two of the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest energy companies, are planning to combine their household energy supply businesses in a potentially seismic shake-up of the market. The two firms said they are in well-advanced talks to create a new independent energy supply firm. The new business would combine the 13 million customers they currently supply with electricity and gas. If the move goes ahead it would see the end of two of the biggest brands in the energy retail market, and is likely to raise competition concerns as the so-called big six that own 80% of the energy market shrinks to the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153big five\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd.... More here: Over in New York, the main US stock indices have hit new record highs at the start of trading. The long equities rally has driven world stock markets to a new record high. The MSCI All-Country World Index burst through the 500-point mark for the first time today. That follows a series of record highs on Wall Street, and yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rally in London which pushed the FTSE 100 to a record close. Earlier today, Japan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Nikkei also popped higher to its highest closing point in 25 years. Investors are in an optimistic mood following after a series of big companies beat expectations recently (Apple, Amazon, Caterpillar, Mastercard, BP and Goldman Sachs to name but a few). Perhaps surprisingly, the rally has continued despite some central banks preparing to unwind their monetary stimulus programme. Government bond prices have also rallied in recent years, of course, as this chart from g+ Economics shows: G+\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Lena Komileva says the financial universe has \u00e2\u20ac\u0153tilted in recent months\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, with the US Federal Reserve unwinding its balance sheet, the ECB slowing its quantitative easing scheme next year, and the Bank of England raising interest rates last week. She warns that there could be volatility ahead, as the process of normalising monetary policy continues. Global bonds - equity correlations have been virtually 1 over the past year (see above chart), following virtually uninterrupted linear growth, pretty much void of volatility, despite historically tight credit spreads and a growing negative-yield bonds universe. This is the type of artificial liquidity environment where asset bubbles and systemic crises are born. As QE tapering gets underway expect a gradual pivot in market sensitivity back towards domestic fundamentals and real risk pricing. It is little surprise that central banks want to exit the current markets environment and follow a return to normal economic activity with policy normalisation, as fast as possible, without putting reflation objectives at risk. Over in Greece finance minister Euclid Tsakalotos has reacted furiously to claims \u00e2\u20ac\u201c issued by parliament\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s state budget office no less \u00e2\u20ac\u201c that the country faces economic collapse if its staggering debt load is not substantially reduced. Our correspondent Helena Smith reports from Athens The budget office\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s dramatic warning that bankrupcy looms unless Greece gets debt relief was dismissed outright by Tsakalotos. In comments to the leftwing daily, Efimerida twn Syntakton, the Greek finance minister described the claim as a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153mistake\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd based on \u00e2\u20ac\u0153outdated figures.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This is a error,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said insisting that the office had been lead to the wrong conclusions on account of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153erroneous calculations\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd over the amount of debt repayments Greece will be called to make between 2021 and 2026. In a subsequent announcement the finance ministry said the House office had employed data from 2013 before short-term debt relief measures were agreed by eurogroup finance ministers in May 2016 and when the interest rates on payments was much higher. Parliament\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s president Nikos Voutsis went further accusing the state budget office of fear-mongering, saying: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I am surprised at the use of invalid data and ensuing public relations stunt.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd In its quarterly report released Monday the budget office warned that bankruptcy was inevitable because interest payments on maturing debt after 2021 were so high. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Without substantial debt relief, Greece will go bankrupt,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd it warned. At 180%, Greece has the highest debt to GDP ratio of any EU member state. But with less than a year to go before the country exits a third international bailout progamme, Athens\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 leftist-led coalition is keen to change the narrative to one of hope after years of gruelling austerity meted out in exchange for rescue funds. I mentioned earlier that house price shortages were keeping UK prices up.... ...and bang on cue, online estate agents HouseSimple.com have confirmed that this is an issue. Its Property Supply Index found that the total number of new properties marketed by estate agents across the UK fell by 4.3% in October. The number of listings fell in 75% of UK towns and cities, including a 37.4% drop in Torquay and 37.0% in Oxford. In Wolverhampton, property listings have fallen for five months in a row. Alex Gosling, CEO of online estate agents HouseSimple.com. says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The housing market is in desperate need of a prolonged period of supply growth rather than isolated months where seller numbers rise, only to fall back the following month. We probably won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t see numbers jump again this year, but steady levels in November and December would at least give the market a strong base going into the New Year, particularly with some heavy Brexit headwinds heading our way. This month\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Black Friday sales will be crucial for UK retailers, especially as Amazon is gunning for them with 10 days of sales and a pop-up store in Soho. High Fletcher, global head of consultancy and innovation at consultancy firm Salmon says retailers might profit by launching their own promotions pronto.... A strong focus on digital and innovation will be vital for consumers wanting a quick and convenient service \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the figures are suggesting, after all, a shift from buying items they want to rather buying items they need. As consumers increasingly flock online to purchase goods, retailers should be looking to start Black Friday sales sooner rather than later to boost the slump in non-food sales, perhaps by even creating their own \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcpeak days\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 to stave off the competition from Black Friday stalwarts such as Amazon. The next month or so will be a game-changer for many in the retail business. Shares in several major British retailers have dropped today, following the news that sales fell in October. Kingfisher, which operates the B&amp;Q DIY chain, and Marks &amp; Spencer are both among the biggest fallers on the FTSE 100 this morning. That has helped to pull the blue-chip index down by 16 points to 7546, denting hopes that we could see a record alltime high today. Security firm G4S are the biggest faller after downgrading its full-year sales growth forecasts this morning, guidance from between four and six per cent to three and four per cent. Associated British Foods are also out of favour, after warning this morning that sugar profits would fall in 2017-2018 due to lower EU prices. That has taken the shine off Primark\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decent performance. Incidentally, Primark\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s UK sales rose by 10% on a total basis, not a like-for like basis as I wrote earlier (now corrected). In another sign that shoppers are cutting back, sales at John Lewis\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s department stores fell by 3.7% last week compared to a year earlier. Takings in the seven days to 4th November fell to \u00c2\u00a3102.03m, from \u00c2\u00a3105.98m in 2016. Homeware sales shank by 7% and electrical and home technology takings tumbled by 8.4% -- despite the iPhone X launch boosting mobile phone sales. The spooky season provided some cheer, though; John Lewis\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Halloween sales jumped by 24% year on year. One week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sales can be deceptive, but this chart shows that sales have been lagging 2016 for several weeks now... Waitrose, which is part of the John Lewis group, reported a 0.5% drop in total sales last week. Eurozone retail sales have beaten forecasts, in another sign that Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy is strengthening. Eurozone retail sales jumped by 0.7% in September, according to new figures from Eurostat. On an annual basis ,sales volumes were 3.7% higher than a year ago. In contrast, retail sales across the UK shrank by 0.8% in September, according to figures released last month. Jeremy Leaf, a north London estate agent, agrees that the shortage of UK houses are keeping prices up. On the face of it, these figures are quite encouraging because they continue to demonstrate the market resilience that we have grown accustomed to over the past few months. However, when you look behind the numbers you realise that much of the growth is supported by continuing shortage of supply which we are also finding on the high street. \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcLooking forward there is no doubt that people will continue to trade but more nervously, particularly in the light of higher mortgage costs and pressure on real income.\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Every weekday morning, Business Today delivers the biggest stories, smartest analysis and hottest topics direct to your inbox.

The drop in retail sales last month shows that UK shoppers are holding onto their cash until they see a real bargain, says Hannah Maundrell, editor in chief of money.co.uk: She explains: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Despite retailers best efforts it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not surprising households have tightened their purse strings in light of inflation rising and the lack of wage growth. Everyone is dubious about parting with their cash \u00e2\u20ac\u0153just in case\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re coming into what is typically the busiest period of the year for retailers, however bargain blindness has hit the retail sector hard as the expectation of rock bottom prices means we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re less and less willing to part with our cash if we have to pay full price. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re less likely to buy and expect discounts which causes the perfect storm for retailers.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Discount fashion chain Primark has defied the slowdown in UK retail sales. It has reported a 10% rise in sales across its British stores in the last year [corrected]. Parent company Associated British Foods says Primark\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s share of the UK clothing market \u00e2\u20ac\u0153increased significantly\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd -- suggesting it is grabbing sales from other retailers. After a good first half, third quarter trading was strong in the lead-up to Easter, with the growth also benefiting from comparison with prior year results that were affected by poor weather and an earlier Easter holiday. Fourth quarter trading was equally strong, fully reflecting the success of our consumer offering. This was driven by the ability of our buying, merchandising and design teams to identify and deliver key seasonal trends. The consumer response to our new autumn/winter range has been encouraging. In total, Primark posted a 14% rise in sales on a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153constant currency\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd basis (stripping out foreign exchange moves) across Europe and the US. Like-for-like sales were only up by 1% though If Halifax are right, then house prices are rising much faster than wages (up 2.1% in the last year) and interest rates (now 0.5%). Lucy Pendleton, Founder Director of independent estate agents James Pendleton, says the lack of supply of new homes is pushing prices up. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s her take on the news that prices rose by 4.5% in the last year. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve since had a rate rise but what you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re seeing isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t one last hurrah as people rush to grab the best mortgage rates. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s that same old ball and chain around the UK property market\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s neck - weak supply. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The countdown on rates may have helped support demand but mortgage approvals were down. We know stiff competition for homes exists but to see approvals and prices diverge in such dramatic fashion is surprising. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153There will also be an echo from September\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s back-to-work bounce, as deals brokered before the summer holidays complete in the Autumn, but such a strong second month is uncharacteristic and shows the market in surprisingly rude health.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd UK house price inflation has accelerated again, according to the latest survey from Halifax. The lender reports that house prices rose by 4.5% in the last quarter, compared to a year ago. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s up from 4% a month ago, and the fastest annual increase since February. During the month, prices picked up by 0.3%. It suggests that buyers weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t deterred by (accurate) predictions that the Bank of England would raise interest rates this week. These housing surveys can be volatile, so should be treated cautiously. Last week, Nationwide also reported that house prices had risen -- but only at an annual rate of 2.5%. Brits may be cutting back on clothes, but they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re still finding money for essentials such as, err, posh tonic water. Fever-Tree, the upmarket mixer maker, has told the City that its results this year will be \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcmaterially\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 ahead of market expectations. It looks like its 5th profit upgrade this year The company, founded just 12 years ago, reckons that it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s dominating the rest of the market, saying: The exceptional performance in the UK, the Group\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest market, has been particularly impressive with the rate of sales growth and momentum strong across both the on and off trade. The mixer category is now the fastest growing category across the UK soft drinks sector with Fever-Tree responsible for 97% of the value growth in retail over the last 12 months. Shares have jumped 10% in early trading, to \u00c2\u00a321.40. Three years ago they floated at just 134p.... UK fashion retailer New Look has also reported a drop in sales over the last six months, another sign that the sector is going through a tough patch. New Look posted a loss after tax of \u00c2\u00a372.7m for the six months to 23rd September this morning, after suffering a 4.5% drop in revenues. The retailer firm also revealed that Alistair McGeorge, former boss, been parachuted in as executive Chairman. McGeorge says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s results reflect another tough period of trading for the company amid a challenging retail environment on the UK high street. Whilst we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re not anticipating a reversal in fortunes overnight, I am confident we will implement the necessary changes to get the company back on track. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s financial results, though, show that McGeorge has a challenge on his hands: Revenue -4.5% to \u00c2\u00a3686.0m (H1 FY17: \u00c2\u00a3718.1m) New Look Brand like-for-like sales -8.6% UK like-for-like sales -8.4% Own website sales -7.6% Third Party E-commerce sales +17.0% Paul Martin, head of retail at KPMG, says the drop in UK retail sales in October is a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153real disappointment\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Clothing sales were particularly hard hit. After a brief uptick, fashion sales reverted back to the dreary theme we have seen for a number of months this year. Unseasonably warm weather last month will not have helped, but this is unlikely to be the only reason the new ranges are proving unpopular. He suggests that customers might be holding back until the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcBlack Friday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 deals arrive. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Overall growth online was lacklustre at best, although health and beauty products continued to stand out as a strong performer. The burning questions for retailers will be whether shoppers are holding off their purchases until Black Friday, and whether retailers can recover from this month\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s poor performance to end the year on a high. Black Friday (an idea imported from America) lands on 24th November, so we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll soon know whether October\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meagre pickings were just a blip or something more serious.... Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. The storm clouds gathering over the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s retail sector have darkened, with a new survey showing that Brits cut back last month. Retail sales shrank by 1.0% on a like-for-like basis in October, compared to a year ago, according to the British Retail Consortium. Worryingly, non-food retail sales shrank by 0.4% over the last quarter on a like-for-like basis -- the worst reading since the BRC started counting in January 2011. That includes a 2.9% slump in sales of non-food items within stores (rather than online). Although food sales did rise, the report is another indication that Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s consumers are being squeezed by the rising cost of living, and economic uncertainty. Helen Dickinson, chief executive of the British Retail Consortium, says the report will alarm shop owners: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It was a meagre month in October for retail sales as shopping activity slumped. With total growth at its lowest since May and below the 12-month average, retailers will have cause for concern as they prepare for the crucial run up to Christmas. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The decline was driven by the worst performance of non-food sales since our record began in January 2011, as consumers appear to have opted for outdoor experiences and excursions during half term, over visits to the shops. The growth in food sales meanwhile, adds some colour to this otherwise anaemic picture, but these figures are very much buoyed by inflation. She blames the jump in inflation -- which hit 3% in September as the fall in the pound drove up import costs. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Real consumer spending power has been on a downward trend in the last year as the acceleration in inflation has caused shoppers to become ever more cautious in considering what purchases they can afford. Many now face higher borrowing costs, given the rise in interest rates, which will only serve to heap further pressure onto household finances. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our report: Foreign exchange expert Kit Juckes of Soci\u00c3\u00a9t\u00c3\u00a9 G\u00c3\u00a9n\u00c3\u00a9rale isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t impressed either: Also coming up today.... European stock markets are expected to open higher, after the FTSE 100 hit a record closing high last night. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll get a new healthcheck on Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s property market when Halifax publishes its monthly house price figures.

In his book Capital in the 21st Century, Thomas Piketty notes that in the early 20th century, the US led the way on tackling wealth disparities, proving intellectually more prepared than other advanced countries to accept a steeply progressive income tax. In an article for <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://prospect.org/article/how-gilded-ages-end\">American Prospect</a>, Paul Starr notes that limiting the power of concentrated wealth in the US is a cause with deep roots.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>That explains why <a href=\"https://learning.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/05/15/may-15-1911-supreme-court-orders-standard-oil-to-be-broken-up/\">anti-trust laws were used to break up Rockefeller\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Standard Oil in 1911</a>, and why the 16th amendment to the constitution brought in a federal income tax in 1913.</p> <p>The US political backlash, in both the Progressive era and the 1930s, went right to the top. Teddy Roosevelt was in the White House when the anti-trust suit which ultimately resulted in the dissolution of Standard Oil was launched; Woodrow Wilson vehemently denounced corporate lobbying and Franklin Roosevelt made clear what he thought of Wall Street when he said in his 1936 re-election campaign that government by organised money was as dangerous as government by organised mob. To rapturous applause, FDR went on to say that big money was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153unanimous in its hatred for me, and I welcome that hatred\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd.</p> <p>Like FDR, Donald Trump has appealed to those in America who think the system is rigged against them. Unlike FDR, he has so far shown not the slightest inclination to do anything to make the system less rigged. To do that, Trump would have to make the tax system more progressive, reduce the power of corporate lobbying, resist pressure for stronger intellectual property rights and stop the wealthy from salting their money away in tax havens. None of this is on his agenda, which explains why America is a country where competition is thwarted, excess profits are rife and the tech entrepreneurs of Silicon Valley are the new robber barons.</p> <p>\u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 This article was amended on 15 November 2017. An earlier version said that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Teddy Roosevelt was in the White House when Standard Oil was broken up\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Roosevelt was president when the anti-trust suit was launched in 1909 but had left office by the time the Supreme Court ordered the dissolution in 1911. <br></p>",

In an article for American Prospect, Paul Starr notes that limiting the power of concentrated wealth in the US is a cause with deep roots. That explains why anti-trust laws were used to break up Rockefeller\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Standard Oil in 1911, and why the 16th amendment to the constitution brought in a federal income tax in 1913. The US political backlash, in both the Progressive era and the 1930s, went right to the top. Teddy Roosevelt was in the White House when the anti-trust suit which ultimately resulted in the dissolution of Standard Oil was launched; Woodrow Wilson vehemently denounced corporate lobbying and Franklin Roosevelt made clear what he thought of Wall Street when he said in his 1936 re-election campaign that government by organised money was as dangerous as government by organised mob. To rapturous applause, FDR went on to say that big money was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153unanimous in its hatred for me, and I welcome that hatred\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Like FDR, Donald Trump has appealed to those in America who think the system is rigged against them. Unlike FDR, he has so far shown not the slightest inclination to do anything to make the system less rigged. To do that, Trump would have to make the tax system more progressive, reduce the power of corporate lobbying, resist pressure for stronger intellectual property rights and stop the wealthy from salting their money away in tax havens. None of this is on his agenda, which explains why America is a country where competition is thwarted, excess profits are rife and the tech entrepreneurs of Silicon Valley are the new robber barons. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 This article was amended on 15 November 2017. An earlier version said that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Teddy Roosevelt was in the White House when Standard Oil was broken up\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Roosevelt was president when the anti-trust suit was launched in 1909 but had left office by the time the Supreme Court ordered the dissolution in 1911.",

Earlier this month, M&amp;S\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new chairman, Archie Norman, accused the struggling store chain of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153drifting\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd for more than 15 years: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This business has been drifting, underfulfilling its customer promise not for five years, not 10 years but 15 years and maybe beyond.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The shift in retail power is being compared with the automotive industry, where the electric carmaker Tesla sped ahead of the 114-year-old Ford Motor Company in April to become the US\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s most valuable car manufacturer. Similarly, the online retailer Amazon is now worth nearly twice as much as Walmart, after overtaking the American grocery chain in 2015. Photiades said that 20 years ago, when online shopping was in its infancy and before Asos was established, M&amp;S had a market value of \u00c2\u00a316.9bn. When Asos floated on the stock market in October 2001, it was valued at \u00c2\u00a314m, compared with \u00c2\u00a37.8bn for M&amp;S. The market valuation of a company reflects expected future earnings: M&amp;S remains bigger both in sales and in terms of profit. Asos recorded sales of \u00c2\u00a31.9bn last year, compared with \u00c2\u00a310.6bn at M&amp;S. Profits were \u00c2\u00a380m and \u00c2\u00a3176.4m, respectively. Profits have been going backwards for several years at M&amp;S despite its position as the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest clothing retailer. It was making full-year profits of more than \u00c2\u00a31bn in 2008 but that figure has been whittled down by a long running slump in clothing sales. Since taking over a year ago the M&amp;S chief executive, Steve Rowe, has stabilised the performance of its clothing arm and shut loss-making stores overseas. Unlike Asos, Rowe also has to grapple with the challenging economics of its large store portfolio as sales migrate online and fewer shoppers frequent the high street. Asos brags that it puts around 5,000 new items on its site each week \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the equivalent of an entire Oxford Street shop \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and is constantly adding new features to the site such as visual search, which allows customers to upload photos from social media to search for a similar outfit. Rowe says M&amp;S\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u0153destiny\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd also lies online, setting a target ofone-third of sales online by 2022. But he warned M&amp;S will need to plough investment into its infrastructure to reach it. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk, or sign up to the daily Business Today email here.",

Despite a plethora of delivery options, 80% of its orders end up being fulfilled the old-fashioned way through the now combined Sainsbury\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s and Argos store network.</p> <p>Rogers says that it is no longer possible to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153delineate\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd between online and physical sales as customers move seamlessly between the two worlds. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The majority of orders start online but are fulfilled in our stores,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he says. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t overestimate the importance of that flexibility. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m a big believer in stores but there is no question that online will continue to grow.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd</p> <p>In the coming days retailers will wage a fierce battle for Black Friday sales, an event that will be a litmus test for the key Christmas period, when many bank the lion\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s share of their annual profits. Rogers is determined that Argos will be one of the winners from these first skirmishes, insisting that if you have the right products at the right prices, the demand is there.</p> <p>\u00e2\u20ac\u0153I think Christmas will be big this year, but it will come later,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he predicts of the nail-biting trading days ahead. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I would not write off stores.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd</p> <p>\u00e2\u20ac\u00a2Follow Guardian Business on Twitter at <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BusinessDesk\">@BusinessDesk</a>, or sign up to the daily Business Today email <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/info/2017/may/16/guardian-business-today-sign-up-financial-news-email?CMP=business_footnote\">here</a>.</p>",

In the early 1960s retail accounted for close to a third of Britons\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 spending, but that figure is 24% today and is expected to fall further still. Shifting priorities have seen retailers invest heavily in creating more dynamic store experiences to pull shoppers away from their screens. A recent example of the trend is John Lewis\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new Oxford store where more than a fifth of the 120,000 sq ft of selling space is devoted to 21 \u00e2\u20ac\u0153services and experiences\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, ranging from style advice to personalised Christmas baubles. Some analysts argue the internet should no longer be seen as the enemy of the store. Amazon put a cat among the pigeons earlier this year when it swooped on organic food chain Whole Foods Market. The move showed that even the biggest of the online giants saw value in a physical store network. Closer to home, supermarket chain Sainsbury\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s swallowed Argos last year for \u00c2\u00a31.4bn as it looked to borrow the catalogue chain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s successful model, which marries stores, the web and super-fast delivery. Argos chief executive John Rogers explains a new topsy-turvy retail landscape where 60% of orders originate online but two-thirds of those shoppers turn up in store to collect their toys, kettles and toasters. Despite a plethora of delivery options, 80% of its orders end up being fulfilled the old-fashioned way through the now combined Sainsbury\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s and Argos store network. Rogers says that it is no longer possible to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153delineate\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd between online and physical sales as customers move seamlessly between the two worlds. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The majority of orders start online but are fulfilled in our stores,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he says. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t overestimate the importance of that flexibility. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m a big believer in stores but there is no question that online will continue to grow.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd In the coming days retailers will wage a fierce battle for Black Friday sales, an event that will be a litmus test for the key Christmas period, when many bank the lion\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s share of their annual profits. Rogers is determined that Argos will be one of the winners from these first skirmishes, insisting that if you have the right products at the right prices, the demand is there. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I think Christmas will be big this year, but it will come later,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he predicts of the nail-biting trading days ahead. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I would not write off stores.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2Follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk, or sign up to the daily Business Today email here.",

                "bodyText":"The US Department of Justice on Monday moved to block AT&amp;T\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s $85bn takeover of Time Warner, one of the largest media deals ever announced. The decision to file suit against the deal is likely to set off a high stakes court battle \u00e2\u20ac\u201c AT&amp;T has already signaled it will go to court if the deal is blocked \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and will start one of the biggest corporate merger legal battles in decades. The suit argues the deal will \u00e2\u20ac\u0153substantially lessen competition, resulting in higher prices and less innovation for millions of Americans\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This merger would greatly harm American consumers. It would mean higher monthly television bills and fewer of the new, emerging innovative options that consumers are beginning to enjoy,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said assistant attorney general Makan Delrahim of the department\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s antitrust division. David McAtee, AT&amp;T\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s general counsel called the suit \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a radical and inexplicable departure from decades of antitrust precedent\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. The US authorities had already called for major changes before signing off on any deal. Critics have claimed the deal is being held hostage because of Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s antipathy towards CNN, owned by Time Warner and which he has branded as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153fake news\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. The deal was first announced in October 2016, just weeks before the presidential election. During the campaign, and since his election, Trump has regularly attacked CNN, calling the network \u00e2\u20ac\u0153terrible\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and \u00e2\u20ac\u0153fake news\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd at his first press conference after the election. Trump attacked the network again while on his recent tour of Asia, calling it \u00e2\u20ac\u0153bad\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and \u00e2\u20ac\u0153FAKE\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Reports suggested that AT&amp;T, the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest telecommunications company, had offered to sell CNN in order for a deal to go through. But the chief executive officer, Randall Stephenson, denied any such compromise had been offered. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Throughout this process, I have never offered to sell CNN and have no intention of doing so,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said in a statement earlier this month. In a press conference after the news broke Stephenson acknowledged the speculation that Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s antipathy to CNN had sparked the legal move. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Frankly I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153But nobody should be surprised that the question keeps coming up.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Stephenson said the deal had \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the whole world\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd questioning what the justice department \u00e2\u20ac\u0153can and cannot do\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. He said any deal would protect CNN\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u0153first amendment rights\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and no deal would be struck without the news channel. Time Warner, owner of CNN, HBO, Warner Brothers and other big-name media properties, does not compete directly with AT&amp;T meaning there is little argument against the deal on competition grounds. But the justice department argues that combining Time Warner\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s assets with AT&amp;T and its DirecTV satellite television business would directly harm consumers, quoting statements from DirecTV that so-called \u00e2\u20ac\u0153vertically integrated programmers\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u201c which own the means of distribution as well as the content \u00e2\u20ac\u201c can \u00e2\u20ac\u0153much more credibly threaten to withhold programming from rival [distributors]\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and can \u00e2\u20ac\u0153use such threats to demand higher prices and more favorable terms\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Vertical mergers like this one are routinely approved because they benefit consumers without removing any competitor from the market. We see no legitimate reason for our merger to be treated differently,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said McAtee. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Fortunately, the Department of Justice doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have the final say in this matter.

Most of the action takes place online in this country, with shoppers choosing to bargain hunt from under the duvet using their phone or laptop rather than queueing up outside stores in the early hours. Spending is expected to be up this year as more stores join the event, but experts say bargains may be harder to find as stores battle rising costs and inflation.

This effort to identify a fresh supply of brownfield urban sites is essential. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s where the chancellor\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s predecessor should have started, instead of stimulating demand with help to buy.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"7b0fb4cb-830d-4770-a136-94cec28c0521\" data-atom-type=\"qanda\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Qanda\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Stamp duty is a tax charged by the government when you buy a property for more than \u00c2\u00a3125,000. The amount you pay depends on the cost of your new home.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p>The tax was first introduced in 1694 as a way to raise money for a war against France, and was eventually introduced on a wide range of purchases, including newspapers and perfume. </p>\n    <p>In 2003, the then chancellor Gordon Brown introduced stamp duty land tax (SDLT) to replace the old duty and homebuyers became legally responsible for declaring their purchase and paying the tax. </p>\n    <p>In recent years successive chancellors have used the tax as a lever to alter the course of the housing market. In 2008 and 2010 Alistair Darling launched stamp duty holidays aimed at encouraging sales; in 2012 George Osborne introduced higher rates for \u00c2\u00a32m-plus properties bought by overseas companies; and in 2016 he added a surcharge on second homes in a bid to calm the buy-to-let market. </p>\n    <p>The biggest change came in December 2014 when Osborne overhauled the way stamp duty was calculated. Prior to that, the whole value of a purchase was taxed at the same rate, leading to property prices bunching underneath each threshold. Since then, it has been charged like income tax \u00e2\u20ac\u201c you pay a higher rate only on the part of your purchase that falls over each threshold. Anyone buying a property costing up to \u00c2\u00a3937,000 pays less than under the old rules.</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Guarantees to support new rental properties are also welcome. That part of the market is often over-looked in the obsession over home ownership. Hammond could have gone further: a wall of pension fund money wants to invest in the rental sector.</p> \n<p>Yet there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a further threat to the chancellor\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ambition to get 300,000 additional homes a year built by the mid-2020s: the shortage of labour, a problem that Brexit may intensify. An extra \u00c2\u00a334m \u00e2\u20ac\u0153to develop construction skills across the country\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd will barely move the dial. Believe in the 300,000 target only when it has been met.</p> \n<h2>VAT fraud needs joint liability laws</h2> \n<p>The best announcement in the budget was the vow to crack down on online VAT fraud \u00e2\u20ac\u201c meaning the practice of firms, often Chinese, illegally selling goods tax-free to UK consumers on sites such as Amazon and eBay. The chancellor\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s proposal will make online marketplaces jointly liable for VAT. Good move.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/nov/28/amazon-ebay-sellers-vat-fraud-ipads-tax-free\">Past investigations by the Guardian</a> have demonstrated how rife the fraud is. We found sellers trading without displaying VAT numbers. Others showed made-up numbers or numbers cloned from unsuspecting legitimate businesses.</p> \n<p>Relying on Amazon and eBay to warn sellers of their obligations, or to delist offenders, has achieved little. Hammond put the cost to the taxpayer of VAT fraud at \u00c2\u00a31.2bn per year. If such a sum was being leaked via traditional retailers, there would be outrage.</p> \n<p>The online giants usually grumble that they shouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be responsible for the VAT compliance of independent sellers. That is disingenuous nonsense. They have helped to create the problem \u00e2\u20ac\u201c joint liability may make them solve it.</p> \n<p>\u00e2\u20ac\u00a2Follow Guardian Business on Twitter at <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BusinessDesk\">@BusinessDesk</a>, or sign up to the daily Business Today email <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/info/2017/may/16/guardian-business-today-sign-up-financial-news-email?CMP=business_footnote\">here</a>.<br></p>",

Yet there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a further threat to the chancellor\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ambition to get 300,000 additional homes a year built by the mid-2020s: the shortage of labour, a problem that Brexit may intensify. An extra \u00c2\u00a334m \u00e2\u20ac\u0153to develop construction skills across the country\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd will barely move the dial. Believe in the 300,000 target only when it has been met. VAT fraud needs joint liability laws The best announcement in the budget was the vow to crack down on online VAT fraud \u00e2\u20ac\u201c meaning the practice of firms, often Chinese, illegally selling goods tax-free to UK consumers on sites such as Amazon and eBay. The chancellor\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s proposal will make online marketplaces jointly liable for VAT. Good move. Past investigations by the Guardian have demonstrated how rife the fraud is. We found sellers trading without displaying VAT numbers. Others showed made-up numbers or numbers cloned from unsuspecting legitimate businesses. Relying on Amazon and eBay to warn sellers of their obligations, or to delist offenders, has achieved little. Hammond put the cost to the taxpayer of VAT fraud at \u00c2\u00a31.2bn per year. If such a sum was being leaked via traditional retailers, there would be outrage. The online giants usually grumble that they shouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be responsible for the VAT compliance of independent sellers. That is disingenuous nonsense. They have helped to create the problem \u00e2\u20ac\u201c joint liability may make them solve it. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2Follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk, or sign up to the daily Business Today email here.",

                "bodyText":"Time for a quick recap. A new report on Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy has shown that firms reined in their investment over the summer. UK business investment growth more than halved in Q3 2017, to 0.2%, suggesting bosses were reluctant to invest for the future. The second estimate of UK GDP in July-September also found that household spending propped up growth, which was confirmed at 0.4%. A separate survey has shown that retail sales have picked up in November, as shoppers returned to the high street after an October slowdown. Yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s budget continues to be scrutinised, with the Institute of Fiscal Studies warning that the UK risks losing two decades of earnings growth. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s all for today, I think. Good night! GW A quiet day in the European markets has ended, with the FTSE 100 closing almost flat. France and Italy managed a small rally though. Financial firms and organisations with a large gender pay gap may have to explain it to MPs. Nicky Morgan MP, chair of the Treasury Committee, says there is no room for complacency, following the publication of the Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s data today. She says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s measures to address its pay gap seem to be on the right track, but we cannot be complacent. Any gap is still too great. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153As part of our Women in Finance inquiry, we will keep a close eye on organisations as they report their gender pay gap before the April 2018 deadline. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We may call for organisations to give evidence to the Committee to hear about best practice. Financial firms should be prepared to explain any gender pay gap that they may have.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Discouraging news from the UK labour market: There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no Wall Street open today; The US stock market is closed for the Thanksgiving celebrations, so traders will soon be tucking into the turkey with their nearest and dearest. That means tomorrow is Black Friday \u00e2\u20ac\u201c America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s traditional pilgrimage to the nearest mall to worship consumerism. European readers have probably noticed that Black Friday has become a bigger deal over here in recent years. Retailers have been offering deals for several days, with a flurry of new offers due at midnight. Press Association reports that some UK stores will opening early: Among them are some John Lewis stores that are slightly extending their opening hours, a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153few\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Argos outlets opening early and 187 Tesco Extra stores that are closing at 1am and reopening at 5am on Black Friday, while a further 62 will open at 6am after preparing for the event. But not everyone is happy. Amazon workers in Italy are going on strike, in a row over bonuses.... Mihir Kapadia, CEO of Sun Global Investments, is struck by the contrast between Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s latest growth figures and this month\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s eurozone PMIs: Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s has achieved a 0.4% growth rate in the last quarter, a respectable enough figure. However, UK business investment only rose by 0.2% in the last quarter, down from 0.5% in April-June which suggests that the growth rate is set to slow. Meanwhile over in Europe, the recovery of growth continues as France outpaced Germany, and the Eurozone posted its strongest growth in over six years. We expect the German economy to ride though the coalition crisis which is expected to lead to fresh elections.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The day after the UK budget is traditionally a time for the Institute of Fiscal Studies to explain what\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s really going on. And today, the IFS has torpedoed the suggestion that Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s era of austerity is over. There are plenty more cuts coming our way. IFS director Paul Johnston has also flagged up that Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy is expected to lag other nations over the next five years. He also rebutted some criticism of the decision to abolish stamp duty for first-time buyers purchasing homes under \u00c2\u00a3300,000: Andy Sparrow\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Politics Live blog has more details. Here are some charts from the Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s gender pay report. They showing how female staff at the bank receive smaller bonuses on average, as well as less basic pay. So, lots of work still to do. But as the Financial Times\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Sarah O\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Connor points out, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s worse elsewhere in the City.... Newsflash: The Bank of England has just released its gender pay gap. It shows that male staff at the UK central bank were paid 18.6% more than female colleagues this year (that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the mean gender pay gap for base pay). That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s down from 22% in 2013. Governor Mark Carney says he is confident that men and women at the Bank are paid equally for doing the same job. However, the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153greater proportion of men than women in senior roles creates a gender pay gap\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Rating agency Moody\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s has now weighed in, saying that Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s growth has \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcstabilised\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 in the last quarter. In a new report, Moody\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s says the Brexit vote has had a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153moderate negative impact\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd so far. They also predict that labour market growth will remain muted, and that inflation will peak in the next few months. Breaking: UK retail sales have bounced back this month after a shock slowdown in October. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s according to the CBI\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s survey of the sector, which found that clothing shops and grocers have enjoyed a pick-up in demand during November. Some 39% of shops questioned by the CBI reported that sales volumes were up on a year ago in November, while 13% said they were down, giving a balance of +26%. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a strong recovery from October\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s -36, which was the weakest balance since the last recession in March 2009. But it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not all good news - retailers are also laying off staff, and worried that trading will be tough next year. Rain Newton-Smith, CBI chief economist, remains cautious, saying: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s great to see retail sales rebound this month after a big dip, but let\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s be clear: our high streets are not out of the woods. Ahead of the crucial run up to Christmas, the weaker pound has pushed up prices and retailers are nervous about business conditions and are trimming their workforces. Jacob Deppe, head of trading at online trading platform, Infinox, can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t find much cheer in today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s UK growth update. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s second estimate of GDP confirms what we already know. Growth this year has slowed considerably as a result of the uncertainty caused by Brexit and is set to be 1.5% at best.... Anaemic growth looks here to stay for years to come at a time when the other major economies of the world are enjoying a boom. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153With business investment softening by 0.2% between July and September and productivity growth this decade forecast to be the worst for 205 years, there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s little joy to be found in the economy just over a month before Christmas.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Jeremy Cook, Chief Economist at WorldFirst, reckons British businesses are suffering from Brexit uncertainty, and the government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s failure to plan for the future better. Cook says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The UK economy owes everything to the overstretched consumer. GDP grew by 0.4% in Q3, with all of that growth coming from consumer spending. Business investment has slowed and trade subtracted 0.5% from overall growth. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This does not surprise us at WorldFirst given our latest Global Trade Barometer showed that as many as 1.1m fewer small businesses are trading internationally compared to this time last year. These businesses represent the back bone of the British economy and are being held back by uncertainty over future trade relations, poor productivity and an incoherent industrial strategy from Westminster.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Kallum Pickering of Berenberg bank says household spending is being supported by debt, helping to prop growth up. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s his take on the GDP figures: Despite the Brexit driven temporary real wage squeeze caused by rising import prices, households are still coping well. Private consumption growth accelerated to 0.6% quarter-on-quarter from 0.2%. Sterling has fallen by c12% on a trade-weighted basis since the Brexit vote in June 2016. Households are smoothing their real consumption by borrowing a little more and saving a little less for a while until real wages begin to rise again \u00e2\u20ac\u201c probably early next year. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s growth figures confirm that Britain is lagging behind its major European rivals. Germany, for example, grew twice as fast in the last three months - expanding by a healthy 0.8%. Dennis de Jong, managing director at UFX.com, says British growth remains \u00e2\u20ac\u0153below par\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. The economy keeps chugging along, but comfortably at the slowest rate in the G7, and Britain is in danger of being left behind. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153After a number of growth forecast downgrades in Chancellor Philip Hammond\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Budget speech, we may need to face up to the fact that the situation isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t going to get better any time soon. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Inflation is up, but productivity and wage growth are down, which means there is far less money in the average Brit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pocket. After Hammond announced a further \u00c2\u00a390bn worth of borrowing, the squeeze is only going to continue \u00e2\u20ac\u201c worrying times for the man on the street.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Economics journalist Dharshini David is also concerned by the breakdown of the GDP report: Disappointingly, UK business investment only rose by 0.2% in the last quarter, down from 0.5% in April-June. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the weakest quarterly growth since the end of 2016. It suggests that firms are reluctant to spend on new machinery and equipment in the current uncertain economic climate. This is a worrying sign, as business spending is a key driver of productivity growth. The new GDP figures also show that net trade had a negative impact on UK growth. But, household spending actually picked up, according to the Office for National Statistics. It says: The rate of growth in household final consumption expenditure strengthened to 0.6% between Quarter 2 and Quarter 3 2017, with car purchases recovering somewhat from a low Quarter 2. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s film industry also had a good quarter: Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s industrial base was stronger than expected in the last three months, but builders had a bad quarter. The Office for National Statistics has revised up its estimate for industrial production growth, from 1% to 1.1%, in July-September. BUT, it has also revised construction output down to -0.9%, from -0.7%. Service sector output is unchanged, at +0.4%. Newsflash: Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s growth rate in the last quarter has been confirmed at 0.4%, in line with the first estimate of GDP. Now onto the details.... The strength of growth in the eurozone is a stark contrast with Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s weakening economy. Julien Lafargue, global investment strategist at JP Morgan, says Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy looks strong - meaning he favours owning share in European companies rather than UK ones. Lafargue explains: The economic momentum remains very supportive in the Eurozone. With the rate of backlog accumulation rising despite companies hiring at the fastest pace in years, we expect to see further investments to boost production capacity. This in turn should support growth in the region and extend the cycle. Within the EU, this trend is in stark contrast with the picture depicted yesterday by the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Chancellor and the Office for Budget responsibility which lowered UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s GDP growth forecasts for every year until 2021. Given this strong economic backdrop in the Eurozone vs. a UK budget that offered little in the form of stimulus, we continue to prefer Continental European equities. Boom! Eurozone companies are enjoying their strongest month since April 2011. The latest survey from data firm Markit shows that Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s recovery strengthened, with companies reporting a surge in output and hiring. This pushed Markit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s composite PMI - a health check on companies across Europe - to 57.5, the highest in six and a half years. France had a particularly strong month, outpacing Germany for only the fourth time in over five years. German growth remained strong too, though, suggesting its economy can ride out the coalition crisis that could lead to fresh elections soon. Chris Williamson, Chief Business Economist at IHS Markit says \u00e2\u20ac\u0153business is booming\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in Europe, led by manufacturing. Growth kicked higher in November to put the region on course for its best quarter since the start of 2011. The PMI is so far running at a level signalling a 0.8% increase in GDP in the final quarter of 2017, which would round-off the best year for a decade. Jobs are being created at the fastest rate since the dot-com boom, yet despite this increase in operating capacity firms are struggling to meet demand. Backlogs of uncompleted work are growing at the fastest rate for over a decade, often resulting in a sellers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 market as customers struggle to source goods and services. Prices are consequently rising at an increased rate. Newsflash: The UK is on course for the longest fall in living standards since records began in the 1950s. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s according to the Resolution Foundation, whose analysts must have worked late into the night crunching yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Budget, and the verdict of the Office for Budget Responsibility. Resolution have found that the fall in living standards which began in 2015 will continue until 2020 - even longer than after the financial crisis: It also warned that Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s productivity is the worst since the Battle of Borodino. On a ten-year rolling basis, productivity growth is set to fall to 0.1 per cent by the end of 2017, marking this as the worst decade for productivity growth since 1812 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c when Napoleon was busy invading Russia. As a result the economy is on course to be \u00c2\u00a342bn smaller in 2022, compared to the March 2017 forecast. More here: Philip Hammond is touring the nation\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s TV and radio stations this morning, defending the budget. On Radio 4, the chancellor was grilled about productivity; Q: Our productivity is still desperate. We have not been able to get a grip on it. You have been in power for seven years. Why haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t you done something about this? Hammond says the country was facing a fiscal and economic crisis after the crash. Q: That was 10 years ago. Hammond says, as soon as the government could start investing again, it did so. He put more capital investment in yesterday. Over this parliament the government will be spending \u00c2\u00a325bn more on capital investment than under Labour. Q: But people want to know you understand why productivity is so low. You don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t seem to understand. Hammond says there is a debate about this among economists. But we know the reasons. British businesses have less capital investment per worker than their competitors. Infrastructure spending is low, and skill levels are low. Q: So why aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t you doing something about it? We are, says Hammond. He says too few people have maths qualifications. He is investing in maths teaching. But that is a generational change. It will take years for the benefits to come through. He says it is tempting for politicians to use the money for short-term fixes. But he wants to focus on measures that will deliver improvements over decades. That is what countries like Germany do. Andy Sparrow\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Politics Live blog has full details: Centrica\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s slide has helped to pull the London stock market into the red. The FTSE 100 is down 36 points, or 0.5%, in early trading. Other European market are also in the red; exporters are suffering because the US dollar fell last night, after America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s central bank sounded cautious about inflation prospects. Over in the City, shares in energy supplier Centrica have plunged by 15%. British Gas\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s parent company has revealed it lost 823,000 customer in the four months between June and October. It has also admitted that earnings will miss market expectations this year. It blamed lower than expected adjusted operating profit in North America and the UK. Centrica also warned that: We are also reflecting the expected impact of warmer than normal weather across October and November. That sent traders scrambling to sell shares at the start of trading, sending Centrica down 26p to 136.7p. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a 14-year low, and the biggest daily tumble in 20 years. Yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s productivity downgrades are a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcSuez moment\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 for the UK economy, says our economics editor Larry Elliott. He writes: It is now more than 10 years since the start of the financial crisis and the OBR\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s gloomy outlook marks the moment when Britain has to stop kidding itself. Growth is not going to return to its pre-crash levels. The 21% gap between output per hour now and where it would have been had it remained on its pre-2007 path is never going to be closed. Britain is substantially and permanently poorer. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. We got a worrying glimpse into Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economic future yesterday. Philip Hammond\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s autumn budget came laced with growth downgrades, forcing another \u00c2\u00a390bn of borrowing over the next few years. As feared, the experts at the Office for Budget Responsibility threw in the towel over the health of the UK economy, conceding that we won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t return to the pre-crisis productivity growth of around 2% per year. Productivity growth is now expected to only average 1.4% - including just 0.9% this year. A dire outlook. Economist and politicians will continue to probe the budget today, kicking the tires of policies such as the (criticised) stamp duty reform for first time buyers, (limited) universal credit changes and the rise in the personal tax allowance (which will benefit high earners the most). Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy will still be in the spotlight this morning; we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re getting the second estimate of UK growth in the third quarter of 2017. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s likely to confirm that growth chugged along at just 0.4% in July to September. These figures will give a better insight into the economy, showing how government spending, personal consumption and business investment changed during the quarter. Analysts at Royal Bank of Canada say: Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s second estimate of UK Q3 GDP isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t expected to result in a revision to the first estimate of 0.4% q/q expansion. Since that preliminary estimate, the incoming information has revealed industrial production to have been stronger than initially thought and construction to be even weaker. The expenditure breakdown becomes available on this occasion. The contribution of consumer spending has been weakening in 2017 and, having seen some of the early indicators of retail activity for October coming in on the soft side, we would caution against reading too much into any potential improvement in Q3 as far as consumption is concerned. In the City, energy firm Centrica, wine supplier Majestic Wine and retailer Mothercare are all reporting results. Plus, fresh data will show how Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s private sector and Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shops are faring this month. The agenda 9am: Flash estimate of eurozone private sector growth this month, 9.30am: Second estimate of UK GDP in the third quarter of 2017 11am: CBI survey of UK retail sales in November",

Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The prospect of political progress in Germany buoyed the euro on Friday afternoon, while the dollar continued to move lower.</p> <p>The news that Angela Merkel and her CDU-CSU party are set to meet with their former Social Democrat coalition partners acted as a pick me up for the euro, which surged 0.6% to a 2 month high against the dollar, while taking another 0.3% off the pound, pushing sterling to its worst price in more than a week. These gains took the edge off the DAX\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s own growth, with a 1% lunchtime surge halving to 0.5%; still, this keeps the German index above 13000, a level its struggled with for the past few sessions.</p> <p>As for the dollar, its drop against the euro was joined by a 0.4% decline against the pound, with cable climbing above $1.335 to hit its best price since the start of October. There are a few things dragging the greenback lower: a pair of weaker than forecast flash manufacturing and services PMIs; Wednesday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s cautious Fed meeting minutes, which cast doubt not on a December rate rise, but the pace of any subsequent hikes; and a series of bearish notes from analysts, including those at Nomura and Morgan Stanley. Add on a Thanksgiving hangover and it was a grey Black Friday for the currency.</p> <p>The FTSE, meanwhile, continued to trail its peers \u00e2\u20ac\u201c not just the Eurozone, but the Dow Jones, which rose 0.2% after the bell \u00e2\u20ac\u201c dipping 0.1% as the day went on.

Current PMI readings are broadly consistent with GDP growing at an annualised rate of just over 2%.</p> <p>There was also good news on hiring, with a slight uptick in employment growth meaning the surveys are indicating non-farm payroll growth of just over 200,000 in November.</p> <p>Both input costs and selling price inflation picked up, suggesting the upturn is feeding though to higher price pressures, though some of the manufacturing price hikes were attributable to the short-term effects of the hurricane-related supply chain disruptions.</p> <p>An upturn in new order inflows means we can expect a strong end to the year, though prospects for 2018 remain more mixed. Although expectations about the year ahead slipped lower in the service sector, future optimism hit a two-year high in manufacturing, suggesting the goods-producing sector may start to make a stronger contribution to the economy in coming months.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2017-11-24T15:04:41.550Z\">at 3.04pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5a1831ba7b0a7b06af591196\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-11-24T14:50:41.296Z\">2.50pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/ReutersBiz/status/934065376211677184\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">JUST IN: Macy&#39;s shares extend premarket gains after CEO&#39;s comments on holiday sales on CNBC, now up 3.5 percent <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%24M&amp;src=ctag&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">$M</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/cOUsHCYoiZ\">pic.twitter.com/cOUsHCYoiZ</a></p>&mdash; Reuters Business (@ReutersBiz) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ReutersBiz/status/934065376211677184?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">November 24, 2017</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5a182f077b0a7b06af591189\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-11-24T14:41:55.137Z\">2.41pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Wall Street opens higher</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>After a day off for Thanksgiving, US markets have started off in a positive mood.</p> <p>Helped by higher oil prices and rising retail shares on Black Friday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 37 points or 0.16% while the S&amp;P 500 opened 0.17% higher and the Nasdaq Composite added 0.13%.

We also note the persistence of a wider differential of $6 per barrel (/bbl) between Brent and WTI recently, although we believe this differential is likely to be nominally smaller in 2018. We base our long-term price assumptions mostly on fundamental analysis including assessments of the marginal cost of oil and gas production, as well as supply and demand fundamentals, for example</p> <p> We continue to expect Brent and WTI to be range-bound in 2018. We note that Brent has been trading above $60/bbl since Oct. 27, 2017, having closed at that price on Sept. 25 for the first time since July 2015. As present, futures prices remain above $60/bbl until November 2018. We believe the price increases reflect ongoing OPEC production cuts, supply disruptions, and temporary production declines as well as positive market sentiment about demand. Shipments from northern Iraq were reportedly lower in October and production from several other regions was down as well.

The US markets were helped by a strong performance from Amazon on Black Friday sales hopes. On that note, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time to close for the day. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be back on Monday. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the latest Barclaycard update on Black Friday, and there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s another new record. So far there has been an 8% increase in the amount spent compared to the same day last year, and Barclaycard processed a record 998 transactions a second between 1pm and 2pm. That beats the previous record of 976 set an hour earlier.

A stronger euro has seen European markets come off their best levels, while a rise in the pound against the dollar has left the FTSE 100 lingering in negative territory. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said: The prospect of political progress in Germany buoyed the euro on Friday afternoon, while the dollar continued to move lower. The news that Angela Merkel and her CDU-CSU party are set to meet with their former Social Democrat coalition partners acted as a pick me up for the euro, which surged 0.6% to a 2 month high against the dollar, while taking another 0.3% off the pound, pushing sterling to its worst price in more than a week. These gains took the edge off the DAX\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s own growth, with a 1% lunchtime surge halving to 0.5%; still, this keeps the German index above 13000, a level its struggled with for the past few sessions. As for the dollar, its drop against the euro was joined by a 0.4% decline against the pound, with cable climbing above $1.335 to hit its best price since the start of October. There are a few things dragging the greenback lower: a pair of weaker than forecast flash manufacturing and services PMIs; Wednesday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s cautious Fed meeting minutes, which cast doubt not on a December rate rise, but the pace of any subsequent hikes; and a series of bearish notes from analysts, including those at Nomura and Morgan Stanley. Add on a Thanksgiving hangover and it was a grey Black Friday for the currency. The FTSE, meanwhile, continued to trail its peers \u00e2\u20ac\u201c not just the Eurozone, but the Dow Jones, which rose 0.2% after the bell \u00e2\u20ac\u201c dipping 0.1% as the day went on. Multiple times this year the UK index has got trapped around the 7400 mark, with the FTSE facing a momentum-less run in to Christmas. The weaker than expected US data has undermined the dollar. The pound is now up 0.35% against the US currency at $1.3351, while the euro is also strengthening against the greenback: Dennis de Jong, managing director of UFX.com, said: Donald Trump and his economic advisors will be concerned with the latest Markit survey coming in below expectations, after what has been a fairly robust upward trajectory since the start of the year. The president has had some significant knockbacks in implementing promised infrastructure plans, and it would be no surprise to see him continue to lay the blame with foreign firms undercutting the US sector. US industry has lost global market share in recent years, with labour-intensive, low-cost countries and knowledge-based, tech-led economies picking US jobs off at both ends of the manufacturing spectrum. Policy makers, not to mention the president himself, will be looking to address this as a priority. US manufacturing slipped back in November but still showed a strong level of growth, according to the latest snapshot. The IHS Market initial manufacturing PMI came in at 53.8, down from 54.6 in October and below expectations of a rise to 54.8. The services PMI fell from 55.3 to 54.7 in November while the composite PMI dipped from 55.2 to 54.6. Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit said: US businesses reported another month of solid growth in November, putting the economy on course for a reasonable, though by no means stellar, fourth quarter. Current PMI readings are broadly consistent with GDP growing at an annualised rate of just over 2%. There was also good news on hiring, with a slight uptick in employment growth meaning the surveys are indicating non-farm payroll growth of just over 200,000 in November. Both input costs and selling price inflation picked up, suggesting the upturn is feeding though to higher price pressures, though some of the manufacturing price hikes were attributable to the short-term effects of the hurricane-related supply chain disruptions. An upturn in new order inflows means we can expect a strong end to the year, though prospects for 2018 remain more mixed. Although expectations about the year ahead slipped lower in the service sector, future optimism hit a two-year high in manufacturing, suggesting the goods-producing sector may start to make a stronger contribution to the economy in coming months. After a day off for Thanksgiving, US markets have started off in a positive mood. Helped by higher oil prices and rising retail shares on Black Friday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 37 points or 0.16% while the S&amp;P 500 opened 0.17% higher and the Nasdaq Composite added 0.13%. Both the S&amp;P and Nasdaq have hit new peaks. According to Barclaycard, there has been a 4% increase in the amount spent on debit and credit cards by 1pm today compared to last Black Friday. That includes high street and online sales, and also other spending such as buying a pint of milk. With sales picking up as the day progresses after a slow start, Barclaycard also says it processed a record 976 transactions a second between 12pm and 1pm. Last year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122a Black Friday peak was 791 transactions per second. Paulette Rowe, managing director of Barclaycard Payment Solutions, said: Early data suggests that shoppers have once again embraced Black Friday, with many taking advantage of the discounts on offer. The value spent is growing at a slightly slower rate than the number of transactions, indicating consumers may be opting to buy more goods at a lower price rather than investing in a handful of higher-value items. Nevertheless, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcso far, so normal\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 on the high street and retailers will likely be encouraged by the results. Back with Black Friday, and here is a gallery of pictures from around the world: Meanwhile US retail shares are moving higher in premarket trading ahead of the official Wall Street opening, with Macy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s up 1.1%, J C Penney 2.5% better and Best Buy 0.9% better. Oil prices are on the rise ahead of a key Opec meeting next week. Brent crude is up 0.19% to $63.67 a barrel, while West Texas Intermediate jumped nearly 1.5% to a more than two year high of $58.91. Part of the increase is due to the partial shutdown of a pipeline linking Canada with the US after an oil spill, reducing the usual 590,000 barrels a day supply. Meanwhile the Opec meeting is widely expected to extend its agreement to curb supplies beyond the original March end date, although Russia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s position on the idea is a little unclear. Analysts at S&amp;P have raised their 2018 price target for Brent crude to $55 a barrel but kept their WTI target at $50, saying, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We anticipate that global oil supply is likely to broadly match consumption in the first half of 2018, assuming the Opec cuts are maintained.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd S&amp;P added: We recognize the typical volatility of these market indicators, as demonstrated during 2017. We also note the persistence of a wider differential of $6 per barrel (/bbl) between Brent and WTI recently, although we believe this differential is likely to be nominally smaller in 2018. We base our long-term price assumptions mostly on fundamental analysis including assessments of the marginal cost of oil and gas production, as well as supply and demand fundamentals, for example We continue to expect Brent and WTI to be range-bound in 2018. We note that Brent has been trading above $60/bbl since Oct. 27, 2017, having closed at that price on Sept. 25 for the first time since July 2015. As present, futures prices remain above $60/bbl until November 2018. We believe the price increases reflect ongoing OPEC production cuts, supply disruptions, and temporary production declines as well as positive market sentiment about demand. Shipments from northern Iraq were reportedly lower in October and production from several other regions was down as well. However, we assume these specific supply issues will be addressed in coming months. What\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s more, we believe that continuing production growth may marginally exceed consumption growth in 2018. Tucking into some lunch at your desk, perhaps after a dash to Pret or Greggs? If so (and even if not!), then get your teeth into the history of Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s UK sandwich industry. Guardian Long Read: How the sandwich consumed Britain Honestly, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a great read. Over in Germany, Amazon workers have gone on strike in protest against pay at the e-commerce giant. The walkout has hit half a dozen Amazon distribution sites in Germany, as staff demand better wages. Workers at its main distribution hub in Italy are also on strike, potentially disrupting activities on Black Friday. Associated Press has more details: In Germany, Ver.di union spokesman Thomas Voss said some 2,500 workers were on strike at Amazon facilities in Bad Hersfeld, Leipzig, Rheinberg, Werne, Graben and Koblenz. In a warehouse near Piacenza, in northern Italy, some workers walked off the job to demand \u00e2\u20ac\u0153dignified salaries.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The German union has been leading a push since 2013 for higher pay for some 12,000 workers in Germany, arguing Amazon employees receive lower wages than others in retail and mail-order jobs. Amazon says its distribution warehouses in Germany are logistics centers and employees earn relatively high wages for that industry. The strikes in Germany are expected to end Saturday. The Italian action, a one-day strike, was hailed by one of the nation\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s umbrella union leaders, the UIL\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Carmelo Barbagallo, as having \u00e2\u20ac\u0153enormous symbolic value because it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s clear that progress, innovation and modernity can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t come at the expense and the interests of workers.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Here are more photos, from the city of Leipzig today: If you are risking Black Friday, know your rights! Hannah Maundrell, Editor in Chief of money.co.uk, explains: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Be a savvy shopper instead of a bargain hunter. Work out a plan of attack: make a list, set a budget and hunt for the cheapest place to buy. Never checkout without checking if you can save even more with a voucher code \u00e2\u20ac\u201c often found by signing up to newsletters or on retailer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s social media sites. If you buy something online which you find cheaper elsewhere next week, don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t worry, you have 14 days to return it and get a full refund no questions asked. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Double check your refund rights before you part with your cash and if you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re buying something that costs over \u00c2\u00a3100, pay with a credit card because you can go to your credit card company for a refund if something goes wrong. The drop in UK consumer confidence comes as people in America and the rest of Europe are feeling more optimistic. This chart, from Kallum Pickering of Berenberg, shows how UK consumer morale has fallen behind other advanced economies recently: Pickering says: After eight years of a recovery that had occasionally been punctured by the euro crisis, a hiccup in emerging markets and gyrations in oil prices, households are becoming increasingly confident. Consumer confidence in the US and the Eurozone has risen above pre-Lehman peaks, with the Brexit-stricken UK serving as the exception to the rule. Even in the UK, where households are suffering from a temporary real wage squeeze due to the Brexit-related drop in trade-weighted sterling and the resulting rise in import costs, consumer confidence remains broadly in line with its long-term average. Economist Sam Tombs has analysed this morning\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s mortgage approval figures, and concluded that the market is cooling.... Despite the entertaining lack of a rush on Oxford Street at 7am, Currys PC World says its having its busiest Black Friday ever - on the Internet. Online traffic via mobile devices is up 14% on last year, apparently, with TV and gaming consoles particularly popular. Robert Gordon, CEO of Hitachi Capital, isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t surprised that UK consumers are more pessimistic: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Job security, stagnating pay and rising inflation are all putting the squeeze on consumers, so it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no surprise that consumer confidence has dipped to a new low Black Friday couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have come quickly enough for retailers, and it will be interesting to see if the weekend\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sales are as robust this year as they have been in previous years. The Financial Times has spotted that UK households withdrew money from their tax-free savings accounts at the fastest rate on record in October. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s another sign that people are feeling the pinch, as falling real wages continue to bite. The FT\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Nicholas Megaw explains: New data from UK Finance suggest households have been saving less and borrowing more in an effort to maintain spending habits in the face of rising prices and falling real wages. The total amount held in cash ISA accounts fell by \u00c2\u00a31.5bn, the sixth straight month of declines and the biggest monthly withdrawal on record in data going back to 2006. UK shoppers are right to be wary of Black Friday \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcbargains\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, according to industry experts. Gemma Butler, associate director of marketing at the Chartered Institute of Marketing, says \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcwise consumers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 will keep their wallets and purses closed. She warns: Widespread price fluctuation, fraud risk and misreporting of prices are understandably of concern to consumers, whilst the pressure to offer incredible deals does seem to have led some marketers to abandon best practice. Black Friday? Slack Friday, more like. It appears that UK shoppers (sensibly) decided to stay in bed rather than queue in the dark to pick up some bargains. On Oxford Street in London, one solitary shopper hovered nervously outside Curry\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s PC World, before the doors were flung open with a flourish. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a similar scene online, as my colleague Sarah Butler explains: The number of shoppers online between midnight and 7am dived 24% on last year according to e-commerce trends service PCA Predict after an 11% rise in shopping over the previous week. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This longer sales period has shifted the emphasis away from Black Friday being a major retail event in its own right, towards becoming part of a pre-Christmas mini season or \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Golden Quarter\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd for retailers,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Chris Boaz, \u00e2\u20ac\ufffdhead of marketing of PCA Predict. Evidence of a slow start in the UK to the US-inspired discount day, was also seen on the high street as retail experts pointed empty stores at chains which had opened early to prepare for queues of bargain hunters. Quite a contrast with three years ago, when there were scuffles at branches of Tesco and Sainsbury as customers scrambled for a bargain. High street chain Next doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t seem to be taking Black Friday terribly seriously either... Just in: UK mortgage approvals have hit their lowest level since September 2016. Banks approved 40,488 loans for house purchases in October, down from 41,576 in September. However, there was a big jump in the number of households who remortgaged their homes, ahead of this month\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s interest rate rise. Credit card lending growth also slowed, , in another sign that UK people are being more cautious about economic prospects. German business confidence has jumped again, in a sign that the European recovery is sizzling away. In a stark contrast with Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s worried consumers, bosses in Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest economy are very upbeat despite the collapse of coalition talks this month. The monthly gauge of German business confidence leaped to 117.5 this month, the highest level in many decades. Firms\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 expectations of current conditions dipped a little, but they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re very optimistic about their future prospects. Ifo chief Clemens Fuest says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Sentiment among German businesses is very strong,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This was due to far more optimistic business expectations. The German economy is on track for a boom.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd UK retailer Sports Direct has called a shareholder meeting, to vote on whether to pay \u00c2\u00a311m to the brother of founder Mike Ashley. An internal review of links between Sports Direct and John Ashley has concluded that he had actually been underpaid for several years. John Ashley\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s company, Barlin, was paid by Sports Direct to handle deliveries overseas. That arrangement was ended earlier this year, amid concern over corporate governance at Sports Direct. However, the review into the links found that John Ashley had unfairly missed out on significant bonuses and pay awards. Mike Ashley plans to abstain on the vote, and says he actually expects independent shareholders to oppose the payout. But to him, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a matter of principle.... It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s important for me to say that if John had owed \u00c2\u00a31 to Sports Direct, I would have ensured any sum was repaid in full. I hope shareholders will therefore be reassured that everything is in order and that any concerns are laid to rest.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The meeting is on 13th December, at Sports Direct\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s headquarters in Shirebrook. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not much drama in the European stock markets this morning. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE 100 has dropped by 15 points, or 0.2%. With excellent timing, Bank of England policymaker Silvana Tenreyro has said that future interest rate moves will largely be dictated by Brexit. In an interview with Bloomberg, Tenreyro explained that nothing could be ruled out in the Brexit era - a hint that rate cuts or hikes could be on the agenda. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153People up until recently thought that Brexit meant monetary policy would remain highly accommodative and interest rates would stay low forever. But Brexit might present other challenges that require the opposite. It might require an adjustment either way, and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not obvious. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s something to be prepared for.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Tenreyro, who joined the Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Monetary Policy Committee this summer, also explained that the MPC doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know how the economy will react to Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s exit from the EU. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Brexit will likely affect the supply side of the economy,. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know how the demand side will respond. It depends on how households and companies react to the new normal, to the new potential. Shocks can hit the economy one way or the other and we will have to respond to that.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd UK consumers won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t feel any more confident after reading today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s front pages. Several newspapers are leading on yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s warning that Britain face a two-decade long pay squeeze. The Institute for Fiscal Studies reckons that we will be earning around \u00c2\u00a3750 per year less in 2022-23 than in 2007-08, in real terms (adjusted for inflation). As economics editor Larry Elliott put it: Unless the economy performs better than expected, the IFS now thinks Britain is in danger of losing not just one, but getting on for two decades of earnings growth. This would be the equivalent of earnings being lower when John Major left Downing Street in 1997 than when Margaret Thatcher began 18 years of Conservative rule in 1979. Historically, it is without precedent. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s survey shows a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153big decline\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in UK consumer confidence this month, according to Stephen Harmston, head of YouGov reports. Harmston adds: There have been falls across the board \u00e2\u20ac\u201c from how secure people feel in their jobs to what they think house prices will do \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and the increased cost of living has put a big squeeze on people\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s household finances. Overall, these are a gloomy set of consumer confidence figures.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd This chart confirms that people are becoming edgier, particularly about their own household finances. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. UK consumers are feeling at their gloomiest since the immediate aftermath of the EU referendum last June. Pessimism is mounting over household finances, property prices, job security and business activity, according to a new survey from YouGov and the Centre for Economics and Business Research. Their monthly index of consumer confidence dropped sharply this month, from 109.3 to just 106.6. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the same level as immediately after the Brexit vote, and the first monthly fall since June 2017. Christian Jaccarini, economist at the CEBR, says consumer confidence suffered a series of blows this month, including the Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision to raise interest rates to 0.5%. The first interest rate hike in over a decade triggered fears that higher borrowing costs will compound the inflation-induced squeeze on household incomes. Simultaneously, higher rates and a housing market in slowdown are warning signals for many homeowners, who fear house price growth may be further dampened. With these economic headwinds set to persist, and the OBR forecasting a weaker growth, households are understandably worried.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd With these storm clouds gathering, shoppers may be reluctant to splash out in the sales today. That would be a blow to retailers who are pinning their hopes on a good Black Friday.

                "bodyText":"Shoppers will splash out more than \u00c2\u00a32.5bn on Black Friday deals, as the UK continues its affair with the US-inspired discount day. Sales will continue over the weekend with \u00c2\u00a37.3bn expected to be spent between Friday morning and Monday night according to the Centre for Retail Research and the Vouchercodes website. A fifth more people are expected to hit the high street than on a normal Friday, according to ShopperTrak, but most of the action takes place online in this country, with shoppers choosing to bargain hunt from under the duvet using their phone or laptop rather than queueing up outside stores in the early hours. Spending is expected to be up this year as more stores join the event, but experts say bargains may be harder to find as stores battle rising costs and inflation.Moneysavingexpert.com advises shopping around and researching the items you want to buy rather than relying on discount promises from retailers. They may be offering \u00e2\u20ac\u015370% off\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd their own price, but it doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t mean the same item isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t cheaper elsewhere. Sticking to a shopping list of items you actually want, using price tracker tools such as Camelcamelcamel and watching out for discount codes are also a good idea. Finally, be wary of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153too good to be true\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd prices \u00e2\u20ac\u201c quite possibly they are \u00e2\u20ac\u201c so carefully check terms and conditions and buyer reviews for sites you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve not used before offering very cheap prices.

Risk appetite remains healthy in the US but subdued in the UK and Europe, and once again it is strength in the home currencies arising from dollar weakness that is helping to stifle what looked like a strong session earlier in the day. The other big worry, particularly for the FTSE 100\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s mining contingent, is a notable tightening of financial conditions in China; while rising bond yields might not seem like a reason to worry, a hit to corporate profits could feed through to the broader economy and thus raise questions about demand for raw materials in 2018. The great mining rally has recovered from its wobble in the first half of the year, but assuming demand remains healthy this weakness could be a chance to pick up some big miners on the cheap.</p> \n   <p>US stocks are back to normal today, with the recovery from Thanksgiving overindulgence complete. Tax reform looks a bit less of a done deal today, and it is strange to see the market so blissfully unconcerned. Perhaps it is the thought of a festive rally into year-end that is keeping them stable, or perhaps they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re hoping Mr Trump will pull a rabbit out of the hat. Either way, as we head into the final month of the year a sudden pullback due to tax reform worries offers the dip-buyers their best hope.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5a1c368157470105e9573cd4\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-11-27T16:02:31.817Z\">4.02pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Earlier the Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chief economist Andy Haldane gave a speech at a Birmingham school about the importance of economics to the general public:</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/bankofengland/status/935175997925855232\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">In his latest speech our Chief Economist, Andy Haldane, discusses why economics can be a turn-off for most people and how our new approach to \"communication, conversation and education\" aims to tackle that. <a href=\"https://t.co/e9Iq1vSbfG\">https://t.co/e9Iq1vSbfG</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/m2fWrZSe85\">pic.twitter.com/m2fWrZSe85</a></p>\u00e2\u20ac\u201d Bank of England (@bankofengland) \n    <a href=\"https://twitter.com/bankofengland/status/935175997925855232?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">November 27, 2017</a>\n   </blockquote> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5a1c2df99ab3f2056cb1c2e2\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-11-27T15:25:17.310Z\">3.25pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>European markets have not been able to keep pace with their US counterparts, and are marginally in the red as we head towards the last hour or so of trading.

                "bodyText":"US markets may be hitting new highs but it is a more downbeat picture in Europe. Dollar weakness lifting the euro and the pound has hit the main European markets, while Wall Street is benefiting from the currency movements and investor hopes that the Republicans are making progress with their tax returns. The final scores in Europe showed: The FTSE 100 finished down 25.74 points or 0.35% lower at 7383.90 Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax dipped 0.46% to 13,000.20 France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac closed down 0.56% at 5360.09 Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB fell 1.07% to 22,176.70 But Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ibex edged up 0.1% to 10,063.1 In Greece, the Athens market added 0.17% to 724.39 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 26 points or 0.11%. And bitcoin is 2.5% better at $9509. On that note, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time to close for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be back tomorrow. Oil is on the slide ahead of this Thursday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meeting of Opec, despite talk that the producers will extend their output cut to try and curb oversupply and protect the price. David Madden at CMC Markets says: WTI and Brent Crude oil are in the red today after having a positive run recently ahead of the OPEC meeting on Thursday. There is speculation that major oil producers will extend the oil production cut until the end of 2018. Some dealers feel a lot of that is already priced in and are exiting their long positions ahead of the meeting in Vienna. The US shale producers will be paying close attention to OPEC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision, as a surge in the energy market could prompt higher production in the shale sector \u00e2\u20ac\u201c which could counteract OPEC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision. Brent crude is currently down 0.8% at $63.33 a barrel while West Texas Intermediate is 2% lower at $57.7. Bitcoin, by the way, is currently up 4% at $9647, although down from its earlier peak of $9721. More on the markets. Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at IG, said: Another day, another record high in the Dow Jones, which is playing catch-up with the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq after those indices hit fresh records last week. Risk appetite remains healthy in the US but subdued in the UK and Europe, and once again it is strength in the home currencies arising from dollar weakness that is helping to stifle what looked like a strong session earlier in the day. The other big worry, particularly for the FTSE 100\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s mining contingent, is a notable tightening of financial conditions in China; while rising bond yields might not seem like a reason to worry, a hit to corporate profits could feed through to the broader economy and thus raise questions about demand for raw materials in 2018. The great mining rally has recovered from its wobble in the first half of the year, but assuming demand remains healthy this weakness could be a chance to pick up some big miners on the cheap. US stocks are back to normal today, with the recovery from Thanksgiving overindulgence complete. Tax reform looks a bit less of a done deal today, and it is strange to see the market so blissfully unconcerned. Perhaps it is the thought of a festive rally into year-end that is keeping them stable, or perhaps they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re hoping Mr Trump will pull a rabbit out of the hat. Either way, as we head into the final month of the year a sudden pullback due to tax reform worries offers the dip-buyers their best hope. Earlier the Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chief economist Andy Haldane gave a speech at a Birmingham school about the importance of economics to the general public: European markets have not been able to keep pace with their US counterparts, and are marginally in the red as we head towards the last hour or so of trading. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said: Monday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been a pretty scatty, aimless day of trading, with the European indices reversing their lunchtime reversal. Once again the FTSE finds itself back below 7400, falling 20 points having been up by that same amount at midday (and having been down by that same amount just after the bell). The pound\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 0.1% rise against both the dollar and the euro likely didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t help, with cable briefly striking a fresh 8 week peak. However the brunt of the FTSE\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decline appears to be coming from the commodity and banking sectors. BP and Shell haven fallen 0.9% apiece as Brent Crude slipped around 1% as it eyes Wednesday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s OPEC meeting, with the miners stranded in a sea of red. The smattering of losses coating the likes of Barclays, Lloyds and RBS, meanwhile, comes ahead of tomorrow\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stress test results. In the Eurozone the DAX and CAX followed the same pattern as the FTSE, flitting in and out of the red before settling at a loss this afternoon. The German index is down 0.1% despite signs of political progress in Germany, while its French peer fell 0.2%. As for the Dow Jones, it surged 0.3% this Cyber Monday, crossing 23600 to hit a brand spanking new all-time peak. For those keeping track, the index has rocketed nearly 20% higher since the start of the year (it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s even more if you trace its rise back to Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s election). Following the strong US housing figures, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has moved sharply higher and has now also hit a new peak. It is now up 0.3% at 23,628. Some strong housing data from the US. New home sales jumped 6.2% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 685,000 in October, the highest level in ten years. New home sales have increased for three straight months, although September\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s figures was revised down from 667,000 to 645,000. Economists had been expected sales to fall 6% to 625,000 in October. No comment: Another day and more records for US markets. Helped by gains for retail shares on Cyber Monday, the S&amp;P 500 has edged up to a new peak of 2604, while the Nasdaq Composite is at a record 6890. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is below the heights reached last week but is still up 0.13% on the day at 23,587. Back with non-cryptocurrencies, and the dollar is slipping back on suggestions that a US rate hike in December may be the last for a while, given last week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Federal Reserve minutes showed some reluctance to push borrowing costs too high. So the pound has added 0.3% against the US currency to $1.3382, an eight week high. Michael Hewson at CMC Markets said of the dollar: While a December rate move remains a done deal in the eyes of the markets, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s what comes after that which is becoming less clear. There were positive views about the jobs market as well as general economic activity across the board, but there were diverging views about the lack of inflation, and it is this uncertainty about US rate policy in 2018 which continues to undermine the currency against the backdrop of a flattening yield curve. Back in the world of shopping, and US retail companies are seeing share price gains in premarket trading, following Black Friday and during Cyber Monday. JC Penney is up 1.8%, Target is 1% better, Macy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s is 1.1% better and the unstoppable Amazon has added 0.5%. What do central banks think of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Bloomberg has done a roundup of views: Eight years since the birth of bitcoin, central banks around the world are increasingly recognizing the potential upsides and downsides of digital currencies. The guardians of the global economy have two sets of issues to address. First is what to do, if anything, about emergence and growth of the private cryptocurrencies that are grabbing more and more attention -- with bitcoin now surging toward $10,000. The second question is whether to issue official versions. The reaction is mixed, with some warning of the dangers while others - including the Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Mark Carney - seeing it as a potential revolution. The full report is here. European stock markets are subdued today, following the selloff in China overnight. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE 100, the German DAX and the French CAC are all down by between 0.1 and 0.3%, as the pound and the euro gain against the US dollar. Rebecca O\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Keeffe, Head of Investment at interactive investor, says: European markets are tracking Asia lower, as fears grow that Chinese equities could be starting one of their downward legs, which may cause fright for global investors. Chinese equity markets are notorious for delivering a volatile ride for investors, who have become used to boom and bust periods. The China effect is especially significant for commodity markets and by extension the metal and oil heavy FTSE 100. Investors are also looking for signs of progress in Germany, now that the centre-left SPD party is prepared to consider another coalition with Angela Merkel. After its early morning jump, bitcoin is currently bobbing around the $9,600 mark. That leaves the $10,000 milestone firmly in its sights. And some in the industry reckon this could lure more people into buying digital currencies. Thomas Glucksmann, Hong Kong-based head of marketing at cryptocurrency exchange Gatecoin Ltd, told Bloomberg: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The weekend\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bitcoin price hike is just the continuation of a long-term bull run on the cryptocurrency, fueled by the tsunami of speculative trading on Japanese exchanges and the entrance of institutional investors across the world. It is more likely that the $10,000 psychological stratosphere will push more institutional investors into the mix.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Alternatively, Bitcoin\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rapid ascent might force financial authorities and central banks to rethink their current policy of waiting to see how digital currencies evolve. In recent months we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve seen a boom in Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs), in which new cryptocurrencies are launched into the market - often backed by a celebrity (yes you, Paris Hilton and Floyd Mayweather). ICOs are already under serious scrutiny, due to fears that investor aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t properly protected. David Futter, fintech partner at law firm Ashurst, predicts that scrutiny will intensify. In the shorter-term regulatory scrutiny will continue to fall on ICOs and the benefits of adapting the existing financial regulation around investments, payments and e-money to drive even more competition while protecting consumers. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Regulators know the rewards of cryptocurrency and blockchain could be huge, but have more than one eye on the catastrophic ramifications if good governance, stability and control are not preserved. If the carrot of self-regulation proves insufficient, the regulators will not hesitate to use their stick.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Now here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a thing. Bitcoin\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u0153mining\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd network uses more electricity in a year than 19 European countries, including Ireland, according to statistics released this morning. That power consumption is the cost of verifying transactions made using bitcoins, as our technology writer Alex Hern explains: At a continual power drain of 3.4GW, it means the network consumes five times more electricity than is produced by the largest wind farm in Europe, the London Array in the outer Thames Estuary, at 630MW.... The astronomical power draw is a facet of how the bitcoin network protects itself against fraud. With no centralised authority confirming transactions, bitcoin is instead backed by \u00e2\u20ac\u0153miners\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, who put specialised computers to work churning through extremely power-intensive computing problems. Solving those problems both rewards the miner, handing them almost a quarter of a million dollars in bitcoin, and verifies all transactions made in the last 10 minutes. More here: Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our news story on Bitcoin\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rally: Speaking of those stress tests, here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a video explaining how Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s banks have been put under the microscope. Tomorrow is a big day for Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s banking sector. At 7am, the Bank of England will publish the results of this year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bank stress tests. They will assess whether UK lenders have enough capital to cope with a sterling crisis, a recession, and a housing market crash. City editor Jill Treanor explains: The Bank of England is to reveal the damage inflicted on the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest lenders from \u00c2\u00a330bn of hypothetical consumer loan losses, an economic downturn and a collapse in the pound. Threadneedle Street\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s latest health check on the sector \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the first was conducted in 2014 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c could have an impact on a bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ability to pay dividends and on its business models. The lenders could be forced to sell off assets or ask existing shareholders and bondholders for more cash if they fail the tests based on hypothetical scenarios intended to put the sector under severe stress. You can get up to speed with Jill\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s preview, here: Bitcoin\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rapid ascent towards $10,000 could spur some investors to cash in their gains, suggests the analyst team at FXPro. They write: Currently, the market is anticipating that Bitcoin will reach $10K, with the lack of warning signals down to the lack of any doubts regarding further growth. It begins to seem that big businesses intended to profit from it. If this happens, there is a huge risk that big players start taking profit, with news provoking panic and sell-off. The cryptocurrency market currently seems like a playground for Wall Street tycoons, with JP Morgan Chase\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Jamie Dimon \u00e2\u20ac\u02dclooking at business opportunities in the planned Bitcoin-futures market\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, albeit having labelled Bitcoin \u00e2\u20ac\u02dca fraud\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 just two months ago. Once speculation is over, it is very likely that only the real business model projects will remain, such as logistics companies, accountancy or statistics firms reliant on blockchain. There are roughly 16.7 million bitcoins in circulation - that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the number mined using special software and hardware. Those coins are now worth $160bn in total (if you accept that a currency can have its own market capitalisation), more than some of the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s major companies. Mike\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s got a point... Tarzan* has swung into the debate on Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s industrial strategy! Lord Heseltine, former UK deputy prime minister, has argued that the best thing for British business would be to cancel Brexit, rather than Heseltine says it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s simply implausible to expect firms to commit fresh investment while Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s future is unclear: Our country is facing years of stagnation, and what is a principal cause of that? It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s that anyone who has got to take an investment decision today is saying, \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcWell how do I know what to invest in? What\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s going to happen about Britain and its biggest market of Europe?\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 and so they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re hesitating. Whether they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re British companies or overseas companies investing here, they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re hesitating. And as long as we have this Brexit shadow going over us, that will remain. And what do we get in the Budget? A \u00c2\u00a33bn bill in order to prepare for this Brexit disaster. Our Politics Live blog has all the details: * - a reference to Lord Heseltine\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s impressive mane and exuberant approach to politics (some readers may remember his antics with the House of Commons mace in 1976) This chart, from Bloomberg, shows how bitcoin has soared this year: Some analysts say it looks like an unsustainable bubble. But Hussein Sayed, chief market strategist at FXTM, reckons bitcoin will keep rising as more individuals and investors jump on board. From a fundamental perspective it is still almost impossible to give the cryptocurrency a fair value, however, there has been a strong correlation between the price of Bitcoin and number of users opening new wallets. It is not just retail investors showing interest in the cryptocurrency, but many hedge funds have decided to join the party recently by including Bitcoins in their portfolios. Given that number of users haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t exceeded 0.1% of the global population, there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s still more potential for this momentum trade to continue. Whether the price will be justified in the foreseeable future, depends on the adoption and the application of the new currency, but so far it still looks unstoppable. Bitcoin\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rally is partly due to the established financial world taking cryptocurrencies more seriously. Last month, derivatives marketplace CME Group announced it will start offering Bitcoin futures in December - letting investors trade Bitcoin without actually buying it. Neil Wilson of ETX Capital says this was a key moment: CME\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision to launch bitcoin futures in December has undoubtedly fuelled buying. BTC is up more than 50% since the decision was announced on October 31st. The legitimacy this gives Bitcoin as a tradeable asset is very important. The market cap of Bitcoin now exceeds that of IBM, Disney and McDonald\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s. But traditional investors still find Bitcoin\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rally baffling, with many predicting that it will end in tears. As Wilson puts it: Rather than a commodity or currency, Bitcoin is like owning stock in a company that will only ever issue 21 million shares and never pay a penny in dividends. The only way it has value is if the next guy is willing to pay you more for it \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the greater fool. With no intrinsic value to Bitcoin, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hard to see this as anything other than a giant speculative bubble.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Chinese stocks may be sinking, but Bitcoin is on a tear (again) this morning. The crypto currency has hit a fresh record high of $9,600 this morning, putting the $10,000 mark within its sights. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s quite a rally - Bitcoin started 2017 at just $1,000, before smashing a series of milestones with remarkable speed. Bullish Chinese investors capitulated this morning, says Mike van Dulken of Accendo Markets. He writes: China equities are turning lower again, led by financials. This is driven by concerns about rising yields (multi-year highs) amid a bond market sell-off that is likely to raise re-financing costs in an already over leveraged economy, putting pressure on both corporates and consumers, reviving the China credit bubble story. Chinese stocks have hit this lowest level since the summer, as a government crackdown on risky lending spooks investors. The Shanghai composite index fell almost 1% to 3,322 points, the lowest level since 25th August. Traders said jitters in the bond market are hitting Chinese shares, on fears that corporations will pay more to borrow - eating into profits. New curbs on the asset management sector are also driving people to sell, as Reuters explains: Selling in China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock markets last week had been prompted by a rout in the bond market that pushed yields on government treasury bonds to three-year highs, and by fresh moves to reduce risks in the asset management industry that may bring a sea change for banks and millions of small investors. But while bond market jitters appeared to ease on Monday, stock market investors continued to unload shares in major firms that have enjoyed strong gains in recent weeks. This could weigh on Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock markets this morning too.... Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Weak productivity growth is a key reason why Britain faces years of anaemic growth and weak pay. But the UK government hopes to crack the puzzle today, by announcing a new UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Industrial Strategy. It will focus on five \u00e2\u20ac\u02dckey foundations\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 -- ideas, people, infrastructure, business environment and places, in an attempt to make the British economy fit for the 21st century. Greg Clark, Secretary of State for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy, will launch the strategy this morning. He hopes to make Britain a world leader in areas such as AI and driverless cars. Our economics editor Larry Elliott explains: The paper will identify four grand challenges, global trends that the government sees as shaping the future: artificial intelligence; clean growth; an ageing society; and future mobility from driverless cars to drones. Industrial strategy went out of fashion in the Conservative party after the defeat of the 1974-9 Labour government by Margaret Thatcher. But Clark believes a new approach based on competition rather than on picking winners will help address Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s long-term problems. But will it really be enough to spur Britain forwards? Also coming up today... City investors will be watching Germany closely. Over the weekend, senior officials in Angela Merkel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s CDU party agreed to pursue a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153grand coalition\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd with the Social Democrats. This could spare Germany from a fresh snap election. Plus, we get a new health check on America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s housing market Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the agenda 9.30am GMT: Industrial strategy released 3pm GMT: US new home sales figures for October",
