                "body":"<p>Will early 2019 be remembered as the beginning of the end for competition in the UK energy market? That is likely to be the time when Theresa May\u2019s price cap on energy bills takes effect and two titans of the market complete the merger <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/nov/07/sse-npower-talks-merged-energy-supplier\" title=\"\">they proposed last week</a>.</p> <p>The new company to be created by Npower and SSE means the so-called \u201cbig six\u201d energy suppliers will shrink to five. More importantly, it means half of the market will belong to just two companies: the new firm and British Gas.</p> <p>The move certainly makes sense for Npower\u2019s parent Innogy, SSE, and its shareholders. Supplying electricity and gas to households has become a tougher business.</p> <p>Both firms have been losing customers to more than 50 smaller companies, who are mostly cheaper and more innovative, and now hold a fifth of the UK retail energy market. And with millions of their customers on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2017/oct/12/may-energy-price-cap-ofgem-electricity-gas-tariffs\" title=\"\">the standard variable tariffs</a> that May is capping, both face further financial pressure that could last for years.</p> <p>The rationale for the deal is strengthened by the fact that Npower\u2019s brand is tarnished, and it has been making a significant loss since 2015. SSE, meanwhile, has the highest proportion of households on the tariffs that will be capped.</p> <p>But will the merger help customers? There are already warnings that such mergers are \u201crarely a good thing for consumers\u201d. The removal of one big player in a market that is still largely differentiated on price could clearly hurt competition.</p> <p>The new giant could primarily use its economies of scale to maintain profit margins and rewards for its shareholders. And the mooted efficiencies of integrating SSE\u2019s old IT system with Npower\u2019s newer one could prove to be a pain rather than a panacea, making costs and customer service worse rather than better.</p> <p>The counter-argument is that those efficiencies could be realised and then used to give a bloody nose to Centrica\u2019s British Gas, driving down prices for consumers in the process.</p> <p>British Gas is a member of the \u201cbig six\u201d, but in reality it has always been the \u201cbig one\u201d, utterly eclipsing the other five in scale. Its new rival could be the first with the advertising clout, lobbying power and size to offer a potential counterweight.</p> <p>Advocates for the merger believe that an energy company solely focused on supplying households, as opposed to running power stations and energy networks, will be more focused and single-minded. It also won\u2019t have those other units to fall back on \u2013 so will in theory be hungrier and more competitive, too.</p> <p>All eyes are now on whether the European commission and UK competition watchdog will wave the plan through, as the groups hope.

                "bodyText":"Will early 2019 be remembered as the beginning of the end for competition in the UK energy market? That is likely to be the time when Theresa May\u2019s price cap on energy bills takes effect and two titans of the market complete the merger they proposed last week. The new company to be created by Npower and SSE means the so-called \u201cbig six\u201d energy suppliers will shrink to five. More importantly, it means half of the market will belong to just two companies: the new firm and British Gas. The move certainly makes sense for Npower\u2019s parent Innogy, SSE, and its shareholders. Supplying electricity and gas to households has become a tougher business. Both firms have been losing customers to more than 50 smaller companies, who are mostly cheaper and more innovative, and now hold a fifth of the UK retail energy market. And with millions of their customers on the standard variable tariffs that May is capping, both face further financial pressure that could last for years. The rationale for the deal is strengthened by the fact that Npower\u2019s brand is tarnished, and it has been making a significant loss since 2015. SSE, meanwhile, has the highest proportion of households on the tariffs that will be capped. But will the merger help customers? There are already warnings that such mergers are \u201crarely a good thing for consumers\u201d. The removal of one big player in a market that is still largely differentiated on price could clearly hurt competition. The new giant could primarily use its economies of scale to maintain profit margins and rewards for its shareholders. And the mooted efficiencies of integrating SSE\u2019s old IT system with Npower\u2019s newer one could prove to be a pain rather than a panacea, making costs and customer service worse rather than better. The counter-argument is that those efficiencies could be realised and then used to give a bloody nose to Centrica\u2019s British Gas, driving down prices for consumers in the process. British Gas is a member of the \u201cbig six\u201d, but in reality it has always been the \u201cbig one\u201d, utterly eclipsing the other five in scale. Its new rival could be the first with the advertising clout, lobbying power and size to offer a potential counterweight. Advocates for the merger believe that an energy company solely focused on supplying households, as opposed to running power stations and energy networks, will be more focused and single-minded. It also won\u2019t have those other units to fall back on \u2013 so will in theory be hungrier and more competitive, too. All eyes are now on whether the European commission and UK competition watchdog will wave the plan through, as the groups hope. Given the new supplier\u2019s sizeable revenues and fact it will have just a million fewer customers than British Gas, it is far from certain that it will be given the green light. What is guaranteed, barring a dramatic political surprise, is that 11 million households on standard variable tariffs will have their prices capped sometime in 2018 or 2019. It is hard to see how this will help competition. Business secretary Greg Clark maintains that this year\u2019s record switching between suppliers will not be harmed by the cap, as it would be designed in such a way that competition could continue under the ceiling. But few in the industry seriously believe switching won\u2019t decline under a cap. Some consumers will be lulled into the idea that they are being protected by the government, while others will not want the hassle as the savings from switching fall from as much as \u00a3300 now to perhaps as little as \u00a370. Any fall in switching will benefit the incumbents with the biggest customer bases today. And with 12.7 million customers, the new Npower/SSE will stand to benefit more than most.
