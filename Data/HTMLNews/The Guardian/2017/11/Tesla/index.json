                "bodyText":"On London\u2019s Oxford Street a row of glittering snowflakes guides shoppers along the golden mile of fashion and department stores. The 750,000 lights floating above Selfridges, John Lewis and Debenhams are a decades-old tradition but events like Black Friday have changed Christmas shopping for ever. The UK high street has just experienced something of a watershed, what some have called its \u201cTesla moment\u201d. Online fashion website Asos overtook Marks &amp; Spencer in market value terms for the first time despite not having a single store to its name. The comparison with the automotive industry comes because electric carmaker Tesla moved ahead of the 114-year-old Ford Motor Company in market value earlier this year. The growing might of the internet will be writ large when the \u00a310bn battle for sales in Black Friday week is tapped out on websites rather than from bargain hunting in stores. \u201cOnline has been a catalyst that has reinforced the fact that we have too many shops in the UK,\u201d says Matthew Hopkinson, director at retail consultancy Local Data Company. \u201cAround 10% of the UK retail stock is surplus to requirements, which equates to about 50,000 stores.\u201d It\u2019s a frightening statistic for an industry where jobs are already disappearing at an alarming rate.

One retail analyst likens the diverging fortunes of the physical and digital high street to Netflix sci-fi show Stranger Things where a malevolent alternative dimension, the \u201cupside down\u201d, is encroaching on everyday life. \u201cRetail seems trapped, with a real world showing online sales booming and an upside down world showing increasingly scary results for high street stores,\u201d says David Jinks, of ParcelCompare.

Assuming a robot driver can do three times as many shifts as a human, those cars alone could replace, for example, every non-Uber taxi or minicab in London.</p> <p>How Uber deploys its new driverless SUVs remains to be seen: but the news underlines how the technology could rapidly change the face of transport, manufacturing and work. So who will win and lose in the driverless future?</p> <h2><strong>Winners</strong></h2> <p><strong>Technology companies</strong><br>The race has been led by Google\u2019s self-driving division, now spun off as Waymo, which has just <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/nov/07/google-waymo-announces-fully-autonomous-ride-hailing-service-uber-alphabet\" title=\"\">started trials of a driverless taxi service</a> in Phoenix, Arizona. Even before its first lift has been hailed by a member of the public \u2013 and without having made a car of its own, as it currently buys in Chrysler minivans \u2013 Waymo has been valued at $70bn (\u00a352bn) by Morgan Stanley.</p> <p>Mobileye, an Israeli maker of chips and cameras for self-driving vehicles with revenues of only $300m a year, was bought by Intel for $15.3bn in March. Uber is rushing to develop its own robo-taxi tech to scale up profits on its enormous global customer base.</p> <p>Richard Cuerden, academy director at the British transport research centre TRL, says of the future: \u201cIt\u2019s very unlikely that we will buy cars as we do now for personal ownership. Firms will make money through things like data sharing and advertising.\u201d</p> <p><strong>Passengers</strong><br>The utopian vision of a driverless future is that just about everyone would benefit from shorter, safer and more productive journeys. If driverlessness means shared ownership, as many hope and believe, as well as more efficient use of road space through intelligent and connected vehicles, there is the scope to massively reduce congestion. If the model also reduces the costs of door-to-door transport, cars could go a long way to ensuring more independent mobility for the elderly and disabled.</p> <p><strong>Online media and retailers</strong><br>Fewer young people are buying cars, and not just because they are strapped for cash: smartphones and tablets mean journeys by bus or train are more enjoyable. Today\u2019s stressed driver can hope for a similar future, Cuerden says: \u201cYou needn\u2019t face forward any more, you\u2019ll be doing a million different things. The holy grail is to free up that time.\u201d Watching Netflix, Instagramming the motorway, internet shopping: a whole new segment of the population will be online and available.</p> <p><strong>Logistics firms</strong><br>The unveiling by Elon Musk of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/video/2017/nov/17/elon-musk-unveils-new-tesla-semi-electric-truck-video\" title=\"\">Tesla\u2019s Semi</a> electric truck, with its autopilot features, will have caught the attention of haulage firms. Around one-third of costs in the $7bn US trucking industry is drivers\u2019 wages.</p> <p>In the UK, salaries have risen due to a lack of drivers: the Freight Transport Association last year said there was a shortfall of almost 35,000 drivers compared with available HGVs. Firms whose delivery routes and schedules are minutely plotted to save time, fuel and money, will probably hope that trials of \u201cplatooned\u201d lorries \u2013 linked vehicles travelling in convoy with perhaps just one driver in the lead cab \u2013 are just the first step to a driverless future.</p> <p><strong>Lithium miners</strong><br>As chancellor Philip Hammond said while announcing a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/nov/22/treasury-backs-electric-cars-but-makes-limited-moves-on-diesel\" title=\"\">\u00a3400m fund for charging networks</a>, the road to autonomy starts with electric cars. And those batteries need minerals: the global <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/jul/29/electric-cars-battery-manufacturing-cobalt-mining\" title=\"\">lithium-ion battery market</a> is expected to more than double in value in the next seven years to around $75bn, according to Transparency Market Research, as electric car sales grow. Elements such as cobalt will be in increasing demand, and mining firms such as Glencore have already struck deals with carmakers who want to lock in supplies.</p> <h2><strong>Losers</strong></h2> <p><strong>Traditional car manufacturers</strong><br>Many expect the number of vehicles in private household ownership to fall. Car manufacturers have been hiring directors from software and tech firms as the market has tilted \u2013 witness <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/apr/04/tesla-charges-ahead-to-overtake-ford-in-market-value\" title=\"\">Tesla\u2019s valuation surpassing Ford</a> and GM\u2019s this year.</p> <p>Partnerships between Ford and Uber\u2019s rival Lyft, as well as Volvo\u2019s Uber deal, could point to how sales evolve.

                "bodyText":"The chancellor may have been keen to talk about the autonomous future in his budget, but the money that talked loudest last week came from Uber\u2019s billion-pound deal with Swedish carmaker Volvo. The scale of the order suggests driverless cars could indeed be just around the corner: 24,000 Volvos are to be kitted out with the ride-hailing company\u2019s self-driving technology between 2019 and 2021. Assuming a robot driver can do three times as many shifts as a human, those cars alone could replace, for example, every non-Uber taxi or minicab in London. How Uber deploys its new driverless SUVs remains to be seen: but the news underlines how the technology could rapidly change the face of transport, manufacturing and work. So who will win and lose in the driverless future? Winners Technology companies The race has been led by Google\u2019s self-driving division, now spun off as Waymo, which has just started trials of a driverless taxi service in Phoenix, Arizona. Even before its first lift has been hailed by a member of the public \u2013 and without having made a car of its own, as it currently buys in Chrysler minivans \u2013 Waymo has been valued at $70bn (\u00a352bn) by Morgan Stanley. Mobileye, an Israeli maker of chips and cameras for self-driving vehicles with revenues of only $300m a year, was bought by Intel for $15.3bn in March. Uber is rushing to develop its own robo-taxi tech to scale up profits on its enormous global customer base. Richard Cuerden, academy director at the British transport research centre TRL, says of the future: \u201cIt\u2019s very unlikely that we will buy cars as we do now for personal ownership. Firms will make money through things like data sharing and advertising.\u201d Passengers The utopian vision of a driverless future is that just about everyone would benefit from shorter, safer and more productive journeys. If driverlessness means shared ownership, as many hope and believe, as well as more efficient use of road space through intelligent and connected vehicles, there is the scope to massively reduce congestion. If the model also reduces the costs of door-to-door transport, cars could go a long way to ensuring more independent mobility for the elderly and disabled. Online media and retailers Fewer young people are buying cars, and not just because they are strapped for cash: smartphones and tablets mean journeys by bus or train are more enjoyable. Today\u2019s stressed driver can hope for a similar future, Cuerden says: \u201cYou needn\u2019t face forward any more, you\u2019ll be doing a million different things. The holy grail is to free up that time.\u201d Watching Netflix, Instagramming the motorway, internet shopping: a whole new segment of the population will be online and available. Logistics firms The unveiling by Elon Musk of Tesla\u2019s Semi electric truck, with its autopilot features, will have caught the attention of haulage firms. Around one-third of costs in the $7bn US trucking industry is drivers\u2019 wages. In the UK, salaries have risen due to a lack of drivers: the Freight Transport Association last year said there was a shortfall of almost 35,000 drivers compared with available HGVs. Firms whose delivery routes and schedules are minutely plotted to save time, fuel and money, will probably hope that trials of \u201cplatooned\u201d lorries \u2013 linked vehicles travelling in convoy with perhaps just one driver in the lead cab \u2013 are just the first step to a driverless future. Lithium miners As chancellor Philip Hammond said while announcing a \u00a3400m fund for charging networks, the road to autonomy starts with electric cars. And those batteries need minerals: the global lithium-ion battery market is expected to more than double in value in the next seven years to around $75bn, according to Transparency Market Research, as electric car sales grow. Elements such as cobalt will be in increasing demand, and mining firms such as Glencore have already struck deals with carmakers who want to lock in supplies. Losers Traditional car manufacturers Many expect the number of vehicles in private household ownership to fall. Car manufacturers have been hiring directors from software and tech firms as the market has tilted \u2013 witness Tesla\u2019s valuation surpassing Ford and GM\u2019s this year. Partnerships between Ford and Uber\u2019s rival Lyft, as well as Volvo\u2019s Uber deal, could point to how sales evolve. Philippa Oldham, head of transport at the Institution of Mechanical Engineers, says: \u201cTraditional sales have already been going down year-on-year as people go to a leasing model. \u201cFord and BMW have car-share businesses, while BMW is diversifying into repurposing batteries as energy storage solutions in homes. The challenge is where they develop their business models.\u201d Insurance firms The majority of car accidents involve some element of human error, and predictions in studies of the potential drop in fatalities from self-driving cars have ranged from 80 to 95%.
