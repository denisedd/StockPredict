                "bodyText":"Vodafone has struck a \u00a3500m deal to bring next-generation gigabit speed broadband to a dozen UK cities, enabling hospitals to send CT scan images in seconds and consumers to download 4k quality movies in minutes rather than hours. The company has struck a deal with CityFibre, the publicly listed company, to take fibre optic lines to 1m homes by 2021, with an option to extend to 5m homes by 2025, covering 20% of the UK broadband market. While few consumers and businesses currently need gigabit speeds, of up to 1,000Mbps, it is likely to become the norm in the coming years. It would be 50 times faster than standard UK broadband and three times quicker than the fastest option currently available from BT. Fibre networks will be needed to provide the back-end data shifting muscle for next generation 5G mobile networks and the internet of things \u2013 including fully automated homes, driverless cars and \u201csmart\u201d manufacturing. The cities where full-fibre networks will be rolled out have yet to be named but are likely to be locations such as Peterborough, Milton Keynes, Leeds and Edinburgh, where CityFibre has already been focusing. Construction is due to start in 2018 with the first customers expected to be connected before the end of that year. The government has referred to full-fibre networks as the \u201cgold standard\u201d internet infrastructure. Ofcom points out that with the boom in streaming and downloading video, fuelled by services such as Netflix, Amazon and YouTube, home broadband data usage has grown at a rate of 36% a year. \u201cOrganisations such as schools, hospitals and GP surgeries, will get these speeds for the first time,\u201d said Nick Jeffrey, Vodafone\u2019s UK chief executive. \u201cThe UK has fallen far behind the rest of the world, trapped by the limited choice available on [existing] networks.

In the move Vodafone would take on BT\u2019s Openreach, which runs the UK broadband infrastructure that rivals such as Sky and TalkTalk use, and Virgin Media, which runs its own network. Vodafone will have exclusive rights to market the new networks during construction phase, guaranteeing to take on 20% of customers, with CityFibre eventually looking to allow rivals to sell packages to consumers using its network. \u201cWith this commitment from Vodafone we have a partner with whom we can transform the digital capabilities of millions of homes and businesses,\u201d said Greg Mesch, chief executive of CityFibre. \u201cThis is a major step forward in delivering gigabit Britain.\u201d Shares in CityFibre, which in July raised \u00a3200m to fund building fibre networks, soared more than 25% following the announcement of the deal.

M&amp;S has said it will close 30 stores, while a further 45 are being downsized or converted into food-only outlets. But many analysts think retailers will have to go further given the pace of high street change. Mothercare, for example, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/may/18/mothercare-looking-to-close-up-to-70-uk-stores\">plans to halve the size of its 150-store UK chain</a> after more than 40% of its sales shifted online.</p> <p>Retailers are following the consumers\u2019 lead after watching online retail sales double over a five-year period. The growth in online spending also holds a mirror up to how we spend our free time. In 2010, 60% of adults went online every day. That figure is now 84%, according to the Office for National Statistics.</p> <p>\u201cIt is the structural change in the way people interact with digital technology that is altering the retail industry,\u201d says Richard Lim, chief executive of Retail Economics, who also points to a shift in spending to the so-called \u201cexperience economy\u201d as Britons spend more on leisure, travel and entertainment.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"04e9694ba56cb792cdef280cf7de678495f142f8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/04e9694ba56cb792cdef280cf7de678495f142f8/0_356_4750_2850/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Peak home furnishings?

I\u2019d say we\u2019ve hit peak red meat, peak sugar, peak stuff \u2026 peak home furnishings.\u201d</p> <p>Until the Brexit blow to sterling, Britons had benefited from 20 years of falling prices as canny retailers imported vast quantities of goods produced cheaply in Asia. There is now an abundance of material possessions,\u201d says Lim. \u201cFor the past two decades British shoppers have enjoyed persistent deflation so the economic value they attach to purchases is diminishing.\u201d</p> <p>He gives the example of people buying their first iPad, which was a much bigger deal than when they upgraded to their fourth or fifth model. This purchase fatigue is changing what we spend our money on as we relish holidays or treat ourselves to days out. In the early 1960s retail accounted for close to a third of Britons\u2019 spending, but that figure is 24% today and is expected to fall further still.</p> <p>Shifting priorities have seen retailers invest heavily in creating more dynamic store experiences to pull shoppers away from their screens. A recent example of the trend is <a href=\"https://www.drapersonline.com/news/john-lewis-unveils-services-for-new-experiential-store/7026902.article\">John Lewis\u2019s new Oxford store</a> where more than a fifth of the 120,000 sq ft of selling space is devoted to 21 \u201cservices and experiences\u201d, ranging from style advice to personalised Christmas baubles.</p> <p>Some analysts argue the internet should no longer be seen as the enemy of the store. Amazon put a cat among the pigeons earlier this year when it swooped on organic <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/jun/16/amazon-buy-whole-foods-market-organic-food-fresh\">food chain Whole Foods Market</a>. The move showed that even the biggest of the online giants saw value in a physical store network.</p> <p>Closer to home, supermarket chain Sainsbury\u2019s swallowed Argos last year for \u00a31.4bn as it looked to borrow the catalogue chain\u2019s successful model, which marries stores, the web and super-fast delivery.</p> <p>Argos chief executive John Rogers explains a new topsy-turvy retail landscape where 60% of orders originate online but two-thirds of those shoppers turn up in store to collect their toys, kettles and toasters. Despite a plethora of delivery options, 80% of its orders end up being fulfilled the old-fashioned way through the now combined Sainsbury\u2019s and Argos store network.</p> <p>Rogers says that it is no longer possible to \u201cdelineate\u201d between online and physical sales as customers move seamlessly between the two worlds. \u201cThe majority of orders start online but are fulfilled in our stores,\u201d he says. \u201cI can\u2019t overestimate the importance of that flexibility. I\u2019m a big believer in stores but there is no question that online will continue to grow.\u201d</p> <p>In the coming days retailers will wage a fierce battle for Black Friday sales, an event that will be a litmus test for the key Christmas period, when many bank the lion\u2019s share of their annual profits. Rogers is determined that Argos will be one of the winners from these first skirmishes, insisting that if you have the right products at the right prices, the demand is there.</p> <p>\u201cI think Christmas will be big this year, but it will come later,\u201d he predicts of the nail-biting trading days ahead. \u201cI would not write off stores.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022Follow Guardian Business on Twitter at <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BusinessDesk\">@BusinessDesk</a>, or sign up to the daily Business Today email <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/info/2017/may/16/guardian-business-today-sign-up-financial-news-email?CMP=business_footnote\">here</a>.</p>",

That figure is now 84%, according to the Office for National Statistics. \u201cIt is the structural change in the way people interact with digital technology that is altering the retail industry,\u201d says Richard Lim, chief executive of Retail Economics, who also points to a shift in spending to the so-called \u201cexperience economy\u201d as Britons spend more on leisure, travel and entertainment. Steve Howard, Ikea\u2019s head of sustainability, caused ripples last year when he suggested households had reached saturation point. \u201cIf we look on a global basis, in the west we have probably hit peak stuff,\u201d he told a conference. \u201cWe talk about peak oil. I\u2019d say we\u2019ve hit peak red meat, peak sugar, peak stuff \u2026 peak home furnishings.\u201d Until the Brexit blow to sterling, Britons had benefited from 20 years of falling prices as canny retailers imported vast quantities of goods produced cheaply in Asia. There is now an abundance of material possessions,\u201d says Lim. \u201cFor the past two decades British shoppers have enjoyed persistent deflation so the economic value they attach to purchases is diminishing.\u201d He gives the example of people buying their first iPad, which was a much bigger deal than when they upgraded to their fourth or fifth model. This purchase fatigue is changing what we spend our money on as we relish holidays or treat ourselves to days out. In the early 1960s retail accounted for close to a third of Britons\u2019 spending, but that figure is 24% today and is expected to fall further still. Shifting priorities have seen retailers invest heavily in creating more dynamic store experiences to pull shoppers away from their screens. A recent example of the trend is John Lewis\u2019s new Oxford store where more than a fifth of the 120,000 sq ft of selling space is devoted to 21 \u201cservices and experiences\u201d, ranging from style advice to personalised Christmas baubles. Some analysts argue the internet should no longer be seen as the enemy of the store. Amazon put a cat among the pigeons earlier this year when it swooped on organic food chain Whole Foods Market. The move showed that even the biggest of the online giants saw value in a physical store network. Closer to home, supermarket chain Sainsbury\u2019s swallowed Argos last year for \u00a31.4bn as it looked to borrow the catalogue chain\u2019s successful model, which marries stores, the web and super-fast delivery. Argos chief executive John Rogers explains a new topsy-turvy retail landscape where 60% of orders originate online but two-thirds of those shoppers turn up in store to collect their toys, kettles and toasters. Despite a plethora of delivery options, 80% of its orders end up being fulfilled the old-fashioned way through the now combined Sainsbury\u2019s and Argos store network. Rogers says that it is no longer possible to \u201cdelineate\u201d between online and physical sales as customers move seamlessly between the two worlds. \u201cThe majority of orders start online but are fulfilled in our stores,\u201d he says. \u201cI can\u2019t overestimate the importance of that flexibility. I\u2019m a big believer in stores but there is no question that online will continue to grow.\u201d In the coming days retailers will wage a fierce battle for Black Friday sales, an event that will be a litmus test for the key Christmas period, when many bank the lion\u2019s share of their annual profits. Rogers is determined that Argos will be one of the winners from these first skirmishes, insisting that if you have the right products at the right prices, the demand is there. \u201cI think Christmas will be big this year, but it will come later,\u201d he predicts of the nail-biting trading days ahead. \u201cI would not write off stores.\u201d \u2022Follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk, or sign up to the daily Business Today email here.",

De-branding takes a drug into an unregulated pricing regime where competition from generic manufacturers is supposed to act as a brake on prices. In practice, competition doesn\u2019t always arrive \u2013 thus a pack of Concordia\u2019s liothyronine tablets rose from \u00a34.46 before de-branding in 2007 to \u00a3258 by July this year.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/nov/21/drug-firm-concordia-overcharged-nhs-with-6000-price-rise\">Drug firm Concordia overcharged NHS with 6,000% price rise, says watchdog</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The government has tried to address the problem by creating powers to control prices of generic medicines. But the open question is how severely the system has been abused. The CMA says its investigators are pursuing another seven cases involving several companies, which may suggest a pricing loophole has been quietly exploited for years.</p> <p>The CMA is doing its bit, but there is a strong case for a wider investigation that looks beyond the narrow application of competition and consumer-protection laws. As it is, NHS England\u2019s response felt limp \u2013 the CMA\u2019s action \u201csends an important enforcement signal \u2026 that taxpayers and the NHS will not tolerate market abuses,\u201d it said.</p> <p>Well, yes, signals are important. But taxpayers and patients also want to know if the NHS has been taken for a ride on generics, whether officials are wiser to pricing games and whether the new law is up to the job. There is scope for a parliamentary inquiry.

                "bodyText":"The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) has discovered a rich seam for inquiries \u2013 pharmaceutical companies allegedly gouging the National Health Service. Pfizer, together with a small UK company called Flynn Pharma, was fined \u00a390m last December for \u201cexcessive and unfair\u201d pricing of an anti-epilepsy drug. GlaxoSmithKline and two small firms were later hit for \u00a345m for conspiring to delay competition on an antidepressant. Now comes an accusation that the Canadian firm Concordia Healthcare abused its dominant position to overcharge the NHS on a thyroid treatment. The price of the drug rose by almost 6,000% while production costs remained \u201cbroadly stable,\u201d says the CMA. The Concordia case is similar to the Pfizer one in that the price hikes followed the de-branding of a medicine. De-branding takes a drug into an unregulated pricing regime where competition from generic manufacturers is supposed to act as a brake on prices. In practice, competition doesn\u2019t always arrive \u2013 thus a pack of Concordia\u2019s liothyronine tablets rose from \u00a34.46 before de-branding in 2007 to \u00a3258 by July this year. The government has tried to address the problem by creating powers to control prices of generic medicines. But the open question is how severely the system has been abused. The CMA says its investigators are pursuing another seven cases involving several companies, which may suggest a pricing loophole has been quietly exploited for years. The CMA is doing its bit, but there is a strong case for a wider investigation that looks beyond the narrow application of competition and consumer-protection laws. As it is, NHS England\u2019s response felt limp \u2013 the CMA\u2019s action \u201csends an important enforcement signal \u2026 that taxpayers and the NHS will not tolerate market abuses,\u201d it said. Well, yes, signals are important. But taxpayers and patients also want to know if the NHS has been taken for a ride on generics, whether officials are wiser to pricing games and whether the new law is up to the job. There is scope for a parliamentary inquiry. And, since the companies all shout about their ethical codes of conduct, they would surely be happy to be questioned in detail about how they deal with the NHS.

Assuming a robot driver can do three times as many shifts as a human, those cars alone could replace, for example, every non-Uber taxi or minicab in London.</p> <p>How Uber deploys its new driverless SUVs remains to be seen: but the news underlines how the technology could rapidly change the face of transport, manufacturing and work. So who will win and lose in the driverless future?</p> <h2><strong>Winners</strong></h2> <p><strong>Technology companies</strong><br>The race has been led by Google\u2019s self-driving division, now spun off as Waymo, which has just <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/nov/07/google-waymo-announces-fully-autonomous-ride-hailing-service-uber-alphabet\" title=\"\">started trials of a driverless taxi service</a> in Phoenix, Arizona. Even before its first lift has been hailed by a member of the public \u2013 and without having made a car of its own, as it currently buys in Chrysler minivans \u2013 Waymo has been valued at $70bn (\u00a352bn) by Morgan Stanley.</p> <p>Mobileye, an Israeli maker of chips and cameras for self-driving vehicles with revenues of only $300m a year, was bought by Intel for $15.3bn in March. Uber is rushing to develop its own robo-taxi tech to scale up profits on its enormous global customer base.</p> <p>Richard Cuerden, academy director at the British transport research centre TRL, says of the future: \u201cIt\u2019s very unlikely that we will buy cars as we do now for personal ownership. Firms will make money through things like data sharing and advertising.\u201d</p> <p><strong>Passengers</strong><br>The utopian vision of a driverless future is that just about everyone would benefit from shorter, safer and more productive journeys. If driverlessness means shared ownership, as many hope and believe, as well as more efficient use of road space through intelligent and connected vehicles, there is the scope to massively reduce congestion. If the model also reduces the costs of door-to-door transport, cars could go a long way to ensuring more independent mobility for the elderly and disabled.</p> <p><strong>Online media and retailers</strong><br>Fewer young people are buying cars, and not just because they are strapped for cash: smartphones and tablets mean journeys by bus or train are more enjoyable. Today\u2019s stressed driver can hope for a similar future, Cuerden says: \u201cYou needn\u2019t face forward any more, you\u2019ll be doing a million different things. The holy grail is to free up that time.\u201d Watching Netflix, Instagramming the motorway, internet shopping: a whole new segment of the population will be online and available.</p> <p><strong>Logistics firms</strong><br>The unveiling by Elon Musk of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/video/2017/nov/17/elon-musk-unveils-new-tesla-semi-electric-truck-video\" title=\"\">Tesla\u2019s Semi</a> electric truck, with its autopilot features, will have caught the attention of haulage firms. Around one-third of costs in the $7bn US trucking industry is drivers\u2019 wages.</p> <p>In the UK, salaries have risen due to a lack of drivers: the Freight Transport Association last year said there was a shortfall of almost 35,000 drivers compared with available HGVs. Firms whose delivery routes and schedules are minutely plotted to save time, fuel and money, will probably hope that trials of \u201cplatooned\u201d lorries \u2013 linked vehicles travelling in convoy with perhaps just one driver in the lead cab \u2013 are just the first step to a driverless future.</p> <p><strong>Lithium miners</strong><br>As chancellor Philip Hammond said while announcing a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/nov/22/treasury-backs-electric-cars-but-makes-limited-moves-on-diesel\" title=\"\">\u00a3400m fund for charging networks</a>, the road to autonomy starts with electric cars. And those batteries need minerals: the global <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/jul/29/electric-cars-battery-manufacturing-cobalt-mining\" title=\"\">lithium-ion battery market</a> is expected to more than double in value in the next seven years to around $75bn, according to Transparency Market Research, as electric car sales grow. Elements such as cobalt will be in increasing demand, and mining firms such as Glencore have already struck deals with carmakers who want to lock in supplies.</p> <h2><strong>Losers</strong></h2> <p><strong>Traditional car manufacturers</strong><br>Many expect the number of vehicles in private household ownership to fall. Car manufacturers have been hiring directors from software and tech firms as the market has tilted \u2013 witness <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/apr/04/tesla-charges-ahead-to-overtake-ford-in-market-value\" title=\"\">Tesla\u2019s valuation surpassing Ford</a> and GM\u2019s this year.</p> <p>Partnerships between Ford and Uber\u2019s rival Lyft, as well as Volvo\u2019s Uber deal, could point to how sales evolve. Philippa Oldham, head of transport at the Institution of Mechanical Engineers, says: \u201cTraditional sales have already been going down year-on-year as people go to a leasing model.</p> <p>\u201cFord and BMW have car-share businesses, while BMW is diversifying into repurposing batteries as energy storage solutions in homes. The challenge is where they develop their business models.\u201d</p> <p><strong>Insurance firms</strong><br>The majority of car accidents involve some element of human error, and predictions in studies of the potential drop in fatalities from self-driving cars have ranged from 80 to 95%. KPMG found insurance premiums could be expected to drop by 50% in a decade.</p> <p>On the other hand, some expect an increase in crashes \u2013 and more wrangles for insurers\u2019 legal departments \u2013 during the transition period while humans and machines share the roads.</p> <p>Other issues remain, as Martyn Thomas, professor of IT at Gresham College, warns: \u201cHow they will price the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/nov/21/uber-data-hack-cyber-attack\" title=\"\">risk of hacking</a> is a complete mystery: a cybersecurity vulnerability that could be exploited by criminals could affect thousands of cars in a single day and put insurers out of business.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/nov/19/self-driving-cars-in-uk-by-2021-hammond-budget-announcement\">Budget 2017: UK to launch self-driving cars on British roads by 2021</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But, says Nick Reed, head of mobility research at component maker Bosch, motor insurance has to survive, even if it is passed to manufacturers and fleets once owner-drivers become passengers: \u201cThe <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/nov/06/government-urged-to-plug-insurance-black-hole-over-self-driving-cars\" title=\"\">business model will change</a>. But consumers always need to have the confidence that, in the event of an incident, there is compensation.\u201d</p> <p><strong>Service stations and hotels</strong><br>Goodbye, Moto? The appeal of a picnic on the M6 may diminish substantially when humans are no longer prompted by driver fatigue to pull in, and are instead engrossed in season 54 of <em>The Simpsons</em>. Electric charging networks may well not operate like petrol stations, where a vehicle has to pull in to refuel. However, should full autonomy allow all occupants to drink en route, more frequent stops could become a human necessity.</p> <p>While few UK journeys might require an overnight commute, a vehicle comfortable enough to sleep in could make hotels a less necessary option for business travellers \u2013 while longer US trips might be continued without the need for a roadside motel.</p> <p><strong>Professional drivers</strong><br>Around a million people in the UK who drive for a living <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/nov/23/philip-hammond-pledges-driverless-cars-by-2021-and-warns-people-to-retrain\" title=\"\">could have to retrain</a>, the chancellor said, acknowledging that \u201cfor some people, this will be very challenging\u201d.</p> <p>Cuerden is not convinced that so many jobs would be lost: \u201cWe\u2019re leading the HGV platooning trials, which see trucks operating more effectively \u2013 but all would need drivers for now. Long term, they might have time on their hands, but perform new tasks.\u201d</p> <p>By 2030, he believes, the bulk of journeys will be covered autonomously, but a human backup could remain. Meanwhile, many taxi firms still value \u201cthe customer interface, the human touch,\u201d Cuerden says. \u201cSo drivers might become stewards.\u201d</p> <p><strong>Government coffers</strong><br>The \u00a346bn that the UK government claims to have forsaken by freezing fuel duty may be only a warm-up for the gaping hole that an all-electric fleet would mean. Tens of millions in revenue for traffic offences could also be jeopardised by law-abiding&#xa0;robots.</p> <p>British councils also made a \u00a3750m profit on parking in 2016. Some have predicted that the UK parking industry, worth \u00a31.5bn in 2015, would effectively disappear in a world of fewer cars.</p> <p>However, the British Parking Association remains defiantly upbeat: \u201cThe number of cars entering, exiting and navigating a parking facility will likely be very much the same as it is now. Just without people.\u201d</p> <h2>Visions of the future?

                "bodyText":"The chancellor may have been keen to talk about the autonomous future in his budget, but the money that talked loudest last week came from Uber\u2019s billion-pound deal with Swedish carmaker Volvo. The scale of the order suggests driverless cars could indeed be just around the corner: 24,000 Volvos are to be kitted out with the ride-hailing company\u2019s self-driving technology between 2019 and 2021. Assuming a robot driver can do three times as many shifts as a human, those cars alone could replace, for example, every non-Uber taxi or minicab in London. How Uber deploys its new driverless SUVs remains to be seen: but the news underlines how the technology could rapidly change the face of transport, manufacturing and work. So who will win and lose in the driverless future? Winners Technology companies The race has been led by Google\u2019s self-driving division, now spun off as Waymo, which has just started trials of a driverless taxi service in Phoenix, Arizona. Even before its first lift has been hailed by a member of the public \u2013 and without having made a car of its own, as it currently buys in Chrysler minivans \u2013 Waymo has been valued at $70bn (\u00a352bn) by Morgan Stanley. Mobileye, an Israeli maker of chips and cameras for self-driving vehicles with revenues of only $300m a year, was bought by Intel for $15.3bn in March. Uber is rushing to develop its own robo-taxi tech to scale up profits on its enormous global customer base. Richard Cuerden, academy director at the British transport research centre TRL, says of the future: \u201cIt\u2019s very unlikely that we will buy cars as we do now for personal ownership. Firms will make money through things like data sharing and advertising.\u201d Passengers The utopian vision of a driverless future is that just about everyone would benefit from shorter, safer and more productive journeys. If driverlessness means shared ownership, as many hope and believe, as well as more efficient use of road space through intelligent and connected vehicles, there is the scope to massively reduce congestion. If the model also reduces the costs of door-to-door transport, cars could go a long way to ensuring more independent mobility for the elderly and disabled. Online media and retailers Fewer young people are buying cars, and not just because they are strapped for cash: smartphones and tablets mean journeys by bus or train are more enjoyable. Today\u2019s stressed driver can hope for a similar future, Cuerden says: \u201cYou needn\u2019t face forward any more, you\u2019ll be doing a million different things. The holy grail is to free up that time.\u201d Watching Netflix, Instagramming the motorway, internet shopping: a whole new segment of the population will be online and available. Logistics firms The unveiling by Elon Musk of Tesla\u2019s Semi electric truck, with its autopilot features, will have caught the attention of haulage firms. Around one-third of costs in the $7bn US trucking industry is drivers\u2019 wages. In the UK, salaries have risen due to a lack of drivers: the Freight Transport Association last year said there was a shortfall of almost 35,000 drivers compared with available HGVs. Firms whose delivery routes and schedules are minutely plotted to save time, fuel and money, will probably hope that trials of \u201cplatooned\u201d lorries \u2013 linked vehicles travelling in convoy with perhaps just one driver in the lead cab \u2013 are just the first step to a driverless future. Lithium miners As chancellor Philip Hammond said while announcing a \u00a3400m fund for charging networks, the road to autonomy starts with electric cars. And those batteries need minerals: the global lithium-ion battery market is expected to more than double in value in the next seven years to around $75bn, according to Transparency Market Research, as electric car sales grow. Elements such as cobalt will be in increasing demand, and mining firms such as Glencore have already struck deals with carmakers who want to lock in supplies. Losers Traditional car manufacturers Many expect the number of vehicles in private household ownership to fall. Car manufacturers have been hiring directors from software and tech firms as the market has tilted \u2013 witness Tesla\u2019s valuation surpassing Ford and GM\u2019s this year. Partnerships between Ford and Uber\u2019s rival Lyft, as well as Volvo\u2019s Uber deal, could point to how sales evolve. Philippa Oldham, head of transport at the Institution of Mechanical Engineers, says: \u201cTraditional sales have already been going down year-on-year as people go to a leasing model. \u201cFord and BMW have car-share businesses, while BMW is diversifying into repurposing batteries as energy storage solutions in homes. The challenge is where they develop their business models.\u201d Insurance firms The majority of car accidents involve some element of human error, and predictions in studies of the potential drop in fatalities from self-driving cars have ranged from 80 to 95%. KPMG found insurance premiums could be expected to drop by 50% in a decade. On the other hand, some expect an increase in crashes \u2013 and more wrangles for insurers\u2019 legal departments \u2013 during the transition period while humans and machines share the roads. Other issues remain, as Martyn Thomas, professor of IT at Gresham College, warns: \u201cHow they will price the risk of hacking is a complete mystery: a cybersecurity vulnerability that could be exploited by criminals could affect thousands of cars in a single day and put insurers out of business.\u201d But, says Nick Reed, head of mobility research at component maker Bosch, motor insurance has to survive, even if it is passed to manufacturers and fleets once owner-drivers become passengers: \u201cThe business model will change. But consumers always need to have the confidence that, in the event of an incident, there is compensation.\u201d Service stations and hotels Goodbye, Moto? The appeal of a picnic on the M6 may diminish substantially when humans are no longer prompted by driver fatigue to pull in, and are instead engrossed in season 54 of The Simpsons. Electric charging networks may well not operate like petrol stations, where a vehicle has to pull in to refuel. However, should full autonomy allow all occupants to drink en route, more frequent stops could become a human necessity. While few UK journeys might require an overnight commute, a vehicle comfortable enough to sleep in could make hotels a less necessary option for business travellers \u2013 while longer US trips might be continued without the need for a roadside motel. Professional drivers Around a million people in the UK who drive for a living could have to retrain, the chancellor said, acknowledging that \u201cfor some people, this will be very challenging\u201d. Cuerden is not convinced that so many jobs would be lost: \u201cWe\u2019re leading the HGV platooning trials, which see trucks operating more effectively \u2013 but all would need drivers for now. Long term, they might have time on their hands, but perform new tasks.\u201d By 2030, he believes, the bulk of journeys will be covered autonomously, but a human backup could remain. Meanwhile, many taxi firms still value \u201cthe customer interface, the human touch,\u201d Cuerden says. \u201cSo drivers might become stewards.\u201d Government coffers The \u00a346bn that the UK government claims to have forsaken by freezing fuel duty may be only a warm-up for the gaping hole that an all-electric fleet would mean. Tens of millions in revenue for traffic offences could also be jeopardised by law-abiding robots. British councils also made a \u00a3750m profit on parking in 2016. Some have predicted that the UK parking industry, worth \u00a31.5bn in 2015, would effectively disappear in a world of fewer cars. However, the British Parking Association remains defiantly upbeat: \u201cThe number of cars entering, exiting and navigating a parking facility will likely be very much the same as it is now. Just without people.\u201d Visions of the future? Five self-driving cars Westfield POD The most futuristic way to get around Greenwich \u2013 at least down the towpath from the O2 Arena. The electric pods, which are built in the Midlands and souped up with driverless gadgetry from Oxbotica, are currently in public trials in south London to test how the public interacts with the technology. Navya Autonom Cab The French manufacturer\u2019s latest vehicle looks more or less like a sleek, people-carrier-style taxi. It just has no driver\u2019s seat, steering wheel, or pedals: its six passenger seats all face inwards. The Autonom Cab should be in production next year, capable of speeds of 55mph \u2013 although, as it is designed for city centres, it probably will not be seen anywhere where it is allowed to go that fast. Starts at around \u00a3230,000. Uber\u2019s Volvo XC90 London\u2019s transport authorities will be praying that Uber doesn\u2019t want to traverse its narrow streets with these chunky Volvo XC90 SUVs. The ride-hailing app ordered 24,000 of the \u00a350,000 vehicles last week, for which Uber will provide the yet-to-be-built self-driving system. The cars are already available with semi-autonomous capabilities, including some automatic braking \u2013 but Uber\u2019s self-driving version isn\u2019t expected until 2021.

More than 800 of Just Eat\u2019s 2,500 staff from across the world (Sainsbury\u2019s, by comparison, has 195,000 staff) came together to celebrate the company\u2019s success last week by creating the world\u2019s biggest human image of a pizza. \u201cIt\u2019s not every day you see a marketing assistant from Mexico dressed as a mushroom standing next to a territory manager from Italy dressed as a basil leaf,\u201d said Lisa Hillier, Just Eat\u2019s \u201cchief people officer\u201d. Just Eat has also launched the British Takeaway Awards. At a black tie ceremony held at London\u2019s Savoy hotel earlier this week John Bishop was handing out the awards including a takeaway of the year prize, which was won by Birmingham\u2019s Lime Pickle Indian. Watching the success of privately held Uber and Deliveroo, City investors have been piling in to Just Eat, sending the shares up from 260p when it floated on the stock market in 2014 to 799p on Wednesday night. That growth meant that it was admitted to the FTSE 100, alongside packaging company DS Smith and Halma, a technology company that makes smoke detectors. Those demoted from the corporate premier league were Madame Tussauds\u2019 owner Merlin Entertainments, engineer Babcock and medical company ConvaTec. Speaking about selling his stake in the company, Buch said he \u201cenjoyed creating and building a company, but the reality of managing it did not appeal\u201d. James Lockyer, an analyst at Peel Hunt, said the fact that Just Eat has overtaken Sainsbury\u2019s is further evidence of \u201cthe dramatic shift in the way we are leading our lives\u201d. \u201cWe are spending more and more time at work and we want to spend less time on boring things,\u201d Lockyer said. \u201cWe want to be satisfied instantly, it is the same with Netflix \u2013 we demand content now.\u201d",
