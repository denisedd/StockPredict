Just ask Twitter, or Snap, owner of Snapchat. Once upon a time \u2013 only eight months ago in the case of Snap \u2013 these were must-have investments at flotation.</p> <p>The investment bankers whipped up the excitement. The world agreed that the valuations looked rich but, hey, this was a chance to own a slice of a business that could be the next Facebook or Google. The shares flew out of the traps. Snap, priced a $17 a pop, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/mar/02/snapchat-ipo-valuation-evan-spiegel-bobby-murphy-snap-inc\" title=\"\">hit $27 almost immediately</a>. Twitter, whose <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/nov/07/twitter-share-price-ipo-stock-market\" title=\"\">IPO in late 2013</a> was pitched at $26, reached $69 at the start of 2014.</p> <p>Look at them now. Snap has drifted close to $12 after yet more disappointing figures. New users are arriving at a \u201clower rate than we would have liked\u201d, conceded co-founder Evan Spiegel.</p> <p>Over at Twitter, the shares have recovered ground since lows this summer but are still below the IPO price, at $20. And it, too, is trying new tricks. The original 140-character limit on tweets is being <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/nov/08/twitter-to-roll-out-280-character-tweets-to-everyone\" title=\"\">increased to 280</a>, infuriating some users and pleasing&#xa0;others.</p> <p>If there\u2019s a common explanation for their woes, it\u2019s that Snap and Twitter are corporate minnows with niche products compared with Facebook and Google. Advertisers follow eyeballs religiously, and the arrival of automation to sell advertising reinforces the process and drives rate down.</p> <p>It\u2019s easy to forget just how small Snap is. A daily average user base of 178&#xa0;million sounds enormous until you see quarterly revenues of just $208m. Net losses tripled to $443m in the latest period. At least revenue is still growing at Snap: for Twitter, third-quarter revenues were down 4% to $590m. On the other hand, the company is at least close to making a profit, unlike Snap.</p> <p>It all feels like splashing around in the shallows while Facebook makes the social media waves. Twitter has 330 million monthly average users, whereas Facebook has 2 billion. Investors are belatedly getting the message: sometimes Goliath wins.</p> <h2>Belfast built ships. So could it build post-Brexit banks?</h2> <p>One of the many issues the UK government has to tackle in Brexit talks is the border on the island of Ireland. A report in the <em>Financial Times</em> last week suggested that the EU was demanding that Northern Ireland stay in the customs union and single market to avoid a hard border on the island.</p> <p>Putting the political ramifications to one side, this could raise an interesting economic proposition. International banks with large London operations are looking for new office space in EU cities such as Frankfurt, Dublin and Paris to make sure that Brexit does impede their ability to do business after March 2019.</p> <p>Imagine Goldman Sachs boss Lloyd Blankfein tweeting: \u201cJust left Belfast. This city built ships (popped into the Titanic museum) reckon can build banks too.\u201d</p> <p>It would add a new twist to the banker\u2019s Brexit-related tweets, in which he has both extolled the virtues of Frankfurt and posted a picture of building work on its new London headquarters, with the words, \u201cexpecting/hoping to fill it up\u201d.</p>",

Over at Twitter, the shares have recovered ground since lows this summer but are still below the IPO price, at $20. And it, too, is trying new tricks. The original 140-character limit on tweets is being increased to 280, infuriating some users and pleasing others. If there\u2019s a common explanation for their woes, it\u2019s that Snap and Twitter are corporate minnows with niche products compared with Facebook and Google. Advertisers follow eyeballs religiously, and the arrival of automation to sell advertising reinforces the process and drives rate down. It\u2019s easy to forget just how small Snap is. A daily average user base of 178 million sounds enormous until you see quarterly revenues of just $208m. Net losses tripled to $443m in the latest period. At least revenue is still growing at Snap: for Twitter, third-quarter revenues were down 4% to $590m. On the other hand, the company is at least close to making a profit, unlike Snap. It all feels like splashing around in the shallows while Facebook makes the social media waves. Twitter has 330 million monthly average users, whereas Facebook has 2 billion. Investors are belatedly getting the message: sometimes Goliath wins. Belfast built ships. So could it build post-Brexit banks? One of the many issues the UK government has to tackle in Brexit talks is the border on the island of Ireland. A report in the Financial Times last week suggested that the EU was demanding that Northern Ireland stay in the customs union and single market to avoid a hard border on the island. Putting the political ramifications to one side, this could raise an interesting economic proposition. International banks with large London operations are looking for new office space in EU cities such as Frankfurt, Dublin and Paris to make sure that Brexit does impede their ability to do business after March 2019. Imagine Goldman Sachs boss Lloyd Blankfein tweeting: \u201cJust left Belfast. This city built ships (popped into the Titanic museum) reckon can build banks too.\u201d It would add a new twist to the banker\u2019s Brexit-related tweets, in which he has both extolled the virtues of Frankfurt and posted a picture of building work on its new London headquarters, with the words, \u201cexpecting/hoping to fill it up\u201d.",

                "bodyText":"Shoppers are expected to spend at least \u00a310bn this week as the UK continues its affair with Black Friday, the US-inspired discount day. Most of the action takes place online in this country, with shoppers choosing to bargain hunt from under the duvet using their phone or laptop rather than queueing up outside stores in the early hours. Spending is expected to be up this year as more stores join the event, but experts say bargains may be harder to find as stores battle rising costs and inflation. Spending is expected to be up this year as more stores join the event, but experts say bargains may be harder to find as stores battle rising costs and inflation. Moneysavingexpert.com advises shopping around and researching the items you want to buy rather than relying on discount promises from retailers. They may be offering \u201c70% off\u201d their own price, but it doesn\u2019t mean the same item isn\u2019t cheaper elsewhere. Sticking to a shopping list of items you actually want, using price tracker tools such as Camelcamelcamel and watching out for discount codes are also a good idea. Finally, be wary of \u201ctoo good to be true\u201d prices \u2013 quite possibly they are \u2013 so carefully check terms and conditions and buyer reviews for sites you\u2019ve not used before offering very cheap prices.

                "bodyText":"Shoppers will splash out more than \u00a32.5bn on Black Friday deals, as the UK continues its affair with the US-inspired discount day. Sales will continue over the weekend with \u00a37.3bn expected to be spent between Friday morning and Monday night according to the Centre for Retail Research and the Vouchercodes website. A fifth more people are expected to hit the high street than on a normal Friday, according to ShopperTrak, but most of the action takes place online in this country, with shoppers choosing to bargain hunt from under the duvet using their phone or laptop rather than queueing up outside stores in the early hours. Spending is expected to be up this year as more stores join the event, but experts say bargains may be harder to find as stores battle rising costs and inflation.Moneysavingexpert.com advises shopping around and researching the items you want to buy rather than relying on discount promises from retailers. They may be offering \u201c70% off\u201d their own price, but it doesn\u2019t mean the same item isn\u2019t cheaper elsewhere. Sticking to a shopping list of items you actually want, using price tracker tools such as Camelcamelcamel and watching out for discount codes are also a good idea. Finally, be wary of \u201ctoo good to be true\u201d prices \u2013 quite possibly they are \u2013 so carefully check terms and conditions and buyer reviews for sites you\u2019ve not used before offering very cheap prices.

                "body":"<p>The chancellor may have been keen to talk about the autonomous future in his budget, but the money that talked loudest last week came from Uber\u2019s billion-pound deal with Swedish carmaker Volvo.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/nov/20/uber-volvo-suv-self-driving-future-business-ride-hailing-lyft-waymo\" title=\"\">scale of the order</a> suggests driverless cars could indeed be just around the corner: 24,000 Volvos are to be kitted out with the ride-hailing company\u2019s self-driving technology between 2019 and 2021. Assuming a robot driver can do three times as many shifts as a human, those cars alone could replace, for example, every non-Uber taxi or minicab in London.</p> <p>How Uber deploys its new driverless SUVs remains to be seen: but the news underlines how the technology could rapidly change the face of transport, manufacturing and work. So who will win and lose in the driverless future?</p> <h2><strong>Winners</strong></h2> <p><strong>Technology companies</strong><br>The race has been led by Google\u2019s self-driving division, now spun off as Waymo, which has just <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/nov/07/google-waymo-announces-fully-autonomous-ride-hailing-service-uber-alphabet\" title=\"\">started trials of a driverless taxi service</a> in Phoenix, Arizona. Even before its first lift has been hailed by a member of the public \u2013 and without having made a car of its own, as it currently buys in Chrysler minivans \u2013 Waymo has been valued at $70bn (\u00a352bn) by Morgan Stanley.</p> <p>Mobileye, an Israeli maker of chips and cameras for self-driving vehicles with revenues of only $300m a year, was bought by Intel for $15.3bn in March. Uber is rushing to develop its own robo-taxi tech to scale up profits on its enormous global customer base.</p> <p>Richard Cuerden, academy director at the British transport research centre TRL, says of the future: \u201cIt\u2019s very unlikely that we will buy cars as we do now for personal ownership. Firms will make money through things like data sharing and advertising.\u201d</p> <p><strong>Passengers</strong><br>The utopian vision of a driverless future is that just about everyone would benefit from shorter, safer and more productive journeys. If driverlessness means shared ownership, as many hope and believe, as well as more efficient use of road space through intelligent and connected vehicles, there is the scope to massively reduce congestion. If the model also reduces the costs of door-to-door transport, cars could go a long way to ensuring more independent mobility for the elderly and disabled.</p> <p><strong>Online media and retailers</strong><br>Fewer young people are buying cars, and not just because they are strapped for cash: smartphones and tablets mean journeys by bus or train are more enjoyable. Today\u2019s stressed driver can hope for a similar future, Cuerden says: \u201cYou needn\u2019t face forward any more, you\u2019ll be doing a million different things. The holy grail is to free up that time.\u201d Watching Netflix, Instagramming the motorway, internet shopping: a whole new segment of the population will be online and available.</p> <p><strong>Logistics firms</strong><br>The unveiling by Elon Musk of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/video/2017/nov/17/elon-musk-unveils-new-tesla-semi-electric-truck-video\" title=\"\">Tesla\u2019s Semi</a> electric truck, with its autopilot features, will have caught the attention of haulage firms. Around one-third of costs in the $7bn US trucking industry is drivers\u2019 wages.</p> <p>In the UK, salaries have risen due to a lack of drivers: the Freight Transport Association last year said there was a shortfall of almost 35,000 drivers compared with available HGVs. Firms whose delivery routes and schedules are minutely plotted to save time, fuel and money, will probably hope that trials of \u201cplatooned\u201d lorries \u2013 linked vehicles travelling in convoy with perhaps just one driver in the lead cab \u2013 are just the first step to a driverless future.</p> <p><strong>Lithium miners</strong><br>As chancellor Philip Hammond said while announcing a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/nov/22/treasury-backs-electric-cars-but-makes-limited-moves-on-diesel\" title=\"\">\u00a3400m fund for charging networks</a>, the road to autonomy starts with electric cars. And those batteries need minerals: the global <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/jul/29/electric-cars-battery-manufacturing-cobalt-mining\" title=\"\">lithium-ion battery market</a> is expected to more than double in value in the next seven years to around $75bn, according to Transparency Market Research, as electric car sales grow. Elements such as cobalt will be in increasing demand, and mining firms such as Glencore have already struck deals with carmakers who want to lock in supplies.</p> <h2><strong>Losers</strong></h2> <p><strong>Traditional car manufacturers</strong><br>Many expect the number of vehicles in private household ownership to fall. Car manufacturers have been hiring directors from software and tech firms as the market has tilted \u2013 witness <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/apr/04/tesla-charges-ahead-to-overtake-ford-in-market-value\" title=\"\">Tesla\u2019s valuation surpassing Ford</a> and GM\u2019s this year.</p> <p>Partnerships between Ford and Uber\u2019s rival Lyft, as well as Volvo\u2019s Uber deal, could point to how sales evolve. Philippa Oldham, head of transport at the Institution of Mechanical Engineers, says: \u201cTraditional sales have already been going down year-on-year as people go to a leasing model.</p> <p>\u201cFord and BMW have car-share businesses, while BMW is diversifying into repurposing batteries as energy storage solutions in homes. The challenge is where they develop their business models.\u201d</p> <p><strong>Insurance firms</strong><br>The majority of car accidents involve some element of human error, and predictions in studies of the potential drop in fatalities from self-driving cars have ranged from 80 to 95%. KPMG found insurance premiums could be expected to drop by 50% in a decade.</p> <p>On the other hand, some expect an increase in crashes \u2013 and more wrangles for insurers\u2019 legal departments \u2013 during the transition period while humans and machines share the roads.</p> <p>Other issues remain, as Martyn Thomas, professor of IT at Gresham College, warns: \u201cHow they will price the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/nov/21/uber-data-hack-cyber-attack\" title=\"\">risk of hacking</a> is a complete mystery: a cybersecurity vulnerability that could be exploited by criminals could affect thousands of cars in a single day and put insurers out of business.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/nov/19/self-driving-cars-in-uk-by-2021-hammond-budget-announcement\">Budget 2017: UK to launch self-driving cars on British roads by 2021</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But, says Nick Reed, head of mobility research at component maker Bosch, motor insurance has to survive, even if it is passed to manufacturers and fleets once owner-drivers become passengers: \u201cThe <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/nov/06/government-urged-to-plug-insurance-black-hole-over-self-driving-cars\" title=\"\">business model will change</a>. But consumers always need to have the confidence that, in the event of an incident, there is compensation.\u201d</p> <p><strong>Service stations and hotels</strong><br>Goodbye, Moto? The appeal of a picnic on the M6 may diminish substantially when humans are no longer prompted by driver fatigue to pull in, and are instead engrossed in season 54 of <em>The Simpsons</em>. Electric charging networks may well not operate like petrol stations, where a vehicle has to pull in to refuel. However, should full autonomy allow all occupants to drink en route, more frequent stops could become a human necessity.</p> <p>While few UK journeys might require an overnight commute, a vehicle comfortable enough to sleep in could make hotels a less necessary option for business travellers \u2013 while longer US trips might be continued without the need for a roadside motel.</p> <p><strong>Professional drivers</strong><br>Around a million people in the UK who drive for a living <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/nov/23/philip-hammond-pledges-driverless-cars-by-2021-and-warns-people-to-retrain\" title=\"\">could have to retrain</a>, the chancellor said, acknowledging that \u201cfor some people, this will be very challenging\u201d.</p> <p>Cuerden is not convinced that so many jobs would be lost: \u201cWe\u2019re leading the HGV platooning trials, which see trucks operating more effectively \u2013 but all would need drivers for now. Long term, they might have time on their hands, but perform new tasks.\u201d</p> <p>By 2030, he believes, the bulk of journeys will be covered autonomously, but a human backup could remain. Meanwhile, many taxi firms still value \u201cthe customer interface, the human touch,\u201d Cuerden says. \u201cSo drivers might become stewards.\u201d</p> <p><strong>Government coffers</strong><br>The \u00a346bn that the UK government claims to have forsaken by freezing fuel duty may be only a warm-up for the gaping hole that an all-electric fleet would mean. Tens of millions in revenue for traffic offences could also be jeopardised by law-abiding&#xa0;robots.</p> <p>British councils also made a \u00a3750m profit on parking in 2016.

                "bodyText":"The chancellor may have been keen to talk about the autonomous future in his budget, but the money that talked loudest last week came from Uber\u2019s billion-pound deal with Swedish carmaker Volvo. The scale of the order suggests driverless cars could indeed be just around the corner: 24,000 Volvos are to be kitted out with the ride-hailing company\u2019s self-driving technology between 2019 and 2021. Assuming a robot driver can do three times as many shifts as a human, those cars alone could replace, for example, every non-Uber taxi or minicab in London. How Uber deploys its new driverless SUVs remains to be seen: but the news underlines how the technology could rapidly change the face of transport, manufacturing and work. So who will win and lose in the driverless future? Winners Technology companies The race has been led by Google\u2019s self-driving division, now spun off as Waymo, which has just started trials of a driverless taxi service in Phoenix, Arizona. Even before its first lift has been hailed by a member of the public \u2013 and without having made a car of its own, as it currently buys in Chrysler minivans \u2013 Waymo has been valued at $70bn (\u00a352bn) by Morgan Stanley. Mobileye, an Israeli maker of chips and cameras for self-driving vehicles with revenues of only $300m a year, was bought by Intel for $15.3bn in March. Uber is rushing to develop its own robo-taxi tech to scale up profits on its enormous global customer base. Richard Cuerden, academy director at the British transport research centre TRL, says of the future: \u201cIt\u2019s very unlikely that we will buy cars as we do now for personal ownership. Firms will make money through things like data sharing and advertising.\u201d Passengers The utopian vision of a driverless future is that just about everyone would benefit from shorter, safer and more productive journeys. If driverlessness means shared ownership, as many hope and believe, as well as more efficient use of road space through intelligent and connected vehicles, there is the scope to massively reduce congestion. If the model also reduces the costs of door-to-door transport, cars could go a long way to ensuring more independent mobility for the elderly and disabled. Online media and retailers Fewer young people are buying cars, and not just because they are strapped for cash: smartphones and tablets mean journeys by bus or train are more enjoyable. Today\u2019s stressed driver can hope for a similar future, Cuerden says: \u201cYou needn\u2019t face forward any more, you\u2019ll be doing a million different things. The holy grail is to free up that time.\u201d Watching Netflix, Instagramming the motorway, internet shopping: a whole new segment of the population will be online and available. Logistics firms The unveiling by Elon Musk of Tesla\u2019s Semi electric truck, with its autopilot features, will have caught the attention of haulage firms. Around one-third of costs in the $7bn US trucking industry is drivers\u2019 wages. In the UK, salaries have risen due to a lack of drivers: the Freight Transport Association last year said there was a shortfall of almost 35,000 drivers compared with available HGVs. Firms whose delivery routes and schedules are minutely plotted to save time, fuel and money, will probably hope that trials of \u201cplatooned\u201d lorries \u2013 linked vehicles travelling in convoy with perhaps just one driver in the lead cab \u2013 are just the first step to a driverless future. Lithium miners As chancellor Philip Hammond said while announcing a \u00a3400m fund for charging networks, the road to autonomy starts with electric cars. And those batteries need minerals: the global lithium-ion battery market is expected to more than double in value in the next seven years to around $75bn, according to Transparency Market Research, as electric car sales grow. Elements such as cobalt will be in increasing demand, and mining firms such as Glencore have already struck deals with carmakers who want to lock in supplies. Losers Traditional car manufacturers Many expect the number of vehicles in private household ownership to fall. Car manufacturers have been hiring directors from software and tech firms as the market has tilted \u2013 witness Tesla\u2019s valuation surpassing Ford and GM\u2019s this year. Partnerships between Ford and Uber\u2019s rival Lyft, as well as Volvo\u2019s Uber deal, could point to how sales evolve. Philippa Oldham, head of transport at the Institution of Mechanical Engineers, says: \u201cTraditional sales have already been going down year-on-year as people go to a leasing model. \u201cFord and BMW have car-share businesses, while BMW is diversifying into repurposing batteries as energy storage solutions in homes. The challenge is where they develop their business models.\u201d Insurance firms The majority of car accidents involve some element of human error, and predictions in studies of the potential drop in fatalities from self-driving cars have ranged from 80 to 95%. KPMG found insurance premiums could be expected to drop by 50% in a decade. On the other hand, some expect an increase in crashes \u2013 and more wrangles for insurers\u2019 legal departments \u2013 during the transition period while humans and machines share the roads. Other issues remain, as Martyn Thomas, professor of IT at Gresham College, warns: \u201cHow they will price the risk of hacking is a complete mystery: a cybersecurity vulnerability that could be exploited by criminals could affect thousands of cars in a single day and put insurers out of business.\u201d But, says Nick Reed, head of mobility research at component maker Bosch, motor insurance has to survive, even if it is passed to manufacturers and fleets once owner-drivers become passengers: \u201cThe business model will change. But consumers always need to have the confidence that, in the event of an incident, there is compensation.\u201d Service stations and hotels Goodbye, Moto? The appeal of a picnic on the M6 may diminish substantially when humans are no longer prompted by driver fatigue to pull in, and are instead engrossed in season 54 of The Simpsons. Electric charging networks may well not operate like petrol stations, where a vehicle has to pull in to refuel. However, should full autonomy allow all occupants to drink en route, more frequent stops could become a human necessity. While few UK journeys might require an overnight commute, a vehicle comfortable enough to sleep in could make hotels a less necessary option for business travellers \u2013 while longer US trips might be continued without the need for a roadside motel. Professional drivers Around a million people in the UK who drive for a living could have to retrain, the chancellor said, acknowledging that \u201cfor some people, this will be very challenging\u201d. Cuerden is not convinced that so many jobs would be lost: \u201cWe\u2019re leading the HGV platooning trials, which see trucks operating more effectively \u2013 but all would need drivers for now. Long term, they might have time on their hands, but perform new tasks.\u201d By 2030, he believes, the bulk of journeys will be covered autonomously, but a human backup could remain. Meanwhile, many taxi firms still value \u201cthe customer interface, the human touch,\u201d Cuerden says. \u201cSo drivers might become stewards.\u201d Government coffers The \u00a346bn that the UK government claims to have forsaken by freezing fuel duty may be only a warm-up for the gaping hole that an all-electric fleet would mean. Tens of millions in revenue for traffic offences could also be jeopardised by law-abiding robots. British councils also made a \u00a3750m profit on parking in 2016. Some have predicted that the UK parking industry, worth \u00a31.5bn in 2015, would effectively disappear in a world of fewer cars. However, the British Parking Association remains defiantly upbeat: \u201cThe number of cars entering, exiting and navigating a parking facility will likely be very much the same as it is now. Just without people.\u201d Visions of the future? Five self-driving cars Westfield POD The most futuristic way to get around Greenwich \u2013 at least down the towpath from the O2 Arena.

This is encouraging. \u201cHowever, we can confirm that member states in the code of conduct group have written to a number of jurisdictions regarding deficiencies that were identified during the screening phase. \u201cWe said that the EU would proactively engage with the relevant jurisdictions throughout the listing process, and that is what member states are doing.\u201d The UK is also one of a few member states resisting improvements to the anti-money laundering rules to reveal the real \u201cbeneficial\u201d owners behind companies and trusts in the EU. The changes would oblige EU member states to operate fully public registers disclosing the \u201cbeneficial ownership\u201d of trusts. The UK claims it would be an infringement of privacy to reveal the beneficiaries of trusts. Laure Brillaud, from Transparency International, said: \u201cThe Paradise Papers have shown that trusts are an essential piece of the offshore puzzle. A new legislation that would not fully cover and increase transparency on trusts doing business in the EU would miss the whole point. \u201cMember states, including those on their way out, must take the opportunity of the new EU anti-money laundering directive to change the rules of the game. \u201cAny countries which attempt to block progress on this will only be proving that they are in favour of the status quo of secrecy which allows wealth to be hidden offshore.\u201d",
