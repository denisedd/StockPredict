Entrepreneurs hope it will tempt US investors to look outside the capital, where tech companies received \u00c2\u00a31.4bn of the \u00c2\u00a31.9bn invested in the industry last year, <a href=\"http://www.londonandpartners.com/media-centre/press-releases/2017/20170112-uk-tech-sector-leads-european-investment-in-2016\">according to the mayor of London\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s promotional firm London &amp; Partners</a>.</p> <p>The northern tech scene might not be under threat from Brexit, but there remains significant barriers to competing with London. Founders complain that UK investors are far more risk-averse than their US counterparts, stifling the growth of young companies. Scott Fletcher, the founder of IT firm ANS, believes Manchester\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s wealth of former Premier League footballers, such as Gary Neville, should open their chequebooks to the region\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s top tech-talent.</p> <p>\u00e2\u20ac\u0153Gary Neville is a one in a million in that he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s an entrepreneur as well, but when you approach other footballers all they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve known all their life is football,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Fletcher. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153They always have advisers and agents around them who have got a vested interest so trying to get access to them is quite difficult, and they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll generally go for safer investments. You\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve got to be willing, when you invest in tech startups, to lose all your money.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd</p> <p>Jamil Khalil, the founder of Manchester-based social curation platform <a href=\"https://wakelet.com/\">Wakelet</a>, said \u00e2\u20ac\u0153so-called early-stage investors\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in Britain made him feel like quitting many times when he was knocked back because the business was not yet making a profit. Luke Massie, the 23-year-old founder of secondary ticket marketplace <a href=\"http://www.vibetickets.co.uk/\">Vibe Tickets</a>, said Silicon Valley benefited from an \u00e2\u20ac\u0153ecosystem that props up startups\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, unlike the UK.</p> <p>\u00e2\u20ac\u0153Investors over here [in San Francisco] are backing growth, whereas in the UK they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re focused on profitability, which means over here a company like mine can focus on your main challenge \u00e2\u20ac\u201c spending \u00c2\u00a31 and making two from it,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said.</p> <p>Andy McLoughlin, a British-born San Francisco-based investor, said Silicon Valley\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s view of the UK was still heavily London-centric. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Getting more British startups to the west coast \u00e2\u20ac\u201c where they can taste the pace of innovation and scale of thinking \u00e2\u20ac\u201c can only be a good thing,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said.</p> <p>\u00e2\u20ac\u0153But a single new flight route won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t put the north of England on top-tier Silicon Valley venture capitalists\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 radars. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll take a sustained ecosystem producing numerous great companies \u00e2\u20ac\u201c something that London has only really started to do in the last five to 10 years.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"00ac605764a65139bd4346498e98fbaaf2ea91f9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/00ac605764a65139bd4346498e98fbaaf2ea91f9/0_246_5472_3283/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tallinn.

                "bodyText":"Theresa May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s article 50 letter might have dominated the front pages in Britain but it was met with a shrug in San Francisco, where 30 tech leaders from the north of England recently embarked on a four-day mission to woo, impress and tempt cash from Silicon Valley\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s top dealmakers. Anxiety over the future of Britain outside Europe has not, it seems, spread to the home of Facebook, Twitter and Google. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Investors here just don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know what Brexit means yet,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Gerald Brady, managing director of the multibillion-dollar lender Silicon Valley Bank. However, that is not stopping EU27 countries from making furtive attempts to lure British entrepreneurs overseas. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Other European countries are trying to attract talent by saying, \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcHey, come to Ireland, or Holland or Germany because we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve got free movement of people and if your number one issue is talent, we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re gonna be able to help you get engineers.\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s happening today,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Brady said. Matt Haworth, the co-founder of Manchester-based \u00e2\u20ac\u0153tech for good\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd agency Reason Digital, said he and other entrepreneurs had been targeted with Facebook adverts from authorities in Estonia and Transylvania since Britain voted to leave the European Union. But it will take more than that to lure Haworth and others away from northern England, where a rapidly growing technology sector has led to a boom in investment in Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s former industrial heartlands. Investment in northern tech businesses reached a 10-year high last year at \u00c2\u00a3327m, up from \u00c2\u00a320m in 2007, according to the government agency Tech North, as startup clusters developed in Manchester, Leeds, Sheffield and the north-east. Sunderland, which is about as far removed as you can get from Silicon Valley, has the fastest-growing digital turnover in the UK behind London, according to Tech City UK. GP Bullhound, an investment bank, says the north now has 12 tech \u00e2\u20ac\u0153unicorns\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u201c that is, companies valued at more than $1bn \u00e2\u20ac\u201c which is more than Sweden or Germany. They include some of the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest tech businesses, such as the software giant Sage and The Hut, the online retailer with an annual turnover of \u00c2\u00a3335m. Northern tech businesses received a further boost recently when Virgin Atlantic launched its inaugural flight from Manchester to San Francisco, the first direct UK route outside London. Entrepreneurs hope it will tempt US investors to look outside the capital, where tech companies received \u00c2\u00a31.4bn of the \u00c2\u00a31.9bn invested in the industry last year, according to the mayor of London\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s promotional firm London &amp; Partners. The northern tech scene might not be under threat from Brexit, but there remains significant barriers to competing with London. Founders complain that UK investors are far more risk-averse than their US counterparts, stifling the growth of young companies. Scott Fletcher, the founder of IT firm ANS, believes Manchester\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s wealth of former Premier League footballers, such as Gary Neville, should open their chequebooks to the region\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s top tech-talent. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Gary Neville is a one in a million in that he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s an entrepreneur as well, but when you approach other footballers all they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve known all their life is football,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Fletcher. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153They always have advisers and agents around them who have got a vested interest so trying to get access to them is quite difficult, and they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll generally go for safer investments. You\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve got to be willing, when you invest in tech startups, to lose all your money.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Jamil Khalil, the founder of Manchester-based social curation platform Wakelet, said \u00e2\u20ac\u0153so-called early-stage investors\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in Britain made him feel like quitting many times when he was knocked back because the business was not yet making a profit. Luke Massie, the 23-year-old founder of secondary ticket marketplace Vibe Tickets, said Silicon Valley benefited from an \u00e2\u20ac\u0153ecosystem that props up startups\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, unlike the UK. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Investors over here [in San Francisco] are backing growth, whereas in the UK they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re focused on profitability, which means over here a company like mine can focus on your main challenge \u00e2\u20ac\u201c spending \u00c2\u00a31 and making two from it,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said. Andy McLoughlin, a British-born San Francisco-based investor, said Silicon Valley\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s view of the UK was still heavily London-centric. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Getting more British startups to the west coast \u00e2\u20ac\u201c where they can taste the pace of innovation and scale of thinking \u00e2\u20ac\u201c can only be a good thing,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153But a single new flight route won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t put the north of England on top-tier Silicon Valley venture capitalists\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 radars. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll take a sustained ecosystem producing numerous great companies \u00e2\u20ac\u201c something that London has only really started to do in the last five to 10 years.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd A more significant challenge to the northern powerhouse lies in the ageing road and rail network, which business leaders say is causing Britain to lose out on potentially billions of pounds in growth and thousands of jobs. The trade minister, Greg Hands, was lobbied privately recently by entrepreneurs to sort out the north\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s woeful transport infrastructure at a networking event to mark the launch of the Virgin Atlantic flight. Phase two of the long-delayed HS2 rail network, from the West Midlands to Leeds and Manchester, is scheduled to begin operating in 2033 but businesses have demanded urgent investment to slash travel times between the north\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s major cities. Charlie Cornish, the chief executive of Manchester Airports Group, said growth in the north would continue to be held back without government action. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a massive part of the UK economy, and for Manchester airport to continue to grow and prosper and create more jobs, it will help to narrow that north-south divide. But unless you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve got connectivity across the north, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s very difficult to see how you can narrow that north-south divide.,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said. Speaking at Manchester airport, Hands said increasing connectivity in the north was a government priority. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve got a big infrastructure programme over the course of this parliament,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153HS2 is obviously right at the centre of that but we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re also looking at smaller large schemes to increase and improve connectivity within the north.

Kathleen Brooks of City Index said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Equity markets are putting a lot of faith into Macron. He first has to win the second round of the French presidential election and get the keys to the \u00c3\u2030lys\u00c3\u00a9e Palace, but then his newly formed party has to do well in the national assembly elections in June.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd There was also some nervousness ahead of the latest European Central Bank meeting on Thursday, with recent positive economic data from the eurozone prompting analysts to wonder if the bank would begin to call a halt to its economic stimulus measures. France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac closed up 0.17% at 5,277, while Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax edged up 0.1% at 12,467, albeit it at another closing high. The Stoxx 600, an index of leading companies across Europe, added 0.2%, its highest level since August 2015, helped by news of a \u00e2\u201a\u00ac12bn (\u00c2\u00a310bn) deal for LVMH to take full control of fashion house Christian Dior. In the UK, the FTSE 100 finished up 10.96 points (0.15%), supported by a further rise in banking shares as investors bet that a Macron victory would avoid Le Pen\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s threat of a eurozone breakup and boost the European banking sector. Meanwhile the MSCI World Index, which measures performance across 23 developed country equity markets, hit a record high for the second day running. Joshua Mahony, a market analyst at IG, said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153US markets are leading the way higher, as the excitement over Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s corporate tax cuts takes the mantle from the French elections ... Despite the optimism of Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tax plan, we are seeing the foreign exchange trends [from Monday] come back into play, with extended gains for the euro ahead of Thursday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ECB meeting. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153While much of the focus has been upon a rate-raising Fed, the political cloud that is gradually being lifted over the eurozone is likely to start putting pressure on [ECB president Mario] Draghi and co.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd As well as the relief rally over the Macron result, the prospect of an end to the ECB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bond-buying programme and low interest rate measures saw the euro hit a two-week high against the pound, up 0.39% to \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.1724. Gold, seen as a haven when investors avoid riskier assets, was out of favour, falling about $15 an ounce to $1,262 (\u00c2\u00a3980).",

what it called the biggest tax cuts \u00e2\u20ac\u0153in history\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd </a>on Wednesday in a move that will simplify the US tax system, slash taxes for businesses large and small (including his own), eliminate inheritance taxes and set the president on a collision course with Congress over the likely $2tn-plus cost of the proposal. <br> Critics immediately called it \u00e2\u20ac\u0153basically a huge tax cut for the rich\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd.  <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2017/apr/26/stock-markets-highs-ftse-wall-street-trump-tax-reforms-business-live?page=with:block-5900e798e4b01972138efb6e#block-5900e798e4b01972138efb6e\">The

about growing the economy, creating jobs.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd</p> </blockquote> <p>Cohn and Steven Mnuchin, the treasury secretary, were short on details of the plan that, if passed, would be the largest overhaul of the US tax system since the Reagan era. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We are moving as quickly as we can,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Mnuchin. <br> The announcement comes amid a continuing row over Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s own taxes, with members of his own party asking for him to release his returns before pressing ahead with tax reforms.<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2017/apr/26/stock-markets-highs-ftse-wall-street-trump-tax-reforms-business-live?page=with:block-5900e176e4b01972138efb55#block-5900e176e4b01972138efb55\"> Mnuchin said on Wednesday that Trump \u00e2\u20ac\u0153has no intention\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd of releasing his tax returns to the public</a>. <br> As well as slashing costs for his own businesses, the new proposals will also cut the alternative minimum tax (AMT), a tax designed to stop the super-wealthy from taking so many tax deductions that they avoid paying anything.

Yet this hyperbole was treated as just that by the Dow Jones, which nudged a mere 0.1% higher after the bell. Even the dollar was nonplussed, maintaining 0.3% and 0.5% rises against the euro and Japanese yen respectively while sitting flat against sterling.</p> <p>The fact investors failed to react to the Treasury Sec\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s headline tax cut announcement suggests that they are looking for more detail, especially the red flags that may cause any proposed bill to go the same way as Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s healthcare reforms.

That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fuelling concerns that some people may be illicitly profiting from embargoed information.</p> <p>The WSJ\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Mike Bird explains:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>During the hour before unexpectedly strong or weak U.K. data is made public, the pound moved 0.065% versus the dollar on average in the same direction it subsequently did after those numbers came out, according to an analysis prepared for The Wall Street Journal by Alexander Kurov, associate professor of finance at West Virginia University.</p> <p>It showed that the average change in the pound\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s value one hour before and after such economic data announcements is 0.127%, meaning around half the shift associated with the statistics came ahead of their official release</p> </blockquote> <p>This is significant because UK data is shared with a wide number of government insiders (from ministers to press officers) before it is released.</p> <p>This creates the potential for a leak -- unlike in Sweden, say, where no-one outside the statistics office gets a sniff before the official release.

If taxes are slashed then some large US firms may re-base themselves back in the US to take advantage of the 15% rate, which might encourage them to engage in shareholder-friendly activities such as share buy-backs, larger dividends etc.</p> <p>However, stocks may pause on Wednesday as the market waits for the reaction from Congress who actually has to pass the bill.</p> </blockquote> <h2>The pesky debt ceiling remains crucial problem for Congress</h2> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The problem for the Republican -controlled Congress is the debt ceiling, which was breached back in March but has been massaged by some accounting measures until the end of this month. Congress is trying to pass a budget that will fund the Federal Government from 28th April, however, an unfunded tax cut from the Trump administration could add to the pressure on the debt ceiling going forward.</p> <p>Thus, Republicans have to balance their desire to reduce the Budget deficit, with their desire to boost the economy with a large cut to the corporate tax rate. If they do the latter, as many expect, then this could be a green light for US stock markets.</p> </blockquote> <h2>Infrastructure plan, what infrastructure plan?</h2> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>This makes Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s infrastructure plan, which has been suspiciously absent from the coverage of the tax blueprint, very unlikely to go ahead. The Trump team is likely to focus on the fact a tax cut can pay for itself and create jobs, but can it do that at the same pace of a large government-spending programme?</p> <p>On balance, we expect markets to outperform in the coming days if key members of Congress throw their weight behind Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tax proposals. But, if there are any signs that this won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get through the US legislature, then we could see big declines for US stocks.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5900540fe4b08d339d361e9c\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-04-26T08:04:20.447Z\">9.04am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>European stock markets will probably have closed before we hear details of Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tax proposals.</strong></p> <p><a href=\"http://thehill.com/policy/finance/330588-mnuchin-cohn-expected-to-roll-out-trump-tax-plan\">According to The Hill</a>, an announcement is expected at 1.30pm Washington time, or 6.30pm BST.</p> <p>They also predict that Secretary of the Treasury Steven Mnuchin and National Economic Director Gary Cohn will present the plans;<a href=\"http://news.sky.com/story/trump-team-to-brief-senators-on-north-korea-at-white-house-10851205\"> Trump is busy holding a session on North Korea, with Secretary of State Rex Tillerson</a>.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2017-04-26T09:20:32.170Z\">at 10.20am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-590050fee4b0e81396c86c6c\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-04-26T07:52:16.834Z\">8.52am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>After two solid days, European stock markets are taking a little breather.</p> <p>The UK, French and German indices have all dipped in early trading:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2d0f93f31e43ec5d5b2b46f30583afe2240ad85b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2d0f93f31e43ec5d5b2b46f30583afe2240ad85b/0_0_919_287/500.jpg\" alt=\"European stock markets tis morning\" width=\"500\" height=\"156\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-59004cc9e4b01972138ef82d\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-04-26T07:38:46.660Z\">8.38am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tax reforms plans are the number one issue in the City today, says Naeem Aslam of Think Markets.</strong></p> <p>He sounds a little sceptical about the whole thing, though:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Currently, one major aspect of his plan which everyone is talking about is the corporate rate tax cut to 15% from its current rate of 35%.

GW Steven Mnuchin\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s claim that faster economic growth would help fund these tax cuts (see here) has been rubbished by one former White House staffer. CNBC explains: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This idea that growth can pay for these kinds of huge tax cuts is operating in fairyland,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd former Clinton administration budget director Leon Panetta told MSNBC on Wednesday. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153That just doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t work, so if you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re going to do a tax cut, then show how you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re paying for it.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our US business editor Dominic Rushe on today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tax announcement (with links to the key points in this liveblog) Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u02dchuge tax cut for the rich\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 would slash taxes for businesses and wealthy The Trump administration unveiled what it called the biggest tax cuts \u00e2\u20ac\u0153in history\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd on Wednesday in a move that will simplify the US tax system, slash taxes for businesses large and small (including his own), eliminate inheritance taxes and set the president on a collision course with Congress over the likely $2tn-plus cost of the proposal. Critics immediately called it \u00e2\u20ac\u0153basically a huge tax cut for the rich\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. The plan would cut the US\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s individual income tax brackets from seven to three (10%, 25% and 35%) and slash US corporate tax rates from 35% to 15%. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We have a once in a generation opportunity to do something really big,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Gary Cohn, chief economic adviser to Donald Trump. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This is about growing the economy, creating jobs.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Cohn and Steven Mnuchin, the treasury secretary, were short on details of the plan that, if passed, would be the largest overhaul of the US tax system since the Reagan era. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We are moving as quickly as we can,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Mnuchin. The announcement comes amid a continuing row over Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s own taxes, with members of his own party asking for him to release his returns before pressing ahead with tax reforms. Mnuchin said on Wednesday that Trump \u00e2\u20ac\u0153has no intention\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd of releasing his tax returns to the public. As well as slashing costs for his own businesses, the new proposals will also cut the alternative minimum tax (AMT), a tax designed to stop the super-wealthy from taking so many tax deductions that they avoid paying anything. Leaked documents have shown that in 2005 Trump paid $31m in tax thanks to the AMT. Mnuchin and Cohn were pressed on how Trump would benefit from the proposals but avoided the questions. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153What this is about is creating job and economic growth,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Mnuchin said. Mnuchin described the proposals as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the biggest tax cut and the largest tax reform in the history of our country\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd.... Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dom\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s full story: The US stock market has greeted the plan with a shrug. The Dow Jones industrial average is up just 37 points, or 0.2%, with similar small gains on the S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s because some of the details had already leaked, so were \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcpriced in\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, and also because it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not clear that the plan can really be implemented. Neil Wilson of ETX Capital says: Stocks pared gains, sliding as the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcdetails\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 were announced, while the dollar also handed back gains. For all the hype, this just wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t quite enough to send everything skyward.... We have to factor in considerable risk that the president won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get his way on tax and must be sceptical about whether the package will make it through the legislature in its current guise. Economics professor Justin Wolfers is also sceptical that this plan can get approved. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s because it doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t appear to pay for itself or appeal to Democrats on Capitol Hill. Analysts at Capital Economics are sceptical that the House and the Senate will approve this plan: The \u00e2\u20ac\u0153new\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd tax plan that the White House unveiled today looks a lot like President Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s old economic plan from the election campaign, with deep cuts to corporate and individual tax rates. Even with dynamic scoring, however, the old plan was expected to increase the Federal budget deficit by $7trn over the next decade. For that reason alone, this plan is never getting approved by Congress, particularly not through a budget reconciliation that requires ten-year revenue neutrality. Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s historic tax reform plan actually fits on a single sheet of paper, with just a dozen key bullet points: Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a video clip of Steven Mnuchin being quizzed about Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s elusive tax returns: Q: Analysis of Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tax returns from 2005 show that without the Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT) he would have only paid \u00c2\u00a35.3m of tax.. So doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t that show that these tax reforms will benefit the president and his companies? This plan is about \u00e2\u20ac\u0153creating jobs and creating economic growth\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, Mnuchin insists. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re talking about massive tax cuts, massive tax reforms, simplifying the system. The AMT is just a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153third complicated set of rules\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, he insists [explainer: AMT is a supplementary income tax aimed at preventing the richest people avoiding tax] And that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the end of the session -- Spicer, Cohn and Mnuchin exit smartly, as a reporter shouts whether Trump might yet change his mind about releasing his tax returns. Q: Will these plans mean president Trump pays more or less tax? I can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t comment on the president\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tax situation since I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have access to that, Mnuchin smiles. Our objective is the reduction in taxes is offset by significant reductionin deductions and other items. So the effective tax rate is what we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re focused on, he adds. Q: What does this proposal mean for American families watching from home? It means a tax cut, national economics director Gary Cohn promises. Q: How much? We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll let you know as soon as the final details are agreed, Cohn promises. The elephant in the room rears its trunk... Q: Will the president release his tax returns? Trump has \u00e2\u20ac\u0153no intention\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd of releasing his tax returns, Mnuchin replies. He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s released \u00e2\u20ac\u0153plenty of information....I think the US population has plenty of information.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Q: This is just one page - just a statement of principles. When do we see full details? We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re working as fast as we can, Mnuchin replies. Q: When would the Death Tax be repealed? Our initial proposal is to phase it out immediately, as son as this new tax package is passed into law, Cohn replies. Q: Is there a danger that Republicans won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t support this package, as with Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s healthcare reforms? There is a lot of desire from everyone to reform the tax system, Mnuchin replies. We have agreement on the core principles of this package. Q: Will this package pay for itself? We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re working on the details, says Mnuchin, before promising: This will pay for itself with extra growth, and by reducing tax deductions and closing loopholes. Gary Cohn also wades in, declaring that the plan will cut debt as a percentage of GDP. In other words, the economy would grow faster than the national debt. Q: You talked about repealing the 3.8% Obamacare rate that hits small businesses - is this the first attempt to start pulling Obamacare back? We are trying to get rid of that tax so we can get more capital back into the economy and stimulate business investment, says Cohn. Q: What do you say to critics who say this package is about helping corporations, not reforming the tax code? This package is about growing the economy and creating jobs, Cohn replies. Asked for more details about the plans, Cohn says the administration is still working with the House and the Senate to agree final details. The goal is to simplify the tax system, lower rates, and make the system fairer, he adds. Q: What are the income boundaries for the new 10%, 25% and 35% tax brackets? Cohn won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t say - only that there is a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcbroad brush\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 view of where they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be back to you with very firm details, he promises. Now Treasury secretary Steven Mnuchin speaks, confirming that the US corporation tax rate will fall to 15%. Small and medium-sized firms will benefit, he pledges, not just big business. Mnuchin also confirms a tax repatriation holiday for businesses who have got cash piles stacked overseas, but doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t give details. Cohn predicts that the Trump administration will be attacked from both sides, but he wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t bet against the president getting this plan through. As rumoured, the plan cuts the number of tax brackets to three, from seven. We will repeal the Death Tax on American\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s estates, says Cohn -- something West Wing fans will be familiar with. Trump is creating a new zero-rate tax band, Cohn says, that means married couples won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t pay tax on the first $24,000 they earn. Cohn outlines how complicated the US tax code has become - it now comes with 211 pages of instructions. Americans spend 7 billion hours complying with tax codes each year, he declares - and almost everyone needs some help filling the form in. Gary Cohn speaks first. This is a historic day, he says - a once in a generation opportunity. The president is going to lead the most significant tax reform legislation sine 1986, and one of the biggest tax cuts in history. Many of the key principles have already been agreed with Congress, Cohn continues, and the administration will work hard over the next few weeks to get a full agreement. Tax reform is \u00e2\u20ac\u02dclong overdue\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, he continues - both for business and families, especially low and middle-income ones. The session is underway - press secretary Sean Spicer jokes that he didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t expect such a big audience for an announcement about the Antiquities Act (tee hee....) I think this live feed should let you watch Mnuchin and Cohn in action.... Some Republicans are already concerned that Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s plan is all about tax cuts, and not really about reforms at all. CNN has the details: House Speaker Paul Ryan put a positive spin on things during his own news conference Wednesday, but things are far from great behind the scenes. The Trump administration has ruffled GOP feathers on Capitol Hill, by getting in the way of legislators efforts to fix the tax system. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not tax reform,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said one senior GOP aide. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Not even close.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re expecting to hear details of the tax reform plan very shortly.... While we wait to hear from Steven Mnuchin (and Gary Cohn) here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a video clip of him speaking earlier today: CNBC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Eamon Javers has heard that Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s plan might eliminate some tax exemptions (which allow people to lower their overall bill) It was not a convincing display, but this week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s market rally which began with Emmanuel Macron\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s victory in the first round of the French election and was then fuelled by the prospect of Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tax cuts, has continued for another day. Ahead of the confirmation of the US president\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s plans European markets ended higher, helped by a positive morning on Wall Street. There was still some caution in Europe, as investors awaited Thursday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meeting of the European Central Bank, which will be carefully scrutinised for any hints that the bank might begin withdrawing its economic stimulus measures. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished up 13.08 points or 0.18% at 7288.72 Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax edged up 0.05% at 12,472.80 France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac closed 0.19% higher at 5287.88 Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB rose 0.15% to 20,836.51 But Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ibex ended down 0.18% at 10,763.4 In Greece, the Athens market added 1.3% to 706.40 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently 56 points or 0.27% higher. Not everyone is upbeat about Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s corporation tax reform. ActionAid head of policy Anna Thomas said: President Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s plan to slash the corporate tax rate risks triggering a global race to the bottom, which could see companies paying minimal taxes around the world. Despite public outrage at corporate tax scandals involving the likes of Google and Amazon, big companies look set to benefit from historically low rates. The IMF has found that when countries try to undercut each other on tax, poorer countries suffer the most. They are particularly dependent on corporation tax and stand to lose the most as they come under pressure to offer ever-lower tax rates to big companies. Healthcare, schools and other key public services are left starved of resources as they are deprived of tax revenues, hitting women and girls hardest. There are reported details of further US tax reforms, in addition to the cut to corporation tax. Individual tax bands of 10%, 25% and 35% are being proposed, apparently: Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a comparison of various countries\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 corporate tax rates: US markets have come to life ahead of the Trump tax announcement. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is now up 67 points and is just 100 points shy of its record high of 21,169 hit on 1 March this year. If the market likes what it hears from Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s administration, that barrier could soon be breached. Meanwhile Nasdaq, which did hit a record high on Tuesday, has edged higher, with many of its technology constituents likely to benefit from the tax changes. Joshua Mahony, market analyst at IG, said: Global markets have continued in a buoyant mood today, thanks to optimism about the impending tax reforms in the US. Despite a significant degree of political uncertainty still evident in Europe, there is a feeling that worst is over, with markets instead focusing on the Trump trade coming back into play. Unlike other more nuanced political and economic changes, a huge corporate tax cut would make a huge difference to the bottom line of US-based businesses. For investors, this impending shift in profitability is a huge attraction to invest in the US, and hence the outperformance of the American markets relative to Europe. Over in Greece, as long-stalled bailout negotiations finally resume, prime minister Alexis Tsipras has been causing ripples warning that while parliament may legislate creditor-demanded reforms, the painful measures may never be implemented if the country isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t given debt relief. From Athens our correspondent Helena Smith reports: With the timing of a maestro, Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s leftist leader used the first day of reactivated bailout talks to deliver a stern message: without promised debt relief the pension cuts and tax hikes Athens has now agreed to as part of a bigger package to unlock further emergency loans will never be enforced. In a live TV interview aired late Tuesday, Tsipras said it was Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s right as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153as sovereign government\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to reverse the measures (the equivalent of 2 % of GDP and due to be enacted as of 1.1.2019) if lenders didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t also honour pledges to offer medium-term debt relief that would allow the economy to breathe. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153They will not be implemented if we do not have a solution to the debt,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he told ANT 1 TV. While the controversial cuts worth \u00e2\u201a\u00ac3.6bn would be approved by parliament in the coming weeks, Tsipras insisted it was within Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sovereign right \u00e2\u20ac\u0153to take back something that had been voted if the agreement wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t upheld.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Predicting that the progress review would be completed in time for the next eurogroup on May 22 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c averting the prospect of crisis being replayed when Greece is called to meet \u00e2\u201a\u00ac7.5bn of maturing debt in July \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Tsipras argued that the review was no ordinary report card but part of a much broader agreement that would allow the country to finally recover from eight years of crisis. While Athens had been forced to make concessions, it had also won the ability to enforce \u00e2\u20ac\u0153counter measures\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to offset losses when Greece hit budget targets and secured valuable labour rights that the IMF had wanted to abolish. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We must not see this review as a review that only concerns the bailout programme. It is the most critical review. Why? Because we have a comprehensive agreement,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said in the interview. Unlike the American Petroleum Institute figures out on Tuesday, the latest official figures on crude stocks show a surprise fall in inventories. The API said stocks rose last week by 897,000 barrels but figures from the Energy Information Administration show a weekly fall of 3.64m barrels to 528.7m. This is higher than the forecast fall of 1.7m barrels. Gasoline stocks however rose by 3.37m barrels compared to expectations of a 1m barrel fall. Brent crude, which had earlier fallen as low as $51.38 a barrel is now up 0.19% at $52.2. The API report is an industry one while the EIA is a government publication. Here is more on the two reports, which are often aligned but sometimes contradict each other. Investors are awaiting more details on the Trump tax plan, hence the muted reaction in the markets so far, says Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex: Financial Analyst Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s confirmation that Donald Trump is seeking to cut corporation tax to just 15% did little for the markets this afternoon. Mnuchin echoed the President in an interview on CNBC, promising the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcbiggest tax cut\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 and \u00e2\u20ac\u02dclargest tax reform in US history\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. Yet this hyperbole was treated as just that by the Dow Jones, which nudged a mere 0.1% higher after the bell. Even the dollar was nonplussed, maintaining 0.3% and 0.5% rises against the euro and Japanese yen respectively while sitting flat against sterling. The fact investors failed to react to the Treasury Sec\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s headline tax cut announcement suggests that they are looking for more detail, especially the red flags that may cause any proposed bill to go the same way as Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s healthcare reforms. There is also every chance that the bulk of the tax plan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s market-boosting juice was used up yesterday, leaving little room for extra growth following the Mnuchin/Cohn press conference later this evening. Elsewhere oil prices are slipping back ahead of new official US crude inventory data from the Energy Information Administration. Earlier in the week industry figures from the American Petroleum Institute showed crude stockpiles rose by 897,000 barrels last week, compared to expectations of a 1.7m fall. The report indicated the difficulty producers are having in reducing supplies despite cuts in output, which have been offset by growing production from US shale companies. Brent crude is currently down nearly 1% at $51.60 a barrel while West Texas Intermediate - the US benchmark - has dipped 0.8% to $49.16. Confirmation of at least one part of Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s US tax proposals - corporation tax cut to 15% - has done little for US markets, but at least they have opened higher rather than lower as originally expected. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is up nearly 7 points while the S&amp;P 500 is virtually flat and Nasdaq Composite is 1.45 points better. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our first take on the proposed US tax reforms, with a corporation tax to 15% now confirmed by Treasury secretary Mnuchin: Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s more details of the Mnuchin interview, and some early reaction: Nice work by The Hill and CNBC there, getting early confirmation from the Treasury secretary about Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tax reform plans. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s CNBC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s early take: Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin confirmed that the tax plan the Trump administration will outline Wednesday afternoon will call for a 15% corporate rate. At an event hosted by The Hill, Mnuchin \u00e2\u20ac\u201d who declined to go into many specifics about the proposal \u00e2\u20ac\u201d contended it would be \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the biggest tax cut and the largest tax reform in the history of our country.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Mnuchin and White House chief economic advisor Gary Cohn are expected to go into more detail about the plan at a briefing later in the day. When Trump floated a 15 % corporate tax rate as a candidate, most analyses of the proposal estimated that it would balloon the deficit. It is unclear what the proposal would do to raise revenue to offset those major cuts, and Mnuchin declined to say how specifically the administration would pay for the 15% rate. Asked about the US debt ceiling, Steven Mnuchin says an agreement must be done in the fall (that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the autumn, UK readers) to create headroom for more borrowing. He doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to get into the details of any potential deal, though. On the US economy, Mnuchin says he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s confident that 3% per-year growth can be achieved [up from just 1.6% last year]. Newsflash: America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s treasury secretary has just confirmed that Donald Trump wants to cut business taxes to just 15%. Speaking to CNBC ahead of today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s official announcement, Steven Mnuchin says: I can confirm that the business tax rate will be 15%. This will deliver on Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s campaign pledge to cut corporation tax, and stimulate growth and job creation, the Treasury secretary explains. The aim is to cut the taxes paid by small businesses, Mnuchin continues, rather than create a loophope for the rich. Mnuchin adds that the Trump administration want to simplify the US tax code. We have a fundamental agreement with Congress about tax reforms, Mnuchin explains, but the details need to be worked out. The interview is being streamed live here. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Wall Street open will be more whimper than bang, with the Dow expected to open broadly unchanged. The pound has taken the opportunity to claw back a little ground against the euro today, up 0.2% to \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.178. Chris Saint, senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, says: Sterling has bounced off a two-week low of \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.1718 versus the euro to trade around half a cent higher at \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.1771 by noon, although euro strength is generally still being underpinned by ongoing expectations that Emmanuel Macron will defeat Eurosceptic candidate Marine Le Pen in the second round of the French presidential elections on 7 May. Social networking site Twitter has defied its critics and posted better than expected financial result. Shares in Twitter are soaring in pre-market trading after it reported earnings of 11 cents per share (on a non-GAAP basis) up from the 1 cent per share which Wall Street expected. Twitter also signed up an extra 9 million users in the last quarter, and now has 6% more users than a year ago. But despite that, Twitter\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s revenues declined in the quarter to $548 million, down 8% on a year ago. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re proud to report accelerating growth in daily active usage for the fourth consecutive quarter, up 14% year-over-year,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Jack Dorsey, Twitter\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s CEO, warns that Twitter continues to face \u00e2\u20ac\u0153revenue headwinds\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, but believes it will return to positive revenue growth in the long term. Traders are optimistic; Twitter shares have surged by 11% in the New York grey market. Former UK prime minister David Cameron apparently told friends recently it was time to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153put some hay in the barn\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, after swapping Downing Street for the speaking circuit. By that measure, Barack Obama may need a second barn - after agreeing to give a speech to Cantor Fitzgerald for $400,000.... Newsflash: One of the employment agencies at the centre of the workplace problems at Sports Direct is preparing for insolvency. My colleague Simon Goodley explains: Transline, the temporary employment agency that became embroiled in the Sports Direct scandal, has submitted court documents preparing the company for insolvency. The Guardian understands that the business has filed a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153notice of intention of appointing administrators\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd at a court in Leeds, and has sounded out the accountancy firm Deloitte as a potential administrator. The \u00e2\u20ac\u0153notice of intention to appointment\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd is a device to give notice to secured creditors that there is a chance or prospect of an administration process. It also creates a moratorium around the business from action by creditors for 10 working days. Transline hit the headlines last year, over its \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcsix strikes\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 policy that penalised workers for trivial actions like \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcexcessive talking\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 or taking time off to nurse an ill child. It has also been facing backpay claims from Sports Direct staff who received less than the minimum wage, due to security checks. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the full story: It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been one of those mornings... It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been a good morning for Yorkshire-based chemicals company Croda. Shares in the FTSE-listed firm hit a record high this morning, up 4.8%, after it reported a blistering 19% jump in revenues in the last quarter. It confirms that UK companies are benefitting from the fall in sterling since the EU referendum (Croda\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sales were only up 5% in \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcconstant currency\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 terms). Croda aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t exactly a household name, but its chemicals go into a swathe of products - from beauty products and Omega 3 fish oil to paints and adhesives. Is some UK economic data being leaked early, and is someone profiting from it? The Wall Street Journal has examined how the pound performs around major data releases, and found that it typically starts to move before the news hits the wires. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fuelling concerns that some people may be illicitly profiting from embargoed information. The WSJ\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Mike Bird explains: During the hour before unexpectedly strong or weak U.K. data is made public, the pound moved 0.065% versus the dollar on average in the same direction it subsequently did after those numbers came out, according to an analysis prepared for The Wall Street Journal by Alexander Kurov, associate professor of finance at West Virginia University. It showed that the average change in the pound\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s value one hour before and after such economic data announcements is 0.127%, meaning around half the shift associated with the statistics came ahead of their official release This is significant because UK data is shared with a wide number of government insiders (from ministers to press officers) before it is released. This creates the potential for a leak -- unlike in Sweden, say, where no-one outside the statistics office gets a sniff before the official release. And the Swedish krona is much less likely to pre-empt a data announcement: More here: Are U.K. Traders Getting an Early Glimpse at Government Data? Currency Markets Suggest Yes Kathleen Brooks of City Index has released a very useful note outlining the Trump tax proposals, and the likely political hurdles. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a flavour: Will Congress back Trump this time? In theory this tax plan looks like it should extend the rally for US stocks. If taxes are slashed then some large US firms may re-base themselves back in the US to take advantage of the 15% rate, which might encourage them to engage in shareholder-friendly activities such as share buy-backs, larger dividends etc. However, stocks may pause on Wednesday as the market waits for the reaction from Congress who actually has to pass the bill. The pesky debt ceiling remains crucial problem for Congress The problem for the Republican -controlled Congress is the debt ceiling, which was breached back in March but has been massaged by some accounting measures until the end of this month. Congress is trying to pass a budget that will fund the Federal Government from 28th April, however, an unfunded tax cut from the Trump administration could add to the pressure on the debt ceiling going forward. Thus, Republicans have to balance their desire to reduce the Budget deficit, with their desire to boost the economy with a large cut to the corporate tax rate. If they do the latter, as many expect, then this could be a green light for US stock markets. Infrastructure plan, what infrastructure plan? This makes Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s infrastructure plan, which has been suspiciously absent from the coverage of the tax blueprint, very unlikely to go ahead. The Trump team is likely to focus on the fact a tax cut can pay for itself and create jobs, but can it do that at the same pace of a large government-spending programme? On balance, we expect markets to outperform in the coming days if key members of Congress throw their weight behind Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tax proposals. But, if there are any signs that this won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get through the US legislature, then we could see big declines for US stocks. European stock markets will probably have closed before we hear details of Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tax proposals. According to The Hill, an announcement is expected at 1.30pm Washington time, or 6.30pm BST. They also predict that Secretary of the Treasury Steven Mnuchin and National Economic Director Gary Cohn will present the plans; Trump is busy holding a session on North Korea, with Secretary of State Rex Tillerson. After two solid days, European stock markets are taking a little breather. The UK, French and German indices have all dipped in early trading: Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tax reforms plans are the number one issue in the City today, says Naeem Aslam of Think Markets. He sounds a little sceptical about the whole thing, though: Currently, one major aspect of his plan which everyone is talking about is the corporate rate tax cut to 15% from its current rate of 35%. He can certainly cut that to 15% but that would only be good enough to produce a mammoth headline on the newswire. But, the question which you need to ask is how long it will take for that tax rate to become effective if it becomes effective at all. The market may go higher on the back of these flashy headlines but it will not take long before reality catches up with it. Last weekend\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s French elections continues to reassure traders, says Chris Weston of IG: It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a good time to hold equity and credit and it seems a dark cloud in the form of the French elections has swiftly departed from the investment landscape, combining effectively with headlines on Trump tax reform and in turn providing fresh impetus to chase returns. The prospect of sweeping tax reforms in America has helped to drive Asian stock markets higher today. Japan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Nikkei has closed 1% higher, and the other main indices are also gaining ground. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a buoyant mood in the markets today, keeping indices at their highest ever levels. Yesterday the MSCI World Index hit a record high, helped by optimism over European politics and hopes of chunky tax cuts in America. That sent Wall Street racing last night, with the Nasdaq hitting 6,000 points for the first time ever. And traders expect to hold onto these gains today: Three factors are working together to keep shares up, and thwart those who think the rally has gone two far. 1) The Europe effect. Investors seem pretty convinced that Emmanuel Macron will defeat Marine Le Pen on May 7th, and become France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s next president. Cautious voices point out that Macron faces a serious struggle to get his reform agenda moving - especially if his En Marche! party don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t make big wins in June\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s elections. 2) Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tax reforms. The US president is expected to outline fiscal plans today, including slashing corporation tax from 35% to just 15%. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s alarmed some experts, with one estimating that it could cost $2 trillion in revenue. But lower taxes = higher profits = higher share prices. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also optimism that a budget deal can be reached to prevent a government shutdown, with Trump apparently giving ground over his Mexican Wall plan: 3) Decent corporate earnings. Yesterday, fast food chain McDonald\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s and equipment maker Caterpillar both beat forecasts, bolstering hopes that the global economy is on firmer footings. Mike van Dulken of Accendo Markets explains: US equity markets continues their sharp jump higher in anticipation of the Trump administration\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tax reform announcement, with the tech-focused Nasdaq trading above 6,000 for the very first time, while both the S&amp;P500 and Dow Jones indices move closer to their respective all-time highs. Strong Q1 earnings performances from Caterpillar, McDonald\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s and DuPont led the Dow over 200 points higher, while the Materials sector led the S&amp;P to within 20 points of a fresh high. Shane Oliver, head of investment strategy at AMP Capital Investors in Sydney, agrees that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Confidence has returned\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, adding: Markets seem a lot more relaxed. Globally, we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re seeing a lot of risk-on.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not much in the economic diary today. On the corporate front, the London Stock Exchange, Jupiter Fund Management, Metro Bank, chemicals firm Croda and German carmaker Daimler are reporting results this morning. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be tracking all the main events through the day....",

The Lloyds investigation is welcome, but a mess It is understandable that Lloyds Banking Group feels the need to answer definitively the charge that its board and executives were complacent about fraud at the Reading branch of HBOS. The bank has appointed Dame Linda Dobbs, a retired high court judge, to examine whether Lloyds handled the matter properly and met its reporting obligations after buying HBOS in 2009. The fraud, for which six people were jailed in February, ran from 2003 to 2007, but victims have long argued that Lloyds wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t listen to their complaints after the takeover. That allegation is serious, and an investigation is overdue. Everybody happy then? Not really. The natural investigator is the Financial Conduct Authority, which is supposedly on the job. The regulator\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s inquiry into HBOS Reading, which was suspended in 2013 when Thames Valley police leapt into action, reopened last month. The primary focus may be on what HBOS did under its own steam, but Lloyds\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 actions after it bought the ailing lender will also be under the microscope. Indeed, Lloyds will not be allowed to publish the Dobbs report or any of its findings until the FCA says so. Put another way, Lloyds has launched an \u00e2\u20ac\u0153independent\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd inquiry into itself that won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be regarded as independent or credible until the regulator allows. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s good that this affair is getting the attention it deserves, but the process is a mess.",

GW AFP have a good write-up of Mario Draghi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s comments about US trade politics: ECB chief Mario Draghi said Thursday that the threat of protectionism may be diminishing, sounding a cautiously optimistic tone amid global fears that Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s America First policy could spark trade wars. Asked what he had learnt about the Trump administration\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economic policies during a recent trip to the US, Draghi replied: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153One has to be very tentative in this, one thing that may have come out of the meetings is that perhaps the risk of trade protectionism may have somewhat receded.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Draghi did not go into details, but his assessment came at a time when major international organisations including the World Bank, IMF and OECD have been warning about rising risks of protectionism. With a nationalist economic agenda, the Trump administration has vowed to upend decades of prevailing trade policy by renegotiating or scrapping trade agreements, imposing hefty tariffs and moving to bilateral trade agreements. The US had also refused at a G20 meeting in March to renew a long-standing anti-protectionist pledge, to the dismay of the group of top developed and developing nations. Timothy Graf, head of macro strategy at State Street Global Markets, says the ECB is unwilling to change course, even though the economy is improving and political risks are fading: Low core inflation is clearly weighing in their minds, suggesting policymaker caution will dominate for at least a few more meetings. While the second half of the year might get more interesting if the better run of data continues and core inflation starts to trend higher, asset purchase levels and benchmark rates will likely hold for at least the next few meetings. Bill Adams, economist at the PNC Financial Services Group, enjoyed Draghi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s slapdown of Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s finance minister: Draghi pushed back against criticism of the ECB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s monetary policy from Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Finance Wolfgang Sch\u00c3\u00a4uble by calling it \u00e2\u20ac\u0153ironic\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd that a supporter of independent monetary policy would criticize that the outcome of that independence. This statement immediately followed Draghi saying he doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t comment on the statements of politicians. This is the closest you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll ever see to a central banker saying \u00e2\u20ac\u0153haters gonna hate.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The ECB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s monetary policymaking process is well insulated from political pressure. Ranko Berich, Head of Market Analysis at Monex Europe, says the ECB has shown that its asset purchase programme is \u00e2\u20ac\u02dchere to stay for now\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The crux of today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s presser was the fact that even though growth has improved and certain Governing Council members are more \u00e2\u20ac\u0153sanguine\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd about economic risks, the inflation outlook has not improved sufficiently for the ECB to formally consider an end to QE. Anyone hoping for a barn-storming performance from Mario Draghi today will have been disappointed. The simple message from the ECB today is that the eurozone recovery is strengthening and broadening, with risks diminishing ; but the inflation outlook looks subdued, so there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s little pressure to consider tightening monetary policy. Draghi did paint an encouraging picture, saying: The signs of a stronger global recovery and increasing global trade suggest that foreign demand should increasingly add to the overall resilience of the economic expansion of the euro area. But despite that, Draghi insists that it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s too early to withdraw stimulus: A very substantial degree of monetary accommodation is still needed for underlying inflation pressures to build up and support headline inflation in the medium-term. In terms of my criteria the (inflation) assessment hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t really changed. The reaction of the euro says it all - rising when Draghi talked up the recovery, but diving once the ECB president sounded dovish on inflation. Draghi was nimble enough to avoid saying anything controversial about the French election, declaring: In the Governing Council meetings we discuss policies, not politics. (behind the scenes, he must be crossing his fingers and hoping for a Macron win, of course). He went a little further when asked about Donald Trump, suggesting that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153perhaps the risk of trade protectionism may have somewhat receded.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. And Draghi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s call for more help for the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dclosers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 of globalisation underlined how the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcelite\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 have woken up to the social problems building in Europe (although he made similar comments last September too). Q: What headline would you write to sum up today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meeting? The headline, giggles Draghi, is... The risks surrounding the eurozone growth outlook, while moving to a more balanced configuration, are still tilted to the downside and relate predominantly to global factors. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m sure some of us have written worse.... And that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the end of the press conference. Summary and reaction to follow.... The press pack are demanding more answers from Draghi about the French elections. Q: Surely the battle between pro-EU Emmanuel Macron and anti-EU Marine Le Pen is a concern? The governing council discusses policies, not politics, Draghi reiterates firmly. But he has also conceded that the ECB does \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcinternalise\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 information about potential political uncertainty which might affect its ability to get inflation on target in the medium-term. Draghi is making some rather dovish noises about the inflation outlook: He also touched on Brexit, warning against thinking that the negative consequences of Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s EU referendum are over. Draghi has called for eurozone politicians to do more to help those who have lost out from globalisation. It would be a mistake to ignore the social unease across the eurozone, the ECB chief warns. It is clear that globalisation had \u00e2\u20ac\u0153extraordinary benefits\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, Draghi explains, but \u00e2\u20ac\u0153it also created losers who were not taken into account of several years\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. There should be greater social consideration for those who don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t benefit, or lose out, he concludes. Q: What did you learn about the situation in the US during your trip to Washington for the IMF/World Bank meeting? One thing that may have come out of the meetings is that the risk of trade protectionism may have receded, Draghi replies cautiously. Draghi says the ECB did not discuss changing its forward guidance (to maintain interest rates at present or lower levels). Q: Did the ECB discuss its exit strategy from its asset purchase scheme, and how it would communicate it? We did not, Draghi says. He adds that growth is improving, the recovery is broad and solid Draghi then takes aim at claims that its stimulus programme have created more inequality. He points out that eurozone unemployment has fallen to its lowest level since the crisis began. There is no better measure of increased equality than by increasing employment. The euro is a little volatile as Draghi speaks. It rose to $1.903 when Draghi declared that downside risks have fallen, only to drop back as he says there isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t enough evidence to change the ECB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s inflation outlook. Q: Six years ago, the ECB raised interest rates too early, forcing you to cut them. Is that experience influencing policy this time? Draghi says he doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t quite understand the logic of the question. In 2011, inflation was above target - today, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not, so there isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t the same pressure to raise borrowing costs. Draghi is in a feisty mood! He slaps down a question about criticism from German finance minister Wolfgang Schauble, saying it was ironic to hear this from someone who supports central bank independence. Q: Did any governing council members disagree about where the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcbalance of risks\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 lies? Draghi says there was a discussion, everyone agreed that the risk outlook is improving, but still tilted to the downside. Onto questions. Q: Did the French election, and the prospect of Emmanuel Macron becoming president, influence your decisions this month? We don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t set monetary policy based on election outcomes, Draghi shoots back Nice snap summary of Draghi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s statement: Draghi ends with his usual call for eurozone governments to do their bit, saying other policy areas must contribute \u00e2\u20ac\u0153much more decisively\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. The eurozone still needs a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153very substantial degree of monetary accommodation\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in order to get inflation back to a sustained level of 2%. Draghi says that underlining inflationary pressures are still low, and predicts that inflation will probably remain around its current levels until the end of the year. Economic indicators suggest that the eurozone economic recovery is increasingly solid, Draghi declares. And importantly, he adds that downside risks to the eurozone have diminished. But... risks are still tilted to the downside - due to global factors - Draghi adds. That means the ECB hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t yet reached the point where it thinks risks are broadly-balanced - a situation where it might start paring back its stimulus programme. Mario Draghi begins by reading out the key points from today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s statement - namely that: Interest rates remain unchanged. The Governing Council continues to expect the key ECB interest rates to remain at present or lower levels for an extended period of time The bond-buying stimulus programme is expected to run at \u00e2\u201a\u00ac60bn per month until the end of December 2017, or beyond The ECB could increase the size or duration of the programme, if needed Mario Draghi is late! Ah...here he comes now. Mario Draghi is about to face the press pack in Frankfurt, to explain today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decisions. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a live feed from the ECB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s headquarters: With exquisite timing, Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s inflation rate has risen to 2% this month. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s up from 1.5% in March, according to figures just released by the Federal Statistics Office. This is slightly above the ECB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s target for euro area inflation, and will put more pressure on the ECB to consider winding back its stimulus programme. Ana Boata, European economist at trade credit insurer Euler Hermes, predicts that eurozone interest rates will stay on hold until 2019. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s why: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The Eurozone economy is strengthening, but we don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t expect the ECB to start raising interest rates until 2019. The most likely scenario is that interest rates increase to two per cent by 2022, which will push interest payments for the total private sector up by \u00e2\u201a\u00ac160 billion compared to their current level, a moderate increase. There are no significant changes in the language of today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ECB statement, compared to the one released after March\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meeting. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s some instant reaction to the ECB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision: Newsflash: The European Central Bank has left borrowing costs across the eurozone unchanged. That means the headline interest rate remains at 0%, an alltime low. The governing council has also vote to leave its deposit facility rate at -0.4% . That means banks must suffer a negative interest rate when they leave cash in the ECB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s vaults. The ECB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s marginal lending facility - charged on banks when they borrow from the ECB - stays at 0.25%. The ECB has also voted to leave its stimulus programme unchanged, meaning it will keep buying \u00e2\u201a\u00ac60bn of new bonds each month. It adds that it could boost, or cut, the programme, depending how the recovery shapes up: If the outlook becomes less favourable, or if financial conditions become inconsistent with further progress towards a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation, the Governing Council stands ready to increase the programme in terms of size and/or duration. Tension is building.... ....up to a point, anyway.... Economists at Societe Generale predict that the ECB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s governing council will sound more optimistic about growth today, but resist making any major changes to their language. They say: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The ECB will likely acknowledge a further improvement in the balance of risks by pointing to upside risks to growth, However, no material changes to its dovish communication are likely and we only expect the medium-term risks to be described as balanced in June.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Kathleen Brooks of City Index also expect Mario Draghi to sound restrained: After all, the risks to inflation - CPI dipped in March - are still tilted to the downside and this could be one reason to delay tapering. The other reason is the precarious state of the Italian banking sector. Its banks hold the largest amount of bad debt in all of Europe. If the ECB reduces the amount of liquidity in the European financial system too quickly then it is hard to see how these banks can recapitalise themselves, and avoid selling off some of their bad debts at a book value so low that it hits their capital position. This could ultimately cause a much bigger problem for the ECB and the wider European banking sector. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ECB meeting could be rather a damp squib, I fear. The central bank won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to rock the eurozone boat before the French election is over. Craig Erlam, senior market analyst at OANDA , says \u00e2\u20ac\u0153very little\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd is expected from the ECB: The meeting falls in between the first and second round of the French Presidential elections, with eurosceptic Marine Le Pen one of the two candidates set to battle it out for the Presidency on 7 May. While the central bank may want to avoid appearing to interfere in the election, it will be interesting to see whether the reference to downside risks is scaled back in order to avoid playing into Le Pen\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hands, or whether they talk up the progress achieved this year and the improved prospects for the region. Over in Frankfurt, the European Central Bank is wrapping up this month\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s monetary policy meeting. In less than 45 minutes, we learn whether the ECB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s governing council voted to change interest rates or tweak its stimulus programme (spoiler alert: almost certainly not). There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a small chance that it will adjust the language in today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s statement. If not, all eyes and ears will turn to the press conference at 1.30pm BST, when Mario Draghi will field questions from the press. The big question is when the ECB might begin the process of slowing (or tapering) its bond-buying stimulus programme. IG Group\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Josh Mahony says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The big question is when we will hear from the ECB regarding a potential tapering of the current asset purchase facility. Draghi has already said that the eventual unwinding of the quantitative easing (QE) programme will involve a tapering of the asset purchase size, the timeline of which we will have to see laid out in advance. With that in mind, it is always worth noting that at some point, we will face the repercussions of a more hawkish Draghi, and the market response to such an event. Will it be this week? Probably not. The CBI\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s monthly healthcheck on Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s retail sector suggests that sales jumped this month as consumers kept spending. Around 59% of retailers surveyed said that sales volumes were up in April on a year ago, whilst 21% said they were down, giving a balance of +38%. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the highest balance since September 2015. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a bit of a surprise, given concerns over higher inflation. This survey is quite volatile (and only tracks 112 firms), so we should be cautious. Clothing and grocery sales were particularly strong, apparently -- perhaps warmer weather encouraged shoppers to buy summer outfits and even risk a barbeque?! But...the CBI predicts that growth will slow in May, as rising inflation hits the high street. Howard Archer of IHS Global Insight agrees that consumers will cut back: There is also a strong likelihood that consumer confidence and willingness to buy major items will soften \u00e2\u20ac\u201c as it is not only pressurized by weakened purchasing power but also by increasing concerns over the economy and jobs as growth likely slows and uncertainties are magnified by Brexit coming more to the forefront now that Article 50 has been triggered. Wall Street is expected to open flat in nearly four hours time, as traders await reaction to Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tax plan. Marc Ostwald of ADM Investor Services says there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153clear sense of anti-climax in markets\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd about the lack of nitty-gritty released yesterday. That means Congress will now \u00e2\u20ac\u0153chisel out\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd the details, he adds. Breaking: Economic confidence in the eurozone has jumped this month, to its highest level since the financial crisis struck. The EC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s monthly economic sentiment survey, just released, has jumped to 109.6 this month, up from 108 in March. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the best reading since August 2007. A narrower measure of business confidence also rose sharply, with builders, industrial firms and service sector companies all more upbeat. This will bolster hopes that the European economy is strengthening. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re not exactly in \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcboom\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 territory yet, but recent data has definitely shown growth is pretty solid. This probably won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be enough to encourage the ECB to alter its policy stance at today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meeting, but it shows why some economists expect a change in language in June. Pensions are a hot topic in the UK right now, with speculation that the Conservative Party might drop the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dctriple-lock\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 (a pledge that pensions rise by 2.5% per year, or in line with earnings or inflation if they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re higher). But the OECD thinktank argues that Britain should go further, and stop giving anything to richer pensioners. Mark Pearson, deputy director of employment, labour and social affairs with the OECD, has told the Financial Times that the system is under strain, with more people reaching pension age. Pearson says politicians face a choice - and means-testing the pension could be the answer. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Faced with these pressures, are you going to ask people of working age to pay more, or people to work longer before they can claim their pension? \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Or another way to ensure an adequate pension is to think about whether the pension should only be paid to those who really need it, to ease the tyranny of the maths. Giving less [pension] to the people at the top would free up resources to increase general benefits.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our story on his comments: Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s housebuilders appear to be doing well, despite the uncertainty created by Brexit. Persimmon and Taylor Wimpey have both reported solid result this morning, pushing their shares up 0.8% and 0.5% respectively. Persimmon\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s total forward sales revenue is up 11% year-on-year, while Taylor Wimpey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s order book is 2% higher. Taylor Wimpey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s CEO Pete Redfern says he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s optimistic that the UK general election won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t disrupt the market. As well as the tax reform plan, investors are also digesting the surprise news that Donald Trump no longer wants to abolish the NAFTA free trade agreement. This huuuge u-turn broke last night, after talks with the leaders of Canada and Mexico: The whole episode is a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcshambles\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, says Kathleen Brooks of City Index, who writes: Overall, this suggests that both communication and policy decision making are a shambles at the White House right now, with extreme and more moderate forces vying to get Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s attention. Overall, this Nafta issue highlights that policy implementation risk is surging under the Trump administration, and could stoke volatility if it continues. The dollar has also dipped this morning, taking the greenback close to its lowest level in five months. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pushed sterling back over $1.29. FXTM Chief Market Strategist Hussein Sayed says investors are sceptical that Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s proposed cuts will get through Congress: The lack of details contained on Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s single piece of paper was perceived as a publicity stunt for the President as he celebrates his first one hundred days in the Oval Office, and unfortunately, seemed more of a wish list than a serious starting point. UK bank Lloyds is defying the selloff, with its shares jumping 4% at the open. The City is impressed that Lloyds has doubled its profits in the last quarter, as its recovery from the financial crisis continues. But there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a wrinkle -- it has set aside another \u00c2\u00a3350m to compensate customers who were missold PPI, plus \u00c2\u00a3100m for victims of fraud at its HBOS branch in Reading. Connor Campbell of SpreadEx sums up the problem with Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tax plan - Not Enough Detail! Alongside cutting corporate tax rates to 15%, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and National Economic Council director Gary Cohn revealed that the USA\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 7 tax brackets would be reduced to 3, while the alternative minimum tax would be slashed and nearly all of the current tax deductions eliminated. Yet when pressed for more information, specifically if these reforms would be revenue neutral, the pair came up short, producing some Trumped up rhetoric about how it would pay for itself through \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcgrowth, reduction of deductions and closing loopholes\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 and that the administration had a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dconce in-a-generation opportunity to do something really big\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the damage across Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s markets this morning: Hopes that Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economic council would offer some surprises in yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tax plan have been dashed, says Mike van Dulken of Accendo Markets. He adds: In focus today will be fallout from Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tax announcement, having disappointed by being merely a proposal framework and still facing the same Congressional hurdle (deficit hawks on both sides of the aisle) that he was unable to clear with Healthcare reform. European stock markets have fallen at the start of trading as traders give their verdict on Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tax policies. In London, the FTSE 100 has shed 27 points or 0.4%, while France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s CAC 40 has lost 0.2%. One trader joked that the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcTrump trade\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 has turned into the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcTrump fade\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, as optimism about the president\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s policies weakens Konstantinos Anthis in the ADS Securities research team says: Investors focused on President Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tax reforms were disappointed by the lack of any real detail. Robin Bew of the Economist Intelligence Unit isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t impressed by the lack of detail in the Trump tax plan. Christopher Hayes of MSNBC thinks a lot more work is needed: Broadcaster and academic Linda Yueh is also struck by the lack of detail: After all the razzmatazz, Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tax reform plan has left investors rather cold. If you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re going to promise one of the biggest tax cuts ever, you need to present more than one side of A4 paper peppered with bullet points. So the broad brush policies presented last night haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t really impressed the City. Japan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Nikkei has closed in the red, down 0.2%, and European markets are expected to dip this morning too. The top line of Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s plan includes slashing corporation tax from 35% to 15%, cutting a key tax on the richest Americans, reducing the number of tax brackets, abolishing most tax deductions, and lowering the rate on corporate profits brought back from overseas. But there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s precious little detail about how the plan would be paid for -- so critics are quickly calling it a tax cut for the rich. Michael Hewson of CMC Markets says investors wanted more: Markets had been hoping for more in the way of specifics, in particular the percentage level of the one-off profits tax, which it is hoped will prompt technology companies to repatriate the billions of dollars in profits currently held overseas, as well as some indications on timings, and how the cuts would be funded. These still appear to be some way off, and appear unlikely to go through this year, though we may get something on healthcare by the end of the month. In any case the effect on the US dollar is likely to be a negative one given that markets will have to wait a while longer for a repatriation boost. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s European Central Bank Day, when the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s investors turn to Frankfurt to listen to Mario Draghi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s view of the eurozone economy. The ECB is expected to maintain its very loose monetary policy stance today, concluding that inflation and wage pressure remains limited. But with Europe picking up speed, and the pro-EU Emmanuel Macron expected to become French president, Draghi may face some pressure from hawkish colleagues. So, we might get some hints that the ECB might change their policy stance in the coming months, perhaps as early as June. The main decisions on rates and stimulus measures are announced at 12.45pm BST (1.45pm in Frankfurt). Draghi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s press conference is 45 minutes later. Royal Bank of Canada expects Draghi to take a relaxed approach, saying: After the market\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u02dchawkish\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 interpretation of the March meeting we expect that Draghi will purposely look to strike a more dovish tone in his press conference along the lines of his recent speech to the annual \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcECB and its Watchers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 conference earlier this month. He argued that, despite an improving growth backdrop, the conditions under which the ECB could begin to consider tightening policy had yet to be met, meaning that that there was no cause to deviate from the current policy path and forward guidance, including what it implied about the sequencing of policy changes Also coming up today.... It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a busy morning for corporate news as the reporting season enters full swing. Financial groups Lloyds Banking Group and Deutsche Bank, Pharmaceutical firm Astra Zeneca, housebuilders Persimmon and Taylor Wimpey and advertising giant WPP are all reporting results this morning. Later today, Google/Alphabet, Microsoft, Amazon, Ford and Starbucks will report. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also some economic data which might move the markets 10am BST: Eurozone consumer confidence for April 11am BST: UK retail sales for April 1.30pm BST: US durable goods orders for March We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be tracking all the main news through the day....",

So a strong GDP report would bolster the Conservative Party.<br></p> <p>But... Economists are expecting that growth <strong>slowed</strong> to its lowest rate in 12 months -- to around 0.4% to 0.5%, from 0.7% in the fourth quarter.</p> <p>So if the GDP report is disappointing, opposition parties should be able to land some blows on the government.</p> <p>Secondly, there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Brexit. These figures will cover the three months before Theresa May triggered Article 50. Crucially, they also cover the period when <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2017/jan/17/theresa-may-brexit-speech-pound-steadies-ahead-of-theresa-mays-brexit-speech-politics-live\">the PM gave her Lancaster House speech, committing to leave the single market</a>. Will that have dented business confidence? And has rising inflation, due to the slump in sterling last year, started to hurt consumers?<br></p> <p>Thirdly, there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the impact on the markets. The pound has quietly been recovering in recent weeks, back up to $1.29 against the US dollar from just $1.21 in mid-March.

                "bodyText":"Phew! Economists and investors are catching their breath after a busy day dominated by growth figures from the eurozone, the UK and America. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s some disappointment that Britain, the United States and France all grew slower than expected in January to March. But there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no panic. American GDP is expected to rebound this quarter, while the UK seems to be settling into a period of slower growth due to the pick-up in inflation, and some Brexit uncertainty. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our news story about the US GDP: And here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our UK GDP story: Thanks for reading and commenting. Hope you have a great weekend. GW Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Nasdaq record high: Larry Fink, the head of fund management firm BlackRock, has said it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u0153terrible\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd that America grew slower than France in the last quarter. Fink is speaking at the Morningstar Investment Conference in Chicago, where he expressed concern about the US slowdown. [Reminder, we learned today that French GDP rose by 0.3%, or 1.2% on the US-style \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcannualised basis\u00e2\u20ac\u2122]. The US stock market isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t too concerned by the growth figures. The Dow Jones industrial average has dipped in early trading, but the technology-focused Nasdaq hit a new record high. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s due to Amazon and Alphabet (Google), which both posted strong results after the closing bell on Thursday night. The weather is copping some blame for the slowdown in US growth. Unusually mild conditions meant Americans spent less money heating their homes and offices during the winter, which equates to lower economic activity. Michelle Meyer, chief United States economist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch, explains: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Warm weather meant consumers weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t spending as much on electricity and natural gas and home heating. Government spending can also be affected by seasonal factors, and defense spending is especially volatile.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Paul Ashworth of Capital Economics, explaining how weak consumption dragged the American economy back down in the last three months: The slowdown in the first quarter this year was principally due to a near-stagnation in consumption, which increased by only 0.3% annualised. Household spending was held down by a drop back in motor vehicle sales from a near-record high at the end of last year and the unseasonably warm winter weather, which depressed utilities spending. But consumer confidence is unusually high and real personal disposable income increased at a 4% annualised pace in the first quarter. Consumption growth will rebound in the second quarter. Another former Democratic official argues that we shouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t panic about the US growth figures. Jason Furman, who chaired president Obama\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s council of economic advisors, points out that growth will likely rebound in the April-June quarter. It may be tempting to contrast Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s promise to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Make America Great Again\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd with the news that US economic growth has hit a three year low on his watch. This certainly isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t the start that Trump had in mind during the campaign, when he boasted that America could grow by more than 4% per year if he were in charge. But I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think you can really blame the new president for the slowdown in Q1 (especially if you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re also criticising him for not getting much done in his first 100 days). The consequences of Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s presidency will only emerge over many months and years. Nancy Curtin, chief investment officer at Close Brothers Asset Management, explains: We haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t yet had the expected fiscal stimulus from Trump, the effects of which may not be seen until the end of this year or the start of 2018. While investors might be disappointed with the reading, it has been a steady start to the year with inflation looking benign, a resilient jobs market and positive PMI data, all likely to boost returns for investors.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Macro-economic strategist George Pearkes concurs: Jared Bernstein, a former advisor to VP Joe Biden, points out that America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy has posted solid enough growth over the last year: Some context: As you can see, America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy also grew modestly in Q1 2016, and actually shrank in Q1 2014. The first three months of 2015 weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t amazing either. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Associated Press\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s take on the US growth figures: The U.S. economy turned in the weakest performance in three years in the January-March quarter as consumers sharply slowed their spending. The result repeats a pattern that has characterized the recovery: lackluster beginnings to the year. The Commerce Department says the gross domestic product, the total output of goods and services, grew by just 0.7% in the first quarter following a gain of 2.1% in the fourth quarter. The slowdown primarily reflected slower consumer spending, which grew by just 0.3 percent. That was the poorest showing in more than seven years. Analysts blame in part the unusually warm winter, which meant less spending on utility bills. Economists believe the slowdown will be temporary. They forecast GDP growth will rebound to 3% or better in the current quarter. Breaking! America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy has slowed sharply, posting its weakest growth in three years. US GDP rose by an annualised rate of just 0.7% in the first three months of 2017. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s equal to a quarterly rate of less than 0.2%, and means that the first growth figures of the Trump administration are a disappointment. This is a sharp slowdown compared to the final quarter of 2016, when the US economy grew at an annualised pace of 2.1%. As in the UK, consumer spending was partly to blame, with car sales rather weak. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Bloomberg\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s snap take: Three down, one to go.... After disappointing GDP figures from the UK and France, but stronger growth in Spain, we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re now turning to America to see how its economy fared in the first quarter of this year..... Time for a quick recap of this morning\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s UK growth report. Economists are warning that the Brexit slowdown has begun, after Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economic growth has more than halved to its lowest rate since the EU referendum. UK GDP grew by just 0.3% in January to March, down from 0.7% in the previous quarter. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a weaker performance than the City expected. The service sector suffered the brunt of the slowdown, as rising prices hurt the retail, hotels and restaurant sector. The data show that the drop in the pound since last summer is now hurting the domestic economy. But manufacturing grew by 0.5%, suggesting sterling\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s depreciation has also boosted UK factories. Chancellor Philip Hammond has said that the UK economy remains resilient. But shadow chancellor John McDonnell, and TUC head Frances O\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Grady, have both warned that Britain faces a new cost of living squeeze. Sam Tombs of Pantheon Economics says the consumer-driven slowdown has begun, as incomes are hit by slowing employment and wage growth as well as rising inflation. One quarter of slow growth is not definitive proof that the economy is on the ropes. But the pressure on consumers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 incomes looks set to build this year as retailers pass on higher import prices; we still expect CPI inflation to exceed 3% in the second half of this year. The British Chambers of Commerce fears that the UK is entering a period of sluggish growth, just as the Brexit negotiations begin. With growth unlikely to pick up, Barclays predict UK interest rates will remain on hold until at least the end of 2018. The pound has not been rattled by the slowdown in UK growth. Instead, sterling hit a new seven-month high of $1.2957 after the GDP figures were released. The pound is now on track for its best month since the Brexit vote last June: As mentioned earlier, Bank of America Merrill Lynch has become the latest bank to revise its pound forecasts higher. BAML currency analyst Kamal Sharma told clients that The announcement of an 8th June general election was a game-changing event for sterling. Sterling will face Brexit challenges but its day of reckoning has been pushed further into the future.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd BAML now expect the pound to bottom out at $1.25 in the current quarter and finish the year at $1.27, compared with their respective forecasts of $1.15 and $1.19 previously. The chancellor has now tweeted about the GDP figures: This chart, from CBI economist Alpesh Paleja, shows why the UK growth rate almost halved in the last quarter. As you can see, the retail and hospitality sector (in green) had been a key driver of growth in October-December, but shrank in January-March. The looming shadow of Brexit means the UK economy is unlikely to accelerate over the next couple of years, warns Morgan Stanley economist Melanie Baker. She writes: We expect this slower quarterly pace of growth to persist in 2017, reflecting our assumption that higher inflation will dampen real consumer spending growth and an assumption of subdued business investment as Brexit approaches As this chart shows, Morgan Stanley predict growth could inch up to 0.4% in April to June, but then dipping back to around 0.3%: John McDonnell MP, Labour\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Shadow Chancellor, has responded to the news that growth slowed to 0.3% the last quarter: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s GDP figures reveal the threat to living standards under the Tories. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Growth for the first three months of 2017 was only half of what was expected. It comes on the back of new forecasts last week from leading independent forecasters showing growth and earnings expectations slashed and inflation revised up.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u0153There is no hiding from the truth. The Tories\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 economic plan has undermined the UK economy and is a threat to working people\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s living standards. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This General Election is a choice between a Labour Party who will stand up for the many and a Tory Party which only looks after the privileged few.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not been much other reaction from the campaign trail; The Sun\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Tom Newton Dunn thinks he knows why.... TUC General Secretary Frances O\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Grady fears that the alarm bells are ringing in the UK economy, now that the consumer slowdown is underway. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s GDP figures do not bode well for the future. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Consumer spending has been propping up the UK economy. But with pay packets squeezed, families have less money to spend on the high street. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The next government cannot rely on household spending alone to drive growth, especially when another living standards crisis is on the horizon. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Politicians have long promised to rebalance the economy. They need to spell out at this election how they will deliver, starting with an industrial strategy that creates good jobs where they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re needed most.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd But writing in The Times, Ed Conway suggests the Conservatives will play down economic issues in this election: The slowdown in Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy will prevent the Bank of England raising interest rates until at least 2019. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s according to analysts at Barclays, who have issued a good note on the GDP figures. They argue: In our view, given rising inflationary pressures and the increasing likelihood of negative real wage growth in the coming months, household consumption will continue to ease over the course of 2017. All in all, we believe this strengthens our view that the Bank of England MPC will leave its monetary policy stance unchanged over our forecast horizon (until end-2018). Barclays also predict that the UK economy will keep slowing this year, as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153households are forced to tighten their belts\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Kalum Pickering of Berenberg says we shouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t panic about the slowdown in the UK economy, even though growth halved in the last quarter: While the deceleration looks a little scary, the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trend rate is around 0.4%. The expansion is entering its eighth year and the labour market is at full employment. Against this backdrop, growth with some volatility around its trend rate during the middle of the cycle is more than satisfactory. Via Berenberg Bank, here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a neat chart showing UK growth by sector over the last decade: Suren Thiru, head of economics at the British Chambers of Commerce (BCC), believes Britain is entering a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153sustained period of more sluggish growth\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. June\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s snap general election won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t help the situation, he warns: Inflation is expected to continue to rise, increasing the squeeze on consumer spending power and firm\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s profit margins, pushing growth lower. The BCC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s own Quarterly Economic Survey confirms that inflation is a key risk to the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s growth prospects, with businesses under increasing pressure to raise prices. Uncertainty over the impact of Brexit and the distraction of a General Election are also likely to weigh on economic activity over the near term. Chancellor Philip Hammond has just been interviewed about the GDP figures by Sky News, outside the Treasury. Hammond argues that the UK economy is in good shape, despite the slowdown in the last quarter. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Employment at record highs and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s set to go higher still\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, says Hammond, adding that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The British economy is resilient\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Q: But isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t the slowdown in growth due to Theresa May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Brexit plans? These negotiations will be \u00e2\u20ac\u0153tough and complex\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, Hammond replies. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s why we need strong and stable leadership and a clear mandate, to get the best possible deal, he concludes. The slowdown in Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s service sector is worrying, because services firms make up around 80% of the economy. Dutch bank ING says households are being squeezed, and fears that Brexit uncertainty will compound the problem: Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s my colleague Katie Allen\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s take on today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s GDP figures: Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy slowed more than expected in the opening months of this year, with GDP growth slipping to 0.3% from 0.7% the previous quarter as the post-referendum rise in living costs took its toll on British households. The news adds to signs that the resilience seen for the UK economy in the wake of the Brexit vote is now waning and will come as a blow to Theresa May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s government as it banks on a solid victory in the snap election on 8 June. Economists had expected growth to slow more modestly to 0.4% in the first quarter, according to a poll by Reuters. The 0.3% growth rate was the slowest for a year. Statisticians said the biggest drag was the retail sector, echoing other signs shoppers are cutting back.... Click here for the full story: Alan Clarke of Scotia Bank sums up the slowdown: To put the pace of growth into context, this is like driving away for the bank holiday weekend, hitting traffic and slowing from 70mph to 30mph\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 and it is starting to rain... Clarke also believes that Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s exit from the EU is responsible: This weakness is likely to be blamed on Brexit. That is probably fair, albeit in an indirect sense. The fears leading up to Brexit were that growth would stall due to a dive in confidence, hiring and investment. That hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t happened. What did happen is the pound dived, pushing inflation sharply higher and that is causing consumer spending and hence overall growth to slow. The good news is that the surge in inflation is probably temporary and the squeeze on growth should pass. However, it is probably going to take another year before growth on back on an upwards trajectory. Nancy Curtin, chief investment officer at Close Brothers Asset Management, says that weak pay growth and the rising cost of living is hurting the UK economy. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153After a GDP reading which defied expectation at the end of last year, all eyes were on the Q1 data to see whether the Brexit effect would have affected UK economic performance at the start of 2017. Rising inflation and slow wage growth have dampened consumer demand and reduced retail spending, which were helping drive growth last year after Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s vote to leave the EU. On the other hand though, the increased attractiveness of sterling in the wake of the referendum has boosted manufacturing and international exports, making headway in rebalancing the UK economy. Dean Turner, Economist at UBS Wealth Management, fears growth will remain modest this year. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s print of 0.3% represents a sharp fall from the giddy pace of growth we witnessed a last quarter. Rising inflation seems to be having a negative impact on the parts of the economy exposed to the consumer. Looking ahead, we expect that pressure on real household incomes will keep growth subdued. Mark Sismey-Durrant, chief executive officer at Hampshire Trust Bank, blames economic uncertainty for the slowdown: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decline in GDP demonstrates the short term uncertainty being felt among both businesses and consumers. Businesses like certainty and with the impact of the snap General Election and the evolving EU negotiations, perhaps some economic impact is inevitable. However, we believe that the outlook offers room for optimism, based on the resilience the economy has demonstrated since the EU Referendum. Sky\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economics editor Ed Conway agrees that consumers are cutting back: ITV\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Noreena Hertz reckons Theresa May won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be happy: Here are the key points from today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s report into the UK economy: UK gross domestic product (GDP) was estimated to have increased by 0.3% in Quarter 1 (Jan to Mar) 2017, the slowest rate of growth since Quarter 1 2016. Slower growth in Quarter 1 2017 was mainly due to services, which grew by 0.3% compared with growth of 0.8% in Quarter 4 (Oct to Dec) 2016. In Quarter 1 2017 there were falls in several important consumer-focused industries, such as retail sales and accommodation; this was due in part to prices increasing more than spending. Production, construction and agriculture grew by 0.3%, 0.2% and 0.3% respectively in Quarter 1 2017. GDP per head was estimated to have increased by 0.1% during Quarter 1 2017. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s GDP repost shows that Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy is suffering the impact of higher inflation. Retailers, hotels and restaurants all suffered falling growth, after being forced to hike prices due to higher input costs (because sterling fell sharply after the EU referendum). The ONS says: Retail trade and accommodation services were the main contributors to the negative growth in the distribution, hotels and restaurants sector. These industries were impacted by increases in prices. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s dominant service sector has suffered a significant slowdown in the last quarter. Services output expanded by just 0.3% in January-March, down from 0.8% in October-December. Industrial production grew by 0.3%, including a 0.5% rise in manufacturing output, construction expanded by 0.2% and agriculture grew by 0.2%. Breaking! Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economic growth slowed sharply in the first three months of this year. UK GDP expanded by just 0.3% in January to March, the Office for National Statistics says. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s down from 0.7% in the final three months of 2016, and the slowest reading since the first three months of last year. More to follow.... A former top advisor to ex-chancellor George Osborne tweets: Tension is building in the City, with just four minutes to go until the UK growth figures are released. Connor Campbell of SpreadEx says a surprise reading can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be ruled out.... After surprising everyone with 0.7% growth in the final quarter of 2016, the UK is expected to have seen a sharp drop-off in Q1 2017, analysts estimating that the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy expanded by just 0.4% across the first 3 months of the year. The GDP readings for the last few quarters, however, have tended to beat the Brexit-inspired gloom, so there is room for a shock this morning. Zing! Sterling has just hit its highest level against the US dollar since last September. The pound has jumped by 0.3% this morning to $1.2939, a seven-month high. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also a little higher against the euro, at \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.1881. The rally comes as Bank of America tears up its gloomy forecasts for the pound. It now predicts that sterling will average $1.25 this quarter, having previously expected it to slump to $1.15. Gross domestic product is the economics world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s favoured way of estimating growth and output. But it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not a perfect measure. GDP tries to pin down how well, or badly, a country is performing by estimating how much was produced, spent, and earned across its economy. It show the output across services, industry, construction and agriculture, household and government spending, business investment, and net trade. But it doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t show whether the economic growth is being shared fairly, whether it is reducing inequality or creating it, whether economic activity is environmentally harmful, or Robert F. Kennedy gave the definitive explanation of GDP\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s flaws almost half a century ago, in a famous speech: It counts special locks for our doors and the jails for the people who break them. It counts the destruction of the redwood and the loss of our natural wonder in chaotic sprawl. It counts napalm and counts nuclear warheads and armored cars for the police to fight the riots in our cities. It counts Whitman\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rifle and Speck\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s knife, and the television programs which glorify violence in order to sell toys to our children. Yet the gross national product does not allow for the health of our children, the quality of their education or the joy of their play. It does not include the beauty of our poetry or the strength of our marriages, the intelligence of our public debate or the integrity of our public officials. It measures neither our wit nor our courage, neither our wisdom nor our learning, neither our compassion nor our devotion to our country, it measures everything in short, except that which makes life worthwhile. And it can tell us everything about America except why we are proud that we are Americans. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s worth remembering that the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy has actually held up pretty well since the EU referendum. GDP rose by 0.5% in July-September last year, accelerating to 0.7% in October-December, dashing forecasts that a Brexit vote would quickly trigger a recession. On a longer-term basis, Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy has already posted 16 quarter of growth in a row. Unless today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s report is a real shocker, that should become 17 quarters..... Breaking! Spain has shown Britain how it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s done, by reporting strong growth figures for the last three months. Spanish GDP expanded by a punchy 0.8% in Q1, ahead of expectations, and extending its recent recovery. On an annual basis, Spain grew by 3.0%. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s UK growth figures, due at 9.30am, are significant for several reasons. First, they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re the most important economic data to be released before the general election on June 8th. So a strong GDP report would bolster the Conservative Party. But... Economists are expecting that growth slowed to its lowest rate in 12 months -- to around 0.4% to 0.5%, from 0.7% in the fourth quarter. So if the GDP report is disappointing, opposition parties should be able to land some blows on the government. Secondly, there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Brexit. These figures will cover the three months before Theresa May triggered Article 50. Crucially, they also cover the period when the PM gave her Lancaster House speech, committing to leave the single market. Will that have dented business confidence? And has rising inflation, due to the slump in sterling last year, started to hurt consumers? Thirdly, there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the impact on the markets. The pound has quietly been recovering in recent weeks, back up to $1.29 against the US dollar from just $1.21 in mid-March. If GDP misses forecasts, then the pound may get tonked. Analysts at RBC Capital Markets have predicted that growth fell to 0.4%, setting the UK up for a year of slower growth. Even with the expectation of activity recovering in March, the broader narrative remains that we look for GDP growth to slow in 2017. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a good chart from the FT, showing how France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s growth has fallen back: There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a flurry of banking news this morning too. Royal Bank of Scotland, which is majority-owned by the UK taxpayer, has posted its first quarterly profit since 2015. It made \u00c2\u00a3259m in the three months to March, beating forecasts. Barclays has announced plans to hire 2,000 extra staff over the next few years, as part of a new push into technology. Can Fintech help to replace City jobs lost due to Brexit? And not to be outdone, the government has cut its stake in Lloyds Banking Group to just 0.89% - more than eight years after taxpayers bailing it out. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve just learned that the slowdown in Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s housing market is gathering pace -- another sign that the economy may be losing momentum. Nationwide has reported that prices FELL in April for the second month running (on a seasonally adjusted basis). And on an annual basis, prices only rose by 2.6% - the slowest rate of increase since June 2013. Robert Gardner, Nationwide\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Chief Economist, says it may be due to rising inflation, which is driving down real incomes. Also, prices may simply have risen too high, Gardner adds: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153There may also be more fundamental reasons for the slowdown. House price growth has been outstripping earnings growth for a sustained period of time, steadily eroding affordability on a number of metrics. For example, the typical house price is currently 6.1 times average earnings, well above the long run average of 4.3 times earnings, and close to the all-time high of 6.4 times recorded in 2007. France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy was dragged back by disappointing trade figures (because exports fell while imports rose). This breakdown of the GDP figures shows how net trade (commerce exterieur) was negative for growth. INSEE explains: Foreign trade weighs on growth Exports decreased in the first quarter of 2017 (-0.7% after + 1.4%), particularly in transport equipment. At the same time, imports accelerated (+ 1.5% after + 0.8%). In particular, purchases of refined petroleum products are rebounding and those of other industrial products are growing more vigorously. Overall, foreign trade weighed on growth, at -0.7 point, after a contribution of +0.2 point the previous quarter. Bert Colijn, senior colleague at ING Bank, says the French growth figures are a disappointment: Fred Ducrozet of Swiss bank Pictet agrees, but is encouraged that French businesses are investing more in new equipment and buildings. Breaking: France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy grew slower than expected in the first three months of this year. French GDP expanded by just 0.3%, missing the 0.4% which economists had predicted. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not all bad news, though - INSEE, the stats body, has revised growth in the last quarter of 2016 up to 0.5%, from 0.4%. French consumers dragged growth back; household spending slowed to just 0.1%. Business investment jumped, though, to +0.9% from 0.6% -- an encouraging sign. But...exports fell sharply (-0.7% from + 1.4%) while imports accelerated (+ 1.5% from +0.8%). Good morning. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re about to get a deluge of economic data that will show how some of the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest economies have performed in 2017. Growth figures from Britain, America, France and Spain are all being released over the next seven hours. And for different reasons, they should all be fascinating. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s GDP report will be pored over for signs that Brexit is hurting the economy. Economists expect growth to have slowed in January-March to around 0.4% to 0.5%, down from 0.7% in October-December 2016. France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s figures will highlight the scale of the challenge facing either Emmanuel Macron or Marine Le Pen. Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s data will show whether the eurozone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s battered periphery is still recovering.... And America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s growth figures are the first school report since Donald Trump became US president. And the bad news is that economists predict a slowdown, as consumers cut back.
