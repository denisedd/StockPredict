Reed Hastings, its co-founder and current chief executive, has seen his 1.43% shareholding rise in value by $180m to $944m. </p> <p>Thomas Husson at the tech research group Forrestersays Netflix has far to go. \u201cNot only have they reached 100m subscribers, they have managed to create a digital relationship with their customers. They know their preferences and are good at acting on the insights they collect on their customers. They are growing fast and are very disruptive.\u201d</p> <p>What lies behind the astronomical increase in value of the Fangs? To a certain extent, they\u2019ve been buoyed by the same tide that raised US shares to record highs this year, the election of Donald Trump. The new president may threaten trade wars and real wars, and prompt unheard-of levels of domestic unrest, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/apr/25/stock-markets-us-tech-donald-trump-tax-reform-emmanuel-macron-french-election\">but to Wall Street investors, all that pales in comparison to a couple of policy proposals that have been on the cards since the day he won the Republican nomination</a> - lower corporation taxes and a tax holiday on repatriated cash.<br></p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/apr/26/trump-tax-proposal-corporate-tax-rate-15-percent\">The US has one of the highest levels of corporation tax in the world, up to 35% with some states charging more on top. </a>For internationally competitive companies, that creates a strong motivation to not bring income earned overseas back to the US. The Fangs have huge international earnings. </p> <p>One proposed solution, favoured by the Republican party for decades and periodically enacted, is a repatriation tax holiday - a fixed period during which money brought onshore is taxed less. The last holiday in 2004 led to $362bn being brought back to the US at a reduced tax rate of 5.25%. Paradoxically, each tax holiday increases the need for the next, because companies start holding ever greater amounts of their tax offshore in the expectation that the next Republican government will announce a new one.</p> <p>In the expectation of just that, which would allow a flood of onshored income to boost dividend payouts and share buybacks, investors have been buying up stocks in companies with foreign holdings.</p> <p>But the Fangs also have their own unique benefits. In a tech industry with a globalised supply chain fighting anti-globalisation movements, where businesses are finding it tough to provide big improvements on devices from laptops to smartphones, and where the next big thing keeps failing to take off they sell nothing but binary code sent over the net.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a531d867930ab4eb9e417d87ae031cb1c425e933\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a531d867930ab4eb9e417d87ae031cb1c425e933/508_344_4199_2519/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Google logo on an iphone\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Google, the big Fang daddy, is now worth $610bn.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Leon Neal/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>All four are subtly different, but firmly overlapping industries. Facebook and Google are primarily advertising companies. One sells things to you while you\u2019re looking for information, the other while you\u2019re chatting to friends. They\u2019re also both in the business of user-generated content, encouraging their customers to upload fun, shareable videos to YouTube and Facebook so they have something to put advertising against \u2013 and keep you coming back for more.</p> <p>In the content industry, the two also compete against Netflix and Amazon, which both produce web video far more directly, with millions invested in the creation of high-quality long-form drama and comedy. Amazon competes against Google in the shopping business, because more and more of us skip the middleman when we want to buy something.</p> <p>And then there are the enormously profitable back-ends. Amazon Web Services makes more profit selling cloud computing services to other companies than it does selling things to you or me, and Google Cloud makes almost as much money doing the same thing to its own startups. </p> <p>None of Fangs have reached the astronomical levels of profitability seen at Apple, which has mastered the art of building expensive technology and selling it for eye-watering levels of profit. Apple, however, also has a weakness. When it comes to its revenue, it has only one really huge product: the iPhone.</p> <p>The Fangs, by contrast, are diversified. They can sell their stuff wherever there is internet access, they don\u2019t have to worry about pesky supply chain issues and they\u2019re aiming for the top of the pile.</p>",

The relative minnow is Netflix, which has climbed in value by $12.5bn since January to $66bn, or three times the value of Sky TV. Reed Hastings, its co-founder and current chief executive, has seen his 1.43% shareholding rise in value by $180m to $944m. Thomas Husson at the tech research group Forrestersays Netflix has far to go. \u201cNot only have they reached 100m subscribers, they have managed to create a digital relationship with their customers. They know their preferences and are good at acting on the insights they collect on their customers. They are growing fast and are very disruptive.\u201d What lies behind the astronomical increase in value of the Fangs? To a certain extent, they\u2019ve been buoyed by the same tide that raised US shares to record highs this year, the election of Donald Trump. The new president may threaten trade wars and real wars, and prompt unheard-of levels of domestic unrest, but to Wall Street investors, all that pales in comparison to a couple of policy proposals that have been on the cards since the day he won the Republican nomination - lower corporation taxes and a tax holiday on repatriated cash. The US has one of the highest levels of corporation tax in the world, up to 35% with some states charging more on top. For internationally competitive companies, that creates a strong motivation to not bring income earned overseas back to the US. The Fangs have huge international earnings. One proposed solution, favoured by the Republican party for decades and periodically enacted, is a repatriation tax holiday - a fixed period during which money brought onshore is taxed less. The last holiday in 2004 led to $362bn being brought back to the US at a reduced tax rate of 5.25%. Paradoxically, each tax holiday increases the need for the next, because companies start holding ever greater amounts of their tax offshore in the expectation that the next Republican government will announce a new one. In the expectation of just that, which would allow a flood of onshored income to boost dividend payouts and share buybacks, investors have been buying up stocks in companies with foreign holdings. But the Fangs also have their own unique benefits. In a tech industry with a globalised supply chain fighting anti-globalisation movements, where businesses are finding it tough to provide big improvements on devices from laptops to smartphones, and where the next big thing keeps failing to take off they sell nothing but binary code sent over the net. All four are subtly different, but firmly overlapping industries. Facebook and Google are primarily advertising companies. One sells things to you while you\u2019re looking for information, the other while you\u2019re chatting to friends. They\u2019re also both in the business of user-generated content, encouraging their customers to upload fun, shareable videos to YouTube and Facebook so they have something to put advertising against \u2013 and keep you coming back for more. In the content industry, the two also compete against Netflix and Amazon, which both produce web video far more directly, with millions invested in the creation of high-quality long-form drama and comedy. Amazon competes against Google in the shopping business, because more and more of us skip the middleman when we want to buy something. And then there are the enormously profitable back-ends. Amazon Web Services makes more profit selling cloud computing services to other companies than it does selling things to you or me, and Google Cloud makes almost as much money doing the same thing to its own startups. None of Fangs have reached the astronomical levels of profitability seen at Apple, which has mastered the art of building expensive technology and selling it for eye-watering levels of profit. Apple, however, also has a weakness. When it comes to its revenue, it has only one really huge product: the iPhone. The Fangs, by contrast, are diversified. They can sell their stuff wherever there is internet access, they don\u2019t have to worry about pesky supply chain issues and they\u2019re aiming for the top of the pile.",
