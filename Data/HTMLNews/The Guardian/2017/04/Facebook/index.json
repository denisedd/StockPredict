                "bodyText":"Airline passengers beware: when you buy a ticket, you are not only subjecting yourself to the ordeals of security queues, baggage limits and turbulence. You are also signing a near-40,000-word contract with a carrier that, in the extreme case of a United Airlines passenger on 9 April, could have you hauled off an overbooked aircraft \u2013 legally \u2013 as fellow customers and a global web audience look on aghast. Sunday\u2019s extraordinary scenes on a Chicago, Illinois, to Louisville, Kentucky, flight unfolded because of two regulations that are standard practice across the industry. The first says a passenger can be barred from a flight if the number of customers with tickets exceeds the number of seats. The second says the captain can have you removed from the plane if you get emotional about it. Air travel is a thicket of regulations and acronyms that, of course, have your safety at heart.

Sunderland, which is about as far removed as you can get from Silicon Valley, has the fastest-growing digital turnover in the UK behind London, <a href=\"http://technation.techcityuk.com/\">according to Tech City UK</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2e74be2c49ae532fc3a8851906a61d68afd9a1ed\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2e74be2c49ae532fc3a8851906a61d68afd9a1ed/13_0_3426_2056/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Manchester airport\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Manchester airport now offers direct flights to San Francisco.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Martin Rickett/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>GP Bullhound, an investment bank, says the north now has 12 tech \u201cunicorns\u201d \u2013 that is, companies valued at more than $1bn \u2013 which is more than Sweden or Germany. They include some of the UK\u2019s biggest tech businesses, such as the software giant Sage and The Hut, the online retailer with an annual turnover of \u00a3335m.</p> <p>Northern tech businesses received a further boost recently when Virgin Atlantic launched its inaugural flight from Manchester to San Francisco, the first direct UK route outside London. Entrepreneurs hope it will tempt US investors to look outside the capital, where tech companies received \u00a31.4bn of the \u00a31.9bn invested in the industry last year, <a href=\"http://www.londonandpartners.com/media-centre/press-releases/2017/20170112-uk-tech-sector-leads-european-investment-in-2016\">according to the mayor of London\u2019s promotional firm London &amp; Partners</a>.</p> <p>The northern tech scene might not be under threat from Brexit, but there remains significant barriers to competing with London. Founders complain that UK investors are far more risk-averse than their US counterparts, stifling the growth of young companies. Scott Fletcher, the founder of IT firm ANS, believes Manchester\u2019s wealth of former Premier League footballers, such as Gary Neville, should open their chequebooks to the region\u2019s top tech-talent.</p> <p>\u201cGary Neville is a one in a million in that he\u2019s an entrepreneur as well, but when you approach other footballers all they\u2019ve known all their life is football,\u201d said Fletcher. \u201cThey always have advisers and agents around them who have got a vested interest so trying to get access to them is quite difficult, and they\u2019ll generally go for safer investments. You\u2019ve got to be willing, when you invest in tech startups, to lose all your money.\u201d</p> <p>Jamil Khalil, the founder of Manchester-based social curation platform <a href=\"https://wakelet.com/\">Wakelet</a>, said \u201cso-called early-stage investors\u201d in Britain made him feel like quitting many times when he was knocked back because the business was not yet making a profit. Luke Massie, the 23-year-old founder of secondary ticket marketplace <a href=\"http://www.vibetickets.co.uk/\">Vibe Tickets</a>, said Silicon Valley benefited from an \u201cecosystem that props up startups\u201d, unlike the UK.</p> <p>\u201cInvestors over here [in San Francisco] are backing growth, whereas in the UK they\u2019re focused on profitability, which means over here a company like mine can focus on your main challenge \u2013 spending \u00a31 and making two from it,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Andy McLoughlin, a British-born San Francisco-based investor, said Silicon Valley\u2019s view of the UK was still heavily London-centric. \u201cGetting more British startups to the west coast \u2013 where they can taste the pace of innovation and scale of thinking \u2013 can only be a good thing,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cBut a single new flight route won\u2019t put the north of England on top-tier Silicon Valley venture capitalists\u2019 radars. It\u2019ll take a sustained ecosystem producing numerous great companies \u2013 something that London has only really started to do in the last five to 10 years.\u201d<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"00ac605764a65139bd4346498e98fbaaf2ea91f9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/00ac605764a65139bd4346498e98fbaaf2ea91f9/0_246_5472_3283/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tallinn.

                "bodyText":"Theresa May\u2019s article 50 letter might have dominated the front pages in Britain but it was met with a shrug in San Francisco, where 30 tech leaders from the north of England recently embarked on a four-day mission to woo, impress and tempt cash from Silicon Valley\u2019s top dealmakers. Anxiety over the future of Britain outside Europe has not, it seems, spread to the home of Facebook, Twitter and Google. \u201cInvestors here just don\u2019t know what Brexit means yet,\u201d said Gerald Brady, managing director of the multibillion-dollar lender Silicon Valley Bank. However, that is not stopping EU27 countries from making furtive attempts to lure British entrepreneurs overseas. \u201cOther European countries are trying to attract talent by saying, \u2018Hey, come to Ireland, or Holland or Germany because we\u2019ve got free movement of people and if your number one issue is talent, we\u2019re gonna be able to help you get engineers.\u2019 That\u2019s happening today,\u201d Brady said. Matt Haworth, the co-founder of Manchester-based \u201ctech for good\u201d agency Reason Digital, said he and other entrepreneurs had been targeted with Facebook adverts from authorities in Estonia and Transylvania since Britain voted to leave the European Union. But it will take more than that to lure Haworth and others away from northern England, where a rapidly growing technology sector has led to a boom in investment in Britain\u2019s former industrial heartlands. Investment in northern tech businesses reached a 10-year high last year at \u00a3327m, up from \u00a320m in 2007, according to the government agency Tech North, as startup clusters developed in Manchester, Leeds, Sheffield and the north-east. Sunderland, which is about as far removed as you can get from Silicon Valley, has the fastest-growing digital turnover in the UK behind London, according to Tech City UK. GP Bullhound, an investment bank, says the north now has 12 tech \u201cunicorns\u201d \u2013 that is, companies valued at more than $1bn \u2013 which is more than Sweden or Germany. They include some of the UK\u2019s biggest tech businesses, such as the software giant Sage and The Hut, the online retailer with an annual turnover of \u00a3335m. Northern tech businesses received a further boost recently when Virgin Atlantic launched its inaugural flight from Manchester to San Francisco, the first direct UK route outside London. Entrepreneurs hope it will tempt US investors to look outside the capital, where tech companies received \u00a31.4bn of the \u00a31.9bn invested in the industry last year, according to the mayor of London\u2019s promotional firm London &amp; Partners. The northern tech scene might not be under threat from Brexit, but there remains significant barriers to competing with London. Founders complain that UK investors are far more risk-averse than their US counterparts, stifling the growth of young companies. Scott Fletcher, the founder of IT firm ANS, believes Manchester\u2019s wealth of former Premier League footballers, such as Gary Neville, should open their chequebooks to the region\u2019s top tech-talent. \u201cGary Neville is a one in a million in that he\u2019s an entrepreneur as well, but when you approach other footballers all they\u2019ve known all their life is football,\u201d said Fletcher. \u201cThey always have advisers and agents around them who have got a vested interest so trying to get access to them is quite difficult, and they\u2019ll generally go for safer investments. You\u2019ve got to be willing, when you invest in tech startups, to lose all your money.\u201d Jamil Khalil, the founder of Manchester-based social curation platform Wakelet, said \u201cso-called early-stage investors\u201d in Britain made him feel like quitting many times when he was knocked back because the business was not yet making a profit. Luke Massie, the 23-year-old founder of secondary ticket marketplace Vibe Tickets, said Silicon Valley benefited from an \u201cecosystem that props up startups\u201d, unlike the UK. \u201cInvestors over here [in San Francisco] are backing growth, whereas in the UK they\u2019re focused on profitability, which means over here a company like mine can focus on your main challenge \u2013 spending \u00a31 and making two from it,\u201d he said. Andy McLoughlin, a British-born San Francisco-based investor, said Silicon Valley\u2019s view of the UK was still heavily London-centric. \u201cGetting more British startups to the west coast \u2013 where they can taste the pace of innovation and scale of thinking \u2013 can only be a good thing,\u201d he said. \u201cBut a single new flight route won\u2019t put the north of England on top-tier Silicon Valley venture capitalists\u2019 radars. It\u2019ll take a sustained ecosystem producing numerous great companies \u2013 something that London has only really started to do in the last five to 10 years.\u201d A more significant challenge to the northern powerhouse lies in the ageing road and rail network, which business leaders say is causing Britain to lose out on potentially billions of pounds in growth and thousands of jobs. The trade minister, Greg Hands, was lobbied privately recently by entrepreneurs to sort out the north\u2019s woeful transport infrastructure at a networking event to mark the launch of the Virgin Atlantic flight. Phase two of the long-delayed HS2 rail network, from the West Midlands to Leeds and Manchester, is scheduled to begin operating in 2033 but businesses have demanded urgent investment to slash travel times between the north\u2019s major cities. Charlie Cornish, the chief executive of Manchester Airports Group, said growth in the north would continue to be held back without government action. \u201cIt\u2019s a massive part of the UK economy, and for Manchester airport to continue to grow and prosper and create more jobs, it will help to narrow that north-south divide. But unless you\u2019ve got connectivity across the north, it\u2019s very difficult to see how you can narrow that north-south divide.,\u201d he said. Speaking at Manchester airport, Hands said increasing connectivity in the north was a government priority. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a big infrastructure programme over the course of this parliament,\u201d he said. \u201cHS2 is obviously right at the centre of that but we\u2019re also looking at smaller large schemes to increase and improve connectivity within the north.

Apple, however, also has a weakness. When it comes to its revenue, it has only one really huge product: the iPhone. The Fangs, by contrast, are diversified. They can sell their stuff wherever there is internet access, they don\u2019t have to worry about pesky supply chain issues and they\u2019re aiming for the top of the pile.",
