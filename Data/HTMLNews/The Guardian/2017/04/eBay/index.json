                "bodyText":"Australia Post has hit back at the internet giants Amazon and eBay, saying the Turnbull government\u2019s plan to impose the GST on all online purchases is a good one. It says the government\u2019s proposed GST collection method \u2013 called a \u201cvendor model\u201d, which would require websites such as Amazon and eBay to collect GST for the commonwealth from goods bought online from overseas \u2013 is the most efficient way to impose the tax. It has warned Australia Post shouldn\u2019t collect the tax, despite the pleas of Amazon and eBay, because it would render its parcels business \u201cunviable\u201d. It says it supports the Turnbull government\u2019s proposed GST plan but hopes it will be imposed a year later than stipulated. The Senate standing committee on economics will hold a public hearing on the bill on Friday. The treasurer, Scott Morrison, is pushing ahead with plans to abolish the GST concession for low-value goods bought online from overseas. At the moment, imports of goods worth less than $1,000 are GST-free \u2013 including clothing, books, electronic devices and sports equipment. The government wants to scrap the concession to \u201clevel the playing field\u201d for local bricks-and-mortar stores but it wants online giants such as Amazon and eBay to collect GST for the commonwealth using a vendor model. A vendor model would require that, where Australian consumers have bought products online from offshore suppliers, the responsibility for collecting GST would lie with the seller, the electronic distribution platform or the re-deliverer, depending on the nature of the transaction. Amazon has attacked the government\u2019s plan, saying it is so poorly designed it will create an \u201cinherent disincentive\u201d to comply. It said the government should instead use a so-called \u201clogistics model\u201d to collect GST on online purchases, requiring Australia Post (and express carriers and freight forwarders) to collect GST instead. \u201cLogistics providers already have infrastructure in place to collect information on goods coming into Australia and have well-established processes for GST collection for goods valued at more than $1,000,\u201d it says in a submission. It also wondered why the government had provided no rationale for ignoring a recommendation from a previous government taskforce to use a logistics model to collect GST. Australia Post has warned that, if the government adopted Amazon\u2019s suggestion, it would be \u201cadversely impacted\u201d by the extra administrative complexity caused by the imposition of additional revenue collection. \u201cAny proposal involving collection of GST under a model that requires collection at the border is likely to render Australia Post mail and parcels business unviable in the current market of continuing and significant decline in mail volumes that have put severe strain on the financial position of the corporation,\u201d its submission says. It argues any changes to the border process must expedite clearance, rather than hinder it, given 59m items are now being cleared through international mail each year. It says if Australia Post was forced to collect GST on items arriving from overseas, it would cost the federal government roughly $900m a year \u2013 vastly exceeding the $300m revenue the GST could be expected to raise. \u201cHowever, the \u2018vendor\u2019 model as proposed in Treasury Laws Amendment (GST Low Value Goods) Bill 2017 places relatively less burden on the Australia Post infrastructure, processing times and its costs of doing business,\u201d its submission says. Gary Elphick, the chief executive of Sydney-based company Disrupt Sports, has said the government\u2019s proposed model shows a \u201cfundamental\u201d lack of understanding about how online markets work.",
