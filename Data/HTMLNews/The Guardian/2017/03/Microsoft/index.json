Jasper Lawler, senior market analyst at London Capital Group, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Markets know that when PSA CEO Carlos Tavares talks about synergies, he means job cuts. PSA were likely in the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153driver\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s seat\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in negotiations since after a decade and a half of losses, GM clearly wanted to get shot of Opel and Vauxhall. Through the Opel brands, PSA have a new opportunity for expansion in China, where French car brands have not been so popular.</p> <p>For the moment, PSA will pay GM for intellectual property, meaning car-buyers can expect to be buying GM standards for the next few years. Eventually Vauxhall will morph into Peugeot so a big question longer term will be how many Vauxhall drivers stay loyal. From a GM shareholder perspective it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pretty cut and dry; the deal removes a loss-making division from the balance sheet and the proceeds will directly line their pockets via share repurchases.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2017-03-06T16:40:05.038Z\">at 4.40pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-58bd89cae4b047c20d905f5e\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-03-06T16:20:26.472Z\">4.20pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><em>Jim Cunningham urges caution, warning that the promises made need to be kept as they have not always been in the past.</em></p> <p>Clark: I am cautiously optimistic.

Sentiment was also dented by news of North Korea launching missiles and Donald Trump accusing Barack Obama of tapping his phone during the US election campaign. But a spate of merger activity - the GM/Peugeot deal and Standard Life linking up with Aberdeen Asset Management - did limit the damage.

On that note, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time to close for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be back tomorrow. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s more from Greg Clark\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s comments on the Vauxhall deal made earlier in parliament, courtesy PA: Clark said the sale was linked to a wider restructuring of General Motors rather than Brexit. When asked whether all automotive companies would get the same deal as Nissan, he added: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve said that by being part of the UK automotive sector, all of the benefits of that in terms of research and development, in terms of trading, in terms of the expansion we see through the industrial strategy of the supply chain, will be available to all such companies.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd He added: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The fact that plants are going to be judged, as they tend to be in the automotive sector for new models, on the basis of their competitive efficiency is a strength for us in this country, because our automotive plants are the strongest in the world.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Back with market reaction to the deal. Jasper Lawler, senior market analyst at London Capital Group, said: Markets know that when PSA CEO Carlos Tavares talks about synergies, he means job cuts. PSA were likely in the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153driver\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s seat\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in negotiations since after a decade and a half of losses, GM clearly wanted to get shot of Opel and Vauxhall. Through the Opel brands, PSA have a new opportunity for expansion in China, where French car brands have not been so popular. For the moment, PSA will pay GM for intellectual property, meaning car-buyers can expect to be buying GM standards for the next few years. Eventually Vauxhall will morph into Peugeot so a big question longer term will be how many Vauxhall drivers stay loyal. From a GM shareholder perspective it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pretty cut and dry; the deal removes a loss-making division from the balance sheet and the proceeds will directly line their pockets via share repurchases. Jim Cunningham urges caution, warning that the promises made need to be kept as they have not always been in the past. Clark: I am cautiously optimistic. The commitments go in the right direction. We have to do everything we can to make sure [a positive future for the car industry] is achieved. And with that the house moves on to the Fox bid for Sky which is being covered in our politics live blog here: Geoffrey Robinson says the reassurances are very limited in extent and duration, and he refers to the closure of the plant at Ryton, adding that the only reassurance that counts is getting replacement models in the UK and the government should push for this. Clark says we do need to stay engaged and make sure these commitments are delivered. It is important these commitments have been given, and in writing. It is a different management now {to the time when Ryton was closed] and the strategy is not based on closing plants. Alistair Burt, wants assurances that jobs in the supply chain are secure. Clark says both the direct workforce and supply chain part of our discussions. [This is] an opportunity to expand the supply chain. Shadow minister Rebecca Long Bailey says workers will be worried about the future of their jobs, and what assurances are there on the Vauxhall plant beyond the existing contracts. Will the production of the new Astra model take place in the UK? With the GM pension deficit, are pensions guaranteed in full? The government has little power in takeovers - are there any plans to broaden the definition of public interest in takeovers. What support was offered to PSA following Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s exit from the European Union? Greg Clark says these have been worrying times for the workforce. [But] the statements made have been welcomed, not just by me, by trade unions. The company has said it will honour agreements they have, at least to 2021. Both principal models in UK are early in the cycle. On pensions, they have given an absolute commitment no pensioner will be worse off. The pensions regulator is also required to confirm any changes in arrangements. As for the takoever regime, this is one overseas company taking over another. But we have agreed with our French and German [counterparts] that we should take a consistent approach. As for support available for automotive sector: we hope future owners will take part in support available. Greg Clark, business, energy and industrial strategy secretary, is answering questions in parliament on the Vauxhall takeover. He said the discussions which have taken place can give confidence to the Vauxhall workforce now and for the future. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We are determined [Vauxhall cars] should continue to be made [here] for many years to come.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd He said there had been a number of important commitments made: the new owners will honour existing agreements with the workforce; pensioners will be in at least as good a position in future as they are today; the UK division will be treated the same as other parts of the business; they will build on existing agreements and not plant closures. General Motors shares have opened lower in early US trading following the deal to sell Opel-Vauxhall to Peugeot. They are currently down 0.5%, worse than the 0.2% decline on the Dow Jones Industrial Average. The overall market has been hit by a number of new concerns, not least the launch of four missiles by North Korea and Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s accusations that his were tapped on the orders of Barack Obama. PA also has more comments from Vauxhall workers arriving for work: Workers clocking in for their afternoon shift at Luton\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Vauxhall plant reacted with a mix of emotions to news of the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sale to French group PSA. Many staff who were yet to start their shift said they only heard about it on the news or online, not from their employer. Paintshop worker Joshua Taylor, 25, expressed uncertainty over job security, saying: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153No-one actually knows what\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s going on. We haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t been told if our jobs are safe. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I looked over the plants Peugeot bought and it doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t look promising.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd James Upton, 26, who has worked at the plant for two years, said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve had jobs before but this is the one that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s actually stuck. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Around here, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s kind of difficult when you go on the Jobcentre websites and you apply for loads of stuff but nothing ever really comes through, and you think \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcI have to go further afield\u00e2\u20ac\u2122.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd He said he does not know much about the deal, and described the arrangement by the French car giant as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153coming at you fast\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Asked about the mood among his colleagues, he said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t gone in there yet to see how everyone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s reacting but I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m sure they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be the same as always. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153As long as people get paid, they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re happy.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Teresa Carway, 63, is retiring at the end of the week after 39 years of service at the Luton plant, and she said the announcement \u00e2\u20ac\u0153couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have come at a better time for me\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. However she said other colleagues who are coming up to their retirement are concerned. She said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I think a lot of people are worried because the average age around here is 52 or 53. But if they could get another five, six years out of here, then they can retire.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Mrs Carway, who works in the bodyshop assembling bolts on van doors, was hopeful for newer staff \u00e2\u20ac\u0153(The plant) have taken on loads of new workers,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd she said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153They\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve taken on around 300 young workers in the last year.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd More from the prime minister\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s spokesman on Vauxhall, courtesy the Press Association: Mrs May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s official spokesman insisted that no specific assurances had been given to Peugeot to secure the future of the UK plants. The PM had made clear to the company that she wanted the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153long history of success\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd at Vauxhall to continue in this country, said the spokesman. But he added: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153In terms of specific assurances - none sought, none given. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We have a stated position that we will ensure the competitiveness of this country when it comes to the supply chain, research and development and trade.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Time for a quick recap, with links to the main points. General Motors has denied that job cuts are inevitable after agreeing the sale of its European operations to PSA Group. GM is offloading Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Vauxhall and Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Opel to the owner of Peugeot and Citro\u00c3\u00abn, in a \u00e2\u201a\u00ac2.2bn deal announced this morning. PSA has insisted that staff across its business will get a fair chance to show they can hit productivity targets. CEO Carlos Tavares told reporters in Paris that simply shutting factories down was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153rather simplistic\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Tavares also pledged to stick to existing deals with Vauxhall workers, and General Motors CEO Mary Barra also claimed that the deal was a win-win for both sides. But unions, and individual workers at Vauxhall, are concerned that jobs could be lost - especially if the plants at Ellesmere Port and Luton don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t secure pledges to manufacture new models. Some industry analysts have also predicted job cuts as PSA looks to consolidate its operations. The UK government is hopeful that Vauxhall could thrive under PSA\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ownership. A spokesman for Theresa May told reporters that: The prime minister set out to Ms Barra the importance of the Vauxhall brand to the UK and reiterated her desire for the jobs at both plants to be secured for the long term. Ms Barra made clear that Vauxhall would remain a British brand and that the deal would recognise and respect all agreements regarding the workforce. Both the prime minister and Ms Barra expressed their confidence that the deal had the potential to strengthen the Vauxhall brand and allow for further growth, supported by the government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Industrial Strategy and the continued strength of the automotive sector in the UK. (that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s via our Politics Live blog) Local MPs have also been banging the drum, insisting that Vauxhall plants are already pretty efficient. Labour\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Justin Madders, who represents Ellesmere Port, says: There is no doubt that we have some of the most efficient plants in Europe so we have a good tale to tell and we should not underestimate the positive impact on sales that having a U.K. manufacturing base brings. There should be no doubt that one of the biggest selling points to UK consumers is that Vauxhall is a British brand that supports British jobs. That is something that I know will be stressed to PSA. General Motors was adamant this morning that its European business would have broken even last year, if it wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t for the Brexit vote. As this chart show, that didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t happen -- although GM has been clawing its way back to profitability since the financial crisis.... Vauxhall workers at Ellesmere Port arrived for work under the glare of TV cameras and photographers this morning: Tony Burke, assistant general secretary of the Unite union, doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t share John Longworth\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s optimism that the car industry will thrive after Brexit. If the UK loses membership of the single market, and the customs union, it will also lose the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153frictionless\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd supply chain that allows components to move freely back and forth across the channel, Burke warns. He hopes that Theresa May will commit to maintaining membership of the single market and the customs union after Brexit. But if that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not possible, Unite wants the government will push the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcreshoring\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 of component makers back into the UK. Burke also pledges to hold PSA to its promise that factories don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have to close, following the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcfantastic\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 work done in recent years to make Vauxhall\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s plants more efficient. John Longworth, who resigned as head of the British Chambers of Commerce last year over his support for Brexit, has denied that the EU referendum vote will hurt the car industry. He tells the World At One that if Britain get a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcclean break\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 from the EU, it could potentially slap import tariffs on cars made in Europe. That would make UK-made Vauxhalls 27% cheaper than comparable models, Longworth argues, boosting domestic demand. [Except, of course, the EU would impose reciprocal tariffs, making Vauxhalls much pricier for EU customers]. Longworth also argues that Britain can use the money saved on EU budget contributions to make the UK a more attractive place for businesses, perhaps by cutting tax or encouraging investment in R&amp;D. Radio 4\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s The World At One is looking at the Vauxhall/Opel sale now. They\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve interviewed several workers at Vauxhall\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ellesmere Port plant today. One told them: I think the deal is a good deal for General Motors and for Vauxhall themselves....but are they [PSA] going to give us a good pension, are they going to take over the General Motors pension scheme that we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve been paying into for 32 years. Is the money still there? Another employee is worried that the Brexit vote means Vauxhall factories are vulnerable if PSA decides to make cuts. If you have a French factory and a German factory and they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re all in the EU and one of them\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s got to go, what would you say? A third predicted a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcdevastating impact\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd on local people and shops if the Ellesmere Port plant closed. This isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t great news for Vauxhall workers.... Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a photo from this morning\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s press conference in Paris, as GM CEO Mary Barra (left) and PSA chairman Carlos Tavares (centre) shook hands on today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s deal. Opel CEO Karl-Thomas Neumann is on the right. Theresa May told General Motors yesterday that UK jobs need to be protected, as the carmaker put the finishing touches to the sale of its European arm. The prime minister gave the message to GM CEO Mary Barra, who gave some reassurances in response, according to May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s office. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the official statement: The Prime Minister set out to Ms Barra the importance of the Vauxhall brand to the UK and reiterated her desire for the jobs at both plants to be secured for the long term. Ms Barra made clear that Vauxhall would remain a British brand and that the deal would recognise and respect all agreements regarding the workforce. Despite that reassurance, workers in Ellesmere Port are understandably concerned, as the FT\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Andrew Bounds explains: Back in the eurozone.... Greece has suffered another blow in its battle to emerge from its debt crisis. New figures show that the Greek economy shrank by 1.2% in the final three months of last year. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a very sharp decline, and much worse than the initial estimate of a 0.4% fall in GDP. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the worst contraction since 2015, when Greek banks were closed and capital controls imposed as the country came close to leaving the eurozone. The figures undermine hopes that the Greek economy was turning the corner. Indeed, Capital Economics are worried that the EU\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s forecast for a growth rebound this year looks rather too optimistic. Something for the Greek government to ponder at today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s cabinet meeting, where ministers will discuss a new growth strategy.... Merging Opel and Vauxhall with Peugeot and Citroen could speed up the creation of new auto technologies. So argues Matt Freeman, managing consultant at cap hpi consulting, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The greater scale the combined PSA-Opel will have for technology investment will see a step change in vehicle development, which requires not only investment in new powertrain technology, but also the development of a wind-down strategy for internal combustion engines. Better scale will also create a better negotiating position when dealing with technology providers like Apple and Microsoft.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our news story on the sale of Vauxhall and Opel to PSA Group, and its pledge that job cuts can be avoided: Richard Gane, director and automotive sector specialist at supply chain firm Vendigital, says this is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a bad day\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd for the UK car industry. He isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t convinced by PSA\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s claim that factories won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t need to close, and believes the UK government needs to offer PSA some \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcinducements\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 to protect Ellesmere Port and Luton. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153GM tried to sell Vauxhall-Opel in 2008 and these businesses have been losing money since then so today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision to sell is not a surprise. There is great concern however, that once current production runs are completed Vauxhall\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s UK-based plants at Ellesmere Port and Luton could close, forcing around 4,500 redundancies. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153While it is not yet definite that the plants will close, there is clearly concern that this could happen because in the case of the Astra, for example, around 75% of components are sourced from the EU and the vast majority of the vehicles made at Ellesmere Port are sold outside the UK. If rumours are correct and PSA Group is planning to combine platforms with Peugeot\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s next new model, there would be a strong reason to exit the UK. Mike Hawes, chief executives of industry body SMMT, is more hopeful: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The UK is a competitive player in the automotive industry thanks to its rich heritage, record levels of productivity, skilled workforce and strong collaboration with government. The outlook for vehicle production remains positive with investment commitments made over the past few years still delivering growth. We are hopeful that this deal will provide a positive future for the plants at Luton and Ellesmere Port and the wider supply chain given their inherent advantages. We have been encouraged by the active role government has played reassuring investors of its determination to safeguard our competitiveness despite the uncertainty of Brexit.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Rebecca Lindland, executive analyst at car valuer Kelley Blue Book, believes selling Opel and Vauxhall makes sense for General Motors. It allows the US auto giant to focus on emerging markets such as China and India, she says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Opel/Vauxhall was a profit losing puzzle no one at GM could solve for decades, and outside forces such as Brexit and an increasingly complex regulatory environment did not help the situation. Unloading Opel/Vauxhall and the European part of the financing greatly improves GM\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s balance sheet, allowing investments in growing markets such as China and India and frees up capital for further expansion into ride and car sharing and autonomous vehicles. For PSA, the acquisition should provide bargaining power with its suppliers and economies of scale. But production cost savings will be challenged by the powerful labor unions of Germany, the UK and France. The Labour MP for Ellesmere Port, Justin Madders, is meeting business secretary Greg Clark today, in an attempt to secure the car plant\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s long-term future under Peugeot-Citro\u00c3\u00abn. Madders says the Vauxhall sale is an important test of the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s industrial strategy. Now the new owners are in place, clearly work must begin in earnest to put UK production in the best possible position. There have been significant challenges faced in the past but thanks to great work between the union and management at Ellesmere Port those threats have been overcome so we must draw strength from previous success. There is no doubt that we have some of the most efficient plants in Europe so we have a good tale to tell and we should not underestimate the positive impact on sales that having a U.K. manufacturing base brings. There should be no doubt that one of the biggest selling points to UK consumers is that Vauxhall is a British brand that supports British jobs. That is something that I know will be stressed to PSA. With the country now facing new trading arrangements after Brexit this is the first test of the Government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s commitment to supporting U.K. manufacturing in the new world. The head of the Unite Union, Len McCluskey, has confirmed that PSA has promised to stick to Vauxhall\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s existing commitments. That could reassure workers about their short-term future.... ....but McCluskey is also worried that the Ellesmere Port plant, which makes Vauxhall Astras, needs a plan for beyond 2021. The Press Association has the details: Len McCluskey told Sky News that the head of the PSA Group, which makes Peugeot, had given reassurances that all commitments would be honoured as part of the deal to buy General Motors\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 European operations, which include Vauxhall in Britain. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153There is a cautious optimism,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153But of course the real issue is not the current products, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s about the new models and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be determined to make certain that the British plants have a long term future. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The current model in Ellesmere Port goes up to 2020/2021 but really it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s this time next year, maybe the middle of next year, (when) we would need to secure acceptance of a new model there. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s really the challenge for all of us. Vauxhall workers in Merseyside are hopeful that the PSA takeover will work out, reports that BBC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Colletta Smith: Labour MP Angela Eagle, whose the Merseyside constituency of Wallasey includes many Vauxhall workers, has tweeted about the deal: Business Secretary Greg Clark has welcomed PSA\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pledge not to rip-up existing deals with Vauxhall\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s workers. He says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Vauxhall has a long history of success in this country and we are determined to see that continue. The Government welcomes the assurance by PSA that they will respect the commitments made by GM to Vauxhall\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s employees and pensioners. The UK government will work with PSA to ensure that it keeps that promise, Clark adds. The Prime Minister and I have been in close contact with the PSA Group and General Motors and they have been clear this deal is an opportunity to grow the Vauxhall brand, building on their existing strengths and commitments. The Peugeot-Citroen press conference is now over...here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s some instant reaction from industry experts. Finally, PSA gets a question about Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s exit from the European Union.... Q: What impact will Brexit have on this deal? Carlos Tavares says that no-one knows how Brexit is going to unfold, but the key issue is the trade relationships that Britain has with Europe. If you think deeply about the two scenarios -either it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hard or soft. If it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a soft Brexit, then the focus is simply on performance - being competitive in the UK versus other countries. In that set-up, the cheaper pound could boost competitiveness. If it is a hard Brexit - it will be \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a very nice opportunity\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to source more car parts from inside the UK, Tavares continues. That would allow Vauxhall to record more of its costs in sterling, bringing them in line with revenues. This means that the UK supplier base needs to be developed....something that the UK government \u00e2\u20ac\u0153totally understands\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, Tavares says. Journalists in Paris are pressing Peugeot-Citreon about the fears of job cuts. Q: What guarantees can PSA give to workers at Opel and Vauxhall? Carlos Tavares promises that all existing agreements with unions at the two car companies will be honoured. This is not tactical, this is ethics. If there is a deal, we will respect it. But what about the future, when those agreements expire? Tavares repeats his line about giving workers a chance to improve efficiencies. Q: Can you achieve the planned efficiency savings without cutting staff? Tavares says the targets aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t based on cutting jobs. Instead, it is based on allowing \u00e2\u20ac\u0153talented and creative\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd staff to show their potential. We will offer workers a European benchmark which they can compare themselves to, Tavares adds. ITV\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Joel Hills gets the microphone. Q: General Motors is taking a \u00e2\u201a\u00ac4.5bn write-down on this deal - isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t that a sign that it was keen to get out of Europe? GM\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Mary Barra reiterates that this deal is an \u00e2\u20ac\u0153opportunity to strengthen the business\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and help GM to stay competitive. Q: Can Peugeot-Citreon make this deal work without closing factories? PSA\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Carlos Tavares says that PSA hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t shut a factory since he took control of the company. Shutting down a plant is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153rather simplistic\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, Tavares continues. His philosophy is that if you trust people, they will come up with ideas and solutions that you wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have thought off. But for that to happen, workforce and managers must believe that they are being given a chance. Tavares concludes: Everyone will have a chance to reach the benchmark of efficiency. As we progress towards that benchmark of efficiency, we do not need to shut down plants. Q: What does this deal mean for PSA\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s existing factories in Spain? Speaking in French, Carlos Tavares says the Spanish factories have improved their performance in recent years. PSA has \u00e2\u20ac\u0153nothing to hide\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, he insists. Colleagues across the company have \u00e2\u20ac\u0153legitimate\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd questions over whether their jobs are protected, he adds - and he reiterates that the answer is to be as efficient and productive as possible. Q: PSA will have 19 factories once this deal goes through. Will you keep them all open? PSA\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Carlos Taraves doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t make any promises -- instead, he signals that car workers hold their future in their own hands. We believe that people understand that the only thing that protects them is the ability to be at the right level of performance, Taraves says. As a company that had a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153near-death\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd experience four year ago, we know that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the only thing that protects us is performance\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, Taraves adds. Onto questions... Q: Did the election of Donald Trump influence GM\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision to sell its European operations? Mary Barra replies that that deal is based on business logic, not political issues. Now the head of Opel, Karl-Thomas Neumann, speaks, and also sound optimistic abotu the sale to PSA. He says the deal will create a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153European champion\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, with Opel remaining a true German brand, and Vauxhall remaining a true British brand. Mary Barra is followed by GM\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s president, Dan Ammann. He says GM found it hard to grow its market share in Europe, despite making improvements at Opel and Vauxhall. Shares in PSA Group have jumped by 4% in early trading, as investors give the deal the thumbs-up. More from Mary Barra: GM\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Mary Barra is also attending the PSA press conference in Paris. She joins Carlos Tavares on the stage now.... Barra says the deal will put Opel and Vauxhall on a firmer footing for the future, and create a new era for the two companies. She admits that it wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t an easy decision, but says GM is convinced that the sale is the right decision for customers, workers and shareholders. Barra also argues that GM Europe would have hit its goal of breaking even in 2016 \u00e2\u20ac\u0153if it wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t for Brexit\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. PSA\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chairman, Carlos Tavares, tells journalists in Paris that today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s deal will create \u00e2\u20ac\u0153create a new European automotive champion\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and unleash the full potential of Vauxhall and Opel. Tavares insists that PSA is committed to both brands. In conclusion, this deal is a game-changed for PSA, Tavares adds. You can also watch the PSA press conference on Periscope, here: Over in Paris, PSA Group is holding a press conference to discuss the Vauxhall/Opel deal. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s being streamed live here (in English). The Vauxhall-Opel sale isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t the only big deal announced this morning. Standard Life has just swooped on fellow insurance group Aberdeen Asset Management in an \u00c2\u00a311bn takeover. Standard Life\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shares have surged by 9% in early trading, while Aberdeen are up 6.5%. But while the City likes the tie-up, staff at both companies may be fearing for their future, with \u00c2\u00a3200m of cost-cuts planned. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s my colleague Julia Kollewe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s take: Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a bit of UK car history -- the first Vauxhall Viva rolling off the production line at the Ellesmere Port factory, back in 1964. Politicians in Germany and Britain have been scrambling to protect workers at Opel and Vauxhall, respectively, in anticipation of this morning\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s deal. City analyst Louise Cooper fears that British workers could be vulnerable. She suspects that Paris government, which holds a stake in PSA, won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to spare Britain from the cost-cutting. Sky\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Darren McCaffrey is also concerned that workers in Luton or Ellesmere Port, in Cheshire, could be hit. Labour MP Gavin Shuker, who represents Luton South, has welcomed the end to the uncertainty over Vauxhall\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s future. Shuker also points out that Vauxhall\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s factories are more efficient than most of PSA\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s other operations -- a reason not to consider closing them.... Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the official annoucement: Opel/Vauxhall to join PSA Group General Motor\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s CEO, Mary Barra, says this deal will help GM to focus on new technologies (probably including self-driving cars?). \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We are reshaping our company and delivering consistent, record results for our owners through disciplined capital allocation to our higher-return investments in our core automotive business and in new technologies that are enabling us to lead the future of personal mobility. Barra also argues that Opel and Vauxhall will be in \u00e2\u20ac\u0153an even stronger position for the long term\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. PSA\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chairman, Carlos Tavares, is trying to reassure Vauxhall and Opel workers about the future. Speaking as the deal is announced, Tavaras says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We are proud to join forces with Opel/Vauxhall and are deeply committed to continuing to develop this great company and accelerating its turnaround. We respect all that Opel/Vauxhall\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s talented people have achieved as well as the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fine brands and strong heritage. We intend to manage PSA and Opel/Vauxhall capitalizing on their respective brand identities. Having already created together winning products for the European market, we know that Opel/Vauxhall is the right partner. We see this as a natural extension of our relationship and are eager to take it to the next level.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We are confident that the Opel/Vauxhall turnaround will significantly accelerate with our support, while respecting the commitments made by GM to the Opel/Vauxhall employees.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd But....PSA is also adamant that it will make cost-savings once the deal goes through.... It says: The transaction will allow substantial economies of scale and synergies in purchasing, manufacturing and R&amp;D. Annual synergies of \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.7 Bn are expected by 2026 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c of which a significant part is expected to be delivered by 2020, accelerating Opel/Vauxhall\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s turnaround It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s official - General Motors is pulling out of the European car market by selling its Vauxhall and Opel divisions in a \u00e2\u201a\u00ac2.2bn (\u00c2\u00a31.9bn) deal. The agreement, announced a few minutes ago, will see France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s PSA Group (the firm behind Peugeot and Citroen) take ownership of Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Opel and Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Vauxhall. It ends weeks of speculation over the future of both car brands, and will make PSA Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s second-largest automotive company, with 17% of the market. But it also means fresh uncertainty for workers at Vauxhall\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s two British plants, at Ellesmere Port and Luton, if PSA decides to cut costs. Details and reaction to follow.... Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a lot afoot this morning, starting with the car industry, as General Motors seals a deal to sell its Opel and Vauxhall divisions to France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s PSA. In the UK, two of Scotland\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest companies \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Standard Life and Aberdeen Asset Management \u00e2\u20ac\u201c are on track to merge, creating the second biggest fund manager in Europe. Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Deutsche Bank is also in focus, after announcing plans to raise \u00e2\u201a\u00ac8bn of fresh capital to bolster its balance sheet. European stock markets are expected to open smoothly, with the FTSE 100 hovering close to last week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s record highs. City traders will also be preparing for Wednesday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Budget announcement, with chancellor Philip Hammond expected to announce plans to set aside billions of pounds to cover the impact of Brexit. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be covering all the main events through the day....",

The tech sector is likely to be prioritised during negotiations, alongside defence and pharmaceuticals \u00e2\u20ac\u201c not least because one in seven NHS drugs come from Israel.</p> <p>Ron Atzmon, managing director of the ID authentication tech company Au10tix, wants the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u201cIsrael relationship to replicate aspects of the EU, with harmonisation of VAT rates and intellectual property regulations.</p> <p>Coupled with more relaxed immigration rules, Atzmon says this would ensure Israeli tech firms will come to a UK where tech \u00e2\u20ac\u0153knowledge is not overflowing outside of London\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Israel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s phenomenal expertise in cybersecurity will particularly interest British negotiators, given the National Crime Agency confirmed last year that cybercrime is costing the UK economy \u00e2\u20ac\u0153billions of pounds per annum\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd.</p> <p>Sharren Haskel, a member of the Israeli parliament from the ruling Likud party, says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153One of the main areas we can co-operate is cybersecurity, where Israel is receiving 20% of worldwide investments \u00e2\u20ac\u201c huge for such a small country.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd</p> <p>In turn, the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s growing expertise in major infrastructure projects, such as high-speed rail, could benefit an Israel that is struggling to keep up with population growth because of a shortage of 10,000 engineers.</p> <p>Back on the ground, Kibbutz Nirim is overflowing with sweet potatoes and radishes. It is also covered with bomb shelters, because this green paradise in southern Israel is only two kilometres from the border of the Hamas-controlled Gaza strip.</p> <p>Should the Israel-Hamas conflict of 2014 have a sequel, as many Israelis fear will happen, an automated voice repeating the words <em>tzeva adom</em> \u00e2\u20ac\u201c \u00e2\u20ac\u0153colour red\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u201c will be played if mortars are fired on the kibbutz. This will give the 400 residents a seven-second warning to reach those shelters.</p> <p>But the eyes of Nirim\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s general secretary, Anat Heffetz, light up at the prospect of exporting all those vegetables to the UK. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Yes, of course, we would love to sell to Britain,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd she says. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We have excellent avocadoes \u00e2\u20ac\u201c because my husband grows them!\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd</p> <h2>Other contenders</h2> <p>Canada, Australia and New Zealand are top of the list of countries Brexit ministers believe will be willing and able to sign a trade deal soon after the UK quits the EU.</p> <p>Canada sealed a deal with the EU last year that covers goods and services from agriculture to banking. The UK will be excluded, but could quickly demolish trade barriers by simply adopting the deal itself, should premier Justin Trudeau believe it worth his while.</p> <p>The Brexit ministry is known to be scouting former Canadian negotiators to help get talks started. And more negotiators are crucial after 40 years without any, other than a handful of UK officials at the European commission. If cloning were an option, former trade minister Peter Mandelson might find himself duplicated several times, if only to fill meetings with more experienced heads than the UK has at the moment.Brexit ministers are keen to approach Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s administration to negotiate a trade deal, but will find it is more productive talking to Australia and New Zealand. Both countries have said they are interested in talks; they share the same legal system and much the same approach to trade.</p> <p>Australia is attempting to resurrect Barack Obama\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Trans Pacific Partnership free trade deal without the US now that Donald Trump has killed it off, but should still be keen to open its market to the UK. <strong>Phillip Inman</strong></p> <ul> <li><em>The spelling of the Golan village Mas\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ade was corrected on 12 March 2017.</em><br></li> </ul>",

Given that this right would end on Brexit, Sorene points out: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153If the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s exit arrangements with the EU involve restricted movement for EU nationals this could indirectly cut the flow of Israeli tech workers to the UK, unless the UK designs a special arrangement for Israel.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Technology is booming in Israel: Google, Apple, Facebook, and Microsoft all have research centres there, and there are 300,000 hi-tech workers in a country of only 8.5 million people. The tech sector is likely to be prioritised during negotiations, alongside defence and pharmaceuticals \u00e2\u20ac\u201c not least because one in seven NHS drugs come from Israel. Ron Atzmon, managing director of the ID authentication tech company Au10tix, wants the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u201cIsrael relationship to replicate aspects of the EU, with harmonisation of VAT rates and intellectual property regulations. Coupled with more relaxed immigration rules, Atzmon says this would ensure Israeli tech firms will come to a UK where tech \u00e2\u20ac\u0153knowledge is not overflowing outside of London\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Israel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s phenomenal expertise in cybersecurity will particularly interest British negotiators, given the National Crime Agency confirmed last year that cybercrime is costing the UK economy \u00e2\u20ac\u0153billions of pounds per annum\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Sharren Haskel, a member of the Israeli parliament from the ruling Likud party, says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153One of the main areas we can co-operate is cybersecurity, where Israel is receiving 20% of worldwide investments \u00e2\u20ac\u201c huge for such a small country.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd In turn, the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s growing expertise in major infrastructure projects, such as high-speed rail, could benefit an Israel that is struggling to keep up with population growth because of a shortage of 10,000 engineers. Back on the ground, Kibbutz Nirim is overflowing with sweet potatoes and radishes. It is also covered with bomb shelters, because this green paradise in southern Israel is only two kilometres from the border of the Hamas-controlled Gaza strip. Should the Israel-Hamas conflict of 2014 have a sequel, as many Israelis fear will happen, an automated voice repeating the words tzeva adom \u00e2\u20ac\u201c \u00e2\u20ac\u0153colour red\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u201c will be played if mortars are fired on the kibbutz. This will give the 400 residents a seven-second warning to reach those shelters. But the eyes of Nirim\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s general secretary, Anat Heffetz, light up at the prospect of exporting all those vegetables to the UK. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Yes, of course, we would love to sell to Britain,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd she says. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We have excellent avocadoes \u00e2\u20ac\u201c because my husband grows them!\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Other contenders Canada, Australia and New Zealand are top of the list of countries Brexit ministers believe will be willing and able to sign a trade deal soon after the UK quits the EU. Canada sealed a deal with the EU last year that covers goods and services from agriculture to banking. The UK will be excluded, but could quickly demolish trade barriers by simply adopting the deal itself, should premier Justin Trudeau believe it worth his while. The Brexit ministry is known to be scouting former Canadian negotiators to help get talks started. And more negotiators are crucial after 40 years without any, other than a handful of UK officials at the European commission. If cloning were an option, former trade minister Peter Mandelson might find himself duplicated several times, if only to fill meetings with more experienced heads than the UK has at the moment.Brexit ministers are keen to approach Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s administration to negotiate a trade deal, but will find it is more productive talking to Australia and New Zealand. Both countries have said they are interested in talks; they share the same legal system and much the same approach to trade. Australia is attempting to resurrect Barack Obama\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Trans Pacific Partnership free trade deal without the US now that Donald Trump has killed it off, but should still be keen to open its market to the UK.
