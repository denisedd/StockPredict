But the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s withdrawal from the EU could bring significant disruption to Ireland as the UK aims for a free trade agreement rather than participation in the single market. </p> <p>Brexit will likely mean lower export growth, deeper disruption to well-established supply chains and the need to establish controls at the border with the UK, its second-largest export market after the United States. </p> <p>Higher foreign direct investment inflows could mitigate some of the negative impact, as Ireland will likely be a key beneficiary from the diversion of investment from the UK. However, Ireland faces important supply constraints, in particular in the area of housing and might not be able to realise its full FDI potential.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>And the risks posed by US corporate tax reform:</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>There is now the prospect of major corporate tax reforms in the US which constitutes an additional risk for Ireland\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s foreign direct investment-focused economic model.</p> </blockquote> <blockquote> <p>The scale of [this] risk to the Irish economy is still unclear as details of any US corporate tax rule changes have yet to be announced. But multinational companies are a crucial part of Ireland\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economic success and Ireland\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s low corporate tax rate has been an important driver for foreign direct investment in the country. </p> <p>Multinationals originating from the US account for around half of all foreign companies located in Ireland, implying that big changes in US corporate tax rules could heavily affect Ireland. In Moody\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s view, new investment inflows into Ireland could be materially lower, while Ireland\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s public finances would also be negatively affected.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-58b8073fe4b09c1763ef5648\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-03-02T12:17:31.356Z\">12.17pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Some reaction now to the eurozone inflation data earlier, which showed a pick-up in the headline rate to 2% in February from 1.8% a month earlier.</p> <p><strong>Jennifer McKeown</strong>, chief European economist at <strong>Capital Economics</strong>, says the inflation rise will prove temporary. </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p> February\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rise in euro-zone consumer price inflation put it in line with the ECB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 2% price stability ceiling for the first time since January 2013, but underlying price pressures remain subdued.

We will have additional measures that will reduce the tax-free threshold and reduce pensions. Mr Tsipras is encumbering citizens with the bill. He is not moving ahead with reforms. He can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t create jobs or attract investments. In essence he is bringing a fourth bailout through the backdoor.</p> </blockquote> <p>Mitsotakis, who held talks in Berlin with the German chancellor Angela Merkel recently, said the leftist government was deliberately delaying bailout talks with creditors. </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The [second bailout] review should have been concluded a year ago.

Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s their take \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 Perhaps it is time to remind ourselves why Snapchat has become so big. Something to do with celebrities and selfies? And Lewis Hamilton, apparently. And here it is, Reuters are reporting (in capital letters): SNAP INC OPENS AT $24 ON NYSE VS $17 IPO PRICE The price is still edging up, it seems. This just in from Reuters\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 The indicative opening price for Snap Inc has edged up to $22-$24 a share. Shares in the Snapchat owner have an indicative opening price of $21-$23 a share. So that takes them more than 30% higher than the IPP price of $17 a share. Still waiting for Snap\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s share price to come in. In the meantime, here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s more about the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s messaging app, Snapchat: While we wait for trading in Snap to get underway, here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s how US markets opened: Dow Jones: -0.04% at 21,108 S&amp;P 500: -0.15% at 2,392 Nasdaq: -0.1% at 5,896 No new records yet... Snap\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chief executive Evan Spiegel and chief technology officer Bobby Murphy have rung the opening bell at the New York Stock Exchange. Excitement is building ahead of Snap\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s debut trading session on the New York Stock Exchange. Shares in the company behind the messaging app are expected to soar after the IPO was over subscribed by more than 10 times. After pricing its IPO at $17 a share, Snap has a market value of roughly $24bn. The US President is expected to speak to the Greek prime minister in the coming days. The substance of the call, according to well-placed sources, will be Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ongoing negotiations with creditors and the role the International Monetary Fund may or may not play in the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s current rescue programme. Donald Trump has publicly tweeted that he thinks the Greeks are \u00e2\u20ac\u0153wasting their time\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd staying in the eurozone. As the largest shareholder in the IMF, with a 17% share of the body\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s voting power, Washington has effective veto power over many decisions. The IMF has yet to sign up to Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s third bailout programme, with Germany and the Netherlands saying its participation is vital if further emergency loans are to be disbursed to the debt-stricken country. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The government is attaching great significance to the conversation in its bid to get a clearer picture of Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s position on several issues, not least the Greek bailout program,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd the Kathimerini news paper wrote today. With tensions also rising in the Aegean between regional rivals Greece and Turkey, Athens is also placing stock in Washington\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s interventionist powers, diplomats say. President Barack Obama, who chose to give his farewell speech abroad in the Greek capital, was aggressively supportive of Greece remaining in the single currency, stepping in when the country came closest yet to leaving the euro six months after Tsipras assumed power in mid-2015. Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Whitehouse chief of staff Reince Priebus, who is of Greek descent, told a visiting Greek delegation ahead of the president\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s swearing-in that the new administration was determined to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153fix Greece\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, although he failed to make clear whether he meant in or out of the eurozone. The number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits fell to a near 44-year low last week, beating expectations. There were 223,000 new claims in the week ending 25 February, lower than the 243,000 predicted by economists and lower than 242,000 posted a week earlier. It was the lowest since March 1973, the US Labor Department said, and the 104th week in a row that claims were below 300,000 - a threshold associated with a healthy labour market. Mike Ashley, the founder and chief executive of Sports Direct, is hoping to snap up Agent Provocateur. The upmarket lingerie is expected to enter administration on Thursday with Sports Direct the favourite to buy the business out of insolvency proceedings. Sky News reported earlier this week that Ashley had gone higher than private equity firm Lion Capital in a bidding war. Agent Provocateur is owned by private equity firm 3i but the brand has struggled in recent years. 3i wrote down the value of its 80% stake in the business by \u00c2\u00a339m last year to reflect its problems and accounting irregularities were also uncovered. Read our full story here: A \u00e2\u20ac\u02dchard\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Brexit is one of the biggest threats facing the Irish economy according to Moody\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Investors Service. Another is the prospect of US corporate tax reforms. Moody\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stresses however that Ireland\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s growth prospects remain strong. Kathrin Muehlbronner, a Moody\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s senior vice president and author of the report explains on the risks posed by Brexit: Ireland has been growing strongly since 2014 and we expect it to continue to do so in the coming years. But the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s withdrawal from the EU could bring significant disruption to Ireland as the UK aims for a free trade agreement rather than participation in the single market. Brexit will likely mean lower export growth, deeper disruption to well-established supply chains and the need to establish controls at the border with the UK, its second-largest export market after the United States. Higher foreign direct investment inflows could mitigate some of the negative impact, as Ireland will likely be a key beneficiary from the diversion of investment from the UK. However, Ireland faces important supply constraints, in particular in the area of housing and might not be able to realise its full FDI potential. And the risks posed by US corporate tax reform: There is now the prospect of major corporate tax reforms in the US which constitutes an additional risk for Ireland\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s foreign direct investment-focused economic model. The scale of [this] risk to the Irish economy is still unclear as details of any US corporate tax rule changes have yet to be announced. But multinational companies are a crucial part of Ireland\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economic success and Ireland\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s low corporate tax rate has been an important driver for foreign direct investment in the country. Multinationals originating from the US account for around half of all foreign companies located in Ireland, implying that big changes in US corporate tax rules could heavily affect Ireland. In Moody\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s view, new investment inflows into Ireland could be materially lower, while Ireland\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s public finances would also be negatively affected. Some reaction now to the eurozone inflation data earlier, which showed a pick-up in the headline rate to 2% in February from 1.8% a month earlier. Jennifer McKeown, chief European economist at Capital Economics, says the inflation rise will prove temporary. February\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rise in euro-zone consumer price inflation put it in line with the ECB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 2% price stability ceiling for the first time since January 2013, but underlying price pressures remain subdued. The pick-up entirely reflected higher energy and food inflation while the core rate was unchanged at just 0.9%. Florian Hense, economist at the German bank Berenberg, agrees, and suggests the European Central Bank will not feel the need to tighten policy at next week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meeting: The ECB will not have to rethink the thrust of its policies. The ECB will be very cautious not to make the same mistake it did in 2011 when it ended up hiking rates in April and July, just a few months before the Euro crisis erupted. Would you be happy to travel in a driverless car? The Guardian\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Gwyn Topham took a spin around East London in a self-driving electric Nissan Leaf. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s what happened: And the story in full: Moving over to Greece now, where the main opposition leader says the government is deliberately drawing out negotiations with creditors and preparing the country for a fourth bailout. From Athens our correspondent Helena Smith reports: Seven years after it was granted its first emergency loan programme, Greece is being prepared for a fourth bailout, says Kyriakos Mitsotakis, who heads the main opposition centre right New Democracy party. In a wide ranging interview aired on Ant 1 TV on Wednesday night, the politician said prime minister Alexis Tsipras\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 acceptance of further pension cuts and tax reforms was tantamount to a new adjustment programme that New Democracy would not be backing. This government cannot get the country out of the impasse it is in. We will have additional measures that will reduce the tax-free threshold and reduce pensions. Mr Tsipras is encumbering citizens with the bill. He is not moving ahead with reforms. He can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t create jobs or attract investments. In essence he is bringing a fourth bailout through the backdoor. Mitsotakis, who held talks in Berlin with the German chancellor Angela Merkel recently, said the leftist government was deliberately delaying bailout talks with creditors. The [second bailout] review should have been concluded a year ago. The government is consciously delaying [it] for reasons of domestic consumption. There is a big danger that entry into the [ECB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s] quantitative easing [programme] will be missed. The spectre of yet more cuts has caused rising alarm in Greece with pensioners taking to the streets. It comes as the Cologne Institute for Economic research says poverty in Greece has shot up by 40 % between 2008 and 2015. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Greece is the big loser,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd the think tank said in its latest study on the European economy, pointing out that the increase was the biggest among EU member states. President Trump is awake and tweeting about his impact on markets: The weak spots in the construction PMI survey have helped to push the pound to a six-week low against the dollar. Sterling fell 0.25% to $1.2259 against a broadly stronger dollar. It also hit a two-week low against the euro, with one euro worth 85.90p. Naeem Aslam at Think Markets said the outlook for the pound was very much dependent on how quickly Theresa May can push ahead with Brexit plans. If she can trigger Brexit as per her deadline, it may push sterling even lower as this will send the message that Theresa May is in full control and her hard Brexit is taking shape. On the flip side, if she cannot deliver this on time, this could be a positive thing for sterling, and the currency could rally all the way to $1.28, with a potential target of $1.30 a realistic target as well. Earlier the Markit/CIPS UK construction PMI suggested activity in the sector grew in February at a similar pace to January. The headline index edged up to 52.5 from 52.2, where anything above 50 signals expansion. Civil engineers reported an acceleration in growth, while growth in housing construction slowed slightly. Construction of commercial buildings such as offices and shops slowed. Firms were fairly upbeat according to Tim Moore, senior economist at IHS Markit and author of the report, but there were reports of weakening demand: February\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s survey data highlights that the UK construction sector has rebounded from its post- referendum soft patch but remains on a relatively slow growth trajectory. Weaker momentum in the house building sector was a key factor weighing on construction growth, alongside a renewed fall in work commercial projects. There was little sign that the UK storms had a material impact on construction growth in February, although some firms noted that longer delivery times for roof tiles had added to supply chain issues. Instead, survey respondents mainly cited an underlying slowdown in sales growth, with the latest rise in new work the weakest for four months. Cost pressures in the sector remained at an eight-and-a-half year high, as the sharp drop in the value of sterling since the Brexit vote pushes up the price of materials and goods imported from abroad. The eurozone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s unemployment rate was unchanged in January at 9.6% - the lowest since May 2009. There were 15.2 million unemployed people in the region, down 56,000 compared with December. Greece has the highest jobless rate in the eurozone at 23%, while Germany has the lowest at 3.8%. Youth unemployment also fell in January, by 198,000 compared with a year earlier to 2.8 million. The youth unemployment rate remains high at 20%. The highest rate is 45.7% in Greece, and the lowest is 6.5% in Germany. The headline rate of inflation in the eurozone rose to 2% in February from 1.8% in January, bang in line with expectations. Eurostat, the region\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s statistics office, said energy prices, food, alcohol and tobacco were the main drivers of the rise. Shares in the outsourcing group Capita are down 9% after the company revealed a 33% fall in annual profits and said its chief executive Andy Parker was stepping down. It follows confirmation that the company, which operates the London congestion charge, is to be relegated from the FTSE 100 because of a sharp fall in the share price. Parker commented on his departure: 2016 has been a difficult year for Capita but the Company is now a simpler, more focussed group with a clear service offering and growth strategy, and a plan to achieve a stronger balance sheet. We have achieved a great deal but going forward it is time for a new leader to take Capita through the next steps to renewed and sustainable organic growth. If you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re feeling nostalgic following the news that the Football Pools is being sold for \u00c2\u00a383m, below is a potted history of the former British staple. At its peak in the 1970s and 1980s, the pools had 15 million regular punters, helped by an army of door-to-door coupon collectors. The Football Pools, once a staple of the British Saturday teatime, is about to change hands in an \u00c2\u00a383m deal. Its owner, London-listed betting company Sportech, has agreed to sell the football lottery game to a company controlled by funds advised by European private equity investors OpCapita. The conditional sale agreement comes after a near-\u00c2\u00a3100m sale of the Football Pools to its management team fell through in November. The Football Pools dates back to 1923 and has struggled against the National Lottery, but is still popular with about 300,000 stalwarts who spend an average of just over \u00c2\u00a33 a week in the hope of scooping the maximum price of \u00c2\u00a33m. The business was formed from the merger of the three big pools operators, Littlewoods, Vernons and Zetters between 2000 and 2007. The pools will still move into new premises in Liverpool city centre. John Von Spreckelsen, chairman of OpCapita: We are delighted to be acquiring the Football Pools, which occupies a unique place in British culture. Sportech has successfully modernised the business and we look forward to realising its significant growth potential. As part of that growth strategy, we plan to ensure existing loyal customers continue to enjoy the game and bring the Football Pools, already loved by so many, to an even wider audience. Neil Wilson, senior market analyst, at ETX Capital, says Snap\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s debut in New York coincides with a period of bullishness among investors: Snap shares look set to fly when they begin trading in New York today after being priced at $17, above its target range. With the Dow closing above 21,000 for the first time the IPO comes at an incredibly bullish point for US, and indeed global, equities. Of course such bullishness is reminiscent of the dotcom bubble and this could be a high watermark for the market. The offer was 10 times over-subscribed, making a strong case for the stock to pop on the open. Big institutional funds will step in to the main market to add to their holdings, forcing up the price. Lessons to be learned from Facebook\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s IPO? We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve also seen huge retail client interest in Snap shares \u00e2\u20ac\u201c this is as big as the Facebook IPO in terms of the hype and buzz around it. But trading in Snap shares could be choppy today. It could be pricing high and selling low. Facebook again is instructive \u00e2\u20ac\u201c it endured a rocky start to life on the public markets, sliding from its IPO price before turning things around. Of course its IPO was beset by technical problems that the US exchanges are keen to avoid this time. There is also a sense that the shares could be overpriced, based on some key fundamentals. Shares in Snap, the American technology company behind the messaging app Snapchat, will start trading in New York today. Shares are expected to soar after it raised $3.4bn (\u00c2\u00a32.9bn) in its initial public offering (IPO) on Wednesday, above its price expectations. Snap\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s IPO was over-subscribed by more than 10 times, suggesting demand for shares will be strong when trading gets underway. Reuters notes: After pricing its IPO at $17 a share, the owner of the popular disappearing-message app has a market value of roughly $24 billion, more than double the size of rival Twitter Inc and the richest valuation in a US tech IPO since Facebook five years ago. The share sale was the first test of investor appetite for a social-media app that is beloved by teenagers and people under 30 for applying bunny faces and vomiting rainbows onto selfies, but has yet to convert \u00e2\u20ac\u0153cool\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd into cash. The FTSE 100 might only be up 4 points or 0.1% at 7,387 but it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a new record high. Hussein Sayed, chief market strategist at FXTM, says investors are on a high following Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s spending pledges despite the fact the President has yet to provide any detail. Equities analysts and strategists including myself have been arguing for some time that if no further details were provided on how and when the proposed US tax reforms and spending plans will take place, the market rally should take a pause. However, US President Donald Trump provided no new details in his speech to Congress on Tuesday, and yet, stocks surged to new highs. He also points out that rising expectations that the Federal Reserve will hike interest rates this month are also driving shares higher... usually such expectations would have the opposite effect as investors remain hooked on stimulus as the hangover from the financial crisis persists. Sayed says: What\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s even more interesting is markets now consider a tighter monetary policy a sign of confidence in economic growth and thus a reason to continue purchasing stocks, when for years post 2008 crisis it had been considered the most significant motive to dump stocks. Does the market rally have legs? There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no doubt that improved economic conditions, consumer confidence, and higher inflation will all lead to higher earnings growth, but what markets are currently pricing in is more than just these factors. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s mainly about tax reforms, and assuming a reduction in the U.S. corporate tax from 35% to 20%, although difficult to calculate its impact on earnings, is expected to lift net profits from 10% to 15%, and this is what investors are betting on. If you still want to ride the current bullish momentum wave, pray that Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tax reduction plan succeeds as soon as possible. The spotlight is on key elections coming up in Europe and all bets are off following Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shock Brexit vote and America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision to install Donald Trump in the White House. Could the Netherlands deliver the next surprise? Here is a useful guide to the Dutch elections on 15 March: As markets settle following a record-breaking run, investors await the flash eurozone inflation rate for February, to be published at 10am. If economists polled by Reuters get it right, and the headline rate rises to 2% from 1.8% in January, Mario Draghi is likely to come under renewed pressure over the European Central Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stimulus measures. Specifically, pressure could build on the president of the ECB to announce policy tightening at next week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meeting of the governing council. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll bring you the figure and reaction when it comes. The FTSE 100 is up slightly this morning, rising 0.1% or four points to 7,387. Elsewhere in Europe major markets are up with the exception of Spain. German\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s DAX: +0.03% at 12,071 France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s CAC: +0.2% at 4,9781 Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB: +0.01% at 19,367 Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s IBEX: -0.04% at 9,748 Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s STOXX 600: +0.1% at 376 The FTSE 250, which is more domestically focused on the UK than the FTSE 100, is down 0.1% at 18,961. Britain is in the midst of the weakest growth in living standards in at least 60 years, with low income families faring the worst, the Institute for Fiscal Studies is warning today. In a pretty gloomy report on poverty, inequality, and living standards, the thinktank says household incomes will not grow at all over the next two years. On average, by 2021-22, families will be \u00c2\u00a35,000 a year worse off than they might have reasonably expected back in 2007-08 before the financial crisis took hold. Inequality and child poverty are also expected to rise over the next five years as a direct result of government policies. Andrew Hood, an author of the report and a senior research economist at IFS, explains: Weak earnings growth combined with planned benefit cuts means that the absolute poverty rate among children is projected to be roughly the same in 2021\u00e2\u20ac\u201c22 as it was back in 2007\u00e2\u20ac\u201c08. In the decade before that, it fell by a third. Tax and benefit changes planned for this parliament explain all of the projected increase in absolute child poverty between 2014\u00e2\u20ac\u201c15 and 2021\u00e2\u20ac\u201c22. A Treasury spokesperson has responded to the report: We are taking action to support families with the costs of living by cutting taxes for millions of working people, doubling free childcare for nearly 400,000 working parents and introducing the National Living Wage \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a significant pay rise for the lowest earners. More people are now in work than ever before with living standards also forecast to rise over this Parliament. Here is our full story: Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. President Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pledge to go on a major spending spree drove a surge in investor optimism, pushing indices on both sides of the Atlantic to fresh record highs on Wednesday. Asia followed Wall Street higher this morning with the Hang Seng and Nikkei both just about in positive territory. CMC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Michael Hewson has this take on investor mood: Records tumbled one after the other yesterday as equity markets across the world went on a tear in the wake of US President Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pledge to spend up to $1trn on rebuilding the infrastructure of the United States, with the FTSE100 and FTSE250 both making an closing at new record highs, as the reflation trade took another leg higher. US markets also surged with the Dow opening above 21,000 and the S&amp;P500 also hitting new record highs above 2,400, as markets posted their best one day gain of 2017. Also coming up day we have the flash estimate of eurozone inflation which is expected to show a pick up in the headline rate to 2% in February from 1.8% in January, potentially causing problems for Mario Draghi. We also have eurozone unemployment. In the UK we have the latest snapshot of construction from the PMI survey for February. And over in the US we have weekly jobless claims figures. We will be bringing you all the latest developments as the day unfolds.",

He said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The decline in the services PMI to a five-month low in February is the clearest sign yet that the U.K. now is enduring stagflation.</p> <p>The business activity index is consistent with quarter-on-quarter growth in output in the non-distribution private services sector slowing to around 0.2% in the first quarter from 0.7% in the fourth quarter. Granted, the PMI often is influenced excessively by sentiment and it was far too downbeat immediately after the referendum. But the recent rally in equity prices should have boosted corporate confidence. In addition, the services PMI was too downbeat last year because it excludes the retail sector, which benefited from a surge in consumer spending. Evidence on retail spending so far this year has been disappointingly weak. </p> <p>The services sector looks vulnerable to slowing sharply over the coming months now that businesses are rising prices rapidly. Indeed, the output prices balance rose to 54.1 in February\u00e2\u20ac\u201dits highest level since September 2008\u00e2\u20ac\u201dfrom 53.7 in January. In the past, the business activity index has tended to weaken over the following six months whenever the output prices index has exceeded 52. Accordingly, we continue to expect quarter-on-quarter GDP growth to average just 0.2% this year, ensuring that the MPC holds back from raising interest rates despite high inflation.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-58b94627e4b07c254ae21b72\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-03-03T10:41:02.470Z\">10.41am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Back with the UK, and the PMI data confirms the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy is likely to see slower growth this year, according to Daniel Vernazza, lead UK economist at UniCredit Research. He said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The bigger than expected fall in the services PMI adds to the mounting evidence in recent weeks that the UK economy is slowing. It fits with the recent fall in retail sales amid a squeeze in real household income growth. We continue to expect growth to slow this year and for the UK economy to decouple from firming global economic activity...</p> <p>The weaker headline figure, which refers to output/business activity, was also reflected in the detail of the report. The new orders balance fell 1.3pts. to 54.7, and both backlogs-of-work and future business expectations edged down. Set against this, the employment balance rose.</p> <p>There are two salient explanations for the recent softness. First, the squeeze in real household income growth (resulting from higher imported inflation) is weighing on demand, particularly for retail services...</p> <p>Second, Brexit-related economic uncertainty remains high and this will increasingly weigh on business investment as the date when the UK formally leaves the EU (spring 2019) approaches.</p> <p>The composite PMI... fell to 53.6 in February, down from an average of 55.4 in the final quarter of last year. The sectorial breakdown clearly reveals that the weakness in the UK economy is domestic, with the export-oriented manufacturing sector performing relatively well and supported by the past depreciation of sterling and firming global economic activity (particularly in Europe). Based on the historical relationship between the composite PMI and real GDP growth, the PMIs in February would be consistent with a quarterly real GDP growth rate of around 0.3%-0.4% quarter on quarter. We keep our forecast for first quarter 2017 real GDP growth of 0.3% quarter on quarter.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-58b9452ce4b09c1763ef5afc\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-03-03T10:31:37.239Z\">10.31am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Despite weak eurozone retail sales figures, shopkeepers remain optimistic about the outlook, says economist Bert Colijn at ING Bank:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Not all that glitters is gold as strong Eurozone economic surveys mask weak performance in retail at the start of the year. The outlook for domestic demand does remain positive though, even under higher inflation rates.</p> <p>While surveys about the Eurozone economy in 2017 have been very upbeat so far, retail sales disappointed in January. The 0.1% month on month decline is the third in a row, while year on year growth is just 1.2%. This suggests that recent Eurozone optimism is not translating into more shopping at the moment.</p> <p>One factor probably influencing this is the rebound of inflation in recent months, bringing price growth back to 2% in the Eurozone. Nominal wage growth has been below 2% since 2013, indicating that real wages are suffering from the recent rebound in prices.</p> <p>Retailers confirmed the current weakness in demand in the Economic Sentiment Indicator as the February survey showed a strong decline in the assessment of the present business situation.</p> <p>Even though recent months have disappointed, retailers do remain optimistic about business in the months ahead. This probably makes sense, given the strength in the job market and relative optimism among consumers.</p> <p>Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s composite PMI numbers confirm that strength in the economy. Still though, this could be a sign for Eurozone growth that domestic demand could be impacted by declining real wages, although we expect consumer spending to remain robust in the first quarter.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2017-03-03T10:37:32.964Z\">at 10.37am GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-58b93eeee4b047c20d904ea7\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-03-03T10:12:12.168Z\">10.12am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Eurozone retail sales slip</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The eurozone may be <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2017/mar/03/markets-edge-lower-ahead-of-service-sector-figures-business-live?page=with:block-58b9318ee4b047c20d904e66#block-58b9318ee4b047c20d904e66\">starting to fire on all cylinders</a> according to the PMIs, but the region\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shopkeepers may not agree.</p> <p>Eurozone retail sales fell by 0.1% month on month in January, the third fall in a row and contradicting expectations of a 0.4% increase.

He said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>After effectively sitting out Thursday, the European markets decided to give back some of the week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rapid growth this morning.</p> <p>Shedding 25 points after the bell, the FTSE started Friday holding above 7350. A smattering of red in its mining sector, and perhaps just a bit of doubt about just how high the index currently sits, seemed responsible for the FTSE\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fall. The pound saw similar losses, slipping to a fresh 6 week nadir against the dollar while handing 0.2% in value back to the euro. </p> <p>Sentiment could shift, however, dependant on the state of the latest services PMI. Analysts are expecting the figure to dip from 54.5 to 54.2 month-on-month, though this week those estimates haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t been very accurate, with the manufacturing and construction PMIs under- and out-performing forecasts respectively. If the services reading can avoid a February dip then the pound may be lifted away from its current lows; if not than sterling\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decline may well intensify.</p> <p>Like in the UK, the Eurozone indices looked a bit weary this morning. The DAX slid 0.4% thanks to a sharp drop in German retail sales, though the index managed to cling on above 12000, while the CAC fell back towards 4950 with a 0.1% decline. The region\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s services data is expectedly to be relatively strong, with the Eurozone-wide figure set to be confirmed at 55.6 for February compared to 53.7 in January, hitting a 6-ish year high in the process.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2017-03-03T08:41:22.936Z\">at 8.41am GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-58b92397e4b09c1763ef5a80\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-03-03T08:07:47.431Z\">8.07am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">European markets open lower</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>As forecast, investors are pausing for breath again after the recent record breaking run in shares.</p> <p>The FTSE 100 has fallen 0.27|% to 7362, Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax has dropped 0.5%, France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac is 0.3% lower and Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB is down 0.41%, while Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ibex has lost 0.5%.</p> <p>And Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Stoxx 600 has opened 0.3% lower.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-58b9201ce4b07c254ae21aea\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-03-03T07:56:52.885Z\">7.56am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The London Stock Exchange, currently in the throes of a merger with Deutsche B\u00c3\u00b6rse, has reported a 21% rise in pretax profit to \u00c2\u00a3623m, in line with expectations.

                "bodyText":"Unlike the Markit survey, the latest Institute for Supply Management report shows stronger than expected growth in the service sector. The ISM non-manufacturing PMI came in at 57.6 in February, up from 56.5 in January and better than the forecasts of 56.5. This is the highest level since October 2015. At 61.2, up from 58.6 in January, the new orders index is at its best since August 2015. On that note it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time to close for the day. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be back on Monday. The first of two surveys of the US service sector has come in marginally below expectations and lower than the previous month. The Markit services PMI for February fell from 55.6 in January to 53.8, below the initial estimate of 53.9. The composite index was 54.1, down from the first reading of 54.3 and the January figure of 55.8. US markets have made an uncertain start to trading after Thursday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s falls. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is up 25 points or 0.12% while the S&amp;P 500 was down 0.07% and the Nasdaq Composite slipped 0.11%. Meanwhile, at the start of the second day of its life as a public company, Snapchat owner Snap followed its 44% first day rise by climbing another 8.8%. It was helped by news that NBC Universal said it had invested $500m in Snap at the flotation. But analysts at Pivotal Research were negative on the company, putting a $10 price target on the shares: Snap is a promising early stage company with significant opportunity ahead of itself. Unfortunately, it is significantly overvalued given the likely scale of its long-term opportunity and the risks associated with executing against that opportunity. Significant ongoing dilution from share-based compensation will likely represent an additional negative consideration for the stock. We value Snap at $10 per share on a 2017 basis. As the stock priced well above this level in its IPO, we rate its shares sell. Meanwhile Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s prime minister Alexis Tsipras appears positive about the current talks with creditors: Over to Greece where politicians, economists and policy makers have been discussing the county\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s outlook at the annual Delphi Economic Forum. Our correspondent Helena Smith caught up with Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Tourism chief there: Tourism, Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s great economic engine, is about to sputter into action, with a new record that will finally help generate growth. Speaking to the Guardian on the sidelines of the Delphi Economic Forum, Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Tourism chief Andreas Andreadis said figures released by airport authorities showed an extra 1.5 million airline seats were planned this year. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153With the expected increase in seat occupancy we will see around two million more arrivals with around 200,000 of that number from the UK. This time, last year, we were in the midst of the refugee crisis and Spain was the big winner. Now Greece is the big winner.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The boost will bring in an anticipated \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1bn in extra revenues which would grow GDP by about one percent, he said. Last year sector revenues had declined despite the evident rise in arrivals with visitors spending much less per capita. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This will be another record year but, more importantly, it will be a year when real growth will start and tourism will be the main reason,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Andreadis added insisting that what Greece most needed was a ten-year growth plan and a roadmap to implement it. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The memoranda,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said referring to the terms and conditions attached to the three bailouts Athens has received since 2010, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153will not lead us out of crisis. What we need is vision and a roadmap to implement it.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Gold is set for its biggest weekly fall for nearly four months on the growing prospect of a US rate rise in March. The precious metal is priced in dollars and so is sensitive to increases in the US currency. It is currently down $5 an ounce at $1,229. But oil has edged higher, recovering a little from recent falls on concerns about whether Russia would cut production in line with a recent deal among producers. Brent crude is up 0.47% at $55.34 a barrel. Fawad Razaqzada, technical analyst at Forex.com, said: Both oil contracts have bounced back a little after Thursday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sharp plunge. The all-time high crude stockpile levels in the US is the number one reason behind oil\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s inability to move further higher in recent weeks. With net long positions on both contracts being at record high levels, it could be that money managers and other large speculators are beginning to unwind those positions, providing additional pressure on prices. The latest positioning data from the CFTC tonight and ICE on Monday may reflect this view point. Also, the fact that there were no further cuts in Russian oil production in February means it will take a little bit longer for the global oversupply to drain. Essentially though, the long-term bearish trend has ended and I still think prices will break further higher later on this year as evidence of a tighter oil market emerges. Weakness in the pound after the dip in UK service sector growth has done little to prop up the FTSE 100. Normally a dip in sterling would boost the leading index due to its preponderance of overseas earners, but it is currently down 0.22% at 7366. The pound is 0.34% lower at $1.2224 against the dollar - having earlier dropped to $1.2215 - and down 0.67% against the euro at \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.1594. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said: Part of the reason sterling\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s slide against the euro was so aggressive was that the Eurozone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s own services PMI hit a near 6 year peak of 55.5 (a smidge lower than what was forecast). This prevented the DAX from getting out of the red, the German index shedding 30 points; the CAC, however, managed to rise 0.5% thanks to the most recent French election polls placing Emmanuel Macron ahead of Marine Le Pen in the first round of voting. After Snap\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s jet-fuelled stock market debut on Thursday - a 44% surge which values the Snapchat owner at $28bn - the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shares are being indicated higher again. The future market is currently showing a 1.3% rise to $24.80, but now the company is listed it has to prove itself, say analysts. Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at IG, said: Snap duly delivered on the hype that surrounded its IPO, with a 44% gain in the share price on day one echoing the heady days of the dot-com bubble. The underwriters and company management will be pleased to see the stock in such high demand, but the easy work is now behind it. Snap is now just another company on the New York stock exchange, and will be judged by the same metrics as others of its ilk. It has to show real user growth from this point onwards, and a firm strategy for making money off those users. And Garry White, chief investment commentator at Charles Stanley, warned: For a company that is losing almost half a billion dollars a year, may never be profitable and faces aggressive competition from larger peers, this valuation seems stratospheric. The reason is the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s popularity with teenagers and millennials, who are prized targets for advertisers. However, this industry remains extremely fickle (remember MySpace and Friends Reunited?) and many investors piling in not wishing to miss \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the next big thing\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd are unlikely to have used the app themselves. Investors tend not to be teenagers. Warren Buffett says he will never invest in a business he doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t understand, this may be advice well worth heeding for those tempted to take a nibble of Snap. Over in Greece, the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s prime minister tweets: The UK is entering stagflation - high inflation and stagnant growth - warns Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics. He said: The decline in the services PMI to a five-month low in February is the clearest sign yet that the U.K. now is enduring stagflation. The business activity index is consistent with quarter-on-quarter growth in output in the non-distribution private services sector slowing to around 0.2% in the first quarter from 0.7% in the fourth quarter. Granted, the PMI often is influenced excessively by sentiment and it was far too downbeat immediately after the referendum. But the recent rally in equity prices should have boosted corporate confidence. In addition, the services PMI was too downbeat last year because it excludes the retail sector, which benefited from a surge in consumer spending. Evidence on retail spending so far this year has been disappointingly weak. The services sector looks vulnerable to slowing sharply over the coming months now that businesses are rising prices rapidly. Indeed, the output prices balance rose to 54.1 in February\u00e2\u20ac\u201dits highest level since September 2008\u00e2\u20ac\u201dfrom 53.7 in January. In the past, the business activity index has tended to weaken over the following six months whenever the output prices index has exceeded 52. Accordingly, we continue to expect quarter-on-quarter GDP growth to average just 0.2% this year, ensuring that the MPC holds back from raising interest rates despite high inflation. Back with the UK, and the PMI data confirms the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy is likely to see slower growth this year, according to Daniel Vernazza, lead UK economist at UniCredit Research. He said: The bigger than expected fall in the services PMI adds to the mounting evidence in recent weeks that the UK economy is slowing. It fits with the recent fall in retail sales amid a squeeze in real household income growth. We continue to expect growth to slow this year and for the UK economy to decouple from firming global economic activity... The weaker headline figure, which refers to output/business activity, was also reflected in the detail of the report. The new orders balance fell 1.3pts. to 54.7, and both backlogs-of-work and future business expectations edged down. Set against this, the employment balance rose. There are two salient explanations for the recent softness. First, the squeeze in real household income growth (resulting from higher imported inflation) is weighing on demand, particularly for retail services... Second, Brexit-related economic uncertainty remains high and this will increasingly weigh on business investment as the date when the UK formally leaves the EU (spring 2019) approaches. The composite PMI... fell to 53.6 in February, down from an average of 55.4 in the final quarter of last year. The sectorial breakdown clearly reveals that the weakness in the UK economy is domestic, with the export-oriented manufacturing sector performing relatively well and supported by the past depreciation of sterling and firming global economic activity (particularly in Europe). Based on the historical relationship between the composite PMI and real GDP growth, the PMIs in February would be consistent with a quarterly real GDP growth rate of around 0.3%-0.4% quarter on quarter. We keep our forecast for first quarter 2017 real GDP growth of 0.3% quarter on quarter. Despite weak eurozone retail sales figures, shopkeepers remain optimistic about the outlook, says economist Bert Colijn at ING Bank: Not all that glitters is gold as strong Eurozone economic surveys mask weak performance in retail at the start of the year. The outlook for domestic demand does remain positive though, even under higher inflation rates. While surveys about the Eurozone economy in 2017 have been very upbeat so far, retail sales disappointed in January. The 0.1% month on month decline is the third in a row, while year on year growth is just 1.2%. This suggests that recent Eurozone optimism is not translating into more shopping at the moment. One factor probably influencing this is the rebound of inflation in recent months, bringing price growth back to 2% in the Eurozone. Nominal wage growth has been below 2% since 2013, indicating that real wages are suffering from the recent rebound in prices. Retailers confirmed the current weakness in demand in the Economic Sentiment Indicator as the February survey showed a strong decline in the assessment of the present business situation. Even though recent months have disappointed, retailers do remain optimistic about business in the months ahead. This probably makes sense, given the strength in the job market and relative optimism among consumers. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s composite PMI numbers confirm that strength in the economy. Still though, this could be a sign for Eurozone growth that domestic demand could be impacted by declining real wages, although we expect consumer spending to remain robust in the first quarter. The eurozone may be starting to fire on all cylinders according to the PMIs, but the region\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shopkeepers may not agree. Eurozone retail sales fell by 0.1% month on month in January, the third fall in a row and contradicting expectations of a 0.4% increase. The year on year figure was a rise of 1.2% but this was lower than the forecast 1.6% increase. The December figure was revised down from a 0.3% fall to one of 0.5% despite the supposed boost from Christmas shoppers. Ben Brettell, senior economist at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: The pace of growth in the UK services sector, which accounts for more than three-quarters of GDP, slipped slightly in February according to survey data released today... 2017 looks set to be a relatively challenging year for the economy, with higher inflation and weaker pay growth likely to squeeze household budgets. This means consumer spending could slow in real terms. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s figure, along with the equivalent readings for the manufacturing and construction sectors, point to 0.4% GDP growth in the first quarter. Overall, however, the economic picture remains more positive than many expected after last year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s vote to leave the EU. A PMI reading above 50 shows the sector is still expanding, albeit at its slowest pace since September. The survey showed that business confidence remained strong, and sentiment about the rest of the year was largely positive. Nevertheless, with uncertainty still rife over how and when the UK will actually leave the EU, and survey data pointing to a modest slowing of activity, the Bank of England looks most unlikely to consider raising interest rates in the near to medium term. The pound slipped back to a day\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s low of $1.2227 against the dollar immediately after the PMI figures, with analysts suggesting the weakness in the economy was more likely to lead to lower interest rates for longer. This is a seven week low against the US currency, while the pound has also fallen against the euro, down 0.5% to \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.1617. Chris Williamson, chief business economist of survey compiler Markit, said: Weaker consumer spending was a key cause of slower service sector growth, suggesting that household budgets are starting to crack under the strain of higher prices and weak wage growth. The ongoing steep upturn in costs suggest that consumer price inflation has significantly further to rise, adding to our belief that inflation will breach 3% over the course of the next year. Despite this, Williamson said the PMI data was more consistent with further easing by the Bank of England. He said: The slowdown in the pace of economic growth signalled by the February surveys pushes the PMI back towards territory more indicative of additional policy stimulus from the Bank of England than a tightening. The UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s service sector grew more slowly than expected in February, mainly due to a slowdown in consumer spending. The Markit/CIPS services purchasing managers index fell from 54.5 in January to 53.3, its weakest performance since last September and lower than the 54.2 figure expected by economists. Markit said the figures - along with the earlier manufacturing and construction data - suggested first quarter growth of below 0.4% compared with 0.7% in the final three months of 2016. The data comes ahead of this month\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Budget and ahead of the government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s plan to trigger Article 50 and begin the process of leaving the European Union. The positive figures from the eurozone may not last, according to Howard Archer, chief european and UK economist at IHS Markit. He said: The final purchasing managers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 survey confirmed Eurozone services activity really stepped up a gear in February to be at a 69-month high. Significantly and encouragingly, It was not only business activity that saw a long-term high, but also incoming new business, outstanding business and business expectations. Employment growth also accelerated. Furthermore, with Eurozone manufacturing expansion picking up modestly further to a 70-month high, Markit report that overall Eurozone manufacturing and services output in February was at the best level since April 2011. The markedly overall improved February purchasing managers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 surveys indicate that the Eurozone economy is seeing a robust first quarter of 2017 after solid if unspectacular growth in the second half of 2016. However, we suspect the Eurozone may find it difficult to kick on amid appreciable political uncertainties during 2017 and likely reduced consumer purchasing power due to higher inflation and limited wage growth in most countries. A dip in Eurozone consumer confidence in February fuels this suspicion. Consequently, we suspect that Eurozone GDP growth will be 1.6%. The positive mood continues with news that eurozone businesses grew at their fastest rate since April 2011. The Markit composite index - manufacturing and services - rose to 56 in February from 54.4 the previous month. The service sector index itself climbed from 53.7 in January to 55.5. Markit chief business economist Chris Williamson said: The final PMI numbers paint a bright picture of a eurozone economy starting to fire on all cylinders. Growth accelerated in all of the four largest member states in February to suggest an increasingly sustainable and robust-looking upturn. The broad-based improvement has pushed the eurozone PMI into territory consistent with 0.6% GDP growth in the first quarter. The labour market is also starting to boom, with jobs being created at the fastest rate for nearly a decade. The strength of the eurozone economy could give the European Central Bank pause for thought in its current quantitive easing and low interest rate programmes: Any change to the ECB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s policy would go down well in Germany, which has been upset by the negative effect of low interest rates on the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s savers. And making a hat-trick of positive performances, Germany service sector has also improved in February after hitting a four month low at the start of the year. Markit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s services PMI for the country rose from 53.4 in January to 54.4, while the composite index climbed from 54.8 to a 34 month high of 56.1 in February. Markit economist Trevor Balchin said: The latest PMI data add to our expectations that economic growth will strengthen in the first quarter to at least 0.6% quarter on quarter, marking a strong start to 2017. The French service sector also put in a strong performance last month, with its fastest pace of expansion since May 2011. IHS Markit said its services PMI index came in at 56.4 in February, up from 54.1 the previous month but slightly lower than the initial estimate of 56.7. The composite index of services and manufacturing rose to 55.9 from 54.1. The sector was boosted by a recovery in the hotel and restaurant business which had previously suffered after a fall in tourism. And strongly out of the traps is Italy, which has just reported its strongest service sector growth since December 2015. The Markit business activity index for services companies jumped from 52.4 in January to 54.1 last month, well above the 53.1 expected by analysts. This follows a positive performance in the manufacturing survey released on Wednesday, helping lift the composite index for both sectors from 52.8 to 54.8. The figures make good reading for prime minister Paolo Gentiloni, who has been in the post for almost three months. WPP is the biggest faller in the FTSE 100, down nearly 6% after it lowered its growth forecast for the year. WPP\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Sir Martin Sorrell also had things to say about corporate governance: WPP\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Sir Martin Sorrell has said that companies with dominant shareholders or owners such as Rupert Murdoch\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Fox, Facebook and Snap that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153offend\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd good corporate governance practices take more risks and tend to perform better financially. Sorrell was speaking the day after Snapchat parent Snap floated on Wall Street, with the offering oversubscribed and the share price rising more than 44% to $24 on its first day of trading, despite co-founders Evan Spiegel and Bobby Murphy and early investors keeping total control of voting rights. He said that WPP has found over a decade of measuring brand valuations that when markets hit tough patches it is companies with dominant shareholders or owners that tend to continue to invest perform best. The full story is here: The dip in markets so far could be reversed if the service sector figures look reasonable, suggests Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex. He said: After effectively sitting out Thursday, the European markets decided to give back some of the week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rapid growth this morning. Shedding 25 points after the bell, the FTSE started Friday holding above 7350. A smattering of red in its mining sector, and perhaps just a bit of doubt about just how high the index currently sits, seemed responsible for the FTSE\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fall. The pound saw similar losses, slipping to a fresh 6 week nadir against the dollar while handing 0.2% in value back to the euro. Sentiment could shift, however, dependant on the state of the latest services PMI. Analysts are expecting the figure to dip from 54.5 to 54.2 month-on-month, though this week those estimates haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t been very accurate, with the manufacturing and construction PMIs under- and out-performing forecasts respectively. If the services reading can avoid a February dip then the pound may be lifted away from its current lows; if not than sterling\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decline may well intensify. Like in the UK, the Eurozone indices looked a bit weary this morning. The DAX slid 0.4% thanks to a sharp drop in German retail sales, though the index managed to cling on above 12000, while the CAC fell back towards 4950 with a 0.1% decline. The region\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s services data is expectedly to be relatively strong, with the Eurozone-wide figure set to be confirmed at 55.6 for February compared to 53.7 in January, hitting a 6-ish year high in the process. As forecast, investors are pausing for breath again after the recent record breaking run in shares. The FTSE 100 has fallen 0.27|% to 7362, Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax has dropped 0.5%, France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac is 0.3% lower and Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB is down 0.41%, while Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ibex has lost 0.5%. And Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Stoxx 600 has opened 0.3% lower. The London Stock Exchange, currently in the throes of a merger with Deutsche B\u00c3\u00b6rse, has reported a 21% rise in pretax profit to \u00c2\u00a3623m, in line with expectations. The dividend is higher than expected at 43.2p a share rather than 38p, which the LSE says reflects a strong outlook. Earlier in the week, the LSE suggested that a last minute demand from Brussels to sell its 60% share in Italian business MTS could scupper the \u00c2\u00a324bn deal. But there was no mention of this in today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s statement. Numis analyst Jonathan Goslin said: There is little new revealed in the outlook statement. The company still claims: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The Group continues to work hard on its proposed merger with Deutsche Bo\u00cc\u02c6rse AG - awaiting outcome of the European Commission Phase II process on or before 3 April 2017\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. We continue to favour [the LSE\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s] strong market position, favourable growth drivers and diversified revenue base. However, the shares are up with events in our view, especially given the downside risks should a deal with Deutsche B\u00c3\u00b6rse not eventually be completed. Ahead of the splurge of service sector data, we have already had some disappointing German retail sales figures. They fell 0.8% month on month in January, compared to expectations of a 0.2% rise and an unchanged figure the previous month. But the year on year figure showed a 2.3% increase compared to a 0.4% rise in December. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a bit like Groundhog Day. On Tuesday there was a whole host of manufacturing data from around the globe - mostly showing a positive trend - and now we get the same thing but for the service sector. Things have kicked off with a slightly disappointing figure from China. The Caixin services PMI index slipped from 53.1 in January to 52.6 last month, down from 18 month highs. Elsewhere, after some weakness in February\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s UK manufacturing figure and a pick up in the construction sector, the services index is expected to show a dip, from 54.5 in January to 54.2 as rising prices put a brake on consumer demand. As for Europe, Michael Hewson at CMC Markets sums up expectations: In Europe... the latest Spain, Italy, France and Germany services numbers [are all] expected to show significant improvements on their January numbers, with increases to 55.1, 53.1, 56.7 and 54.4 respectively. In the US, there is expected to be a strong performance from the service sector, which is likely to add fuel to the growing belief that the Federal Reserve could raise interest rates as soon as this month\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meeting. Hewson again: The US remains the key driver of markets right now and the sudden hawkish stance of a number of previously dovish Fed officials has caught investors somewhat off guard in the past week or so, and pushing the prospect that we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll see another interest rate rise into a realistic prospect. In fact such has been the turnaround in expectations, that a rate move looks more or less a done deal. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s US ISM services numbers for February are expected to underscore this increased optimism with an expectation that we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll see a robust 56.5, however the acid test will be later today when a week of Fed speakers concludes with four more FOMC voting members speaking about the US economy. That expectation has been pushing the dollar higher again, and as a consequence putting pressure on the pound. As it happens, sterling is currently flat against the dollar at $1.2265 but has edged 0.15% lower against the euro to \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.1653. Meawhile after Thursday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fall on Wall Street following its record breaking run and overnight dips in Asia, European markets are expected to open lower: On the corporate front there are results out from advertising giant WPP and the London Stock Exchange.",

On that note, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t time to close for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and come back tomorrow for our coverage of the UK budget. Snap, the parent of Snapchat, made an explosive debut on the New York Stock Exchange last week. Shares in the business soared 44% from their initial $17 on Thursday, the first day of dealing, and added another 10% a day later in heavy trading. But since then the shares have dropped, falling 12% on Monday and another 11% so far on Tuesday to around $21. Most analysts have been negative on the stock with four out of six analysts recommending selling the shares, and the other two having a neutral rating. Joshua Mahony, market analyst at IG, said: Although [Snap] remains well above the $17 IPO price, momentum has turned ugly. The question is whether this is early investors locking in profits, or whether this heralds a move to a more realistic valuation for this hyped, but risky, early-stage stock. Back with the appointment of Charlotte Hogg as deputy governor of the Bank of England after it emerged she had not told the bank her brother worked at Barclays, prompting a potential conflict of interest. After a critical Treasury committee hearing earlier, the chair of the committee Andrew Tyrie has issued a statement: The Committee now needs to digest the evidence it has heard today, some of which has been a surprise to a number of us. It will offer a view after a period of reflection. The committee said it would return to the matter after Wednesday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s budget. One Labour MP, John Mann, has already called for Hogg to resign over the issue. Given the tensions over the US trade deficit with Germany, this could be interesting: Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s talk of cracking down on drug pricing has also unsettled European pharmaceutical companies. Novartis is down 1.7%, Roche has fallen 1.23%, Shire has lost 2.2%, while AstraZeneca and GlaxoSmithKline are both almost 1% lower. President Trump has been at it again. A tweet suggesting plans to cut drug prices has hit pharmaceutical shares and helped push Wall Street lower at the open: So the Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 33 points or 0.16% while the S&amp;P 500 opened 0.17% lower and the Nasdaq Composite off 0.21%. Pfizer is down 1.3% while Merck is 1.5% lower. Will any European countries end up leaving the eurozone? Apart from Greece, the chances are low, according to Moody\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s, but could get higher. In a new report, it said: The likelihood of a country other than Greece leaving the European Union\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s single currency area remains very low, but has the potential to increase materially this year given the rise of anti-EU political parties in the region. While it is unlikely that any of these parties will gain sufficient electoral support to seek a mandate for exit from the euro area in the near future, they can still influence political agendas, potentially weakening support for euro area membership... \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Aside from Greece, Moody\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s believes that the likelihood of a country leaving the euro area remains very low,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Colin Ellis, Moody\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Chief Credit Officer for EMEA and the report\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s co-author. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153However, this probability could increase over coming months, depending on the results of upcoming elections.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Any exit from the European single currency would be an existential moment for the euro area: it would demonstrate conclusively that the currency union was not indivisible. A country leaving the euro area and redenominating its currency would not necessarily automatically result in a default, however. In that situation, Moody\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s would in particular focus on any change in the financial value of debt obligations relative to the original contractual promise. Over to the US and - in news which will not please Donald Trump - the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade deficit in January widened to its highest level since March 2012. With rising oil prices pushing up the cost of imported fuel, the trade gap increased 9.6% to $48.5bn compared to the December figure of $44.3bn, according to the Commerce Department. Trump sees trade as one of the key areas to tackle, and has already said he will pull out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership and renegotiated the North American Free Trade Agreement. Exports to the European Union fell 7.3%, and Trump advisors have already hit out at Germany for benefiting from a weak euro. The trade deficit with the United Kingdom rose from $457m to $609m. Meanwhile the deficit with China, another contentious area for Trump, rose by 12.8% to $31.1bn in January. But the trade deficit with Mexico - where Trump has continued to push plans for a border wall - fell 10.1% to its lowest level since July 2015. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our news story about Charlotte Hogg\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s non-disclosure, which sparked such a rumpus at the Treasury committee today: Newsflash: John Mann MP has declare that Charlotte Hogg\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s position as deputy governor is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153now untenable\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, following her admission that she didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t declare that her brother hold a senior role in Barclays\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 strategy team. In a statement just released, Mann MP argues that Hogg has failed to meet the principles of public life, known as the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Nolan principles\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd (a point he made during today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hearing). Mann says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It is simply incredible that such a senior person at the Bank of England has behaved in such in this manner. Last week Charlotte Hogg proudly told this committee that she actually wrote the bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s code of conduct which she has now admitted to repeatedly breaking it.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Not only has she compromised her current position and the Bank of England itself but more importantly she has failed under the key principles of the Nolan standards in public life and she has no excuse for doing so.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This is simply a question about standards in public life and in this regard she has failed and must resign.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd You can watch the entire Treasury Committee hearing about Charlotte Hogg\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s non-declaration here. Andrew Tyrie wraps up the hearing by saying that we are \u00e2\u20ac\u0153looking at a mistake, a series of mistakes\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. We need to examine if the response from the bank has been proportionate. There are three issues to discuss, Tyrie argues: Whether, and to what extent, we can ensure this doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t become a case of \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcdo what I say, not what I do\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 for a very serious member of the Bank Need to protect the reputation of the Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Prudential Regulation Committee, which oversees UK banks What it says about the role of the Court in the Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s governance. Tyrie concludes by telling Anthony Habgood and Bradley Fried that this morning\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s news about Charlotte Hogg has been a surprise to a number of committee members, including himself, and they must \u00e2\u20ac\u0153think very carefully\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd about it. Charlotte Hogg has also officially recorded her family links to the Hoare family -- who created Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s oldest private bank, Habgood says. Q: Have any other senior Bank of England staff updated their declarations under the code of conduct since Charlotte Hogg\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s omission came to light? Anthony Habgood says that several people have, yes, including one who has added that his daughter is a political journalist. Deputy court chairman Bradley Fried now hits back at the suggestion that Charlotte Hogg\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s conduct has fallen below acceptable standards. Despite this lack of disclosure over her brother, I believe she is a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153superb public servant\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd says Fried. His personal view is that Hogg does meet standards of the best of public life laid out in the code. We are living with the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153disappointment and aggravation\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd of her non-disclosure right now, Fried adds. And he suggests this affair will be a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153watershed moment\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in Hogg\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s career, and also in the way that senior Bank executives report any potential conflicts of interest. Scottish Nationalist Party MP George Kerevan reads out the Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s code of conduct. Q: The code of conduct on interests says that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153living within our code is not simply about observing the letter of the policies referred to. We aspire to set an example of the best in public service.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd By that test, has Ms Hogg failed it? BoE Court chairman Anthony Habgood replies that She has omitted something that she should not have omitted, that is important, so she has not lived up to that code. Q: So do you stand by the code? Absolutely we stand by the code, Habgood adds. Q: What effect will her non-compliance have on the rest of the bank staff, and the way they see the code? We will push the code harder, Habgood says, but it is hard as it relies on self-assessment. For example, someone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s second son might move from a non-regulated City firm to a regulated one - so they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d need to update their records. We have moved a long way from a few years ago, when the Bank didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t really have a code of conduct, Habgood adds (somewhat alarmingly!) Tory MP Kit Malthouse is concerned that the Bank of England doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know exactly what Quintin Hogg does at Barclays. He could even be targeted with handling Barclay\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s strategy towards the Bank of England, Malthouse suggests. We could find out, Habgood concedes. But even if that were the case, he thinks it wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have affected Charlotte Hogg\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s suitability to be deputy governor. Now the committee ask about social ties between the top brass at the Bank of England. Court chairman Anthony Habgood insists that he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s had no social interaction with Charlotte Hogg -- beyond one trip to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153something to do with ballet for youthful people\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know her until just before I came to the bank. But Habgood then reveals other ties to the Hogg dynasty. I know her mother better than I know her because she\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been chairman of various things when I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve been chairman of various things. Charlotte Hogg\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s mother is Sarah Hogg, the first woman to chair a FTSE 100 company (3i, back in 2002). She\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s married to Douglas Martin Hogg, son of the late Lord Hailsham, and a former Tory MP (until his expenses claim for moat-cleaning came to light...) Fried adds: Anthony [Habgood]and I are fans of Charlotte. We think she\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a distinctive professional. Conservative MP Kit Malthouse wants to know what the Court of the Bank of England (the board of the central bank) is going to do about Hogg\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s breach of the code. Deputy chairman Bradley Fried says the situation will be discussed. Clearly we have an issue now around optics. We hope that it can be resolved. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not an issue how we feel individually. We will discuss it in full Court. Chairman Anthony Habgood then weighs in, saying they don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t expect to recommend reversing Hogg\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s appointment as deputy governor of the BoE. Why not, asks Tyrie? Because the process of having Hogg\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s line manager (Mark Carney), and the head of HR looking into the issue has been concluded, Habgood explains. Earlier in this hearing, deputy court chairman Bradley Fried said Hogg had committed an \u00e2\u20ac\u0153unwillful act of omission.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Bloomberg has the details: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I definitely don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t believe it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a hanging offence,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Fried told Parliament Tuesday. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s terribly unfortunate. It warrants grumpiness.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Anthony Habgood says he has discussed the situation with governor Mark Carney -- apparently it was a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153revelation\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to Carney that Charlotte Hogg hadn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t declared her brother\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s role at Barclays. Committee chairman Andrew Tyrie wants more answers from BoE chairman Anthony Habgood. Q: How many breaches of the Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s code of conduct are there? Habgood doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know. I think it might be helpful to know, Tyrie points out. Q: What are the sanctions for failing to make a voluntary declaration? It depends on the seriousness of it, Habgood says. In most cases, he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d expect that the line manager and the HR department would speak to the individual and take a view. Q: So why didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t Charlotte Hogg declare her brother\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s role as a Barclays strategy director when she was hired as chief operating officer in 2013? Habgood insists that it wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153wilful\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd decision. He suggests that Hogg didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t feel that her brother was in a position where it mattered - which was a mistake as she she shouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t take that decision. It was also an issue of priorities but it should have been high up her list of priorities as Charlotte Hogg helped develop the codes, Habgood points out... Labour MP John Mann is now laying into the Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s top brass -- comparing Charlotte Hogg\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s conduct to MPs who were jailed in the expenses scandal. The standards of public life are about ethics and public responsibility, Mann insists. He demands to know who is going to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153sanction\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Hogg for not declaring her brother\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s role at Barclays back in 2013. Mann tells BoE Court chairman Anthony Habgood that: She\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s broken the standards in public life....and you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve done nothing about it.... You must see that the independence of the Court is being brought into question. Habgood says any sanction is the responsibility of her line manager, governor Mark Carney. And he points out that Hogg did declare her brother\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s role to the committee in her written submission last month (it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s online here). The problem, though, is that she didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t declare it back in 2013 when she joined the Bank. Habgood says: The standard is broken, that is correct. But he argues that this isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcblack and white\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 issue -- the Court must consider a range of factors (Hogg is highly regarded at the BoE). And there is definitely no personal gain here, Habgood insists. The Treasury Committee are laying into the Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s top brass over Charlotte Hogg\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s failure to declare that her brother works for Barclays. Jacob Rees-Mogg (who knows a thing or two about high society), is challenging the idea that there hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t been a conflict of interest, actual or potential. There aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t a lot of people in the City called Quintin Hogg, points out Rees-Mogg. He adds: What\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s worrying me is that the bank and the Court is pretty complacent about this. It can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have been wrong because we wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have behaved like that. We won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t investigate it - we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll just say there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no conflict because the brother\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s probably like us, he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s another good chap. Rees-Mogg is also unimpressed that Anthony Habgood doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t seem to actually know what Hogg. Q does at Barclays. Deputy chairman Bradley Fried hits back at the suggestion that the Bank is a cushy institution where family background counts for a lot. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153deeply forensic, fact-based institution\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he insists. Now this is awkward.... Charlotte Hogg, the newly appointed deputy governor of the Bank of England, has admitted that she failed to disclose that her brother works for Barclays Bank. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a clear, and highly embarrassing, breach of the BoE\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s code of conduct. Last month, Hogg told MPs Treasury Committee that she had reported her brother\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s role as a strategy director at Barclays to the Bank, when she joined as its chief operating officer in 2013. But now, in a letter to the Treasury Committee released this morning, Hogg admits that she didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the key section: During my appointment hearing on 28 February 2017,1 was asked by you and other members of the Committee about my brother\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s role as Director, Group Strategy at Barclays Bank pic. Following my hearing, I checked the Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s records of the interests and relationships that I had declared prior to joining the Bank in July 2013 and subsequently. I had not formally declared my brother\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s role at Barclays Bank pic to the Bank. The first time that I formally outlined my brother\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s role was when I noted it in the questionnaire which I submitted to the Committee in advance of my recent hearing. As Barclays Bank pic is regulated by the PRA, under the Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s internal code of conduct and personal relationships policy, I should have formally declared my brother\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s role when I first joined the Bank. I did not do so and I take full responsibility for this oversight. I have now added a full record of my brother\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s role in the Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s HR systems. Regrettably, my oversight means that my oral evidence to the Committee in this respect was not accurate. I write now to correct that evidence at the earliest opportunity and to place on record my sincere apologies to the Committee. Hogg adds that the Secretary of the Bank and the Chaiman of the Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Court of Directors, Anthony Habgood, agree that there has not been any actual or potential conflict of interest. But Andrew Tyrie, the chair of the Treasury committee, isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t impressed at all. He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s quizzing Habgood about the issue now in parliament. Tyrie argues that this relationship becomes a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153much more serious issue\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd now that Hogg has been promoted to deputy governor. And doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t this breach show how seriously the Bank does (or doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t) take its approach to compliance? Habgood agrees that this is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a very serious breach\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd of the Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s compliance code.... Economics blogger Tim Worstall has a good take on the German factory orders decline, on Forbes. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a flavour: Reading too much into just the one month\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s numbers is not a sensible thing to be doing so the answer to that headline question, as Betteridge\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Law says it should be, is probably no. However, when matters do turn against the German economy this is the sort of thing that we would expect to see. We all know, or at least we all should know, that the German economy is rather different from those of other advanced countries. It has about double the manufacturing of those others and that manufacturing is rather more concentrated into durable goods than most others. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s thus vulnerable to a slow down in investment in other economies... More here: It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a bad morning for hundreds of workers at Budgens stores across the country. Some 34 Budgens stores are closing after administrators failed to find a buyer for their owner, Food Retailer Operations Limited (FROL). These stores employ around 815 workers. However (and contrary to some reports), this doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t mean that the entire Budgens chain is toast. Instead, around 150 other outlets are still in business. Charles Wilson, chief executive of Booker, told my colleague Julia Kollewe that: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The business is performing very strongly.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Budgens stores are usually run by independent retailers, while the brand is owned by Bookers -- which is being taken over by Tesco. Breaking: The OECD thinktank has just become the latest organisation to admit that it overestimated the impact of the Brexit vote on the UK economy. The Paris-based group now expects Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s GDP to rise by 1.6% this year, up from 1.2% previously. My colleague Katie Allen says it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a boost to chancellor Philip Hammond ahead of tomorrow\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s budget. The new forecasts envisage the UK economy performing in line with the eurozone economy, where GDP is also expected to expand by 1.6% in 2017. The US economy, helped in part by an expected rise in spending under Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s administration, is forecast to grow 2.4% this year. The OECD still has concerns about the UK economy, and is warning that inflation will hurt growth. More here: The news that UK house price growth has hit its lowest level since July 2013 has disappointed some economists. Howard Archer of IHS Global Insight predicts that the market will be muted in 2017: February\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s slight rise in house prices reported by the Halifax fuels our belief that house price gains over 2017 will be no more than 3% and could well be less. Weakening consumer fundamentals, likely mounting caution over making major spending decisions, and elevated house price to earnings ratios are likely to weigh down on house prices. However, a shortage of supply is likely to put a hard floor under prices. Jonathan Hopper, managing director of Garrington Property Finders, says potential buyers are being cautious: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Halifax\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s latest data reflects the cautious nature of the market; with value sensitive buyers remaining committed to their moving plans, but only at the right price. Hannah Maundrell, Editor in Chief of money.co.uk, doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t believe we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re heading for a crash: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s too soon to make a call on whether the property market is cooling off. While it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s possible this is a sign of things to come demand is still so high and supply so lacking so I can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t see a dramatic slump on the horizon quite yet. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Affordability is a major issue and if rising inflation means households are strapped for cash getting onto or moving up the ladder will be more difficult and that will impact prices. The changes to tax on rental properties have also meant more would-be landlords are holding back from buying too which has an effect. Rob Weaver, Director of Investments at property crowdfunding platform Property Partner, thinks the lack of housing supply will keep propping prices up. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Despite continuing uncertainty, a buoyant jobs market, record low interest rates and the imbalance between high demand for homes and a severe shortage in supply continue to put upward pressure on prices. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s house market appears to be weakening, with prices growing at their weakest rate in over three years. Prices rose by an annual rate of 5.1% in the three months to February, according to the Halifax building society. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s down from 5.7% the previous month, and the weakest rate since July 2013. In February alone, prices inched up by 0.1% - weaker than the 0.4% expected by City economists. Halifax\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Martin Ellis predicts that price growth will keep falling, bringing it closer to wage growth. Ellis says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153A sustained period of house price growth in excess of pay rises has made it increasingly difficult for many to purchase a home. This development, together with signs of reduced momentum in the jobs market and squeezed consumer spending power, is expected to curb house price growth during 2017.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd These factory orders numbers are rather weaker than other German data, points out Bloomberg: Ifo\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s business climate index improved in February amid strong activity in manufacturing and services, and unemployment continued to decline. And last week, we got very decent PMI figures suggesting that German factories were \u00e2\u20ac\u02dchumming\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 in March.. Even if you strip out orders for expensive transport equipment, German factories had a bad January: Financial analysts are concerned by the scale of the drop in German factory orders at the start of 2017. Carsten Brzeski at ING says the 7.4% slide is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153almost unprecedented\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s disappointing data is also a good reminder that the German industry is having more problems returning to full speed than buoyant sentiment indicators have been suggesting\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Fred Ducrozet of Swiss bank Pictet points out that demand for large machinery and expensive equipment (known as capital goods) fell particularly rapidly Claus Vistesen of Pantheon says the figures are \u00e2\u20ac\u02dchorrible\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, but doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to read too much into a single month\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s data. Andreas Wallstr\u00c3\u00b6m of Nordea Markets provides more context: Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s manufacturing sector has suffered a surprisingly sharp fall in orders, raising concerns that its economy may not be as robust as thought. Orders for German factory goods plunged by 7.4% in January, compared to December. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s much worse than the 2.5% drop which analysts expected. The dropoff appears to have been driven by a decline in orders within Germany itself. This domestic demand fell by 10.5%. Foreign orders slid by 4.9% -- including a 7.8% fall in demand from the euro zone. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not a great signal for the euro area, which had shown signs of more robust growth recently. We shouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t read TOO much into one month\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s data -- especially as the German factory orders report is notoriously volatile... Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s finance ministry is urging calm, saying: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The weak start to the year should be manageable. Business confidence in manufacturing is significantly brighter than the long-term average, so that a revival in manufacturing can still be expected.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll pull together more reaction now.... Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Consumer spending has been propping the UK economy up since last summer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s EU referendum. But there are now signs that the retail sector is feeling a chill. A new survey this morning shows that retail sales slid by 0.2% in the three months to February, compared with a year earlier. Non-food sales are dropping for the first time in five years, suggesting consumers are tightening their belts as the economy slows. Helen Dickinson of the British Retail Consortium, which compiled the report, warns: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Tougher times are expected ahead. The impact of inflation on consumer spending will add further intensity to an already fiercely competitive environment in which the ability to adapt and innovate will be key to survival.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Faced with slowing sales, retailers are now pleading with the government to rethink its business rates changes - perhaps as soon as in tomorrow\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Budget? Also coming up today..... We get a new healthcheck on the global economy at 10am GMT, with the latest forecasts from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). The car industry has flocked to Geneva for the annual Motor Show, where they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be showing off new models and concept cars. Closer to home, Vauxhall car workers will be thinking about the future after being sold by General Motors yesterday. PSA Group, their new owners, has promised that job cuts aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t inevitable. But although Vauxhall\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s two UK plants are relatively efficient, they could still lose out. My colleague Graham Ruddick explains: Vauxhall\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s factories in Ellesmere Port and Luton will have to battle with Peugeot, Citro\u00c3\u00abn, and Opel plants across Europe to win the right to produce vehicles beyond 2021. The future of Vauxhall\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sites is secure until then because PSA Group, which has bought Vauxhall and Opel from General Motors, has pledged to recognise existing production commitments. Ellesmere Port is scheduled to produce the Astra until 2021 while Luton will make the Vivaro van until 2025. However, PSA will have to make a decision on where to produce the next-generation Astra from 2021 as early as next year, and Ellesmere Port faces a significant challenge to win the work and secure its survival.... More here: European stock markets are expected to rally a little, pushing the FTSE 100 back towards last week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s record highs. On the corporate news front, bookmaker Paddy Power, online food delivery form Just Eat and insurance firm Direct Line are reporting results. And Halifax are scheduled to release their latest UK house price figures, at 8.30am GMT. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be tracking all the main events through the day...",

In November, a promotion ran on johnlewis.com advertising the Apple Watch at \u00c2\u00a3249 as part of its promise to match competitors\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 prices. The company, which has used the strapline \u00e2\u20ac\u0153never knowingly undersold\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd since 1925, ran the Apple Watch promotion at the same time as pushing a four-day Black Friday sales event promising that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve lowered hundreds of prices this weekend\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. The Advertising Standards Authority received a complaint from a shopper, who found that the Apple Watch was listed as out of stock when she tried to buy it but that it was made available the following day at full price. John Lewis said the Apple Watch deal had proved so popular that a decision was made to pull it from the price match sale over concerns they would not have enough stock to fulfil all orders. The company said it had boosted the Apple Watch back to full price the next day because the competitor had stopped running its promotion, and listed it as out of stock online until after the separate four-day Black Friday sale ended. John Lewis admitted that it might have stopped selling the discounted Apple Watch online sooner than it could have done. The company said that removing stock from sale was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153not a decision we would take lightly\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and that it had been done in good faith because Black Friday is the biggest retailing day of the year.

                "bodyText":"It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not been the most exciting day in the financial markets, with traders distracted by reports of banks and insurers preparing for life after Brexit. And it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ended with the main European markets posting small gains, with Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s DAX hitting a new two-year high. The French CAC and Italian FTSE MIB also closed up around 0.5%. Shares in exporters were boosted by a weakening euro, which dropped after today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fall in German inflation. The FTSE 100 missed out, though, and closed down 0.06%. It was hit by a pick-up in the value of the pound, which gained half a cent to $1.249 against the US dollar. Jasper Lawler of London Capital Group sums up the session: Stocks are still in a bit of a holding pattern with traders lacking a bit of conviction to follow through on the last two days of dip-buying. A positive open in the US, helped by further recovery in crude oil prices improved sentiment in European markets by the afternoon. A bigger than expected fall in German inflation during March assured investors who have been buying the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shares in hopes of an extended period of easy money policies. The German benchmark DAX index touched a two-year high for a second day. The resilience of the British pound in the face of Article 50 uncertainty was probably the biggest factor behind the underperformance of the FTSE 100. Fund manager Schroders was the biggest loser while Ashtead Group was top gainer. And on that note, we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re closing down for the night. Thanks for reading and commenting. GW Theresa May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision to activate Article 50 yesterday has also encouraged City firms to trigger their own contingency plans, says Joshua Mahony, market analyst at IG. He predicts short-term pain for London, as the Brexit process rumbles on. Lloyds of London\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision to relocate jobs to Brussels, coupled with rumours of potential relocations for the likes of Citi and JP Morgan do little to inspire confidence in the City of London. There is no doubt that London will be the main loser from the coming two years of negotiations, much in the same way it was the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s main beneficiary from our EU membership. While the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s loss may be the EU\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s gain in the short-term, the long-term picture of a more open, globalised UK should mean that perhaps the EU and the UK will be better off further down the line. Another investment bank, Citigroup, has told its staff that some London-based jobs will move overseas due to Britain leaving the EU. Jim Cowles, the head of Citi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Europe, Middle East and Africa division, told staff in an internal memo that planning has been underway for months. Cowles explained that Citi expects a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153hard Brexit\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd (ie, losing membership of the single market and the Customs Union), adding; \u00e2\u20ac\u0153A hard Brexit would require certain changes, including relocating certain client-facing roles to the EU from the UK, and the possible creation of a new broker-dealer entity within the EU.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd In another Brexity development, Luxembourg has thrown its hat into the ring to become the new home of the European Banking Authority. The EBA\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s responsibilities include holding the regular European-wide banking stress tests. It is currently based in London, which won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be sustainable once Britain has left the EU. Amsterdam, Dublin, Frankfurt, Paris and Vienna have all reportedly been batting their eyelashes at the EBA. The EC has suggested it could be merged with a pensions regulator, based in Germany. Luxembourg, though, claims it has a legal right to host the EBA, citing a letter from 1965 which said it would be considered as a host for financial institutions. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our news story about JP Morgan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s plans: The Liberal Democrats are worried that JP Morgan and Lloyd\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s could be signalling an exodus from the City. Susan Kramer, the Lib Dem Treasury spokeswoman, says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153David Davis has already gone back on his assurances that British firms would continue to enjoy all the benefits of single market membership in his post-Brexit utopia. Now reality is starting to intervene, with JP Morgan reportedly looking to move 1,000 jobs out of London. This follows Lloyd\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s of London saying it will open an office in Brussels due to Brexit and become, at least in part, Lloyd\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s of Brussels. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It is the prime minister\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s choice to drive Britain out of the single market, and that is driving jobs and wealth creation out of the UK. Estimates suggest leaving the single market could cost Britain up to \u00c2\u00a3200bn over 15 years. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153When the P45s start to land and the NHS operations are cancelled, this will be the government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fault.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Banks aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t the only companies considering moving jobs out of the UK after Brexit. Two fifths of computer games companies based in the UK are considering relocating out of the country, a new survey has found. The industry fears that it will lose access to international talent from the EU, and funds administered by Brussels. More here: Newsflash: Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s inflation rate has fallen, and by even more than expected. The German Consumer Prices Index rose by just 1.5% annually this month, down from the four-year high of 2.2% scaled in February. Economists expected it to drop to 1.9%. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s partly because Easter fell in late March in 2016, but this year isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t until mid-April. Prices usually rise around the Easter holidays, partly due to higher transport costs. But even so, this should take some pressure off the European Central Bank to start tightening monetary policy. The overall eurozone inflation rate, announced on Friday morning, is on track to fall from last month\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 2%. We mentioned earlier that Lloyd\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s of London is planning to shift \u00e2\u20ac\u0153tens of jobs\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to Brussels, rather than whole floors of staff from London. Reuters\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s George Hay has dubbed this an example of the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153phantom exodus\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, and suspects that fewer staff will leave the City than feared. He writes: There is no way to spin this outflow as a good thing. Even if every financial firm moves only 10 percent of staff, that could still risk a tangible proportion of the 71 billion pounds of tax from financial services companies generated in 2016. UBS has said a fifth of its 5,000 London staff could be affected by Brexit, while a quarter of JPMorgan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 16,000 UK staff could be. Still, anecdotally bankers at the big firms think the exodus will be less, and London will retain its financial hub status. While a free trade agreement between the EU and the UK on favourable terms for finance seems far-fetched, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not impossible \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and Prime Minister Theresa May on Wednesday said that a future free trade agreement ought to cover financial services. More simply, not many financial types want to leave London. As such, Lloyd\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s is merely doing what every other firm is doing \u00e2\u20ac\u201c acquiring an option that it hopes will expire, out of the money. More here: Just in: A former investment banker has been fined over \u00c2\u00a337,000 for sharing confidential client information over the WhatsApp messaging service. The Financial Conduct Authority imposed the penalty on Christopher Niehaus, ruling that he failed to act with \u00e2\u20ac\u0153due skill, care and diligence\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. It explains: The FCA found that Mr Niehaus, who was a managing director in the Investment Banking division at Jefferies International Limited, received client confidential information during the course of his employment and, on a number of occasions between 24 January and 16 May 2016, shared that information with both a personal acquaintance and a friend, who was also a client of the firm. In one of the instances where Mr Niehaus shared client confidential information with his friend, who was also a client of the firm, that information was about a competitor. Mr Niehaus used the instant messaging application WhatsApp to share this information. The information was shared by Mr Niehaus because he wanted to impress the people that he shared the information with. The details of the information he shared included the identity of the client, the details relating to the client mandate and the fee Jefferies would charge for their involvement in the transaction. Mr Niehaus also boasted about how he may be able to pay off his mortgage if one of the deals was successful. None of the parties traded on the information shared, the FCA adds. Even so, Niehaus resigned from Jefferies after being suspended, after the WhatsApping came to light. More here. Bloomberg is also reporting that JPMorgan is in talks to buy office space in Dublin in response to Brexit. It believes the bank wants enough room for over 1,000 workers. It says The lender is negotiating the potential purchase of a building in Dublin\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Capital Dock that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s being developed by a venture between Kennedy Wilson Holdings Inc. and Ireland\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s National Asset Management Agency, the people said, asking not to be identified because the plans are private. The building, at 200 Capital Dock, has about 130,000 square feet (12,000 square meters) of space, the people said. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s enough for more than 1,000 workers. In another potential blow to the City, JP Morgan is reportedly considering moving hundreds of jobs to Dublin. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s according to the Irish Independent this morning, which reports: US investment banking giant JP Morgan is understood to be considering the relocation of hundreds of its employees from London to Capital Dock, the 31,600 sq m (340,000 sq ft) office scheme currently being developed by Kennedy Wilson in Dublin\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s docklands. News of JP Morgan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s potential post-Brexit move will be welcomed, coming as it does in the wake of the decision by two major insurance companies, Lloyd\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s of London and AIG, to choose Brussels and Luxembourg instead of Dublin for their respective European Union bases. While a source familiar with the matter insisted that a decision on Capital Dock was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153still up in the air\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, JP Morgan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s intentions in relation to the scheme\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s offices are currently the subject of intense speculation within Dublin\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s commercial real estate sector. The Irish Independent understands that JP Morgan has been engaged in a search for space capable of accomodating employees from both its existing offices at George\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dock in Dublin\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s International Financial Services Centre and up to 500 personnel currently working within its London operations. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the full story: JP Morgan eyes Capital Dock for Brexit relocation It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no secret that JP Morgan has been considering moving staff out of the City. Before the referendum, CEO Jamie Dimon warned that up to 4,000 jobs could be lost from London if the public voted for Brexit. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Wall Street Journal reports that the investment bank has been weighing up the respective charms of several cities, including Paris, Frankfurt, Luxembourg and Dublin. As with Lloyd\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s of London, such a move would allow JP Morgan to retain those passporting rights to offer financial services within the EU (which the City will lose if Britain quits the single market). Economic confidence across the eurozone has dipped a little this month, according to the latest survey from the European Commission. The EC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s index of investor and consumer sentiment in the region dipped to 107.9 this month, from 108 in February. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s weaker than expected, but still close to a five-year high. Standard &amp; Poor\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t planning to revise Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s credit rating, even though it has a better idea of Theresa May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Brexit strategy. S&amp;P has had Britain on a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcnegative outlook\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 since June 27, the Monday after the EU referendum, when it also ripped away the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s triple-A rating. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a sign that the rating is more likely to be cut again than raised. Moritz Kraemer, S&amp;P\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chief of sovereign ratings, has told Reuters no reason to change that view, following the PM\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s announcement on Wednesday that Brexit has begun. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a flavour: Kraemer...said May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s speech was largely as expected and there had been \u00e2\u20ac\u0153no surprises\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, though her tone was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153more conciliatory than it could have been\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The (EU) governments know that they have to hold the (Brexit) discussions in good faith,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he told Reuters. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy has proved far more resilient to uncertainty caused by the Brexit process than most economists - including those from S&amp;P - had predicted. That has raised questions as to whether the firm\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s negative outlook, which suggests a greater chance of another rating cut, is still justified. In Kraemer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s view it is. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We have seen nothing recently to make us rethink the negative outlook on the UK rating,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said. More here: No reason to rethink UK rating\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s negative outlook: S&amp;P There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not much drama in the foreign exchange market either. Sterling is hovering around the $1.241 level, a dip of 0.2% today, and slightly below its level before Britain formally triggered Article 50. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s up slightly against the euro at \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.156, meaning one euro is worth 86.5p. Yann Quelenn, market analyst at Swissquote, the Switzerland bank, believes sterling might actually rally this year as the Brexit talks proceed. Losing 20% in the wake of the referendum vote, the weaker sterling has provided the UK with a strong exports boost. Strengthening of the pound is now very likely especially as Europe faces a veritable minefield with the upcoming French and German elections. Time to reload GBP. [Great British Pounds] Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Brexit secretary, David Davis, is touring the broadcasting studios this morning. He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s denying that the UK is blackmailing Europe by using security co-operation as a bargaining chip, and trying to play down the idea of a huge exit bill. Andy Sparrow\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Politics Live blog has all the details: You might have expected European financial markets to be rattled by the formal opening of the Brexit process. But no. Trading is extremely sluggish across the continent\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock exchanges this morning. The Stoxx 600, which tracks the 600 largest companies in the region, has crept up by a mere 0.09%. In London, the FTSE 100 is up a meagre 5 points. But this soporific mood probably won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t last, once the UK actually begins the tussle with the rest of the EU. Connor Campbell of SpreadEx warns: The European markets are looking pretty sleepy this morning, lacking the direction provided by the Trump slump and Article 50 earlier in the week. However, with the real Brexit negotiations looming these kinds of placid opens may soon be a distant memory. Kit Juckes of Societe Generale also spies trouble ahead: In the UK dawn has broken over the new post-Article 50 environment. A beautiful red sunrise greeted me as I arrived at work, warning of rain even as the weather forecasters promise me the warmest day of the year so far. The bickering has already started over the order in which the exit can be negotiated and the uncertainty about the economic impact isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t going away. Now this is interesting.... Inga Beale, Lloyd\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s CEO, has revealed that they chose Brussels partly because Belgium is unlikely to follow Britain out of the EU. Speaking on BBC News, Beale said the group wanted a location with strong regulation, and good access to talent, which could be reached easily from London and other parts of Europe. Lloyd\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also wanted to think about the likelyhood of the country remaining in the EU too, Beale explained. She added that it would be \u00e2\u20ac\u0153fantastic\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd if Britain negotiated a deal that meant City firms retained their passporting rights in Europe [allowing them to sell services to every country in the EU from one site]. But as that now seems unlikely, Lloyd\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s is pressing on with the move to Brussels. Lloyd\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s of London chairman John Nelson has said the new Brussels operation will employ \u00e2\u20ac\u0153tens\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd of staff; a mixture of new hires and existing workers who will transfer to Belgium. He adds that it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u0153too early to say\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd whether other insurers will make a similar move, but points out that other Lloyd\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hubs have created their own ecosystems. So we might find that some of Lloyd\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s customers - the insurance brokers who trade on its market - shift jobs to Brussels too. (thanks to Reuters for the quotes). Lloyd\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision to open a new EU hub in Brussels is causing a stir. Bloomberg points out that other companies will be considering similar action: British companies and international financial firms are considering how to continue serving European clients should the U.K. withdraw not just from the EU, but also from its single market and customs union, both of which can accommodate countries that aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t in the bloc. The BBC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Simon Jack reckons Downing Street won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t appreciate the move, even though Lloyd\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s is also maintaining its main headquarters in London. Paul Sommerville of Sommerville Advisory Markets wonders if a name change might be needed: That didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t take long. Just a day after Britain triggered article 50, one of the City\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s most established names announced plans to open a new office in Brussels. Lloyd\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s of London, the insurance market that famously began in a coffee house, will create a subsidiary in the Belgian capital so it can retain its \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcpassporting rights\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 in Europe. Those rights are essential to keep offering financial services across the EU from. Under the plan, Lloyd\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s will have its new office ready in time for the 2019 underwriting season -- to minimise the disruption from Brexit. Up to 100 staff are likely to move. CEO Inga Beale says it will provide \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcefficient\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 access to Europe, adding: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It is now crucial that the UK government and the European Union proceed to negotiate an agreement that allows business to continue to flow under the best possible conditions once the UK formally leaves the EU. I believe it is important not just for the City but also for Europe that we reach a mutually beneficial agreement.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Julia Kollewe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s news story on the announcement, and Lloyd\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s latest financial results: Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. The City feels rather subdued this morning after the drama of seeing Britain hit the exit button to quit the European Union yesterday. Traders are watching to see how the opening exchanges pan out...and there are already worrying signs, with EU officials unhappy that the UK is threatening that security co-operation will suffer unless it gets a decent deal. Investors may also be alarmed that the two side are also at odds, already, over the negotiating process. Britain wants to discuss the terms of the divorce, and the future relationship, at the same time - but Germany insists the exit bill is agreed first. So faced with this impasse, investors are taking a cautious approach this morning. And that means the pound is serenely flat in early trading, at $1.243 against the US dollar. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s equally unruffled against the euro, at \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.1551 - the same as last night. Equities are calm too, with the FTSE 100 gaining 8 points in early trading, to 7382 points. No drama here (yet anyway). FXTM chief market strategist Hussein Sayed believes Brexit will be a tricky event for the City. Traders haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t seen such a historic event before, and Wednesday marked the official countdown of UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s divorce from the EU, ending a 44-year relationship with its neighbors. The end of this relationship is of course painful, but many agree that this marriage was not a case of love at first sight after all. Investors decided not to take any significant action on Wednesday, the GBP-USD traded within 70 pips trading range, and all major European equity markets closed higher. Predicting currency movements was never an easy task, and in the pound\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s case it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s even a more complicated situation given that we never experienced such a divorce in the past. Economic conditions in the U.K. are in a much better shape than what was anticipated nine months ago, with most economic indicators surprising to the upside. Meanwhile, the BoE is likely to turn more hawkish as the depreciation of sterling continues to feed through to increased prices. These factors helped the pound to find a floor in the past 6-months, but the forward outlook will much depend on how negotiations progress in the next couple of months. Coming up this morning. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s some interesting economic data on the calendar today, which might move the markets. 10am BST: The latest Eurozone economic confidence reading; expected to be a little higher this month as the European economy picks up 1pm BST: German inflation figures for March.
