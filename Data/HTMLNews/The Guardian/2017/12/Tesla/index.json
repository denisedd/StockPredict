                "bodyText":"After a bruising two years, there are signs that Volkswagen is overcoming the damage to its reputation, and finances, wrought by revelations that it had cheated on emissions tests. In November, the Wolfsburg-based manufacturer said it would post record vehicle deliveries this year and higher annual profits. VW, which also owns Porsche, Audi and Bentley among other brands, said it expected to sell more than 6 million Volkswagens this year, boosted by a strong performance in China, Europe and the US. It also said the operating profit margin at the brand could rise to between 4% and 5% by 2020 \u2013 still falling behind rivals such as PSA Group (formerly PSA Peugeot Citro\u00ebn) and Toyota, but higher than forecast. This from the company that became an emblem of corporate scandal in 2015 when it emerged that it had used software to suppress emissions of nitrogen oxides during vehicle tests \u2013 a scam that affected 11 million vehicles. Aftershocks from the scandal still linger, but the German car giant expects to overtake the \u20ac1.9bn (\u00a31.7bn) of earnings it notched up in 2016. Rising sales of more profitable sport utility vehicles (SUVs), such as its Touareg model, are pushing earnings higher. The more positive outlook has been seized on by analysts and investors. Arndt Ellinghorst, a senior managing director at financial advisory firm Evercore, said: \u201cIt is increasingly hard for investors to ignore the impressive turnaround of VW.\u201d Investors have responded to the positive news, chasing the share price up by 18% over the last three months. This is despite the mounting financial toll of the scandal: it has so far cost VW more than \u20ac25bn and has been the main driver behind its strategic shift towards electric vehicles. The costs include settlements of government and customer lawsuits, repurchases, and retrofits to affected vehicles. It also includes a criminal plea deal in the US, which exacted $2.8bn (\u00a32.1bn) in criminal fines and $1.5bn in civil penalties. It has been a watershed couple of years for the car industry, as rivals scurry to jump on the electric-power bandwagon pioneered by Elon Musk\u2019s Tesla. VW was late to the party, but the so-called \u201cdieselgate\u201d scandal has forced it to accept the new reality. Governments in France, the UK and the Netherlands have backed plans to ban the sale of diesel and petrol vehicles between 2025 and 2040 in a push to clean up polluted cities. Fears about the death of diesel also appear to have hit home with buyers. In November, sales of new diesel cars fell in the UK by more than 30% compared with the same period a year before, according to the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT). The wider VW Group can see the writing is on the wall for the internal combustion engine. The carmaker\u2019s response has been decisive. It has earmarked \u20ac70bn to produce battery-powered versions of all models by 2030. Paul Nieuwenhuis, senior lecturer at Cardiff University\u2019s Centre for Automotive Industry Research, says VW has come through the worst: \u201cThey are quite resilient \u2026 The problem now is really in the US \u2013 because of the litigation.\u201d The carmaker and two of its executives are still under investigation in Germany and it faces investor lawsuits in the US and at home. Oliver Schmidt, formerly VW US compliance executive, was sentenced to seven years in prison this month after pleading guilty to one count of conspiracy to defraud the US and another of violating the Clean Air Act. Schmidt admitted he was coached to lie about emissions by his bosses at Volkswagen. He is the second employee sent to prison for participating in the emissions-cheating scheme: James Liang, a veteran VW engineer, was sentenced to 40 months in prison in August, having pleaded guilty to conspiracy and cooperated with prosecutors. He has appealed against his sentence. But despite the huge legal challenges in America, sales of VW cars are up 8.3% year-on-year in the US. \u201cThe thing is, they just make good cars,\u201d Nieuwenhuis said. \u201cIt is such a strong brand, people will say \u2018I\u2019m buying a Golf because it\u2019s good value for money\u2019.\u201d",

                "bodyText":"2017 was a year marked by mini-upsets in the business world that, taken together, represented a changing of the old guard and a new establishment taking shape. Technology fuelled a revolution which saw upstarts in retail, manufacturing and finance overtake long-established players. Whether it was payment cards or Bitcoin trumping cash or currencies, or the battery coming of age over the internal combustion engine, these were seminal moments. Maureen Hinton, a director at research firm GlobalData said: \u201cThese disruptors have adapted to new demand and changing lifestyles far quicker than traditional businesses often because they can create from scratch, rather than having to adapt an existing model.\u201d The disruptors made 2017 their own in a good year for the upstart. Asos leapfrogs Marks &amp; Spencer The biggest upset of the year in the UK was in retail. Marks &amp; Spencer, Britain\u2019s favourite clothing retailer, was overtaken last month by Asos, the fashion website still listed on the junior AIM market. This was seen as a pivotal moment on the high street because M&amp;S, which dates back to 1884, was dwarfed by its 17-year-old rival in terms of its stock market value. A month on and the gap is even wider with Asos worth \u00a35.2bn compared with M&amp;S\u2019s \u00a34.9bn. The power of the relatively new online player over such well-established retail royalty is a sign of the times on the high street. Shopping habits have changed. Customers have fallen out of love with tired and dated town-centre shops and there is a growing trend toward buying items online. M&amp;S has struggled in recent years to deliver on-trend designs in women\u2019s clothing from its expensive stores. Asos, which used to be called As Seen on Screen, started out by selling cheap copies of celebrity fashion items, and has carved a niche delivering cheap popular designs to a faithful and growing band of young shoppers. This could not have come at a worse time for M&amp;S\u2019s chief executive, Steve Rowe, who has just cbegun a five-year transformation programme and has promised to bring the company\u2019s clothing business back on track. Aldi overtakes Co-op Store openings and bigger more beautiful premises helped Aldi leapfrog the more established Co-op to become Britain\u2019s fifth largest supermarket. The German upstart, which opened its first UK store in 1990, increased its share of the grocery market from 5.6% to 6.2% in February, compared with the same 12-week period the previous year, according to the market research firm Kantar Worldpanel.

UK card payments overtake cash The value of transactions made using payment cards exceeded those in cash for the first-time last year, according to the British Retail Consortium. Some may have mistakenly thought such a landmark had been reached some years ago, but smaller transactions paid with loose change always accumulated to swing the balance in favour of cash. The innovation of using contactless, where you can wave your card in front of a payment machine without having to enter a pin, has however meant more people are using cards for buying lower value items. Contactless now accounts for a third of all card purchases, up from 10% in October 2015. The introduction of lower transaction fees and handling charges also had an impact. Retailers are now more willing to invest in systems to accept card payments after reduced charges were forced through by the EU under its interchange fee regulation.
