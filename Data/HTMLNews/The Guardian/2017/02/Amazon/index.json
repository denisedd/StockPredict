Philip Hammond, one suspects, will end up inventing various reliefs to try to quell the anger of those small businesses in London facing increases of up to 400%. But something more than a sticking-plaster is required. If not, this toxic row will return every time potential rents \u2013 the basis for establishing rateable values \u2013 are recalculated. There are, of course, no easy alternatives to a tax that raises \u00a328bn a year for councils and the government. We already have a sales tax called VAT and corporation tax applies to profit.

Seema Malhotra has written to Hammond to say she believes it was an abuse of official data and has written to the UK Statistics Authority about it. Counting the cost Bryars and Bryars, Cecil Court, London Tim Bryars, who runs an antique book store near Covent Garden, is facing a 20% increase in his rates bill in the coming two years. \u201cI\u2019ve got to sell quite a lot of books to clear the extra profit required to cover that 20% increase,\u201d said Bryars. \u201cIf the market goes online I think something will be lost \u2026 you can only Google something if you\u2019ve heard about it.\u201d Bryars is particularly irked by the way the revaluation process has benefited online stores at the expense of the high street. \u201cPeople see independent stores closing and think those businesses couldn\u2019t cut it in the modern world because of the internet,\u201d he said. \u201cBut lots of small businesses are perfectly viable; they just can\u2019t find half their rent again in business rates before all the other expenses. The business rates system probably worked fine in the late 20th century but it is out of date if multinationals like Amazon see their rates bill fall while small independent retailers see theirs rise.\u201d Titanic Brewery, Stoke, Staffordshire Keith Bott and his brother Dave run Titanic Brewery, a small business that owns and operates eight pubs in Staffordshire, and Bott said the increase in rates will cost the business \u201ctens of thousands of pounds\u201d, once a transitional relief period ends in five years. He said the main problem was that rates on pubs were linked to their turnover not property value. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen a 25% increase in rateable values across the board,\u201d he said. \u201cThe government needs to recognise and understand the issue. Pubs are responsible for 0.5% of turnover of the UK economy but pay 2.8% of business rates.\u201d Rob Davies and Zoe Wood",

If they call in loans or stop issuing new ones, the car market would be in big trouble. Likewise credit-card lending, which is vulnerable to a rise in unemployment \u2013 or, more likely, a squeeze on pay from rising inflation that will prevent people servicing their loans.</p> <h2><strong>House prices</strong></h2> <p>A mix of higher taxes on second homes and Brexit uncertainty is taking the heat out of the housing market. But there are still concerns that buyers are stretching too far to purchase homes, leaving them vulnerable to the slightest hiccup in their financial calculations.</p> <p>The latest study of home affordability by Lloyds, which measures the ratio between average house prices by city and average gross local earnings, is at its worst level since 2008.</p> <p>Over the past five years, the average UK city house price has risen by 32% from \u00a3169,966 in 2012 to its highest ever level of \u00a3224,926 in 2017. Average annual earnings for city dwellers over the same period have risen by only 7% to \u00a332,796. As a result, average affordability in the nation\u2019s cities has worsened, with house prices rising as a multiple of average annual earnings from 5.5 in 2012 to 6.9 in 2017.

The result was a collapse in GDP growth and mass redundancies, especially in industries that relied on cheap loans.</p> <p>It was this slowdown that precipitated the fall in oil prices and a dramatic decline in global trade during 2015.
