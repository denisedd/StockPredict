The broader measure of US companies, the S&amp;P 500, continued its ascent back to a high point established in June.</p> <p>Wall Street analysts expect the US stock market, which has soared by more than a fifth since Trump took office, to maintain its supercharged rise for some time yet.</p> <p>But not much of the boost can be credited to the president. There was an initial spike following his election as infrastructure companies boomed on hopes of big government spending contracts, and wealthy investors and corporations gambled that he would hand out eye-watering tax cuts.</p> <p>But more important has been the action of the Federal Reserve, the US central bank. This year, despite two small rate rises, the signs are that a return to anything like normal interest rates is a long way off.

Foreign exchange traders watch the same signals and since January have decided that rate rises, which act to suck foreign money into the US, are not going to happen. They sold the dollar, which has fallen by around 10% against a basket of currencies since January.</p> <p>One major spin-off of that decline has been a boost to exports, especially to China, despite Trump\u2019s anti-Beijing rhetoric. That\u2019s good news for companies from Apple to General Electric.</p> <p>Another trend is the spectacular revenues of most large companies. Firms have continued to spend their improving profit levels on share buybacks.

The growth rate is half what we saw in the 1990s and there are strong indications that the economy will weaken next year.\u201d</p> <p>Shapiro, who runs his own economic consultancy, Sonecon, in Washington, believes few people will permit Trump to take credit for the current benign economic situation \u2013 but will hold him responsible should it deteriorate by the midterm elections in November 2018.</p> <p>\u201cWe always give credit for the economy in the first year to the previous president,\u201d he says. \u201cTrump hasn\u2019t passed any significant legislation, and while he has put forward some de-regulation measures, they haven\u2019t had any effect yet.\u201d</p> <p>Trump\u2019s Treasury secretary, Steve Mnuchin, argues that his budget proposals for the autumn will extend the current run of strong growth and push it to beyond 3% year after year through to the middle of the next decade, at which point bumper tax receipts will bring the government spending deficit back into balance.</p> <p>The budget is a mix of tax cuts for the richest and middle-income groups coupled with deep cuts in further education and welfare spending.</p> <p>Albert Edwards, the famously gloomy global strategist at Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale, is convinced that the loose monetary policies preferred by the Federal Reserve and the Bank of England, and endorsed by Trump, are encouraging a debt bubble that will burst with similar consequences to the 2008 financial crash.</p> <p>Edwards said in a recent note to investors: \u201cI\u2019m genuinely getting tired of bashing the major central banks, but every day more evidence mounts that almost exactly the same debt excesses that caused the global financial crisis in 2008 are present today.</p> <p>\u201cThe Bank of England and Federal Reserve deserve particular vilification for failing to remove the monetary punchbowl quickly enough \u2013 just like the 2003-2007 period, allowing grotesque debt excesses to build.\u201d</p> <p>Mnuchin\u2019s budget is expected to be watered down as it makes its way through Congress and emerge as not much more than a mild tax cut for the wealthy. That would leave the Fed unmoved and sticking to its course of only incremental interest rate rises over a period of years.</p> <p><strong>Verdict</strong> The best years of the current recovery are in the past, though unfunded tax cuts in the autumn could provide a sugar rush that pushes up growth and inflation next year.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"384299973ac879b7f2638eff3cbea0ce2dfbe5f6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/384299973ac879b7f2638eff3cbea0ce2dfbe5f6/0_0_2980_1787/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Steve Mnuchin\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin forecasts 3% annual growth for years to come.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Susan Walsh/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>\u2018Unemployment lowest\u2026\u2019</strong></h2> <p>Economists have worried that the US economy is struggling to create significant employment despite <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/apr/07/us-march-jobs-report-98000-retail-government-freeze-trump\" title=\"\">Trump\u2019s promise of \u201cJOBS!

Huge numbers of women and older workers have quit the jobs market completely. America now has one of the lowest labour market participation rates in the developed world.</p> <p>Jobs data has emphasised the trend, with the largest growth in low-paying service industry jobs, and not in the higher-paying traditional blue-collar industries Trump pledged to support.</p> <p>Coal exports have boomed this year, but jobs in food services are growing at more than three times the rate of mining jobs, and manufacturing employment growth is static.</p> <p>Shapiro says he advised Hillary Clinton before last November\u2019s presidential election that she would need to put in place policies that raised the skill levels of blue-collar workers to prepare them for workplaces increasingly dominated by technology.</p> <p>\u201cYou have already hit full employment so you can\u2019t expect strong job expansion to support growth,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd without strong jobs growth you need to increase productivity, but that has been slow for three years and shows no sign of increasing.</p> <p>\u201cThis is a White House that has largely been absorbed by the Russia scandal and the legal implications for senior members of the administration.

                "body":"<p>Not everybody can be the next Facebook \u2013 or least not easily or quickly. This has been a hard lesson for investors in Snap, owner of Snapchat. They should have known it all along, of course, since Facebook has never disguised its ambition to crush any social media upstarts that get in its way. But it didn\u2019t prevent Snap being <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/mar/02/snapchat-ipo-valuation-evan-spiegel-bobby-murphy-snap-inc\" title=\"\">valued at a colossal $28bn on its first day of trading</a> on the US stock market in March.</p> <p>Five months later, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/aug/10/snapchat-shares-fall-losses-wall-street\" title=\"\">the valuation has halved</a>, prompting chief executive Evan Spiegel to pledge that he and co-founder Bobby Murphy won\u2019t sell any of their shares this year. This promise was meant to signal the duo\u2019s deep belief in the long-term success of Snap. In fact, the gesture was no more than the minimum required to sustain flagging spirits. If the founders had left their options open with the shares trading below their IPO price, there would have been panic. As it was, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/aug/10/snapchat-shares-fall-losses-wall-street\" title=\"\">the shares fell 16% after second-quarter results on Thursday</a>.</p> <p>Debate around those figures was dominated by Spiegel\u2019s assertion that Wall Street analysts are looking at his camera app company through the wrong lens. Forget about the number of daily users, he argued with irritation, and look at the amount of time users spend on Snapchat, and how much advertisers are willing to pay.</p> <p>Spiegel\u2019s general point is fair: advertising revenue is what ultimately counts. The trouble is, Snap doesn\u2019t yet have a good story to tell on that front. Average revenue per user was $1.05 in the quarter, up from $0.90 in the previous three months. A quarter-on-quarter increase of 16% is not be sniffed at, but the revenue numbers only become explosive when combined with lots of new users. Snap added only 7.3 million, a quarter-on-quarter rise of only 4%, to reach 173 million. No wonder Spiegel would prefer people to look somewhere else.</p> <p>The awkward fact remains that Snap is actually a small company in its industry. Revenues were $182m in the quarter and $331m over six months. That suggests that reaching $1bn for 2017, as some on Wall Street had expected, will be a stretch.</p> <p>Even if it achieved that, is it really sensible to value Snap at 14 times its revenues? The figure seems absurd when you remember that this is a six-year-old business that still makes heavy losses and has to face the formidable companies of Facebook \u2013 especially Instagram, which seems to be directly aimed at Snapchat these days.</p> <p>One can\u2019t blame Spiegel, of course, if investors were prepared to put such a high price on hope at the IPO. Investors were so mad for a slice of the action that they all allowed him to get away with the governance outrage of issuing shares with no voting rights whatsoever. That\u2019s their lookout. But Snap\u2019s overhyped IPO, and subsequent share price fall, naturally prompts the question of whether there\u2019s a wider bubble in the US technology market.</p> <p>The short answer is probably no. Or, rather, if there is, it is a different kind of bubble from the one that popped in 2001. Back then, almost every stock with a \u201cnew economy\u201d tag went up like a rocket. Investors have learned to discriminate. Stocks such as Amazon, Google, Facebook and Tesla remain hellishly difficult to value by old yardsticks, but the market is commendably ruthless in punishing the shares of overpromoted companies that disappoint financially, like Twitter.</p> <p>The same process now seems to be under way at Snap. The IPO itself was a triumph of the investment bankers\u2019 art of generating a buzz and a fear of missing out. But now the party is over. Spiegel may not like the sudden blast of scepticism, but he should be braced for more of the same. It\u2019s healthy. To command even Snap\u2019s shrunken valuation, you have to do more than invent an animation of a dancing hot dog, the current viral sensation. You have to show you can make money from it.</p> <h2>Family ties and animal fat should never catch out the Bank</h2> <p>The mistakes that forced Charlotte Hogg to resign as deputy governor of the Bank of England in March are well-documented. One of the UK\u2019s best-connected individuals \u2013 her <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2013/jun/20/profile-charlotte-hogg-bank-of-england\" title=\"\">parents both had leading roles in John Major\u2019s government</a> and her grandfather was Quintin Hogg, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2001/oct/15/guardianobituaries.conservatives\" title=\"\">better known as Lord Hailsham</a> \u2013 had forgotten to disclose that her brother (also Quintin) worked at Barclays.</p> <p>She compounded her error by telling MPs on the Treasury select committee that the Bank knew about her brother\u2019s role, before having to admit that she had not disclosed this and was therefore in breach of the Bank\u2019s code of conduct \u2013 which she had helped write.</p> <p>Now, though, it is clear that the Bank could have handled the case better. A <a href=\"http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/about/Documents/ieo/nedreview0817.pdf\" title=\"\">review commissioned by the Bank\u2019s non-executive directors</a> into the embarrassing chain of events found that the usual processes were not followed when she first joined the Bank in 2013. There was an \u201cinformal exchange of emails\u201d with the then chair of the Bank\u2019s oversight body \u2013 the court of directors \u2013 and nothing more.</p> <p>\u201cA more structured approach may have resulted in Ms Hogg\u2019s brother\u2019s role being registered at the outset,\u201d the reported pointed out. Well, quite.</p> <p>The Bank has now pledged to sort out its processes and make the matter of conflicts of interests clearer during interviews. It should set itself a goal to ensure that no one else ever has to leave under such circumstances.</p> <p>It might also think about how it got itself into such a mess over banknotes. Its new plastic notes \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/video/2016/sep/14/mark-carney-tests-new-5-plastic-note-video\" title=\"\">indestructible even when dipped in curry by governor Mark Carney</a> \u2013 are not so durable in the face of public scrutiny. They\u2019re made with tallow, an animal fat, and so are unacceptable to millions of UK residents \u2013 vegans, vegetarians, Hindus, Sikhs, Jains and others \u2013 according to a petition. The Bank is, however, sticking with tallow: using palm oil was found to cause its own problems.</p> <p>These are two situations that, perhaps, the Bank could have handled better from the start.</p> <h2>Wilko pins its woes on the \u2018national living wage\u2019</h2> <p>\u201cChancellor Osborne\u2019s final austerity budget surprised the industry by its unilateral imposition of a statutory minimum living wage at well above expected levels,\u201d reports Wilko, the family-owned homewares and households goods retailer, in its annual report for last year.</p> <p>That overly dramatic description was perhaps a warm-up for last week\u2019s announcement that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/aug/11/wilko-warns-nearly-4000-staff-could-lose-jobs\" title=\"\">almost 4,000 jobs at the company are at risk</a>. This was presented as an exercise in internal restructuring \u2013 a stripping out of a layer of management \u2013 but a grumble about the former chancellor\u2019s 2015 budget all helps to encourage the idea that outside forces are upsetting the retail sector.</p> <p>Yet times can\u2019t be too hard at Wilko, despite the expansion of rival discount chain B&amp;M in the homewares market. The Wilkinson family still managed to pay themselves a \u00a33m dividend for the year. That wasn\u2019t imposed on them. Rather, it was a conscious choice.</p>",

Five months later, the valuation has halved, prompting chief executive Evan Spiegel to pledge that he and co-founder Bobby Murphy won\u2019t sell any of their shares this year. This promise was meant to signal the duo\u2019s deep belief in the long-term success of Snap. In fact, the gesture was no more than the minimum required to sustain flagging spirits. If the founders had left their options open with the shares trading below their IPO price, there would have been panic. As it was, the shares fell 16% after second-quarter results on Thursday. Debate around those figures was dominated by Spiegel\u2019s assertion that Wall Street analysts are looking at his camera app company through the wrong lens. Forget about the number of daily users, he argued with irritation, and look at the amount of time users spend on Snapchat, and how much advertisers are willing to pay. Spiegel\u2019s general point is fair: advertising revenue is what ultimately counts. The trouble is, Snap doesn\u2019t yet have a good story to tell on that front. Average revenue per user was $1.05 in the quarter, up from $0.90 in the previous three months. A quarter-on-quarter increase of 16% is not be sniffed at, but the revenue numbers only become explosive when combined with lots of new users. Snap added only 7.3 million, a quarter-on-quarter rise of only 4%, to reach 173 million. No wonder Spiegel would prefer people to look somewhere else. The awkward fact remains that Snap is actually a small company in its industry. Revenues were $182m in the quarter and $331m over six months. That suggests that reaching $1bn for 2017, as some on Wall Street had expected, will be a stretch. Even if it achieved that, is it really sensible to value Snap at 14 times its revenues? The figure seems absurd when you remember that this is a six-year-old business that still makes heavy losses and has to face the formidable companies of Facebook \u2013 especially Instagram, which seems to be directly aimed at Snapchat these days. One can\u2019t blame Spiegel, of course, if investors were prepared to put such a high price on hope at the IPO. Investors were so mad for a slice of the action that they all allowed him to get away with the governance outrage of issuing shares with no voting rights whatsoever. That\u2019s their lookout. But Snap\u2019s overhyped IPO, and subsequent share price fall, naturally prompts the question of whether there\u2019s a wider bubble in the US technology market. The short answer is probably no. Or, rather, if there is, it is a different kind of bubble from the one that popped in 2001. Back then, almost every stock with a \u201cnew economy\u201d tag went up like a rocket. Investors have learned to discriminate. Stocks such as Amazon, Google, Facebook and Tesla remain hellishly difficult to value by old yardsticks, but the market is commendably ruthless in punishing the shares of overpromoted companies that disappoint financially, like Twitter. The same process now seems to be under way at Snap. The IPO itself was a triumph of the investment bankers\u2019 art of generating a buzz and a fear of missing out. But now the party is over. Spiegel may not like the sudden blast of scepticism, but he should be braced for more of the same. It\u2019s healthy. To command even Snap\u2019s shrunken valuation, you have to do more than invent an animation of a dancing hot dog, the current viral sensation. You have to show you can make money from it. Family ties and animal fat should never catch out the Bank The mistakes that forced Charlotte Hogg to resign as deputy governor of the Bank of England in March are well-documented. One of the UK\u2019s best-connected individuals \u2013 her parents both had leading roles in John Major\u2019s government and her grandfather was Quintin Hogg, better known as Lord Hailsham \u2013 had forgotten to disclose that her brother (also Quintin) worked at Barclays. She compounded her error by telling MPs on the Treasury select committee that the Bank knew about her brother\u2019s role, before having to admit that she had not disclosed this and was therefore in breach of the Bank\u2019s code of conduct \u2013 which she had helped write. Now, though, it is clear that the Bank could have handled the case better. A review commissioned by the Bank\u2019s non-executive directors into the embarrassing chain of events found that the usual processes were not followed when she first joined the Bank in 2013. There was an \u201cinformal exchange of emails\u201d with the then chair of the Bank\u2019s oversight body \u2013 the court of directors \u2013 and nothing more. \u201cA more structured approach may have resulted in Ms Hogg\u2019s brother\u2019s role being registered at the outset,\u201d the reported pointed out. Well, quite. The Bank has now pledged to sort out its processes and make the matter of conflicts of interests clearer during interviews. It should set itself a goal to ensure that no one else ever has to leave under such circumstances. It might also think about how it got itself into such a mess over banknotes. Its new plastic notes \u2013 indestructible even when dipped in curry by governor Mark Carney \u2013 are not so durable in the face of public scrutiny. They\u2019re made with tallow, an animal fat, and so are unacceptable to millions of UK residents \u2013 vegans, vegetarians, Hindus, Sikhs, Jains and others \u2013 according to a petition. The Bank is, however, sticking with tallow: using palm oil was found to cause its own problems. These are two situations that, perhaps, the Bank could have handled better from the start. Wilko pins its woes on the \u2018national living wage\u2019 \u201cChancellor Osborne\u2019s final austerity budget surprised the industry by its unilateral imposition of a statutory minimum living wage at well above expected levels,\u201d reports Wilko, the family-owned homewares and households goods retailer, in its annual report for last year. That overly dramatic description was perhaps a warm-up for last week\u2019s announcement that almost 4,000 jobs at the company are at risk. This was presented as an exercise in internal restructuring \u2013 a stripping out of a layer of management \u2013 but a grumble about the former chancellor\u2019s 2015 budget all helps to encourage the idea that outside forces are upsetting the retail sector. Yet times can\u2019t be too hard at Wilko, despite the expansion of rival discount chain B&amp;M in the homewares market. The Wilkinson family still managed to pay themselves a \u00a33m dividend for the year. That wasn\u2019t imposed on them. Rather, it was a conscious choice.",

Latest Office for National Statistics data show that total real average weekly earnings decreased by 0.5% in the three months to June, which was marginally down from a peak drop of 0.6% in May. Inflation will likely be close to 3% through the latter months of 2017, while earnings growth seems set to hover around 2%</p> <p>Furthermore, consumer confidence is brittle and caution over making major purchases appears to have been reinforced by heightened economic, political and Brexit uncertainties. </p> </blockquote> <p>However, there is cause for cause for cautious optimism looking into next year.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The squeeze on consumers should progressively ease in 2018 due to inflation falling back markedly (as the impact of sterling\u2019s sharp fall drops out).

                "bodyText":"That\u2019s it for the day and the big news came from the European Central Bank minutes and UK retail sales. ECB minutes revealed that the Bank\u2019s policymakers are fretting about the euro \u201covershooting\u201d against other currencies. That\u2019s a concern because a strong euro would make exports from the 19-nation single currency bloc less competitive. The release of the minutes sent the euro on a downward trajectory. In the UK, retail sales were up 0.3% month on month in July, slightly ahead of a forecast of 0.2%, an encouraging sign coming hot on the heels of an apparent easing of the cost of living squeeze. However June\u2019s retail sales figure was revised downwards from 0.6% to 0.3%. Elsewhere, European markets took a turn for the worse after a winning streak and the FTSE was down by mid-afternoon, after lacklustre results from B&amp;Q owner Kingfisher and Mecca Bingo owner Rank. On that note, it\u2019s time to put the blog back into hibernation. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back bright and early tomorrow with all the latest developments. Here\u2019s Guardian retail guru Sarah Butler with the full lowdown on Asda\u2019s first sales rise for three years. In a note snappily titled \u201cEurozone: Between taper and tantrum\u201d, analysts at Dutch bank ING have been unpicking those ECB minutes, which have put the euro on the slide. They are looking ahead to next week\u2019s meeting of central bankers at Jackson Hole and think the minutes reflect cautiousness at the ECB about unwinding monetary stimulus. Today\u2019s minutes fit into the picture of an ECB which wants to steer and moderate the process towards tapering extremely cautiously. Yesterday\u2019s reports that Mario Draghi would possibly not say anything new on the bank\u2019s monetary policy at his speech at the Jackson Hole conference on 25 August had already given the same flavour. However, ING reckon this does not rule out the possibility of more subtle changes of tone at the ECB, most likely further towards the back end of the year. All of this means that in our view the ECB will take another baby step towards tapering at the September meeting. This could be done by putting more emphasis on the strong economic recovery which easily could do with somewhat less monetary stimulus and/or by using the well-known key phrase that the Governing Council has tasked the relevant committees to investigate several options for QE in 2018. Tapering will come but somehow the ECB itself does not yet entirely know when and how to do it. UK retail sales growth may have been pretty lacklustre in July but nobody has told Asda. The British supermarket, part of the world\u2019s largest retailer Wal-Mart, has reported its first underlying sales growth for three years. Like-for-like sales at the UK\u2019s third biggest supermarket rose by 1.8% in its second quarter, helped by food price inflation and a comparison against a weak period last year. That\u2019s still quite the turnaround from the first quarter, when sales were down 2.8%, the eleventh straight quarterly decline. Details of the European Central Bank\u2019s Governing Council meeting for July have been released. It seems policymakers are concerned about the euro \u201covershooting\u201d in the future. In other words they\u2019re worried the euro may strengthen too much. The reason that\u2019s a concern is that the eurozone relies quite heavily on exports and a stronger euro could make those exports less attractive to buyers outside the 19-nation bloc. The euro hit a three-week low against the dollar after the ECB voiced its fears. The Federation of Small Businesses has taken a look at July\u2019s UK retail sales and they are not impressed. Here\u2019s the verdict of Mike Cherry, the FSB\u2019s national chairman. Confidence among small retailers has plummeted over the first half of the year. We\u2019re worryingly close to flat, or even negative, retail sales growth across the UK. \u201cWith operating costs at their highest in four years, small business owners are paying themselves less, struggling to award pay rises and pushing up prices in an attempt to absorb increased outgoings. This threatens to further stifle already reduced consumer spending power. \u201cInflationary pressure, Brexit uncertainty and delays to business rates relief measures are making it almost impossible for small retailers to invest and plan for the future. In this unforgiving climate, the Government needs to carefully consider its inaugural Budget. Stealth tax grabs in the form of hikes to fuel duty and insurance premium tax will make a bad situation worse. A quick check on markets, currencies and commodities as we head towards noon. The FTSE100 is down 25 at 7407 after disappointing numbers from Kingfisher and Rank Germany\u2019s DAX is 12 points lower at 122251, while the French CAC is off 8.6 points at 5168 Sterling is at $1.2858 and \u20ac1.1694 Brent crude oil is flat at $50.24 per barrel The Guardian business desk\u2019s ace new economics correspondent Richard Partington has put some flesh on the bones of those UK retail sales figures. Here\u2019s his version of events. Time for a bit of light relief after those chewy retail sales figures. Harper\u2019s has published a transcript of the jury selection process in the trial of beleaguered pharmaceuticals chief executive Martin Shkreli, who was convicted of fraud earlier this month. It\u2019s fair to say that potential jurors were tough to find, with most already having formed some pretty strong opinions on Shkreli, who has been widely condemned after his company Turing raised the price of drugs for conditions including HIV/AIDS. More than two hundred were excused as a result. It started badly, with prospective Juror No 1 declaring: \u201cI\u2019m aware of the defendant and I hate him.\u201d Another candidate described Shkreli as the \u201cmost hated man in America\u201d while one felt incapable of being impartial because he \u201ckind of looks like a d***\u201d. But perhaps the most heinous accusation levelled at Shkreli by jurors was that he \u201cdisrespected the Wu-Tang Clan\u201d, the influential New York hip-hop group that enjoyed a meteoric rise in the 1990s with their distinctive sound. Shkreli was the man who bought the sole copy of the Wu-Tang\u2019s special release \u201cOnce Upon A Time in Shaolin\u201d for $2m in 2015, on the condition that he didn\u2019t release it for 88 years. Shkreli duly leaked it to celebrate Donald Trump\u2019s election, sparking a war of words with the group\u2019s members including Ghostface Killah, who deemed him a \u201csh*thead\u201d. Of course, any fan of the hip-hop outfit could have told Shkreli that the Wu-Tang Clan Ain\u2019t Nuthing Ta F\u2019 Wit and advised him to Protect Ya Neck, or risk crying Tearz. Price rises in the 19 countries that share the euro currency held firm during July, with inflation sticking at 1.3% excluding energy and unprocessed food, according to the European statistics office Eurostat. Inflation remains below the European Central Bank\u2019s target of 2% but has ticked up slightly on 1.2% in June and came in above analysts\u2019 forecasts of 1.2%. We may get an indication later today of whether the ECB is moving towards an unwinding of its monetary stimulus programme, with the Bank\u2019s Governing Council meeting minutes from July due to be published. Here\u2019s some more detail on those lacklustre numbers from B&amp;Q and Screwfix owner Kingfisher. Analysts at AJ Bell have noted that despite Kingfisher being \u00a3368m of the way through a \u00a3600m share buyback, its stock has slumped to its lowest level since late 2014. The failure of this largesse to support the shares raises further questions over whether buybacks are a good value of creating long-term value for investors or not. Here comes Howard Archer, chief economic adviser to the EY ITEM Club, without whose analysis no retail sales release would be complete. We\u2019ve heard the numbers, which were better than expected, but here\u2019s Howard\u2019s slightly gloomier take on the shape of things to come: The outlook for consumers looks set to be highly challenging over the latter months of the year, even though a modicum of relief has come from consumer price inflation easing back to 2.6% in July from a near four-year high of 2.9% in May. Real income growth is currently negative, and it looks likely to remain so through the rest of 2017. Latest Office for National Statistics data show that total real average weekly earnings decreased by 0.5% in the three months to June, which was marginally down from a peak drop of 0.6% in May. Inflation will likely be close to 3% through the latter months of 2017, while earnings growth seems set to hover around 2% Furthermore, consumer confidence is brittle and caution over making major purchases appears to have been reinforced by heightened economic, political and Brexit uncertainties. However, there is cause for cause for cautious optimism looking into next year. The squeeze on consumers should progressively ease in 2018 due to inflation falling back markedly (as the impact of sterling\u2019s sharp fall drops out). However, earnings growth will likely remain relatively muted and employment may well lose momentum. Time for some reaction to those UK retail sales figures, which narrowly beat forecasts with a 0.3% rise. This is what Ruth Gregory, UK economist at Capital Economics, has to say: July\u2019s retail sales figures were fairly encouraging given the recent intensification of the squeeze on consumers\u2019 real incomes and suggest that talk of a sharp consumer slowdown has been overdone. Admittedly, the 0.3% monthly expansion in retail sales volumes (consensus 0.2%) was a bit weaker than the recent upbeat surveys had suggested. What\u2019s more, the annual rate of sales volumes stood at just 1.3% in July \u2013 down from 2.8% in June and considerably lower than the 5-6% rates seen towards the end of 2016. But with July\u2019s monthly rise in sales volumes building on June\u2019s robust 0.6% increase, high-street spending appears to have carried a decent amount of momentum into Q3. There have been few signs of a sharp slowdown in spending growth away from the high street either. Keith Richardson, managing director retail sector at Lloyds Bank Commercial Banking, said: July\u2019s wet weather might have dampened fashion sales but the supermarkets\u2019 continued creativity together with a good month for homewares meant it was another good month for retailers overall. While headline inflation may have eased back slightly recently, shoppers are still feeling the squeeze from several months of rising prices and sluggish wage growth. But despite consumers finding their purses a little lighter each month, the supermarkets continue to find ways to help shoppers adapt their spending rather than rein it in \u2013 encouraging them to trade nights out for nights in and switch brands for own label, for example. July\u2019s retail sales rose by 0.3% month-on-month according to the Office for National Statistics, above a Reuters consensus forecast of 0.2%. June\u2019s figures were revised down from 0.6% to 0.3%, a fairly sizeable revision. Shoppers tightened their belts on most things except food, which was up 1.5%. Ole Black, the ONS\u2019 top statistician calls it a \u201crelatively subdued picture\u201d, given that sales in all sectors but food declined. Here\u2019s a graph from the Office for National Statistics showing the sectoral breakdown. A quick update on President Donald Trump\u2019s increasingly fractious relationship with the US business community, which has seen him disband two business councils. Apple chief executive Tim Cook is the latest chief executive to voice his disapproval of Trump\u2019s lacklustre response to the far right\u2019s manoeuvres in Charlottesville, Virginia. Here are some excerpts from an email to staff, leaked to Buzzfeed, in which Cook was pulling no punches. I disagree with the president and others who believe that there is a moral equivalence between white supremacists and Nazis, and those who oppose them by standing up for human rights. Equating the two runs counter to our ideals as Americans. What occurred in Charlottesville has no place in our country. Hate is a cancer, and left unchecked it destroys everything in its path. He added that \u201cin the wake of the tragic and repulsive events in Charlottesville, we are stepping up to help organisations who work to rid our country of hate. He\u2019s putting his money where his mouth is too. Apple will make two $1m donations, one to the Southern Poverty Law Center and the other to the Anti-Defamation League. The tech giant will also double any donations that its staff make to those organisations and any other human rights groups until September 30. While we\u2019re waiting for UK retail sales to drop, here\u2019s a reminder of what looks likely to be one of the week\u2019s biggest business news stories, President Donald Trump\u2019s broadside at Amazon and growing friction with US captains of industry. With a single tweet, the President knocked $5bn off the Amazon share price. Amazon, of course, is run by Jeff Bezos, who also owns the Washington Post, never Trump\u2019s biggest cheerleader. You can tell that jobs are important to President Trump thanks to the capital letters and exclamation marks in the tweet immediately preceding the assault on Amazon. Trump\u2019s relationship with the US business world is looking fragile after he disbanded his business advisory council of chief executives, after many of them fled for the exit in the light of his response to the violence surrounding a far right rally in Charlottesville, Virginia. Let\u2019s have another look ahead to today\u2019s UK retail sales figures, due for release by the Office for National Statistics at 9.30am. The British shopper is a hardy soul, not likely to be deterred by global concerns such as the threat of nuclear war, the rise of the far right in the US, or the impending four-year absence of Big Ben\u2019s bongs. This resilience in the face of adversity is one reason why pundits expect a rise, albeit a modest one of 0.2%, in July retail sales. That\u2019s a slowdown on 0.6% in June but any increase is better than nothing. Here\u2019s one more comment from Michael Hewson at CMC Markets:- The squeeze on consumer incomes has been particularly apparent in this year\u2019s retail sales data which got off to a poor start in Q1, but did improve somewhat in Q2, with a decent rebound at the end of the quarter. As Q3 gets underway there is some optimism that the July numbers will also show an improvement, if last week\u2019s BRC retail sales numbers are any guide. They do tend to act as a leading indicator to the official numbers, and show a modest improvement last week, with today\u2019s retail sales numbers expected to show a rise of 0.2%, down from June\u2019s 0.6% The FTSE has been open nearly 10 minutes now and is down around 15 points at 7417, after Kingfisher reported a worse-than-expected second quarter performance for its DIY chain B&amp;Q. Here\u2019s Panmure Gordon\u2019s veteran City analyst David Buik with a brief glimpse at the numbers. And there was nothing to shout \u201cHouse\u201d about either at Mecca Bingo owner Rank Group, where full year pre-tax profit is down 7% to \u00a379.7m on revenues broadly flat at \u00a3707m. Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets, has been reading the runes regarding the ECB\u2019s plans, with one eye on the meeting of central bank minds at next week\u2019s Jackson Hole symposium. We saw a another decent day for European markets yesterday helped in no small part by a report citing European Central Bank sources that ECB President Mario Draghi would not be making any references to monetary policy at next week\u2019s Jackson Hole annual central bank symposium. This helped push the euro towards its lowest levels this month against the US dollar, while helping support European stocks. Speculation had been building that we might get an early steer on the ECB\u2019s intentions with respect to the slow winding down of the banks \u20ac60bn a month stimulus program. The report went on to say that any discussion would have to wait until the autumn, which suggests that we may well have to wait until the October meeting, before the ECB looks at showing its hand, on the timing of any tapering program. Stock markets in Europe have been on something of a winning streak of late but that looks like it might come to an end today. It\u2019s red ink across the board, according opening calls from the folks at IG. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. July retail sales due for release at 9.30am will give us an inkling of how the UK consumer is faring given the ongoing squeeze on household incomes, which persists despite inflation coming in lower than expected earlier this week. Eurozone inflation data is out half an hour later at 10am. Monetary policy on both sides of the Atlantic is also in focus, after minutes of the Federal Reserve came out last night indicating a divide over when to raise rates. European Central Bank minutes are due for release at 12.30pm today, with analysts watching out for some sign of the Bank\u2019s \u20ac60bn-a-month stimulus programme being unwound. In the City, there are are financial performance figures from casino and bingo firm Rank and Kingfisher, the group behind DIY brand B&amp;Q. On today\u2019s agenda: \u2022 9.30 BST: UK retail sales for July \u2022 10.00 BST: Eurozone inflation data \u2022 12.30 BST: European Central Bank minutes",

Asos still has a way to go to catch M&amp;S in terms of total sales and profit, however. Asos sales were \u00a31.4bn last year, compared with \u00a310.6bn at M&amp;S. Profits were \u00a342.8m and \u00a3176m respectively. Mike Lewis, the head of the property litigation team at SA Law, said the consumer shift towards online shopping was taking its toll on UK high streets. \u201cThe demise of BHS and the empty stores in places such as St Albans one year on, reflect that finding tenants for such sizeable units that the likes of M&amp;S occupy is not an easy exercise,\u201d he added.",

                "bodyText":"Markets have been in more upbeat mood this morning, boosted in part by some stronger-than-expected manufacturing data from China this morning. All of Europe\u2019s major markets are in firmly positive territory, and Wall Street has open higher. It is looking less rosy for the pound, which was unable to hold on above $1.29 after Michel Barnier, the EU\u2019s chief Brexit negotiator, raised fresh concerns about how talks are going. The pound is currently down 0.4% against the dollar at $1.2871. Over in France, supermarket group Carrefour issued a profits warning, prompting a heavy share sell-off. Shares are currently down 14%. Eurozone inflation picked up to 1.5% in August from 1.3% in July, while the jobless rate was unchanged at 9.1% (in July). In the UK, the big corporate news was that online gambling firm 888 was handed a record \u00a37.8m fine by the regulator for failing to protect vulnerable customers. Michael Saunders, a member of the Bank of England\u2019s Monetary Policy Committee, stepped up his argument for an immediate rise in UK interest rates. On that note we\u2019ll close up for the day. Thank you for all the comments and please join us again tomorrow. AM US markets have maintained the upbeat sentiment in European markets with Wall Street climbing higher in early trading: Dow Jones: +0.3% at 21,958 S&amp;P 500: +0.2% at 2,464 Nasdaq: +0.4% at 6,390 Over in the US, initial jobless claims have come in slightly below expectations. There were 236,000 new claims for jobless benefits in the week ending 26 August - 1,000 more than in than in the previous week - according to the US Labor Department figures. It was a little below the 237,000 forecast by economists. Tomorrow is the big day for US jobs data, with the closely watched non-farm payrolls report for August to be published at 13.30 (BST). Economists polled by Reuters are forecasting that 180,000 were added this month, following 209,000 in July. Shilen Shah, bond strategist at Investec Wealth &amp; Investment, says Barnier\u2019s comments have longer term implications for UK assets: The risk of no transitionary agreement seems to have increased today given the strong word\u2019s from Barnier, the EU chief Brexit negotiator. His not unexpected comments has led to a modest weakening in sterling, however it also increases the chance of the UK exiting the EU in a disorderly fashion. The key hazard for markets is that today\u2019s disagreement is an indicator of where future negotiations are heading, with the danger that the risk-premium on UK assets will widen if the talks implode with no agreement. Andrew Sentance, a former member of the Bank of England\u2019s Monetary Policy Committee is feeling the effects of the weaker pound today: Here is our full story on the latest round of Brexit talks: The pound\u2019s losses have widened against the dollar and it is now down 0.5% at $1.2856. Sterling has been knocked further since Michel Barnier, the EU\u2019s chief Brexit negotiator, said that no \u201cdecisive progress\u201d had been achieved after the third round of talks in Brussels. He told a news conference: Over the course of this week we have made a number of useful clarifications on a number of points, for instance the status of border workers. However, we did not get any decisive progress on any of the principle subjects, even though on the discussion we had about Ireland - that discussion was fruitful. European markets have extended gains this afternoon. Here are the latest scores: FTSE 100: +0.7% at 7,414 Germany\u2019s DAX: +0.6% at 12,074 France\u2019s CAC: +0.7% at 5,092 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB: +1% at 21,717 Spain\u2019s IBEX: +0.8% at 10,327 Europe\u2019s STOXX 600: +0.8% at 374 German data this morning showed that the number of people out of work in Europe\u2019s largest economy fell by 5,000 in August to 2.53m. It disappointed expectations, with economists forecasting a bigger fall of 6,000. Rainer Sartoris, economist at HSBC, said the fall in German unemployment was slowing: The slowdown in the pace of falling unemployment is likely linked to more and more refugees starting to search for a job, as they exit training courses (e.g. language courses). This trend is likely to continue over the coming quarters, which could constrain a further improvement in the number of unemployed. Over in Greece, tourism is helping to boost economic sentiment according to the eurozone\u2019s statistics agency, Eurostat. It comes as the country prepares to further ease capital controls. Helena Smith reports from Athens: Reaping the dividends of a bumper tourism season, Greece saw its economic sentiment indicator rise to 99 points this month from 98.2 points in July. While the index is still in negative territory - optimism is only measured at 100 points - it was the strongest in 12 months and is being interpreted as another turning point for the eurozone\u2019s weakest economy. In another sign of growing confidence in the Greek economy, the leftist-led government is to allow bank depositors to withdraw more of their savings as of tomorrow (September 1st). The move will see the cap on withdrawals being increased by 7% to \u20ac1,800 a month. As part of the relaxation, opening of new accounts will be facilitated for farmers, companies and freelancers. The restrictive measures were imposed at the height of the country\u2019s debt crisis in the summer of 2015 amid fears of a run on banks. However, it has not been lost on many that total annual withdrawals will actually amount to less. Under the new \u201crelaxed\u201d rules, depositors will be able to withdraw \u20ac21,600 euro a year, compared with \u20ac21,840 under the old rules. French supermarket group Carrefour has suffered a heavy share sell-off this morning after a profit warning from the retailer spooked investors. Shares are currently down nearly 15%, putting the company on track for its biggest daily fall in 20 years. Carrefour reported weaker-than-expected first-half results and warned that full-year profits could fall by 12%. The retailer\u2019s new chief executive, Alexandre Bompard, had this to say: Our 2017 results will be impacted by our first-half performance and an operating environment that will remain difficult in the second half in some countries. The negative news from Carrefour spread throughout the supermarket sector, making UK grocers among the biggest fallers on the FTSE 100: Tesco is down 1.3% at 180p Morrisons is down 0.7% at 244p Sainsbury\u2019s is down 0.6% at 234p The retail index has been among the worst performers in Europe this year as competition and structural pressures mount. Paul Harper, equity analyst at DNB Bank, says its partly down to Amazon: It\u2019s been a tough time for the sector, with the more macro theme that Amazon is slowly eating everyone\u2019s lunch, though that\u2019s not the case in Europe to the same extent as the US. Another problem is that the retail sector is relatively highly priced, so there\u2019s not really much room for disappointment. Peter Vanden Houte, chief economist for the eurozone at ING, said higher-than-expected inflation in the region would give ammunition to those members of the European Central Bank\u2019s governing council who favour tighter policy. He is not convinced, however: The hawks within the governing council will argue that deflationary pressures have now clearly disappeared. But given the risk that an overshoot of the euro exchange rate could push inflation back below 1.5%, caution remains warranted in removing monetary policy accommodation. We believe that the ECB will announce a \u201cdovish tapering\u201d in October, giving the markets the impression that quantitative easing could be lengthened into the second half of next year, if need be. At the same time we think that a deposit rate hike is not to be expected before the end of 2018. Unemployment in the single currency bloc was unchanged in July at 9.1% - the lowest since February 2009. It compared with a jobless rate of 7.7% in the wider EU. The number of unemployed people in the eurozone rose by 73,000 in July, to 14.86m, according to the Eurostat figures. Here is how it looks across the European Union: Eurozone inflation rose to 1.5% in August, from 1.3% in July, according to a \u201cflash estimate\u201d from Eurostat. It was higher than the 1.4% rate forecast by economists, and the main driver of the rise was energy, with prices up 4% year-on-year. Here is the breakdown: Core inflation - which strips out food and energy - was unchanged at 1.3% in August. Economists predicted a slight dip to 1.2%. The pound has slipped below $1.29, and is currently down 0.2% at $1.2896. Thu Lan Nguyen, a currency strategist at Commerzbank, says concerns about the way Brexit talks are going are weighing on the pound: Brexit uncertainty continues to weigh on sterling, and if there is a protracted spell of weakness then policymakers may come out to support the currency as it pushes up headline inflation. Against the euro, the pound is down 0.4% at \u20ac1.0832. The top FTSE 100 risers this morning are dominated by mining companies, which tend to benefit from data that signals strong demand from China. All major European markets are up this morning, boosted by stronger-than-expected manufacturing growth in China, positive US data, and easing tension over North Korea. Here are the latest scores: FTSE 100: +0.5% at 7,400 Germany\u2019s DAX: +0.5% at 12,064 France\u2019s CAC: +0.3% at 5,072 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB: +0.4% at 21,581 Spain\u2019s IBEX: +0.6% at 10,305 Europe\u2019s STOXX 600: +0.4% at 372 Here is our full story on the speech by Michael Saunders, Bank of England policymaker, in Cardiff: Michael Saunders\u2019 latest call for a rise in rates has failed to lift the pound this morning. Sterling is down 0.2% against the dollar but is still holding on above $1.29 at $1.2902. Saunders\u2019 comments will come as a surprise to few, after his vote for a hike at the last two meetings, but the exchange rate is also reflective of dollar strength. Stronger-than-expected US data on Wednesday has raised investor expectations that the Federal Reserve will raise rates again before the end of the year, sending the dollar broadly higher. The pound meanwhile is also down -0.2% against the euro this morning, at \u20ac1.0850. Michael Saunders, a member of the Bank of England\u2019s Monetary Policy Committee, has stepped up his argument that the UK needs an immediate rise in interest rates. Predicting that inflation would hit 3% in the coming months (well above the Bank\u2019s 2%) target, Saunders told an audience in Cardiff: Our foot no longer needs to be quite so firmly on the accelerator in my view. A modest rise in rates would help ensure a sustainable return of inflation to target over time. He said that raising rates now would allow a more gradual pace of hikes, making it easier for people to adjust to higher borrowing rates. There are considerable advantages to acting early enough to allow a gradual rise in interest rates. It is fully 10 years since the MPC last tightened monetary policy. Many borrowers have never faced a rate hike. It would be preferable to have the space to move gradually, observing the effects as we go. If we get behind the curve, we lose that space. Saunders has voted for a 0.25 point rise in rates \u2013 from a current all-time low of 0.25% - at the last two meetings of the MPC. He has yet to convince the majority of his colleagues, with only one other MPC member - Ian McCafferty - joining him in the vote for a rise. In response to the Gambling Commission\u2019s fine, 888 said: It was never 888\u2019s intention to benefit financially from this technical failure and we have completed a detailed process to identify all affected customers. The group is refunding customers who were able to continue playing when they should have been excluded across 888\u2019s platforms. The Gambling Commission said 888\u2019s record \u00a37.8m fine for failing to protect thousands of vulnerable customers will be divided in the following way: a \u00a33.5m repayment of deposits made by self excluded customers (whose accounts were left accessible) a \u00a362,000 compensation payment to the employer from whom money was stolen by a problem gambler (that 888 failed to spot/stop) a further \u00a34.25m will be paid to a socially responsible cause to invest in measures to tackle gambling-related harm Sarah Harrison, chief executive at the Gambling Commission: Safeguarding consumers is not optional. This penalty package of just under \u00a38m reflects the seriousness of 888\u2019s failings to protect vulnerable customers. The 888 sanction package will ensure those affected don\u2019t lose out, that the operator pays the price for its failings via a sum that will go to tackling gambling-related harm, and that independent assurance will be given to see that lessons are learnt.\u201d 888, one of Britain\u2019s biggest online gambling firms, has been fined a record \u00a37.8m by the regulator for failing to protect thousands of vulnerable customers. An investigation by the Gambling Commission found that over 7,000 customers who had chosen to \u201cself exclude\u201d (people who flag that they wish to stop gambling for at least six months) were still able to access their 888 accounts due to a technical failure. It meant that vulnerable customers were able to deposit \u00a33.5m into their accounts, and then continue to gamble, for over 13 months. 888 also failed to spot \u201cvisible signs\u201d of problem behaviour from one individual, which was so significant it resulted in criminal activity, the watchdog said. That particular customer staked over \u00a31.3m, including \u00a355,000 stolen from their employer. During a 13 month period the customer gambled on average 3-4 hours a day. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the latest news from the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Growth in China\u2019s manufacturing sector accelerated unexpectedly in August, reassuring global investors that the world\u2019s second largest economy is still growing at a decent pace. China\u2019s official manufacturing PMI index rose to 51.7 in August from 51.4 in July, confounding economists\u2019 expectations for a small decline. (Anything above 50 signals growth.) Along with stronger Q2 growth and jobs figures from the US on Wednesday, the Chinese PMI figures are expected to lift investor sentiment after a torrid week of heightened tensions over North Korea. Markets on both sides of the Atlantic rose on Wednesday \u2013 largely because of a relatively measured response from President Trump - and European markets are expected to open higher this morning: Also coming up today: 08.25 BST Speech by Michael Saunders, member of the Bank of England\u2019s Monetary Policy Committee 08.45 BST German unemployment (August) 10.00 BST Eurozone \u2018flash estimate of inflation (August) 13.30 BST US weekly jobless claims",
