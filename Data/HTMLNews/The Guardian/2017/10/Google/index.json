We need a more flexible approach, accommodating the more diverse patterns of life and work of the 21st century.</p> <p>In this context, the idea of a universal basic income set at a level comparable to the age pension has considerable appeal. The ultimate goal would be to provide an unconditional payment lower than the return from working but sufficient to sustain decent living standards. An interim step, proposed by the late Tony Atkinson in his final book, Inequality: What Can Be Done?, would be a <a href=\"http://www.involve.org.uk/2015/06/12/what-about-a-participation-income/\">participation income</a> available to people who undertook voluntary work to benefit the community. <em></em></p> <p>The combination of a job guarantee and a universal basic income would free workers from dependence on employers.

This phrase refers to an economy with major roles for both public and market provision of goods and services. Typically, the public sector provided infrastructure such as electricity, water and road networks, and human services such as health and education. Most of our existing assets in these fields were built up under public ownership. The market sector provided consumer goods, and the wholesale and retail trade networks needed to distribute them, along with a wide range of services.</p> <p>The push for privatisation, beginning with the Thatcher government in the 80s, was based on the premise that private ownership and market competition would outperform public-sector provision.

In essence, public monopolies have been replaced by regulated private monopolies and oligopolies. Investors and top managers have done well out of this process, while workers and consumers have lost.</p> <p>The public has long since lost faith in the promise of privatisation and is in fact supportive of <a href=\"https://yougov.co.uk/news/2017/05/19/nationalisation-vs-privatisation-public-view/\">re-nationalisation</a>. Yet, as with the labour market, we can\u2019t simply revive the mid-20th century economy.</p> <p>First, technological change has radically changed the structure of the economy and society. The central role in the industrial economy of the mid-20th century was played by manufacturing, which took the resources produced by mining and agriculture and transformed them into goods to be distributed through transport, wholesale and retail trade systems to consumers. </p> <p>By contrast, the 21st century economy is dominated by services including health, education and telecommunications, which require different forms of economic organisation.</p> <p>Second, the mid-20th century was a period when economic activity (work for governments or businesses, undertaken for pay or profit in factories, shops and offices) was sharply distinguished from non-economic activity (housework, voluntary activity and non-government organisations). </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>In the aftermath of neoliberal failure, some utopian vision is what is needed</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>These sharp distinctions are no longer tenable. Thanks to mobile phones and the internet, much paid work is done at home. More importantly, the economic value of the internet as a whole depends entirely on its content, much of which (Facebook and blog posts, Twitter, personal and group websites and so on) is produced by users rather than for economic return.</p> <p>To reimagine a 21st century socialist economy we need to consider a much broader mix of forms of economic activity than those of the 20th century mixed economy. These include:<br></p> <ul> <li>big business <br></li> <li>small business<br></li> <li>government businesses<br></li> <li>public non-market provision<br></li> <li>not-for profits and NGOs <br></li> <li>household production<br></li> </ul> <p>Under financial capitalism, the standard way of providing goods and services is through big business: large corporations, with an associated network of subsidiaries and dependent contractors. Big business has grown at the expense of the public sector through privatisation and at the expense of independent small businesses through increased market concentration. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"cc1bdb3bc66e8e8cbe28681bfa1cbc28b7467293\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cc1bdb3bc66e8e8cbe28681bfa1cbc28b7467293/0_0_4928_3280/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Supporters of Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders attend a campaign rally in Los Angeles, California in 2016.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"666\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Supporters of Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders attend a campaign rally in Los Angeles, California in 2016.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Robyn Beck/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>At the same time, labour market reforms have reduced the bargaining power of workers and increased that of employers.

Large-scale capital intensive activities with limited scope for competition, such as the provision of infrastructure, would be returned to public ownership. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/sep/08/something-big-has-to-change-could-australia-afford-a-universal-basic-income\">'Something big has to change': could Australia afford a universal basic income?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>We are already seeing the beginnings of this process, with a notable example in the South Australian government\u2019s investment in electricity generation.

This is a nonsensical idea, but it illustrates the extent to which the taboo on government intervention has lost its power.</p> <p>Similarly, we are seeing some attempts to reconstruct the public Tafe system<em><strong> </strong></em>after the fiasco of for-profit vocational training and the Fee-Help system. <a href=\"http://www.premier.vic.gov.au/students-finally-return-to-lilydale-tafe-site/\">The Victorian government in particular </a>has taken some positive steps. </p> <p>A socialist program in the 21st century needs to involve much more than a reversal of neoliberalism. The internet and the information economy have broken the link between productive activity and market returns.

On the other hand, the market value of internet activity depends, almost entirely, on the ease with which it can be packaged up with commercial advertising \u2013 meaning access is artificially constrained.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/jul/03/stop-exploiting-people-cut-unemployment-job-guarantee-underwritten\">What if we could stop exploiting people and cut unemployment at a stroke? | Phil McDuff</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The fact that information is naturally a public good creates a huge potential for economic and social benefits of which we have realised only a small fraction. The combination of strong intellectual property laws and reliance on advertising to finance internet content mean that our access to information is artificially constrained. Governments could address this problem, providing vastly increased access to resources of all kinds, from artistic and cultural content to designs to be used in 3-D printers. </p> <p>But the policies of neoliberal austerity have pushed us in the opposite direction, cutting budgets and pushing public institutions of all kinds towards more reliance on user pricing and advertising.</p> <p>There is also much more room for voluntary and non-government activity. The neoliberal state, through contracting, competitive tendering and the audit culture, has sought to turn voluntary work and non-government organisations into low-cost providers of government services. In the process, much of the creative potential of civil society has been lost. Expanding the scope for voluntary social initiatives would fit naturally with a socialist program, and this is already beginning with the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/social-enterprise-network/2013/apr/29/social-enterprise-job-creation\">rise of social enterprises.</a> <em></em></p> <p>The idea of a socialist economy with unconditional access to basic incomes and greatly expanded provision of free services might seem utopian. But in the aftermath of neoliberal failure, utopian vision is what is needed. To re-engage people with democratic politics, we need to move beyond culture wars and arguments over marginal adjustments to tax rates and budget allocations, necessary as these may be in the short term. </p> <p>Socialists have always seen short-term political struggles as part of a long-term project of transforming society for the better. It is this fact which explains why conservatives have always used the term \u201csocialist\u201d as a bogeyman. It\u2019s also why the term has retained its appeal through decades of neoliberal retrenchment. Social democratic and liberal parties, compromised by their acquiescence in, or embrace of, neoliberalism, need to make a decisive break with the recent past. An explicit embrace of socialism would make that break clear.<br></p>",

After decades in which the focus has been on critiquing neoliberalism, the task of thinking about positive alternatives is urgent, but efforts in this direction are only just beginning. Discussion of economic policy in socialist terms is confined to a handful of small publications, such as Jacobin, a US magazine edited by Bhaskar Sunkara, with notable contributors including Seth Ackerman, Peter Frase and Noam Chomsky. Equally significant has been the resurgence of the left in mainstream economics, represented by Paul Krugman, Thomas Piketty and Joseph Stiglitz. While not explicitly socialist (Krugman\u2019s blog is called The Conscience of a Liberal) these economists have focused attention on issues of inequality and unemployment, and on progressive policy responses. These are, however, only first steps. To develop a serious socialist alternative, we need both to look backwards to the social democratic moment of the 50s and 60s, and forwards to the prospects for a genuine sharing economy based on the internet and other technological advances. The middle of the 20th century was a unique period of sustained economic growth and broadly shared prosperity in developed market economies. The crucial feature underpinning this success was full employment, guaranteed by Keynesian macroeconomic management. In an economy with full employment, workers are no longer dependent on the goodwill of individual employers or the confidence of business as a whole.

Conversely, as we\u2019ve seen since the 70s, when governments are driven by the need to please financial markets, ever-growing inequality is the inevitable result. The most striking evidence is the rising share of income going to the top 1%, as documented by Piketty and others. The success of Keynesian stimulus in the immediate aftermath of the GFC and the disastrous outcomes from the shift to austerity after 2010 show that Keynesian economic management is as vital as ever. Going beyond crisis management, socialist governments would reinstate the commitment to full employment, and solidify it through policies such as a jobs guarantee, ensuring the availability of a full-time job for anyone who has been unemployed for some minimum period. However, the technological and social changes that have taken place over the past 60 years mean that the traditional notion of full employment, focused on full-time jobs for male breadwinners, is no longer adequate. We need a more flexible approach, accommodating the more diverse patterns of life and work of the 21st century. In this context, the idea of a universal basic income set at a level comparable to the age pension has considerable appeal. The ultimate goal would be to provide an unconditional payment lower than the return from working but sufficient to sustain decent living standards. An interim step, proposed by the late Tony Atkinson in his final book, Inequality: What Can Be Done?, would be a participation income available to people who undertook voluntary work to benefit the community.

The central role in the industrial economy of the mid-20th century was played by manufacturing, which took the resources produced by mining and agriculture and transformed them into goods to be distributed through transport, wholesale and retail trade systems to consumers. By contrast, the 21st century economy is dominated by services including health, education and telecommunications, which require different forms of economic organisation. Second, the mid-20th century was a period when economic activity (work for governments or businesses, undertaken for pay or profit in factories, shops and offices) was sharply distinguished from non-economic activity (housework, voluntary activity and non-government organisations). These sharp distinctions are no longer tenable. Thanks to mobile phones and the internet, much paid work is done at home. More importantly, the economic value of the internet as a whole depends entirely on its content, much of which (Facebook and blog posts, Twitter, personal and group websites and so on) is produced by users rather than for economic return. To reimagine a 21st century socialist economy we need to consider a much broader mix of forms of economic activity than those of the 20th century mixed economy. These include: big business small business government businesses public non-market provision not-for profits and NGOs household production Under financial capitalism, the standard way of providing goods and services is through big business: large corporations, with an associated network of subsidiaries and dependent contractors. Big business has grown at the expense of the public sector through privatisation and at the expense of independent small businesses through increased market concentration. At the same time, labour market reforms have reduced the bargaining power of workers and increased that of employers. The combined effects have included increasingly concentrated wealth and power, wage stagnation and slow economic growth. Even the OECD has recognised this. A socialist program would allocate much less economic activity to big business, and more to other forms of organisation. In deciding what kind of economic activity belongs where, a range of considerations are relevant. These include the scale of the activity, the extent to which it is possible and appropriate to charge market prices, the scope for competition and the relative importance of economic and non-economic motives. In part this would imply reversing the neoliberal program of privatisation and marketisation. Large-scale capital intensive activities with limited scope for competition, such as the provision of infrastructure, would be returned to public ownership. We are already seeing the beginnings of this process, with a notable example in the South Australian government\u2019s investment in electricity generation. The Turnbull government denounced South Australia\u2019s policies as those of a \u201csocialist paradise\u201d, sure to lead to economic disaster. In very short order, however, Turnbull was announcing his own interventions, with the expansion of Snowy Hydro and restrictions on gas exports. We have even seen the suggestion that the commonwealthmight buy the Liddell power station (recently privatised by its state counterparts) to extend its operating life. This is a nonsensical idea, but it illustrates the extent to which the taboo on government intervention has lost its power. Similarly, we are seeing some attempts to reconstruct the public Tafe system after the fiasco of for-profit vocational training and the Fee-Help system. The Victorian government in particular has taken some positive steps. A socialist program in the 21st century needs to involve much more than a reversal of neoliberalism. The internet and the information economy have broken the link between productive activity and market returns. Information is a pure public good, which can be shared again and again with no additional costs. So the production of information (ranging from scientific research to Instagram pictures) has potentially huge social value. On the other hand, the market value of internet activity depends, almost entirely, on the ease with which it can be packaged up with commercial advertising \u2013 meaning access is artificially constrained. The fact that information is naturally a public good creates a huge potential for economic and social benefits of which we have realised only a small fraction. The combination of strong intellectual property laws and reliance on advertising to finance internet content mean that our access to information is artificially constrained. Governments could address this problem, providing vastly increased access to resources of all kinds, from artistic and cultural content to designs to be used in 3-D printers. But the policies of neoliberal austerity have pushed us in the opposite direction, cutting budgets and pushing public institutions of all kinds towards more reliance on user pricing and advertising. There is also much more room for voluntary and non-government activity. The neoliberal state, through contracting, competitive tendering and the audit culture, has sought to turn voluntary work and non-government organisations into low-cost providers of government services. In the process, much of the creative potential of civil society has been lost. Expanding the scope for voluntary social initiatives would fit naturally with a socialist program, and this is already beginning with the rise of social enterprises. The idea of a socialist economy with unconditional access to basic incomes and greatly expanded provision of free services might seem utopian. But in the aftermath of neoliberal failure, utopian vision is what is needed. To re-engage people with democratic politics, we need to move beyond culture wars and arguments over marginal adjustments to tax rates and budget allocations, necessary as these may be in the short term. Socialists have always seen short-term political struggles as part of a long-term project of transforming society for the better. It is this fact which explains why conservatives have always used the term \u201csocialist\u201d as a bogeyman. It\u2019s also why the term has retained its appeal through decades of neoliberal retrenchment. Social democratic and liberal parties, compromised by their acquiescence in, or embrace of, neoliberalism, need to make a decisive break with the recent past. An explicit embrace of socialism would make that break clear.",

For these Britons, cash is not a hoardable unit of insurance but a day-to-day necessity that vanishes like water. Victoria Cleland, the Bank of England\u2019s chief cashier, whose signature adorns newly-printed banknotes, said: \u201cIt tends to be that people who are less well-off will use cash as a budgeting technique. If you were in a situation where you saw more people were struggling, you would expect to see a higher demand for cash.\u201d But back to the bigger picture. Cash usage in general is falling because of the rise in technology, such as contactless payment methods. The proportion of payments using physical currency has declined from 62% of all transactions in 2006, to about 40% last year, with a further fall to about 21% expected by 2026. Carl Packman, research manager at the poverty charity Toynbee Hall, said: \u201cIn the rush towards better digital payments it would be an error to reduce access to cash. Cash is a great leveller: regardless of age and income demographics, keeping cash is a way of taking visual control of money and avoiding unwanted situations like problem debt.\u201d Part of Threadneedle Street\u2019s reasoning for replacing the three decade-old pound coin was to counter fraud, with as many as one in 30 of the coins thought to be a fake. The new 12-sided coin, which resembles the old threepenny bit and first entered circulation in March, has high-tech features to thwart counterfeiters. Suitcases full of banknotes conjure images of organised crime for good reason. The Bank found in 2015 that at least half of all UK banknotes were either held abroad or being used for illicit purposes \u2013 from drug dealing to prostitution and dodgy business deals. The study followed earlier research which showed at least 11% of UK banknotes in general circulation are contaminated with cocaine. Peter Sands, the former boss of the Asia-focused UK bank, Standard Chartered, suggests scrapping the highest denomination notes because they are more likely to be used in crime. The European Central Bank is removing the \u20ac500 note, which is nicknamed the \u201cBin Laden\u201d due to its association with money laundering and terror financing. Wads of shredded \u20ac500 notes were discovered stuffed down the sewer system of a branch of Swiss bank UBS. The links between notes and crime are forcing central banks to raise their game. The Bank of England is fighting financial crime with polymer notes, which it expects will be harder to counterfeit. The new \u00a310, featuring a portrait of Jane Austen, was launched last month, following the introduction of the \u00a35 featuring Winston Churchill earlier this year. The Bank plans to launch a \u00a320 featuring the artist JMW Turner in 2020, while it has yet to decide whether to introduce a new \u00a350 polymer note. And if British cash is not being hidden away in houses, it is being kept away from the taxman. Paying a gardener, window cleaner or childminder in cash could be depriving the British tax system of as much as \u00a36.2bn, according to official figures on the country\u2019s \u201chidden economy\u201d \u2013 which encompasses people carrying on business without telling HM Revenue and Customs. It\u2019s the biggest behavioural aspect behind unpaid taxes, which total as much as \u00a336bn, or 6.5% of theoretical total tax liabilities. Attempts to tackle the problem elsewhere have not impressed. India scrapped some higher denomination bills overnight last year, to try to catch criminals and tax evaders off guard. The move is thought to have damaged GDP growth, while underlining how some financial practices are so hard-wired into an economy that trying to remove them immediately can cause harm. It is possible that signs of overheating in the UK economy \u2013 record low unemployment and rising inflation \u2013 could deliver the answer instead by triggering an increase in Britain\u2019s anaemic borrowing costs. The record low interest rate of 0.25% means savers are offered lousy rewards by high street banks for depositing money in accounts. The average monthly interest paid on an instant access account including bonuses was 0.14% in September. Having sounded warnings in recent months that the economy might be due a rate increase, Threadneedle Street may increase the cost of borrowing for the first time in a decade from as early as November. Cleland estimates a 1% increase in rates would reduce cash demand by 2%, with the clearest effects seen by the \u00a320 and \u00a350 notes. \u201cIf you saw a significant change, that might alter behaviour and you think about the benefits of having money under the bed rather than in the bank,\u201d she said. Alternatives to cash While cash represented 40% of all payments made in Britain last year, its usage is expected to decline to 21% of all transactions by 2026. Beyond increasing use of debit cards and contactless payments, there are plenty of other ways to pay: BITCOIN Rising from obscurity but increasingly mainstream, bitcoin is the first and the biggest \u201ccryptocurrency\u201d \u2013 a tradable asset that allows people to bypass banks and traditional payment processes to pay for goods and services. Unlike currencies controlled by governments and central banks, bitcoins are created by its network of users by \u201cmining\u201d new bitcoins. Miners use vast computing power to solve maths problems, and are given new bitcoins as a reward. Regulators and banks are growing concerned about this new money: the City watchdog has warned investors in new cryptocurrencies should be prepared to lose all their money; the boss of JP Morgan, the biggest bank in the US, say he would fire any trader working for the bank who invests in bitcoin; Vladimir Putin has also warned they need regulating. They pose huge problems for tracing transactions and collecting taxes and are regularly associated with money laundering and online crime because transactions take place anonymously. The currency is also volatile, having recently soared to more than $5,800 before dipping back to $5,600 on the same day. But it is growing in popularity. A London property company says it will take residential rents paid in bitcoin by the end of this year \u2013 and another property developer says they will accept them in payment for apartments in Dubai. ETHEREUM The second-largest cryptocurrency behind bitcoin, ethereum is also a peer-to-peer software platform used for the development of computer applications and transfer of contracts. Both bitcoin and ethereum are built using blockchain technology. This is a type of decentralised digital ledger of encoded information, which exists on a network and cannot be controlled by one of the machines plugged into it alone. DIGITAL WALLET The rise of online shopping has led to the development of digital wallets, which are online places to park money outside the traditional banking system. Paypal was an early version of this type of tool, most popularly used in conjunction with shopping on eBay. However, digital wallets can be used for spending elsewhere \u2013 online and offline. APPLE PAY AND ANDROID PAY Apple and Google both operate contactless payment systems via their smartphones. They are in effect digital wallets, allowing consumers to connect their traditional bank accounts to the payment system. While both allow consumers to make contactless payments using their mobile phones, they also enable payments online. TOTNES POUND A far more basic idea: the Devonshire town of Totnes, together with several other places in Britain such as Bristol and Brixton, has introduced local currencies. Part of the Transition Town movement, the currency is designed to keep money within the local economy for the benefit of the local community, small businesses and customers. The theory is that sterling and other major currencies can be easily withdrawn from one place and used or hoarded elsewhere, which can be potentially damaging to a local economy. Community currencies aim to foster greater links between producers and users, encouraging local development and cutting down on pollution caused by the transportation of goods from elsewhere. M-PESA Launched by Vodafone\u2019s Kenyan associate, Safaricom, in March 2007, M-Pesa is a mobile phone-based money transfer system. It is hugely successful in Kenya and growing fast in other countries \u2013 including Afghanistan, Egypt, Albania and Tanzania -where access to traditional banking services can be limited. The service, now live in 10 countries, enables users to deposit money into an account stored on a mobile phone, as well as to send money to others and make payments and withdrawals. It also cuts street crime and corruption.",

                "bodyText":"And finally, European stock markets have closed higher - but Spain has bucked the trend as the Catalan crisis escalates further. Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 closed 18 points higher at 7505, while the French CAC and German DAX both gained around 0.7%. Consumer-focused companies did well, as did oil firms following the jump in Brent crude to a two-year high. America\u2019s solid growth report reassured investors that the global economy is in decent shape. But, Spain\u2019s IBEX closed down 1%, as traders are spooked by this afternoon\u2019s declaration of independence by MPs in Catalonia - which is likely to lead to Madrid imposing direct rule. David Madden of CMC Markets says: The political outlook is very uncertainty, and investors are getting more nervous by the minute. Investors will be reluctant to hold Spanish stocks over the weekend, for fear we could see a repeat of the violence that took place on the referendum day. Over on Wall Street, though, the Nasdaq continues to hit new highs. Here\u2019s a reminder of why, from CMC Markets: Alphabet revealed a 24% jump in third quarter profits to $27.8 billion and earnings per share (EPS) jumped by 5.6% to $9.57, easily exceeding the $8.33 analysts were expecting. The core advertising business and the other operations are performing well, but investors are as bit concerned about the rising costs. Cost per click fell by 18% and traffic acquisition costs exceeded dealer\u2019s forecasts. Alphabet is still pouring more money and resources into its cloud division, and this is an area that has huge growth potential. The tock is up over 5% today. Amazon registered a 34% jump in revenue to $43.7 billion and that compared with the forecast of $42.14. The EPS came in at 52 cents, which smashed the estimate of 3 cents. Amazon saw sales in North America jump by 35%, the rest of the world saw sales rise by 29%. Amazon Web Services (AWS) posted a 42% jump in sales \u2013 it is the most profitable division in the company. Amazon is expanding in the cloud commuting, and it is proving to be successful. The share price has gained 11% today. And, that\u2019s probably all for today. Thanks for reading and commenting. GW This is a great fact: By my reckoning, Amazon is now valued at around $546bn, Microsoft is worth $650bn and Alphabet has a market capitalisation of some $723bn. Amazon\u2019s share price has now surged by 11%, raising the chances that Jeff Bezos will overtake Bill Gates and become the world\u2019s richest person. Align Technology, the dental equipment firm, is keeping Amazon off the top spot, though, after posting its own record results yesterday. Here\u2019s a chart showing the rise, and fall, and rise again of the technology-focused Nasdaq over the last two decades: This rally in the oil price will cheer the Opec cartel, who have been restricting production in an attempt to push prices higher. But...it may also persuade rival producers, such as America\u2019s shale industry, to increase their own output. It is also likely to push inflation up globally, once it pushes up fuel and energy prices. Boom! Brent crude has pushed over $60 per barrel for the first time since July 2015. Anyone who bought tech stocks at the depths of the last recession, in 2009, is sitting on some massive profits: Over in Greece prime minister Alexis Tsipras has attempted to quash heated speculation the his government is about to cut a \u20ac2.4bn deal with the Washington to upgrade its F16 fighter planes. Helena Smith reports from Athens Addressing parliament the leftist leader insisted that no agreement had as yet been reached, saying \u201cit is still under negotiation.\u201d Far from being a \u20ac2.4bn deal the government had a \u201cceiling of \u20ac1.1bn\u201d Tsipras insisted. The Greek prime minister has come under fierce attack for the deal initially announced by U.S president Donald Trump during Oval Office talks last week. Senior members of Tsipras\u2019 own Syria part have deplored the deal, calling it outrageous that so much should be spent on a military agreement when the debt stricken country could ill afford ambulances and basic equipment in schools because of budget restraints. Trump had said the \u20ac2.4bn deal would be a job creator in the United States. Tsipras himself recently checked out Greece\u2019s air capabilities, when flew in an F16 fighter during a visit to the military airport of Larissa earlier this month... Here\u2019s some more expert reaction to the news that the US economy grew faster than expected in the last quarter: Neil Birrell, Chief Investment Officer at Premier Asset Management: \u201cThe US GDP data released today shows that the economy is stronger than expected. It grew at 3% in the third quarter against consensus expectations of 2.6%. The hurricanes made consumer spending hard to predict but overall they do not seem to have had a negative impact on growth. Inflationary pressures also look higher than expected, but the rate is still well below the Fed\u2019s target. This news is positive for the Dollar and expectations for an interest rate increase will be on the up as well. Overall, the US economy is performing well.\u201d Charlie Bilello of Pension Partners points out that the current recovery has been slower than previous expansions, although it\u2019s also lasted a long time.... Nancy Curtin, chief investment officer at Close Brothers Asset Management, says the US has shrugged off the devastation of the hurricane season. \u201cIn spite of the obstacles thrown in its path by two devastating hurricanes, the US economy is flying at a fair clip. We may even see this accelerate in the last part of the year as economic activity that was hit by hurricanes Harvey and Irma recovers, and in the longer-term, we should see infrastructure investment in the areas most heavily affected. The Nasdaq index of tech stocks has jumped by 1.8% in early trading, to a new all-time high. Amazon, Microsoft, Alphabet (Google\u2019s parent company) and Intel are all among the top risers. BREAKING: Tech stocks are rallying hard on Wall Street. Amazon\u2019s shares have spiked by over 8% at the start of trading in New York, following last night\u2019s impressive financial results. That takes them back over the $1,000 mark. Investors are impressed that Amazon achieved earnings of 52 cents a share, way ahead of forecasts of 3 cents a share. Alphabet has also opened strongly, gaining almost 5%, after it also beat revenue and earnings forecasts. Traders are also driving Microsoft and Intel\u2019s shares higher Daniel Ives, head of technology research at GBH Insights, explains why Wall Street is so impressed: \u201cWe would characterize last night\u2019s Amazon September results as a \u2018Picasso-like quarter\u2019 with the company handily beating all metrics across the board,\u201d \u201cLast night\u2019s quarter ... is another feather in Bezos\u2019 cap.\u201d Back in Europe, Spanish government bonds are being sold off after the Catalan parliament voted to declare independence. Madrid\u2019s stock market is also suffering, with the IBEX index of leading shares plunging by 2% as the crisis in the region escalates further. My colleagues Sam Jones and Stephen Burgen report from Barcelona: The Catalan parliament has voted to establish an independent republic in defiance of the Spanish government, which is expected to fire the region\u2019s president and impose direct rule within the next few hours. On Friday afternoon, Catalan MPs voted for independence by a margin of 70 votes to 10. Two ballot papers were blank. The proposal, brought by the region\u2019s ruling Together for Yes coalition and their far-left allies the CUP party, was bitterly attacked by oppostion MPs who boycotted he vote.... Donald Trump will surely be pleased by today\u2019s GDP report, as it shows America\u2019s economy has grown at a healthy rate on his watch. But....how long will it last? Capital Economics predicts that GDP will accelerate next year, if the US president delivers on his tax and spending plans. But it could then slow sharply in 2019. Paul Ashworth, their chief US economist, explains: GDP growth for 2017 as a whole is currently tracking at around 2.1% and, assuming we see a modest fiscal stimulus in early 2018, we expect GDP growth to accelerate to 2.5% next year, even after allowing for a more aggressive pace of monetary tightening. As the stimulus wears off and the cumulative monetary tightening begins to bit, however, 2019 could be a very different story. We expect GDP growth to slow to only 1.5%. America\u2019s economy has now posted two successive quarters of 3% annualised growth, for the first time in three years. The Bureau of Economic Analysis says that America\u2019s growth in the last quarter came from \u201cpersonal consumption expenditures (PCE), private inventory investment, nonresidential fixed investment, exports, and federal government spending\u201d. But \u201cresidential fixed investment and state and local government spending\u201d both had a negative impact on growth. The US dollar is strengthening, as Wall Street traders calculate that this solid growth raises the chances of an interest rate rise in December: Economists are impressed by America\u2019s economic performance over the last quarter, especially given the disruption caused by the hurricane season. For example, here\u2019s Mohamed El-Erian, chief economic advisor at financial services giant Allianz: Justin Wolfers, professor at the University of Michigan, says America\u2019s long slow expansion has continued. He tweets: Jason Furman, who chaired President Obama\u2019s Council of Economic Advisers, has the bigger picture: Today\u2019s GDP report shows that consumer spending across America slowed in the last quarter, to a rate of 2.4% from 3.3% in the second quarter. That is partly due to Hurricanes Harvey and Irma - so the underlying picture is probably stronger. Businesses boosted their inventories, suggesting they expect strong demand in the coming months. This inventory investment added 0.73 percentage points to third-quarter GDP growth. Business investment rose during the July-September quarter, at a rate of 3.9%, led by spending on new equipment. Exports also rose, by 2.3%, while imports fell by 0.8% -- that narrowed the trade deficit, and made a positive contribution to growth. Breaking: America\u2019s economy expanded at an annualised rate of 3.0% in the third quarter of 2017. That beats Wall Street expectations, and is another quarter of solid growth. That\u2019s equivalent to a quarterly growth rate of 0.75%, faster than the 0.4% growth which the UK managed during the last quarter. More to follow! The Wall Street Journal has compiled a helpful list of things to watch for in today\u2019s US GDP report, due in 15 minutes. They include: Did the economy bounce back from the devastation caused by the hurricane season? Hurricanes Harvey and Irma probably slowed America\u2019s growth during the quarter Did consumer spending remain robust? The WSJ suspects it may have slowed, as \u201cAmericans generally don\u2019t go out shopping or dining during hurricanes\u201d. Did businesses keep investing? A strong reading would suggest firms are confident about their future prospects Are US exports growing? The world economy seems to be strengthening, so US firms should be taking advantage and selling more overseas. Analysts at ING predict a strong US growth report: Excitement is building on Wall Street as traders wait nervously to learn how America\u2019s economy fared in the third quarter of 2017. As explained in the introduction, economists predict that US GDP expanded at an annualised pace of 2.5% in July-September (the equivalent of growing by 0.6% during the quarter). That would be a small slowdown in growth after a strong second quarter, but still a fairly solid result. The data could help determine whether US interest rates are raised again this year. Craig Erlam, analyst at City firm OANDA, explains: The economy performed very well in the second quarter and another strong number is expected today, which will only increase the likelihood that the Fed raises interest rates at the December meeting. While there\u2019s no room for manoeuvre on this for the December meeting \u2013 a rate hike is fully priced in \u2013 there\u2019s plenty of room next year with markets severely under-pricing the three hikes the Fed has projected for 2018. Newsflash: US department store chain J. C. Penney has issued a profits warning \u2013 a timely example of how traditional retailers are struggling in the face of Amazon. The company, which runs more than 1,000 stores in shopping malls across America, has slashed its earnings forecast for 2017. J. C.Penney revealed that it had been forced to slash prices, particularly for women\u2019s clothes, to stimulate sales in September and October. That has taken a big slice out of its company\u2019s profitability. Shares have plunged by 15% in pre-market trading. Rival retailers Macy\u2019s and Kohl\u2019s are also dropping, on fears that the US retail sector is slowing (unless you\u2019re Amazon, of course...). Newsflash from Moscow: The Bank of Russia has cut interest rates, by a quarter-point, to 8.25%. Russian interest rates have been cut steadily this year, having been hiked to an eye-watering 11% in 2015 as central bankers tried to get inflation under control and support the rouble. Last night\u2019s financial results are calming worries that technology companies had become dangerously overvalued. The rally in the US stock markets this year has been partly driven by the FANG stocks (Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Google). Those stocks had fallen in recent days, on fears that investors had got carried away. But the news that Amazon and Alphabet both posted such strong revenue and profit growth suggests that Wall Street was right all along, and hadn\u2019t overvalued the tech sector. Thomas Fitzgerald, associate fund manager at EdenTree Investment Management, says: \u201cAlphabet reported an impressive set of results on Thursday evening, beating consensus expectations on every measure and delivering top-line growth in excess of 20% for the sixth straight quarter. The results were driven by strength in both core mobile and desktop search, \u2018phenomenal growth\u2019 from YouTube and further momentum in cloud services. \u201cOverall, the results reinforce our positive view on the company, as it continually adapts to a rapidly evolving computing environment, while leveraging advanced A.I. and machine learning capabilities to sustain a high level of growth. Jeff Bezos might wrestle the title of the world\u2019s richest person back from Bill Gates today, depending how Amazon and Microsoft\u2019s shares perform today. The 8.5% surge in Amazon\u2019s shares in after-hours trading swelled Bezos\u2019s fortune by over $6bn. That could be enough to put Bezos top of the pile. Bloomberg has the details: Gates ended Thursday with a net worth of $87.9 billion, about $4.5 billion ahead of Bezos. Gates has been the world\u2019s richest person since 2013, though he briefly slipped behind Bezos during intraday trading on July 27. Gates ended that day on top. The race is only close, though, because Gates has given away tens of billions of dollars over the years - including a $4.6bn donation in August.

The Competition and Markets Authority fears that customers are being unfairly pressured into making a booking, by warnings about how many (or few) rooms are left or how long a price might be available for. Here\u2019s the full story: Woosh! European stock markets have hit a five-month high this morning as last night\u2019s US tech results create an upbeat mood. Technology stocks, and consumer-focused companies, are leading the rally this morning. Stocks are also benefitting from the drop in the euro yesterday, after the European Central Bank extended its bond-buying stimulus scheme by another nine months (at least). Alphabet\u2019s results are also being cheered by technology analysts. Here\u2019s Bloomberg\u2019s Mark Bergen: Alphabet Inc. beat projections for third-quarter sales and earnings after a surge in Google ad volume helped the web-search giant shrug off concerns about regulatory scrutiny and an expensive foray into hardware. Sales for the quarter rose to $22.27 billion and profit was $9.57 a share, the company said. Analysts on average estimated sales of $22 billion on earnings of $8.34 a share. Executives lauded \u201ctremendous results\u201d in mobile search ads. Yet the company cautioned investors the biggest costs that come with those ads -- fees paid to distribution partners -- will continue to rise, along with expenses from Google\u2019s foray into devices and holiday-season marketing. \u201cWe had a terrific quarter, with revenues up 24% year on year, reflecting strength across Google and Other Bets,\u201d Chief Financial Officer Ruth Porat said in the statement. It\u2019s the first time in an earnings release that the CFO praised Alphabet\u2019s non-Google units, in self-driving cars and other experimental fields, which sharply curbed their costs during the quarter. James Cordwell, an analyst at Atlantic Equities, says: TAC [ Traffic acquisition costs] is surging, but the trade-off between growth and margin is a good one, with overall gross profit dollars still growing in excess of 20 percent. Over on Quartz, Mike Murphy points out that Google provided the bulk of Alphabet\u2019s revenues Time is a flat circle. Alphabet announced its third-quarter earnings today (Oct. 26), and yet again, it brought in a ton of cash, almost entirely from Google\u2019s advertising business. The company generated $27.8 billion in revenue, up 24% from the same quarter last year, making this Alphabet\u2019s highest-revenue quarter ever. (The previous record was $26.06 billion in the fourth quarter of 2016.) Roughly $24.1 billion of that revenue, or about 87%, came from Google\u2019s ad sales. Here\u2019s some reaction to Amazon\u2019s forecast-smashing results. The FT\u2019s Anna Nicolaou: Amazon grew quarterly sales by more than a third, helping the company turn a profit even as it spends heavily to disrupt industries ranging from groceries to logistics and television shows. Shares jumped more than 8 per cent to $1,040 a share in extended trading, as the company led by billionaire Jeff Bezos reported that sales jumped 34 per cent to $43.7bn in the three months to the end of September. This handily topped Amazon\u2019s own forecast and consensus estimates for $42.1bn, and outpaced growth of 25 per cent last quarter. Wedbush Securities analyst Michael Pachter: \u201cThis company has finally gotten itself to the point where it can sustain its spending growth and still leave some crumbs for shareholders.\u201d Benchmark Co analyst Daniel Kurnos: \u201cThey are firing on all cylinders. The machine is churning,\u201d The BBC\u2019s technology correspondent, Rory Cellan-Jones, is also impressed: Amazon, Alphabet, Microsoft and Intel collectively hauled in roughly $2.2bn more profit and $19bn more revenue than in the same quarter a year ago. That\u2019s according to Marketwatch\u2019s Jeremy Owens, who adds: Alphabet had perhaps the most astounding beat of the afternoon, as profit rose $1.12 billion and revenue $9.5 billion from a year before. The Google parent company reported third-quarter net income of $6.73 billion, or $9.57 a share, on revenue of $27.8 billion. That performance destroyed forecasts, as analysts on average expected Alphabet to report earnings of $8.31 a share on revenue of $26.9 billion. Over in Japan, the Nikkei stock index has surged by over 1% to a fresh 21-year high following last night\u2019s blisteringly good results from Alphabet, Amazon et al. Mutsumi Kagawa, chief global strategist at Rakuten Securities, says investors are in an optimistic mood: \u201cCorporate earnings are rising to record levels in the world. And the IMF just upgraded its economic forecast for all of U.S., China, Europe and Japan. World stock markets are upbeat this morning after the world\u2019s largest technology companies smashed forecasts last night. Amazon, Alphabet (Google) and Microsoft all outperformed Wall Street expectations with their latest financial results, sparking a rally in Asia -- and potentially sending US stocks to fresh record highs later today. Amazon posted a 34% (!) rise in revenues during the last quarter, to $43.7bn, partly due to its recent acquisition of Whole Foods. That beat forecasts of $42.1bn. And despite investing heavily, the online retail giant also posted net earnings of $256m or 52 cents per share -- compared to forecasts of just 3 cents. The results sent Amazon\u2019s shares soaring by 7% in after-hours trading, popping over the $1,000 mark. Alphabet\u2019s shares are also poised to vault over the $1,000 mark when trading begins in New York later today. Its earnings spiked by 32% during the quarter, to $9.57 a share, beating forecasts of $8.35. Revenues beat forecasts too - rising to $27.77bn, ahead of forecasts of $27.2bn. CNBC explains: Ad prices went down more than expected during the quarter, and traffic costs were higher than forecast \u2014 but revenue was boosted by a higher-than-predicted surge in the volume of clicks on Google ads across the world, especially in Asia. Microsoft, too, had a good quarter, partly to strong demand for its cloud services operation. Revenue from the Office 365 cloud productivity suite jumped 42% year-on-year, helping to drive total revenue to $24.5bn, compared to $23.56bn expected. That drove Microsoft\u2019s share to an all-time high in after-hours trading. Microchip maker Intel and social media network Twitter also beat forecasts yesterday, suggesting that the tech boom isn\u2019t fading. Alphabet, Microsoft and Amazon are all among the world\u2019s five largest companies, so these results have cheered investors. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. We get a new insight into the health of the world\u2019s largest economy today, when preliminary US GDP figures are released. Analysts predict that America\u2019s economy grew by around 0.6% during the quarter, giving an annualised growth rate of around 2.5%. That would be a small decline on the 3.1% recorded in the April-June quarter A strong reading would bolster confidence in the health of the global economy, but it\u2019s possible that today\u2019s data will be distorted by the hurricane season. Adam Cole of Royal Bank of Canada predicts that US companies hiked their spending on new equipment and buildings and stocked up on more raw materials, in a sign of confidence. Cole says: Look for a sharp inventory swing to contribute a sizeable amount to the sequential change (just over 0.5ppt) while capex investment should also look firm (adding another 0.5ppt, possibly more after this week\u2019s durables release). Otherwise it\u2019s a fairly quiet day...
