                "bodyText":"At the annual meeting of Starbucks shareholders in March, executives were confronted by a barista who demanded more paid family leave for new moms like her. Now, if a group of Starbucks investors has its way, the people asking that question will soon be the shareholders themselves. On Monday, a group led by Zevin Asset Management announced it would pressure Starbucks to inform shareholders of whether its paid family leave policy \u00e2\u20ac\u201c which offers less leave to retail workers than to corporate employees \u00e2\u20ac\u201c might count as employment discrimination. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Paid family leave is a huge factor in how well women can stay involved in the workforce after having a baby, or how much time out they have to take in their careers,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Pat Tomaino, Zevin\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s associate director of socially responsible investing. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Women and their families benefit from equal and generous paid family leave \u00e2\u20ac\u201c but companies do too.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd It appears to be the first shareholder proposal calling for a company to rethink its policy on paid family leave. Nor are the investors stopping with Starbucks. In letters sent this summer, Zevin warned nearly a dozen other major employers \u00e2\u20ac\u201c among them Costco, Target, UPS, Amazon, AT&amp;T, Apple, CVS, and Marriott \u00e2\u20ac\u201c that their paid leave policies could face similar scrutiny. Starbucks is the first target because its family leave policies are already being protested by a vocal group of baristas and store managers. The coffee company offers employees of its corporate offices 16 weeks\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 paid leave if they give birth and 12 weeks if they are new fathers or adoptive parents. Retail workers who give birth or adopt are eligible for six weeks of paid leave; dads whose partners give birth get none. Starbucks argues its parental leave policy is one of the best in the retail industry. But parents protesting the policy say it presents a hardship. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It is in no way fair to the average worker,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Jess Svabenik, a new mother and a barista, told the Guardian. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153You can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have corporate without us, so why would one have a better benefit than the other?\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The proposal that investors filed with the company suggested that the policy could be discriminatory. LGBTQ parents, Tomaino said, are especially disadvantaged. Tomaino added that the unequal policy poses a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153reputational liability\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, because Starbucks executives have repeatedly boasted about treating corporate and retail employees equally. At the March 2017 shareholders meeting, Howard Schultz, the outgoing chief executive, said a decision in the 1990s to offer stock options and healthcare \u00e2\u20ac\u0153to everyone that worked at Starbucks, including part time people \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 became the foundation of the culture of the company.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Tomaino said Starbucks has said it is willing to discuss the proposal before it comes to a vote.

He said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The US economy looks in great shape based on recent surveys, supporting the Fed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s message that everyone needs to prepare for a higher interest rate environment.</p> <p>If you though Monday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ISM manufacturing index was good \u00e2\u20ac\u201c highest reading for 13 years, the non-manufacturing ISM index is astonishing. It has jumped from 55.3 to 59.8 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the strongest reading in 12 years.</p> <p>Admittedly this jump is partly down to a rebound from the recent hurricanes but the strength clearly evident in the details of the report underlines the point that the US corporate sector is in great shape.

                "bodyText":"With stronger than expected services data from the US, Wall Street shrugged off an early dip and continued on its merry way to new records. It was a different story in Europe, with a more mixed picture. Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax edged to a new peak but France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac slipped back, while Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ibex dropped sharply in the wake of the Catalan crisis confronting the country following the weekend\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s violence. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished down 0.53 points or 0.01% at 7467.58 Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax added 0.53% to 12,970.52 France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac closed 0.08% lower at 5363.23 Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB fell 1.44% to 22,456.38 Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ibex ended down 2.85% at 9964.9 In Greece, the Athens market slipped 0.23% to 750.72 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 32 points or 0.14%. On that note, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time to close for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be back tomorrow. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Capital Economics\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 look at the global economic picture as evidenced by recent surveys: In the markets, the standout performance came from Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ibex, and not in a good way. Following the weekend violence surrounding the Catalan independence referendum, there is little sign of a resolution to the dispute between the region and the central government. So the Ibex has ended down almost 3%. Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at IG, said: Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s focus has been relentlessly on the situation in Spain, where Catalonia is seemingly headed for a declaration of independence. As a result, the Ibex remains under heavy pressure, with the index now down 11% from its highs. Geopolitical risk is back on the agenda, with investors shunning Spanish stocks in favour of their German counterparts, as the Dax returns to all-time high. David Madden, market analyst at CMC Markets, said: The Ibex 35 has fallen to a mark not seen since March as the uncertainty surrounding Catalan independence is eroding investor confidence. The head of the Catalan separatist movement has pledged to declare independence for the region within days. The Spanish King and Prime Minister oppose this, and the region has been threatened with direct rule. The eyes of the world are on Catalonia and the spike in political tensions is likely to keep investors away. US interest rates are likely to rise in December given the strength of recent data, says ING Bank chief international economist James Knightley, barring a failure to resolve the debt ceiling problems. He said: The US economy looks in great shape based on recent surveys, supporting the Fed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s message that everyone needs to prepare for a higher interest rate environment. If you though Monday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ISM manufacturing index was good \u00e2\u20ac\u201c highest reading for 13 years, the non-manufacturing ISM index is astonishing. It has jumped from 55.3 to 59.8 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the strongest reading in 12 years. Admittedly this jump is partly down to a rebound from the recent hurricanes but the strength clearly evident in the details of the report underlines the point that the US corporate sector is in great shape. A strong domestic economy is driving output and new orders while a fairly soft dollar and strong global demand are boosting exports. The non-manufacturing survey shows business activity jumping five points while new orders jumped six points \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the index has only been higher on two occasions in the past twelve years. Employment is also looking very strong at 56.8 versus the 50 break even level, which gives us confidence to assert that any softness in Friday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s payrolls report relating to hurricane effects will be swiftly reversed in coming months. As such today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s report reinforces our view that the only thing stopping a December hike is the potential for debt ceiling issues coming to a head, risking a government shutdown around year-end. Inflation wise, the price paid component indicates that the decline in inflation rates seen through this year will soon come to an end and the Fed is right to assert that disinflation was merely transitory. More on what the latest ISM surveys - manufacturing and non-manufacturing - say about the strength of the US economy: US crude inventories dropped sharply last week, and by significantly more than expected. They fell by 6.02m barrels to 464.96m, compared with expectations of a 0.8m decline. But gasoline stocks grew by more than expected, up 1.64m barrels rather than 1.1m. But there may be some divergence between the survey and the official data, suggests Nordsea economist Johnny Bo Jakobsen: Anthony Nieves, ISM chair, said: The non-manufacturing sector has reflected strong growth in the month of September despite the impact on the supply chain from the recent hurricanes. Respondents\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 comments indicate a good outlook for business conditions. And here are some comments from the survey: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Hurricane Irma caused a revenue challenge that will take some time to recover from, interrupting business operations in that region and offsetting growth in others.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd (Accommodation &amp; Food Services) \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Our business continues to grow at a good pace.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd (Health Care &amp; Social Assistance) \u00e2\u20ac\u0153General outlook looking up, with sales picking up. That will drive spend and investment.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd (Information) \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Overall, consistent growth in construction/office renovation jobs. Eight percent more jobs and 6 percent more revenue.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd (Construction) \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Positive business trends continue in second half. Business results above plan and higher year-to-year. Forecast above planned results for 2017.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd (Finance &amp; Insurance) \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Business still in a down trend due to lack of capital investment in worldwide mining market.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd (Mining) \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Hurricane Harvey has been a disruption to normal business activity in the oil and gas industry. Refineries and petrochemical plants were shut down due to the storm, as were many offices along the Gulf Coast. Business is just now returning to some sense of normalcy.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd (Professional, Scientific &amp; Technical Services) \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Continued growth; however, slower pace than in past. Expecting some further disruptions due to weather in Texas and Florida.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd (Retail Trade) In contrast, the Institute for Supply Management service sector survey has come in much stronger than expected. The ISM non-manufacturing PMI for September was 59.8, up from 55.3 in August and higher than the 55.5 expected by analysts. This is the highest level since August 2005. The new orders index jumped from 57.1 in August to 63. Commenting on the survey, Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit said: Given the disruption caused by recent hurricanes, some pull-back in business activity was understandable, so the resilient reading of the September services PMI makes for encouraging reading. Looked at alongside the manufacturing PMI, the survey data point to GDP rising at an annualised rate of just over 2% in the third quarter. Growth is largely reliant on the services economy, however, as manufacturing lags behind, struggling in part due to the strong dollar. While rebuilding and a return to normal business conditions after the hurricanes will hopefully boost growth in the fourth quarter, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s worrying to see business expectations about activity levels over the coming year drop in September. Measured across both manufacturing and services, future optimism is at its lowest since February, suggesting companies have become increasingly cautious about the outlook. However, while optimism has slipped, the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dchard\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 survey data on recent output, new orders and hiring trends remain solid. Combined with the further upturn in price pressures seen in September, the survey data will further fuel expectations that the Fed will be keen to hike interest rates again before the year is out. Average prices charged for goods and services rose at the fastest rate for three years in September, though it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not yet clear how much of the rise reflected short-term hurricane effects. The first of two US service sector survey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shows a better than expected outcome, although a slight decline on the previous month. The Markit final service sector PMI for September came in at 55.3 compared to an initial reading of 55.1, but down on August\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s figure of 56. There was a similar pattern for the composite PMI, up from an initial 54.6 to 54.8 but down on August\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 55.3. As expected the Dow Jones Industrial Average opened marginally lower, but soon regained positive territory. The Dow fell 3 points initially after its record breaking run, but is currently up 9 points as investors await the latest service sector data. The S&amp;P 500 dipped 0.06% and the Nasdaq Composite edged 0.14% lower. The non-farm payroll numbers will probably be below the ADP figures, says Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics: Meanwhile in America, the latest jobs figures have beaten expectations. Ahead of the non-farm payroll numbers on Friday, a report from payroll processor ADP showed that US private employers added 135,000 jobs in September. This was above the Reuters forecast of a rise of 125,000. The increase came despite hurricane Harvey and Irma, although the report did show smaller retailers were hit hard by the storms. If the non-farm figures also come in above estimates, that will give more credence to a possible US interest rate rise before the end of the year. The better than expected data is not set to help Wall Street, however, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average forecast to open slightly lower after its recent record breaking run. Shares in Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s housebuilders haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t reacted to another Theresa May announcement - an extra \u00c2\u00a32bn for the government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s affordable housing programme. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s probably because the plan will only make a small dent in Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s housing shortage, by building an extra 5,000 social rented homes a year. Shares in Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s energy providers are sliding, after Theresa May told the Conservative Party conference that the government will introduce a new price cap Centrica, which runs British Gas, has shed 6% , while SSE are down 3%. That sends Centrica down to its lowest level since early 2004. Andy Sparrow\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Politics liveblog has more details (including the astonishing sight of a comedian handing May a P45 during her speech, and a lot of interruptions for coughing as the PM\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s voice faltered). Back in the City, Standard &amp; Poor\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s have warned that Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy may not be strong enough to support an interest rate hike, especially with Brexit looming. In a new report, S&amp;P argues that the Bank of England has been talking up the idea of rate rises soon, to stop the pound sliding. S&amp;P says: We remain a bit skeptical as to how justified such a hike would be in the near term. One rate rise may come in November, but further increases aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t justifiable given Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s weak wage growth, S&amp;P argues: Overall, we believe the Bank and Mark Carney\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s recent statements are primarily aimed at propping up sterling to reduce imported inflation pressures. This strategy may include an actual 25 basis point hike in November, thus bringing the policy rate back to where it was before the Brexit referendum. Additional moves in 2018 do not appear warranted on the back of a slowing economy. S&amp;P also warns that there is a high risk that Britain suffers a disruptive Brexit. It points to the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153tangible lack of progress\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in talks with Brussels and the ongoing \u00e2\u20ac\u0153infighting within the U.K. political establishment\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd: Oxfam\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Head of Inequality Ana Arendar has welcomed the EC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ruling against Amazon: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Cosy deals that let companies slash their tax bills show how the global tax system is open to abuse. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Corporate tax avoidance robs countries around the world of billions each year \u00e2\u20ac\u201c money that could be used to fight poverty. Poor countries are hit hardest as they are more dependent on tax revenue from companies to pay for public services like life-saving healthcare and clean water. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Governments need to tighten tax rules to ensure companies pay their fair share of tax. In the meantime, the UK Government should not delay implementing laws to require British multinationals to publically report their activities for each country where they do business.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s my colleague Jennifer Rankin on today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s state aid decisions: Amazon has been ordered to repay \u00e2\u201a\u00ac250m (\u00c2\u00a3222m) by EU authorities, after a ruling that the technology company benefited from illegal and unfair state aid from Luxembourg. The European commission also announced on Wednesday that it planned to take the the Irish government to the European court of justice (ECJ) over its failure to collect \u00e2\u201a\u00ac13bn in unpaid taxes from Apple, in relation to an earlier ruling. Margrethe Vestager, the EU commissioner in charge of competition, said Luxembourg\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u0153illegal tax advantages to Amazon\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd had allowed almost three-quarters of the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s profits to go untaxed, allowing it to pay four times less tax than local rivals. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This is an illegal practice under EU state aid rules,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Vestager said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Member states may not grant selective tax concessions to multinational groups to which other companies do not have access.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The commission said Amazon had benefited from an illegal tax deal granted by the Luxembourg authorities that allowed the company to artificially reduce its tax bill by \u00e2\u201a\u00ac250m from 2006 to 2014. The company has been ordered to repay the full amount plus interest. Amazon rejected the findings of the commission investigation. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We believe that Amazon did not receive any special treatment from Luxembourg and that we paid tax in full accordance with both Luxembourg and international tax law. We will study the commission\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ruling and consider our legal options, including an appeal.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Jennifer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s full story: Ireland\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s finance ministry says the EC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision to take it to court is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153extremely regrettable\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Dublin insists that it is making significant progress in recovering \u00e2\u201a\u00ac13bn of taxes from Apple, even though it doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t agree with that ruling. Q: Are you concerned that there could be a proliferation of sweetheart tax deals in the UK after Brexit? I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t see why the situation would change, Vestager replies. If you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have it now, why have it later? She argues that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153political direction and administrative practices\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd determine what kind of tax system a country runs. Luxembourg has issued a statement, arguing that Amazon did not benefit from state aid (as the EC claim): Luxembourg has taken notice of the decision by the European Commission in the Amazon case. Luxembourg will use appropriate due diligence to analyse the decision and reserves all its rights. The decision of the Commission refers to a period going back to 2006. Over time, both the international and the Luxembourg legal frameworks have substantially evolved. As Amazon has been taxed in accordance with the tax rules applicable at the relevant time, Luxembourg considers that the company has not been granted incompatible State aid, as foreseen by article 107(1) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. Luxembourg has been fully cooperating with the Commission in its investigation and is strongly committed to tax transparency and the fight against harmful tax avoidance. Luxembourg fully adheres to the OECD/G20 BEPS project, which modernizes international tax rules and creates a global level playing field. Q: Can member states claim some of Amazon\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u201a\u00ac250m tax bill for themselves? Vestager suggests this is unlikely (ie, because the money should have been paid to the Luxembourg tax offices). Q: Could today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decisions make member states more worried that the EC is interfering in their tax affairs? Vestager says she hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t heard this sort of complaint. Member States understand the importance of an effective tax system in the world of digital commerce and large multinationals. Amazon has rejected the EC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ruling that it illegally avoided paying enough tax in Europe, and may appeal. In a statement, it says: We believe that Amazon did not receive any special treatment from Luxembourg and that we paid tax in full accordance with both Luxembourg and international tax law. We will study the commission\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ruling and consider our legal options, including an appeal.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Q: The US government is considering changing its tax rules so it can tax the trillions of dollars which are currently parked overseas by American companies. What\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s your advice for them? Vestager declines to advise the US government on this issue. She\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s focused on getting Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tax system to work properly. Q: How did Amazon evade tax in Luxembourg, if it was recording revenues there? Vestager explains that Amazon\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s operating company was paying unacceptably high royalties to the holding company, which lowered its taxable income. Q: Could this ruling spark a trade war with America? Vestager denies that the EC is targeting US companies. Businesses in Europe need to know they are on a level playing field, she replies. There is no bias in our rulings. They are about ensuring there is competition in Europe, whatever your flag and your ownership. Onto questions. Q: Amazon\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s behaviour occurred when [Commissioner president] Jean-Claude Juncker was prime minister and finance minister of Luxembourg. So was he guilty, or negligent? Commissioner Vestager says the EC investigates behaviour by a member state, rather than conducting a criminal investigation trying to incriminate anyone. Commissioner Vestager then turns to Apple. She explains that the EC is taking Ireland to the European Court of Justice, because it has failed to collect a year-old tax bill worth \u00e2\u201a\u00ac13bn from tech giant Apple. Vestager suggests Dublin is dragging its feet on this issue... \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We understand that recovery in certain cases maybe more complex than in others, and we are always ready to assist. But member states need to make sufficient progress to restore competition. Background: Last August, the EC penalised Apple for having received unfair deals from Ireland that cut its effective corporate tax rate. That ruling was disputed by the tech company, and the government of Ireland. Vestager insists that the EU isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t fining Amazon. We are removing an illegal advantage that it should never have received in the first place, she says. The message is that all companies need to pay their taxes, as the huge majority of companies do, she adds firmly. Margrethe Vestager says Amazon used an \u00e2\u20ac\u0153empty shell\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd of a holding company in Luxembourg to shift profits out of Europe. This holding company had no employees and no offices, she says, and wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t involved in developing intellectual property. Instead, it was simply there to cut Amazon\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tax bill, and ensure that three-quarters of sales in Europe were untaxed. This chart from the EU shows how it was done: Vestager says that Amazon\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tax deal with Luxembourg was unfair, because a local company would have paid four times as much tax on the same profits. NEWSFLASH: The EC is demanding \u00e2\u201a\u00ac250m from Amazon, to cover the unfair tax advantages it received from basing its European operations in Luxembourg. Those tax benefits are \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcillegal under EU state aid rules\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, commissioner Margrethe Vestager tells the press conference in Brussels. She adds: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Luxembourg gave illegal tax benefits to Amazon. As a result, almost three quarters of Amazon\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s profits were not taxed. Vestager says Amazon must repay the benefits of that deal, plus interest. In another move, the EU is also taking Ireland to the European Court of Justice for failing to recover \u00e2\u201a\u00ac13bn of tax from Apple, following a ruling against the US tech giant in August 2016. Over in Brussels, European Commissioner Margrethe Vestager is preparing to give a press conference on state aid. She\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s expected to announce that the EC is hitting Amazon with a tax bill over its \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcsweetheart\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 deal with Luxembourg. You can watch it online here. Some background. Amazon Europe is based in Luxembourg and aggregates the billions of pounds of sales the retailer makes from individual countries across the continent, It emerged in August that Amazon paid just \u00c2\u00a315m in tax on European revenues of \u00c2\u00a319.5bn which were reported through Luxembourg in 2016. James Smith of ING is concerned that new business growth cooled last month: At 53.6, the UK services PMI was a little better than hoped. But dig a little deeper and the key takeaway for us was the fact new business growth is at a 13-month low. With the current PMI roughly indicating growth in the 0.3% region, this latter point means that growth over the next couple of quarters could be equally as sluggish. Once again, political uncertainty was a key factor in holding back growth. It is possible that we see some recovery over the next few months; the fact that the UK government is more united behind the idea of a transition period could help unlock some short-term investment. But a lack of full agreement on the terms or length of such an arrangement, or indeed the ultimate Brexit deal, is likely to keep businesses cautious. Howard Archer of the EY Item Club says the drop in new business will knock growth: Chris Sood-Nicholls of Lloyds Bank Commercial Banking is encouraged that the headline Services PMI rose last month: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This slight increase in the index is encouraging, particularly given a backdrop of mixed economic signals. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The sector still faces a period of uncertainty surrounding Brexit, a sentiment echoed in Moody\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s recent decision to downgrade the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s credit rating to Aa2 from Aa1. Those consumer facing parts of the sector will also be mindful of the potential for an interest rate rise in the coming months, particularly as we head into one of the busiest trading periods of the year.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Matt Whittaker of the Resolution Foundation has tweeted a nice graph showing all the PMI data this week: The drop in new orders across the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s service sector last month is a serious concern, says Duncan Brock of the Chartered Institute of Procurement &amp; Supply. He fears that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a stagnation trend\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd is developing in the sector, with firms unwilling to take risks until they know how Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s exit from the EU is playing out. Brock explains; Where consumers recovered a little from their spending hesitation last month, it was the turn of businesses to be spooked into inactivity, exerting greater scrutiny over new projects and long-term spending plans. The pressure of Brexit and resulting uncertainty were at the heart of this indecision. Markit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s all Sector PMI, which measures growth across the UK economy, has hit its lowest level since the EU referendum, and the second worst in over four years. Breaking: Growth in Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s service sector strengthened last month. Markit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s services PMI, which tracks activity at thousands of UK firms, has risen to 53.6 for September, up from 53.2 in August. Any reading over 50 shows growth, so this indicates a small acceleration. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s welcome news, following data earlier this week showing that factory growth slowed while construction actually shrank in September. But.... service sector bosses also warned that new orders rose at the slowest rate in 13 months. Many told Markit that customers were delaying signing off on large projects due to Brexit related uncertainty [something the Lord Mayor of London will understand.....]. Firms were also hit by rising prices, with input cost inflation hitting a seven month high. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s due to rising food, energy and fuel bills, alongside increased prices for imported items and greater staff salaries, Markit says. Chris Williamson of Markit estimates that the UK economy probably only grew by 0.3% in the last quarter -- matching its growth earlier this year. He explains: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The services sector saw another month of modest growth, running in the middle ground between the robust expansion seen in manufacturing and the contraction recorded in construction. The three PMI surveys put the economy on course for another subdued 0.3% expansion in the third quarter, but the fourth quarter could see even slower growth..... The surveys therefore portray an economy struggling with the unwelcome combination of sluggish growth and rising prices, presenting a dilemma for policymakers. More to follow.... Just in: Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economic recovery strengthened further last month, indicating that it continues to grow faster than the UK. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s according to data firm Markit. Its monthly PMI survey of companies across the region has jumped to 56.7 in September, up from 55.7 in August, which shows the fastest growth in four months. Germany, Ireland and France led the way, with firms reporting that output expanded and new orders surged. Job creation was also strong, rising at almost the fastest rate in a decade. No wonder some in the City keep talking about a euroboom.... Chris Williamson, Chief Business Economist at IHS Market says Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy seems to have grown by around 0.7% in the third quarter of 2017. The jump in new orders suggests growth will remain strong this autumn. Williamson adds: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Growth is also becoming increasingly broadbased, which should help make the upturn more sustainable as corporate profits, labour markets and demand improve across the region. The eurozone therefore looks increasingly able to withstand any political shocks and set for a strong end to the year.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd While the City of London worries about Brexit, the German stock market has just hit a new all-time high. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE 100, though, is flat this morning, having hit a seven-week high yesterday. The Lord Mayor is absolutely right when he says that banks urgently need clarity over Brexit. Several of the biggest firms in the City have already begun shifting jobs overseas; JP Morgan is buying a new office block in Dublin, for example, and Standard Chartered is opening a subsidiary in Frankfurt. But as this graph from Bloomberg shows, thousands more jobs could yet move, depending how negotiations play out. The Lord Mayor of London is urging the UK government to finalise a legally binding Brexit transition period by the end of the year, or risk serious damage to Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s financial sector. Andrew Parmley will warn that banks need to plan ahead, and cannot risk a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153cliff edge\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Brexit that would badly hurt the UK economy. Lord Mayor Parmley will issue the warning at the annual City Banquet - a swanky event at London\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Mansion House tonight. He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s expected to welcome Theresa May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s proposal of a two-year transition deal after March 2019 - calling it a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcbridge\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 to London\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s future. But he insists that this is nailed down within three months, so that financial companies have some clarity. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We owe it to the sector \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and to the global financial system \u00e2\u20ac\u201c to do all we can not only to maintain our collaborative approach, but to enhance it. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153That is why we cannot have a cliff-edge at the moment of Brexit \u00e2\u20ac\u201c businesses must have the certainty of how they will be regulated, and that requires a transition period. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We welcome the Government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s proposal on transition \u00e2\u20ac\u201c this will be our bridge to the future. But the idea must become reality, translated into a legal agreement before the end of the year. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The longer this is left, the more it damages all our futures \u00e2\u20ac\u201c not only in the UK, but the economy right across the EU. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We also need to know more about the final state, after transition. How can the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s most profitable industry be expected to programme its satnav without knowing the destination?\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Parmley also blasted \u00e2\u20ac\u0153economically illiterate calls\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to impose new cross-border financial barriers between London and the rest of the world. Parmley\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s post is mainly ceremonial*. But he does \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcspeak for the City\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, and this speech is a reminder that Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s financial district isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t as upbeat about Brexit as certain government MPs, who seem to think we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re re-enacting Agincourt.... Andrew Bailey, CEO of the Financial Conduct Authority and Sam Woods, head of the Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Prudential Regulation Authority, are also speaking at tonight\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s event. Surely they will touch on Brexit too? * - correction, the Lord Mayor isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t unelected, as I wrote earlier. He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s elected by residents and businesses in the Square Mile. Apologies for the error. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Today is services PMI day, when we learn how service sector companies around the globe fared last month. So, after some underwhelming UK construction and factory data yesterday, we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re about to learn how Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s dominant services sector coped in the face of rising inflation and political uncertainty in September City economists expect little improvement on August, so the PMI could be unchanged at 53.2 - a level that shows steady growth. Anything below that will heighten concerns that growth is weakening. Royal Bank of Canada say: Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s PMI services report follows weak numbers in both manufacturing (Monday) and construction (yesterday). It is one of the final clues for the initial estimate of Q3 GDP on 25 October (RBC: 0.2%q/q). We see downside risk to today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s number as well on the back of relatively weak business expectations in recent months Also coming up today.... European traders will be watching events in Spain again, after Catalonia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s president claimed the region would declare independence \u00e2\u20ac\u0153at the end of this week or the beginning of next\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Last night, the King of Spain weighed in, criticising the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcirresponsible behaviour\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 and \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcunacceptable disloyalty\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 of Catalonia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s leaders. Could direct rule from Madrid be next? CMC Market\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Michael Hewson says: Having miscalculated so badly with their reaction at the weekend it would appear that Spanish Prime Minister Rajoy is in no mood to compromise and looking to double down. While he is well within his rights under the terms of the law of the constitution it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s difficult to see how this can end in any other way than badly, and for that history may well judge him harshly. Any further misjudgements by the Spanish government could well also increase the pressure on the EU to come off the fence that it has been so busy trying to stay on, with respect to last weekend\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s events. It could be an expensive morning for Amazon. The European Union\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s (EU) competition commissioner Margrethe Vestager is hit the e-commerce giant with a massive bill for back taxes related to its tax arrangement with Luxembourg. Vestager\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s announcement could come at 11am UK time. In the City, supermarket chain Tesco has reinstated its dividend and reported a 2.2% rise in like-for-like UK sales in the last quarter. Shareholders will get one shiny penny for each share they own - a small benefit, but as they say, every little helps (sorry). Flooring firm Topps Tiles is also reporting results, and has warned that profits will be at the lower end of expectations. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the agenda: 9am: Eurozone services PMI for September. Likely to show another month of solid growth, with economists predicting the PMI will be unchanged at 55.6. 9.30am: UK services PMI for September. The City will be hoping that Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s major economic sector shrugged off Brexit worries last month. 10am: India\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s interest rate decision. Reserve Bank of India is likely to leave borrowing cost unchanged. 10am: Eurozone retail sales. Economists predict a 0.3% rise in September. 3pm: US services PMI. After strong factory data on Monday, will America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s services sector also sparkle? Probably.... Tonight: City Banquet at Mansion House",

David Madden, market analyst at CMC Markets UK, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The IBEX 35 is the best performer in Europe, which make a nice change seeing the Spanish market lost the most ground this week. Madrid and Catalonia are still at loggerheads, and the Spanish government has suspended Catalan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s parliamentary session which was due to take place on Monday. Only the Parliament of Catalonia can declare independence, and since Madrid has prevented the meeting from taking place there isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t much the separatists can do. Nonetheless, investors will be fearful of the Spanish stock market while the Catalan question hangs over the country. </p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-59d64abde4b0c8da8831bf19\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-10-05T15:09:44.114Z\">4.09pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The pound\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s weakness against the dollar could be temporary, suggests John Higgins at Capital Economics:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Although sterling has fallen sharply against the dollar over the past fortnight or so, we forecast that the exchange rate will end this year and next at $1.35/\u00c2\u00a3, above its level now of $1.31/\u00c2\u00a3.</p> <p>Sterling\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s drop on Thursday appears to have been prompted by unexpectedly-weak car sales in the UK..and growing doubts over PM Theresa May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s future. The economy as a whole seems to be holding up quite well, though. And we don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t expect it to be derailed by political uncertainty unless we end up with a new prime minister with a markedly-different view of how Brexit negotiations should proceed.</p> <p>That risk aside, sterling\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s exchange rate against the dollar will probably continue to be driven by shifting views of monetary policy. Expected interest rates shot up in the UK in mid-September after the MPC signalled that it might raise Bank Rate sooner than investors had expected. But expected interest rates then rose further in the US after the FOMC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meeting later in the month, when participants\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 projections suggested that a hike in the federal funds rate in December remains on the cards.</p> <p>This helps to explain why a fall of more than 2% in the dollar against sterling between these two policy meetings has since been more than unwound.

But the difference is not large. And we suspect that the exchange rate will find some support late next year from the prospects for monetary policy in 2019. We forecast that the gap in policy rates will shrink to minus 0.75-1.00pp during that year, as the Fed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tightening cycle ends in the spring while the MPC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s continues gradually.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-59d6436be4b00593b4d66f24\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-10-05T14:37:22.031Z\">3.37pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Sterling\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s suffering was exacerbated this afternoon by a beefed up showing from the dollar.</p> <p>Cable plunged as much as 0.9% this Thursday, dragging the pound to a sub-$1.325 4 week nadir against the greenback.

                "bodyText":"With Spanish shares recovering despite the continuing tensions between the government and Catalan separatists, European markets managed to end the day higher. The exception was Germany, which slipped back from its record highs. In the UK, a weakening pound gave some support to the FTSE 100, dominated as it is by overseas earners who benefit from a fall in sterling. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished 40.41 points or 0.54% higher at 7507.99 Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax dipped 0.02% to 12,968.05 France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac closed up 0.3% to 5379.21 Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB rose 0.49% to 22,566.03 Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ibex ended up 2.51% at 10,214.7 In Greece, the Athens market slipped 0.79% at 744.80 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 91 points or 0.4%, ahead of Friday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s non-farm payroll numbers. On that note, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time to close for the day. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be back tomorrow. Over in Spain, the stock market has recovered much of Wednesday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s slump, as Spain rules that Catalan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s parliament should be suspended on Monday, thus ruling out an expected vote on independence. David Madden, market analyst at CMC Markets UK, said: The IBEX 35 is the best performer in Europe, which make a nice change seeing the Spanish market lost the most ground this week. Madrid and Catalonia are still at loggerheads, and the Spanish government has suspended Catalan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s parliamentary session which was due to take place on Monday. Only the Parliament of Catalonia can declare independence, and since Madrid has prevented the meeting from taking place there isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t much the separatists can do. Nonetheless, investors will be fearful of the Spanish stock market while the Catalan question hangs over the country. The pound\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s weakness against the dollar could be temporary, suggests John Higgins at Capital Economics: Although sterling has fallen sharply against the dollar over the past fortnight or so, we forecast that the exchange rate will end this year and next at $1.35/\u00c2\u00a3, above its level now of $1.31/\u00c2\u00a3. Sterling\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s drop on Thursday appears to have been prompted by unexpectedly-weak car sales in the UK..and growing doubts over PM Theresa May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s future. The economy as a whole seems to be holding up quite well, though. And we don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t expect it to be derailed by political uncertainty unless we end up with a new prime minister with a markedly-different view of how Brexit negotiations should proceed. That risk aside, sterling\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s exchange rate against the dollar will probably continue to be driven by shifting views of monetary policy. Expected interest rates shot up in the UK in mid-September after the MPC signalled that it might raise Bank Rate sooner than investors had expected. But expected interest rates then rose further in the US after the FOMC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meeting later in the month, when participants\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 projections suggested that a hike in the federal funds rate in December remains on the cards. This helps to explain why a fall of more than 2% in the dollar against sterling between these two policy meetings has since been more than unwound. Other \u00e2\u20ac\u0153majors\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd have still fared worse than sterling against the US currency since the MPC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s last meeting, though. We think that the contrast between policy rates in the US and UK at the end of next year will be a bit starker than investors appear to be anticipating. Our view is that the gap will be minus 1.00-1.25 percentage points (pp), which reflects forecasts of 2.25%-2.50% for the US and 1.25% for the UK. The gap implied by our forecasts for policy rates would be broadly consistent, on the basis of past form, with a slightly weaker dollar/sterling exchange rate than the one that we are projecting. But the difference is not large. And we suspect that the exchange rate will find some support late next year from the prospects for monetary policy in 2019. We forecast that the gap in policy rates will shrink to minus 0.75-1.00pp during that year, as the Fed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tightening cycle ends in the spring while the MPC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s continues gradually. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex said: Sterling\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s suffering was exacerbated this afternoon by a beefed up showing from the dollar. Cable plunged as much as 0.9% this Thursday, dragging the pound to a sub-$1.325 4 week nadir against the greenback. Sterling also maintained a half a percent drop against the euro \u00e2\u20ac\u201c which itself fell 0.3% against the dollar \u00e2\u20ac\u201c sporadically causing the pound to dip below \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.12, a level it hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t seen since mid-September. As has been the case all day, there isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t any one great defining factor either driving the pound lower or the dollar higher, but rather a web of news items highlighting the impact of Brexit uncertainty for the former and suggesting a hawkish Fed for the latter. Cable is likely to remain the dominant force on Friday, as investors gear up for a potentially crucial (and likely hurricane hit) set of non-farm figures. Still with the US, and factory goods orders rose by more than expected in August. New orders increased by 1.2%, following a 3.3% drop recorded in July and better than the forecast 1% rise. On the recent hurricanes the Commerce department said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We cannot isolate the effects of Hurricanes Harvey and Irma on either the Advance Report or Full Report on Manufacturers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Shipments, Inventories and Orders, because the survey is designed to estimate the month\u00e2\u20ac\ufffdto\u00e2\u20ac\ufffdmonth change in manufacturing activity at the national level and not at specific geographic areas.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd US markets are continuing their winning streak. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is up 12 points in early trading while the S&amp;P 500 and Nasday Composite have opened at new record highs. Williams however will not vote on interest rates this year, so if they do rise in December it will not be down to him: The dollar of course is being supported by the expectation of a US rate rise before the end of the year. And new comments from San Francisco Fed president John Williams in a speech in Missouri do little to dispel that idea: The pound is on track for its worst week against the dollar since November 2016, according to Reuters. The pound continues to fall, now down a cent or 0.8% against the dollar at $1.3135. The UK currency is now at its lowest since early September and has lost all the gains (and more) that it made after the Bank of England suggested rates might rise in November. Worries about a challenge to Theresa May as UK prime minister following her conference speech has unsettled investors, since a weakened leadership is hardly ideal for the crucial Brexit negotiations. The latest poor economic data - in the shape of disappointing car sales - also point to an economy which would struggle to accommodate increased borrowing costs. Indeed, ratings agency S&amp;P suggested that very thing this week. Meanwhile the strong US data - service sector on Wednesday, jobless claims now - is helping to push the dollar higher. Over in the US, and weekly jobless claims have come in better than expected. Ahead of the non-farm payrolls numbers tomorrow, the Labor Department said the number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits fell by 12,000 last week to 260,000. Analysts had been expecting a figure of around 265,000. But the impact of the recent hurricanes makes the picture a little difficult to assess. The department said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria impacted this week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s claims.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Dennis de Jong, managing director of UFX.com, said: President Trump will be quick to point towards the strength of the labour market on the back of today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s positive jobless claims data. The initial impact of hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria have typically increased the number of new applications for unemployment benefits. However, today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s dip dampens fears of job growth restraint in the coming months. Initial jobless claims are unlikely to return to August\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s record lows for a while yet, though. Weekly claims had previously been operating at their lowest level since the early 1970s, but with many businesses yet to reopen in the wake of the natural disasters, a number of Americans are still faced with little choice but to seek unemployment benefits. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a nice chart from the BBC, showing how diesel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s share of UK car sales has shrunk, while electric vehicles are carving out a bigger slice of the market. Rebecca Long-Bailey MP, Labour\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Shadow Secretary of State for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy, says the drop in UK car sales is part of a wider problem: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This is an economy being driven into the ditch. Sales of cars last month were down 9.3 per cent compared to a year earlier. This is worrying not only for the car industry but speaks to a deeper economic malaise with anaemic economic growth figures this year and real wages lower than ten years ago. The country desperately needs a bold, transformative industrial strategy which only a Labour government will deliver.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd This chart shows one reason why Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy is in a mess - productivity has been persistently weak since the financial crisis, repeatedly defying forecasts of growth. The decline in car sales highlights the pressure on chancellor Philip Hammond to deliver an impressive budget next month. The government desperately needs something to cheer about, following the debacle of Theresa May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s speech yesterday. Hammond could improve the mood with some growth-friendly policies, tax cuts or spending pledges. Abolishing the public sector pay cap, for example, might give the Tories a boost. But there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a problem. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy has only expanded slowly this year, so Hammond has less wriggle-room than previously expected. Weak GDP growth means the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s official fiscal watchdog may revise down its assessment of the UK economy. That would wipe out much of the \u00c2\u00a326bn which the chancellor set aside for a rainy day in 2016\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s autumn statement. Chris Giles, economics editor of the Financial Times, reckons that two-thirds of Hammond\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s war chest has been wiped out. He writes: Philip Hammond is facing what officials describe as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a bloodbath\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in the public finances in his Budget next month as weak economic forecasts derail the government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s plans. As much as two-thirds of the \u00c2\u00a326bn of headroom in the public finances that the chancellor created last year as a buffer for the economy through the Brexit period is likely to be wiped out after the government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fiscal watchdog concludes its forecasts for growth have been too optimistic. The Office for Budget Responsibility will publish on Tuesday a new analysis suggesting it has persistently over-estimated Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s productivity over the past seven years and will give a broad hint that it will rectify the situation with a more pessimistic Budget forecast. Slower growth in the forecast will limit deficit reduction and cut the size of the war chest that Mr Hammond put aside to smooth the Brexit transition. This leaves him in an awkward position politically, since he is under increasing pressure to end the austerity cap on public pay, lower the burden of debt on students and build houses. More here. Sales of new vans in the UK also fell in September, by over 4%, indicating that British businesses are cutting back. The Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders reports that: Demand for new vans declines -4.2% in September to 57,368 units. Pickups and heavier van demand broadly stable, rising 0.4% and 0.1% respectively. Year-to-date registrations drop -3.1% overall, as business confidence dented. SMMT chief Mike Hawes says: Business confidence has taken a hit recently as economic and political uncertainty continues, so fluctuations in purchasing patterns are to be expected. The 21% slump in diesel car sales has been welcomed by Friends of the Earth, the environmental campaign group: Conversely, sales of electric cars jumped by 41% in October, from 16,000 to over 22,000. Alternatively fuelled cars now make up 5.4% of the market. Labour MP Chuka Umunna says the decline in UK car sales shows that Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s exit from the EU is causing significant harm to the UK ecnoomy. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This is yet more evidence that Brexit is having a serious and damaging impact on our economy and on the livelihoods of the British people. Higher inflation, lower growth and greater uncertainty are all taking their toll. These new figures suggest that households are feeling the pinch. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Car sales tend to be a barometer for the overall health of our economy, which makes this news even more concerning. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The Government has a duty to put our economy and living standards first in the Brexit negotiations. That is why they should end their ideological red lines, give people and businesses certainty, and abandon their plan to leave the Single Market and the Customs Union.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Ian Gilmartin of Barclays Corporate Banking says the 9.3% slump in car sales in September was a poor result, but not unexpected given the drop in consumer confidence. New plate months are always crucial, and some were pinning their hopes on the usual biannual boost providing a bit of respite ahead of further tough times, but that hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t materialised. The result isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t a surprise because across a number of retail sectors consumers are understandably becoming more reluctant to commit to high value purchases. Add to that the ongoing confusion over diesel models, which posted a 22% drop last month, and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s easy to see why the overall figures have dipped so much. Sue Robinson, director of the National Franchised Dealers Association (NFDA), says worries over diesel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s future are partly to blame. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Consumers walking into the showroom need more clarity on issues such as diesel and air quality. We are working closely with car retailers to assist them in educating their customers.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Andy Bruce of Reuters points out that motor retailers have warned that business conditions have deteriorated: Nissan managed to beat Ford to the top of the best-sellers table last month: Chris Bosworth, director of strategy at Close Brothers Motor Finance, says anxiety over the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s exit from the EU has hurt demand for cars. September traditionally delivers a peak as the new registration plates are introduced, but it appears that the motor industry is struggling to shake off the impact that Brexit uncertainty is having on consumer spending. We are already seeing the consequences of the weak pound on UK manufacturers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 profit margins, and this has made it difficult for dealers to offer customer deals, especially the 0% finance offers which would have been abundant in previous years. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a handy chart showing how UK car sales have declined this year: Diesel car sales slumped by over 20% in September, as British drivers continue to shun them following recent emission scandals. Around 170,000 new diesel cars were registered last month, down from almost 218,000 in September 2016. That follows the revelation that Volkswagen had used \u00e2\u20ac\u02dccheat software\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 to make their cars seem less polluting. The SMMT claims that this trend is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153thwarting the ambitions of both industry and government to meet challenging CO2 targets\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s because diesel cars emit less greenhouse gases than petrol models. However, they also emit toxic nitrogen oxides, which cause tens of thousands of deaths each year A crackdown on older, more polluting diesel cars is now underway - London is introducing a new emissions charge to deter them entering the capital. The value of used diesel cars has fallen sharply in recent months, as consumers worry that some cities could ban them altogether.... The decline in car sales last month was wide-ranging. Businesses bought 5.2% fewer cars, sales to private buyers fell 8.8%, while \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcfleet\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 sales dropped by 10%. Sales of luxury saloons slumped by over a third, while supermini sales dropped by 21%. The slump in September sales means that new car registrations have fallen by 3.9% since the start of 2017. Unless the market picks up, we could see the first drop in annual sales since the last recession. BREAKING: Car sales across the UK fell by 9.3% in September. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the sixth monthly decline in a row, and raises the real risk that British car registrations post their first annual decline since 2011. The Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders blames a fall in consumer confidence, due to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153economic and political uncertainty\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and confusion over the government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s air quality plans As this charts shows, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the first decline in September sales in six years. Mike Hawes, SMMT Chief Executive, said, September is always a barometer of the health of the UK new car market so this decline will cause considerable concern. Business and political uncertainty is reducing buyer confidence, with consumers and businesses more likely to delay big ticket purchases. The confusion surrounding air quality plans has not helped, but consumers should be reassured that all the new diesel and petrol models on the market will not face any bans or additional charges. Manufacturers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 scrappage schemes are proving popular and such schemes are to be encouraged given fleet renewal is the best way to address environmental issues in our towns and cities. More to follow.... Sterling has hit a three-week low against the US dollar, shedding half a cent to just $1.318. Fresh speculation over Theresa May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s future, ongoing Brexit worries, and today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s weak car sales are all weighing on the pound. Alberto Gallo, head of macro strategies at Algebris Investment, blame the prime minister\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s nightmare speech yesterday: Connor Campbell of SpreadEx says there is plenty of bad news chipping away at the pound. There were the lingering effects of Standard &amp; Poor\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s comment yesterday stating that it is \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcsceptical\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 of a Bank of England rate hike. Keeping with the BoE, deputy governor Sam Woods argued that a transition deal with the EU would need to be in place before Christmas to prevent an exodus of City jobs out of the UK. Then there was the report that car sales may have fallen 10% in September, leaving the UK industry on track for its first annual decline since 2011. Britons are cutting back on new sofas, as well as new cars, it seems. Furniture maker DFS just posted a 22% drop in pretax profits over the last year, and warned that trading conditions are tough. Ian Filby, DFS\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chief executive, told the City this morning: The UK furniture market continues to be very challenging and the outlook for the sector remains uncertain. DFS appears to be another victim of weakening consumer confidence, and rising inflation which has pushed up import costs and driven down real wages. Laith Khalaf, senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, explains: Big ticket items like sofas tend to be the first things consumers cut back on when they are feeling the pinch, and a slew of poor sales data from the car industry corroborates that trend. Things don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t look like they are getting much easier either, with DFS expecting weak trading conditions to continue into the next financial year. The SMMT\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s communications director, Tamzen Isacsson, blames economic and political uncertainty for the drop in UK car sales: Reuters has a good explanation of why UK car sales have declined for the last six months: Sales have fallen year-on-year since April due to a combination of factors including increased vehicle excise duty, weaker consumer confidence, partly due to uncertainty around Brexit, and comparisons with record sales in 2015 and 2016. Diesel car sales have been worst hit as consumers fear new levies and possible restrictions on their use in urban areas as the government continues to consult on ways to reduce pollution. SMMT chief Mike Hawes also warns that car manufacturers are putting off new investment until they know what\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s happening with Brexit. Hawes says Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s auto industry enjoyed a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153tremendous run\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd of investment, around \u00c2\u00a32.5bn per year for the last five years. But.... investment fell by a third in 2016, and is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153down markedly again this year, Hawes says. He blames uncertainty over Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s exit from the European Union: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153People are waiting to see what the future relationship with our biggest market, Europe, is going to be before making any additional investment.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone crisis and business. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s car industry is facing its first drop in annual sales since 2011, after suffering a sharp drop in demand last month. Figures due out at 9am today will show that new car registrations fell for the sixth month running in September. September is usually a bumper month for the industry because licence plates change (meaning motorists can proudly drive away with a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcbrand new car\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 to impress the neighbours). But not this year. Industry experts warn that sales may have fallen by nearly 10% year-on-year in September. That means there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s now a serious danger that British car sales will shrink in 2017, for the first time since 2011. Mike Hawes, the head of the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders, says we should brace for a bad set of figures. Speaking on that BBC Today Programme, Hawes warns: Sales have been falling for six months and that trend is probably going to be magnified given the size of the September market. So we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re probably going to see something over 9% in September. Hawes blames falling consumer morale, saying: The confidence that people have in making big-ticket items\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 is just declining. He also cites uncertainty over the figure of the car industry itself. Recent warnings from the government that petrol and diesel car sales could be banned by 2040 have left consumers confused. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll bring you the full picture of the UK car industry at 9am today. Also coming up today... The Catalan crisis continues to loom over the European financial markets, with speculation that the region could vote on declaring independence next week. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll also be watching the energy sector, following the government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s move to introduce a price cap on bills. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not as simple as that, though, as my colleague Adam Vaughan explains: Theresa May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pledge to cap \u00e2\u20ac\u0153rip-off\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd energy prices is about as clear as the average electricity and gas bill. The prime minister promised to introduce a draft bill next week to give the energy regulator, Ofgem, powers to cap the bills of people being \u00e2\u20ac\u0153punished\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd for their loyalty and their inability to shop around. But the Conservatives later admitted that they were only giving Ofgem the powers to impose a cap for everyone on a standard variable tariff, not actually ordering the regulator to impose it..... Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the agenda: 9am BST: UK car registration figures released by SMMT 10am BST: Eurozone retail PMI reports 1.30pm BST: US weekly jobless figures 3pm BST: US factory orders for August",

Yes, but only because it takes time to move people with expensive demands from one place to another, set them up in swanky offices and find them homes and schools for their children.

Plans for a soft Brexit \u00e2\u20ac\u201c one that provides the banks with most of their demands \u00e2\u20ac\u201c appear to have disappeared in a blizzard of claim and counter-claim as the EU and UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s respective negotiating teams lock horns. A hard Brexit beckons. It means that agreeing the legal framework for trading between the EU and a newly independent Britain is fraught with difficulties arising from the rivalries with financial centres inside the EU and the limited time left to secure a deal. Financial industry lobby group TheCityUK says that most of its members will need to begin putting their contingency plans for a hard Brexit into action by April next year at the latest. It fears the loss of 75,000 jobs, \u00c2\u00a338bn in revenues and \u00c2\u00a310bn in tax should Britain exit without a deal. Theresa May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pleading in Brussels last week could arrest the situation, especially after she appeared to illicit some favourable remarks from Angela Merkel, who said trade talks might begin in December. Yet the City knows the Brexit debate is not confined to May and Merkel or Brexit secretary David Davis and the EU\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chief negotiator, Michel Barnier. The Tory party has a stake in the outcome, meaning anything could happen, including a hard Brexit. So are financial firms bluffing if they threaten to quit when the Brexit flag goes up? Yes, but only because it takes time to move people with expensive demands from one place to another, set them up in swanky offices and find them homes and schools for their children. In the end, the very real risk is that London\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s financial sector and the exchequer will be much diminished. Highly charged warning for power firms Change is coming whether you like it or not, UK energy regulator Ofgem told energy firms last week. While Dermot Nolan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s speech was partly about laying down the law to companies who have grumbled against the price caps he will impose, it was also about making it clear there are other big structural changes afoot, irrespective of these measures. In the future, householders might get their power from electric carmakers or tech firms selling smart gadgets, Nolan said. Or maybe they would get it from their local solar farm, making traditional suppliers less relevant or even redundant. While British Gas is the biggest energy company today, the market leader in a decade\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time could be plausibly be an Amazon or an Alphabet-owned Nest. In the meantime, there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the small matter of price caps to implement. Nolan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s message to companies who oppose caps was clear: stop moaning, embrace it.",

                "bodyText":"\u00e2\u20ac\u0153We are the controllers of the funfair, of the rabbit hole ... of the dreams,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd cries an eccentrically costumed showman as a three-dimensional kaleidoscope whirls into life. The ride is one of the Alice\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Adventures in Wonderland-themed theatrical \u00e2\u20ac\u0153experiences\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd designed to inject some pizzazz into the opening of Westgate Oxford, the \u00c2\u00a3440m shopping centre that has replaced the city\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rundown 1970s scheme. The spinning wall of coloured mirrors has a dizzying effect; when the ride ends, you stumble out blinking like a modern-day Alice. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not Wonderland \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the huge John Lewis in front of you confirms that. Rather, you have entered the realm of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153shoppertainment\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, a brave new world where retailers aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t just in the business of trying to sell stuff \u00e2\u20ac\u201c they are also in showbusiness. The more than 300 staff at Westgate\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s John Lewis have been put through their paces by the Oxford Playhouse theatre. The acting lessons, which included voice coaching and body language skills, are part of new John Lewis boss Paula Nickolds\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 bold plan to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153reinvent the department store for the 21st century\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Simon Tavener, secretary of the Oxford Theatre Guild, says it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s useful for retail staff to find their \u00e2\u20ac\u0153character\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, adding: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153You need to put on a face and adjust your performance to suit [the customers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122] needs and wants. \u00e2\u20ac\u02dc\u00e2\u20ac\u02dcSelling requires you to have a sort of script in your head,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Tavener says. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Not one you recite, but one you tailor to your own voice ... a form of improv, if you like.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd John Lewis\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new Oxford shop is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153more than a route to selling things\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, according to Nickolds, who has turned over a fifth of the 120,000 sq ft selling space to 21 \u00e2\u20ac\u0153services and experiences\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, ranging from style advice to personalised Christmas baubles. The retail theatre is stage-managed via an \u00e2\u20ac\u0153experience desk\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd where shoppers can plan their itinerary. One option packs personal shopping, a manicure, a light lunch at Benugo and a Charlotte Tilbury makeover into a five-hour spree. Given the store\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00c2\u00a318m cost, the last entry on the agenda is, of course, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Head to customer collections to collect your purchases\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Shoppers hungry for experiences have plenty of other options. In the nearby Nespresso store, fans of its pod coffee machines are invited to sit down and literally smell the coffee. Staff are coffee specialists who deliver the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153ultimate coffee experience\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, and the store\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s props include an atelier table where shoppers can take masterclasses. Westgate Oxford took nearly 20 years and three sets of developers to complete, despite the fact that major retailers were desperate for modern units rather than the more traditional style of shop the historic centre of Oxford is famous for. The 800,000 sq ft mall, a joint venture between Landsec and the Crown Estate, is now 93% let. Despite the uncertainty created by Brexit, Landsec\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Scott Parsons says there was still plenty of interest from retailers.

Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE 100 closed 18 points higher at 7505, while the French CAC and German DAX both gained around 0.7%. Consumer-focused companies did well, as did oil firms following the jump in Brent crude to a two-year high. America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s solid growth report reassured investors that the global economy is in decent shape. But, Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s IBEX closed down 1%, as traders are spooked by this afternoon\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s declaration of independence by MPs in Catalonia - which is likely to lead to Madrid imposing direct rule. David Madden of CMC Markets says: The political outlook is very uncertainty, and investors are getting more nervous by the minute. Investors will be reluctant to hold Spanish stocks over the weekend, for fear we could see a repeat of the violence that took place on the referendum day. Over on Wall Street, though, the Nasdaq continues to hit new highs. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a reminder of why, from CMC Markets: Alphabet revealed a 24% jump in third quarter profits to $27.8 billion and earnings per share (EPS) jumped by 5.6% to $9.57, easily exceeding the $8.33 analysts were expecting. The core advertising business and the other operations are performing well, but investors are as bit concerned about the rising costs. Cost per click fell by 18% and traffic acquisition costs exceeded dealer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s forecasts. Alphabet is still pouring more money and resources into its cloud division, and this is an area that has huge growth potential. The tock is up over 5% today. Amazon registered a 34% jump in revenue to $43.7 billion and that compared with the forecast of $42.14. The EPS came in at 52 cents, which smashed the estimate of 3 cents. Amazon saw sales in North America jump by 35%, the rest of the world saw sales rise by 29%. Amazon Web Services (AWS) posted a 42% jump in sales \u00e2\u20ac\u201c it is the most profitable division in the company. Amazon is expanding in the cloud commuting, and it is proving to be successful. The share price has gained 11% today. And, that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s probably all for today. Thanks for reading and commenting. GW This is a great fact: By my reckoning, Amazon is now valued at around $546bn, Microsoft is worth $650bn and Alphabet has a market capitalisation of some $723bn. Amazon\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s share price has now surged by 11%, raising the chances that Jeff Bezos will overtake Bill Gates and become the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s richest person. Align Technology, the dental equipment firm, is keeping Amazon off the top spot, though, after posting its own record results yesterday. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a chart showing the rise, and fall, and rise again of the technology-focused Nasdaq over the last two decades: This rally in the oil price will cheer the Opec cartel, who have been restricting production in an attempt to push prices higher. But...it may also persuade rival producers, such as America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shale industry, to increase their own output. It is also likely to push inflation up globally, once it pushes up fuel and energy prices. Boom! Brent crude has pushed over $60 per barrel for the first time since July 2015. Anyone who bought tech stocks at the depths of the last recession, in 2009, is sitting on some massive profits: Over in Greece prime minister Alexis Tsipras has attempted to quash heated speculation the his government is about to cut a \u00e2\u201a\u00ac2.4bn deal with the Washington to upgrade its F16 fighter planes. Helena Smith reports from Athens Addressing parliament the leftist leader insisted that no agreement had as yet been reached, saying \u00e2\u20ac\u0153it is still under negotiation.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Far from being a \u00e2\u201a\u00ac2.4bn deal the government had a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153ceiling of \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.1bn\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Tsipras insisted. The Greek prime minister has come under fierce attack for the deal initially announced by U.S president Donald Trump during Oval Office talks last week. Senior members of Tsipras\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 own Syria part have deplored the deal, calling it outrageous that so much should be spent on a military agreement when the debt stricken country could ill afford ambulances and basic equipment in schools because of budget restraints. Trump had said the \u00e2\u201a\u00ac2.4bn deal would be a job creator in the United States. Tsipras himself recently checked out Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s air capabilities, when flew in an F16 fighter during a visit to the military airport of Larissa earlier this month... Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s some more expert reaction to the news that the US economy grew faster than expected in the last quarter: Neil Birrell, Chief Investment Officer at Premier Asset Management: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The US GDP data released today shows that the economy is stronger than expected. It grew at 3% in the third quarter against consensus expectations of 2.6%. The hurricanes made consumer spending hard to predict but overall they do not seem to have had a negative impact on growth. Inflationary pressures also look higher than expected, but the rate is still well below the Fed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s target. This news is positive for the Dollar and expectations for an interest rate increase will be on the up as well. Overall, the US economy is performing well.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Charlie Bilello of Pension Partners points out that the current recovery has been slower than previous expansions, although it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also lasted a long time.... Nancy Curtin, chief investment officer at Close Brothers Asset Management, says the US has shrugged off the devastation of the hurricane season. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153In spite of the obstacles thrown in its path by two devastating hurricanes, the US economy is flying at a fair clip. We may even see this accelerate in the last part of the year as economic activity that was hit by hurricanes Harvey and Irma recovers, and in the longer-term, we should see infrastructure investment in the areas most heavily affected. The Nasdaq index of tech stocks has jumped by 1.8% in early trading, to a new all-time high. Amazon, Microsoft, Alphabet (Google\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s parent company) and Intel are all among the top risers. BREAKING: Tech stocks are rallying hard on Wall Street. Amazon\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shares have spiked by over 8% at the start of trading in New York, following last night\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s impressive financial results. That takes them back over the $1,000 mark. Investors are impressed that Amazon achieved earnings of 52 cents a share, way ahead of forecasts of 3 cents a share. Alphabet has also opened strongly, gaining almost 5%, after it also beat revenue and earnings forecasts. Traders are also driving Microsoft and Intel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shares higher Daniel Ives, head of technology research at GBH Insights, explains why Wall Street is so impressed: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We would characterize last night\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Amazon September results as a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcPicasso-like quarter\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 with the company handily beating all metrics across the board,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Last night\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s quarter ... is another feather in Bezos\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 cap.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Back in Europe, Spanish government bonds are being sold off after the Catalan parliament voted to declare independence. Madrid\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock market is also suffering, with the IBEX index of leading shares plunging by 2% as the crisis in the region escalates further. My colleagues Sam Jones and Stephen Burgen report from Barcelona: The Catalan parliament has voted to establish an independent republic in defiance of the Spanish government, which is expected to fire the region\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s president and impose direct rule within the next few hours. On Friday afternoon, Catalan MPs voted for independence by a margin of 70 votes to 10. Two ballot papers were blank. The proposal, brought by the region\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ruling Together for Yes coalition and their far-left allies the CUP party, was bitterly attacked by oppostion MPs who boycotted he vote.... Donald Trump will surely be pleased by today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s GDP report, as it shows America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy has grown at a healthy rate on his watch. But....how long will it last? Capital Economics predicts that GDP will accelerate next year, if the US president delivers on his tax and spending plans. But it could then slow sharply in 2019. Paul Ashworth, their chief US economist, explains: GDP growth for 2017 as a whole is currently tracking at around 2.1% and, assuming we see a modest fiscal stimulus in early 2018, we expect GDP growth to accelerate to 2.5% next year, even after allowing for a more aggressive pace of monetary tightening. As the stimulus wears off and the cumulative monetary tightening begins to bit, however, 2019 could be a very different story. We expect GDP growth to slow to only 1.5%. America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy has now posted two successive quarters of 3% annualised growth, for the first time in three years. The Bureau of Economic Analysis says that America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s growth in the last quarter came from \u00e2\u20ac\u0153personal consumption expenditures (PCE), private inventory investment, nonresidential fixed investment, exports, and federal government spending\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. But \u00e2\u20ac\u0153residential fixed investment and state and local government spending\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd both had a negative impact on growth. The US dollar is strengthening, as Wall Street traders calculate that this solid growth raises the chances of an interest rate rise in December: Economists are impressed by America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economic performance over the last quarter, especially given the disruption caused by the hurricane season. For example, here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Mohamed El-Erian, chief economic advisor at financial services giant Allianz: Justin Wolfers, professor at the University of Michigan, says America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s long slow expansion has continued. He tweets: Jason Furman, who chaired President Obama\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Council of Economic Advisers, has the bigger picture: Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s GDP report shows that consumer spending across America slowed in the last quarter, to a rate of 2.4% from 3.3% in the second quarter. That is partly due to Hurricanes Harvey and Irma - so the underlying picture is probably stronger. Businesses boosted their inventories, suggesting they expect strong demand in the coming months. This inventory investment added 0.73 percentage points to third-quarter GDP growth. Business investment rose during the July-September quarter, at a rate of 3.9%, led by spending on new equipment. Exports also rose, by 2.3%, while imports fell by 0.8% -- that narrowed the trade deficit, and made a positive contribution to growth. Breaking: America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy expanded at an annualised rate of 3.0% in the third quarter of 2017. That beats Wall Street expectations, and is another quarter of solid growth. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s equivalent to a quarterly growth rate of 0.75%, faster than the 0.4% growth which the UK managed during the last quarter. More to follow! The Wall Street Journal has compiled a helpful list of things to watch for in today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s US GDP report, due in 15 minutes. They include: Did the economy bounce back from the devastation caused by the hurricane season? Hurricanes Harvey and Irma probably slowed America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s growth during the quarter Did consumer spending remain robust? The WSJ suspects it may have slowed, as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Americans generally don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t go out shopping or dining during hurricanes\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Did businesses keep investing? A strong reading would suggest firms are confident about their future prospects Are US exports growing? The world economy seems to be strengthening, so US firms should be taking advantage and selling more overseas. Analysts at ING predict a strong US growth report: Excitement is building on Wall Street as traders wait nervously to learn how America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy fared in the third quarter of 2017. As explained in the introduction, economists predict that US GDP expanded at an annualised pace of 2.5% in July-September (the equivalent of growing by 0.6% during the quarter). That would be a small slowdown in growth after a strong second quarter, but still a fairly solid result. The data could help determine whether US interest rates are raised again this year. Craig Erlam, analyst at City firm OANDA, explains: The economy performed very well in the second quarter and another strong number is expected today, which will only increase the likelihood that the Fed raises interest rates at the December meeting. While there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no room for manoeuvre on this for the December meeting \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a rate hike is fully priced in \u00e2\u20ac\u201c there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s plenty of room next year with markets severely under-pricing the three hikes the Fed has projected for 2018. Newsflash: US department store chain J. C. Penney has issued a profits warning \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a timely example of how traditional retailers are struggling in the face of Amazon. The company, which runs more than 1,000 stores in shopping malls across America, has slashed its earnings forecast for 2017. J. C.Penney revealed that it had been forced to slash prices, particularly for women\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s clothes, to stimulate sales in September and October. That has taken a big slice out of its company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s profitability. Shares have plunged by 15% in pre-market trading. Rival retailers Macy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s and Kohl\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s are also dropping, on fears that the US retail sector is slowing (unless you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re Amazon, of course...). Newsflash from Moscow: The Bank of Russia has cut interest rates, by a quarter-point, to 8.25%. Russian interest rates have been cut steadily this year, having been hiked to an eye-watering 11% in 2015 as central bankers tried to get inflation under control and support the rouble. Last night\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s financial results are calming worries that technology companies had become dangerously overvalued. The rally in the US stock markets this year has been partly driven by the FANG stocks (Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Google). Those stocks had fallen in recent days, on fears that investors had got carried away. But the news that Amazon and Alphabet both posted such strong revenue and profit growth suggests that Wall Street was right all along, and hadn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t overvalued the tech sector. Thomas Fitzgerald, associate fund manager at EdenTree Investment Management, says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Alphabet reported an impressive set of results on Thursday evening, beating consensus expectations on every measure and delivering top-line growth in excess of 20% for the sixth straight quarter. The results were driven by strength in both core mobile and desktop search, \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcphenomenal growth\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 from YouTube and further momentum in cloud services. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Overall, the results reinforce our positive view on the company, as it continually adapts to a rapidly evolving computing environment, while leveraging advanced A.I. and machine learning capabilities to sustain a high level of growth. Jeff Bezos might wrestle the title of the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s richest person back from Bill Gates today, depending how Amazon and Microsoft\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shares perform today. The 8.5% surge in Amazon\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shares in after-hours trading swelled Bezos\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fortune by over $6bn. That could be enough to put Bezos top of the pile. Bloomberg has the details: Gates ended Thursday with a net worth of $87.9 billion, about $4.5 billion ahead of Bezos. Gates has been the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s richest person since 2013, though he briefly slipped behind Bezos during intraday trading on July 27. Gates ended that day on top. The race is only close, though, because Gates has given away tens of billions of dollars over the years - including a $4.6bn donation in August.

The Competition and Markets Authority fears that customers are being unfairly pressured into making a booking, by warnings about how many (or few) rooms are left or how long a price might be available for. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the full story: Woosh! European stock markets have hit a five-month high this morning as last night\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s US tech results create an upbeat mood. Technology stocks, and consumer-focused companies, are leading the rally this morning. Stocks are also benefitting from the drop in the euro yesterday, after the European Central Bank extended its bond-buying stimulus scheme by another nine months (at least). Alphabet\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s results are also being cheered by technology analysts. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Bloomberg\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Mark Bergen: Alphabet Inc. beat projections for third-quarter sales and earnings after a surge in Google ad volume helped the web-search giant shrug off concerns about regulatory scrutiny and an expensive foray into hardware. Sales for the quarter rose to $22.27 billion and profit was $9.57 a share, the company said. Analysts on average estimated sales of $22 billion on earnings of $8.34 a share. Executives lauded \u00e2\u20ac\u0153tremendous results\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in mobile search ads. Yet the company cautioned investors the biggest costs that come with those ads -- fees paid to distribution partners -- will continue to rise, along with expenses from Google\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s foray into devices and holiday-season marketing. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We had a terrific quarter, with revenues up 24% year on year, reflecting strength across Google and Other Bets,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Chief Financial Officer Ruth Porat said in the statement. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the first time in an earnings release that the CFO praised Alphabet\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s non-Google units, in self-driving cars and other experimental fields, which sharply curbed their costs during the quarter. James Cordwell, an analyst at Atlantic Equities, says: TAC [ Traffic acquisition costs] is surging, but the trade-off between growth and margin is a good one, with overall gross profit dollars still growing in excess of 20 percent. Over on Quartz, Mike Murphy points out that Google provided the bulk of Alphabet\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s revenues Time is a flat circle. Alphabet announced its third-quarter earnings today (Oct. 26), and yet again, it brought in a ton of cash, almost entirely from Google\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s advertising business. The company generated $27.8 billion in revenue, up 24% from the same quarter last year, making this Alphabet\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s highest-revenue quarter ever. (The previous record was $26.06 billion in the fourth quarter of 2016.) Roughly $24.1 billion of that revenue, or about 87%, came from Google\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ad sales. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s some reaction to Amazon\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s forecast-smashing results. The FT\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Anna Nicolaou: Amazon grew quarterly sales by more than a third, helping the company turn a profit even as it spends heavily to disrupt industries ranging from groceries to logistics and television shows. Shares jumped more than 8 per cent to $1,040 a share in extended trading, as the company led by billionaire Jeff Bezos reported that sales jumped 34 per cent to $43.7bn in the three months to the end of September. This handily topped Amazon\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s own forecast and consensus estimates for $42.1bn, and outpaced growth of 25 per cent last quarter. Wedbush Securities analyst Michael Pachter: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This company has finally gotten itself to the point where it can sustain its spending growth and still leave some crumbs for shareholders.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Benchmark Co analyst Daniel Kurnos: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153They are firing on all cylinders. The machine is churning,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The BBC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s technology correspondent, Rory Cellan-Jones, is also impressed: Amazon, Alphabet, Microsoft and Intel collectively hauled in roughly $2.2bn more profit and $19bn more revenue than in the same quarter a year ago. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s according to Marketwatch\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Jeremy Owens, who adds: Alphabet had perhaps the most astounding beat of the afternoon, as profit rose $1.12 billion and revenue $9.5 billion from a year before. The Google parent company reported third-quarter net income of $6.73 billion, or $9.57 a share, on revenue of $27.8 billion. That performance destroyed forecasts, as analysts on average expected Alphabet to report earnings of $8.31 a share on revenue of $26.9 billion. Over in Japan, the Nikkei stock index has surged by over 1% to a fresh 21-year high following last night\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s blisteringly good results from Alphabet, Amazon et al. Mutsumi Kagawa, chief global strategist at Rakuten Securities, says investors are in an optimistic mood: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Corporate earnings are rising to record levels in the world. And the IMF just upgraded its economic forecast for all of U.S., China, Europe and Japan. World stock markets are upbeat this morning after the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest technology companies smashed forecasts last night. Amazon, Alphabet (Google) and Microsoft all outperformed Wall Street expectations with their latest financial results, sparking a rally in Asia -- and potentially sending US stocks to fresh record highs later today. Amazon posted a 34% (!) rise in revenues during the last quarter, to $43.7bn, partly due to its recent acquisition of Whole Foods. That beat forecasts of $42.1bn. And despite investing heavily, the online retail giant also posted net earnings of $256m or 52 cents per share -- compared to forecasts of just 3 cents. The results sent Amazon\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shares soaring by 7% in after-hours trading, popping over the $1,000 mark. Alphabet\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shares are also poised to vault over the $1,000 mark when trading begins in New York later today. Its earnings spiked by 32% during the quarter, to $9.57 a share, beating forecasts of $8.35. Revenues beat forecasts too - rising to $27.77bn, ahead of forecasts of $27.2bn. CNBC explains: Ad prices went down more than expected during the quarter, and traffic costs were higher than forecast \u00e2\u20ac\u201d but revenue was boosted by a higher-than-predicted surge in the volume of clicks on Google ads across the world, especially in Asia. Microsoft, too, had a good quarter, partly to strong demand for its cloud services operation. Revenue from the Office 365 cloud productivity suite jumped 42% year-on-year, helping to drive total revenue to $24.5bn, compared to $23.56bn expected. That drove Microsoft\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s share to an all-time high in after-hours trading. Microchip maker Intel and social media network Twitter also beat forecasts yesterday, suggesting that the tech boom isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t fading. Alphabet, Microsoft and Amazon are all among the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s five largest companies, so these results have cheered investors. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. We get a new insight into the health of the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest economy today, when preliminary US GDP figures are released. Analysts predict that America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy grew by around 0.6% during the quarter, giving an annualised growth rate of around 2.5%. That would be a small decline on the 3.1% recorded in the April-June quarter A strong reading would bolster confidence in the health of the global economy, but it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s possible that today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s data will be distorted by the hurricane season. Adam Cole of Royal Bank of Canada predicts that US companies hiked their spending on new equipment and buildings and stocked up on more raw materials, in a sign of confidence. Cole says: Look for a sharp inventory swing to contribute a sizeable amount to the sequential change (just over 0.5ppt) while capex investment should also look firm (adding another 0.5ppt, possibly more after this week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s durables release). Otherwise it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a fairly quiet day...

That country is the UK. Closing the tax loophole around non-UK companies and commercial property sales would level the playing field for British businesses and at the same time help tackle the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/apr/30/uk-throes-of--housing-crisis\">overheated housing market</a>. It would also generate substantial revenue \u00e2\u20ac\u201c enough to cover the entire public health budget for a year, for example.</p> <p>According to the British Property Federation there is <a href=\"http://www.bpf.org.uk/sites/default/files/resources/PIA-Property-Report-2016-final-for-web.pdf\">about \u00c2\u00a3871bn worth of commercial real estate</a> in the UK \u00e2\u20ac\u201c 10% of our nation\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s net wealth. Not only is this hugely important in its own right, its value impacts on the price of land, and hence of new homes. About 20% of commercial real estate is sold each year \u00e2\u20ac\u201c worth an eye-watering \u00c2\u00a3115bn in 2015, according to Her Majesty\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Revenue and Customs.</p> <p>When a seller is a UK individual or company, they are subject to UK corporation tax on their capital gains. Yet where the seller is foreign they are not. Approximately one-third of all UK commercial real estate \u00e2\u20ac\u201c including most high value property \u00e2\u20ac\u201c is held through offshore companies.

We could not get deliveries due to a lack of drivers when the material was available. These problems are continuing.</li> </ul> <p>Fabricated Metal Product Manufacturing<br></p> <ul> <li>The shutdowns and damage as a result of Hurricane Harvey and to a lesser extent Hurricane Irma have caused refinery operators to reschedule a lot of their planned work into 2018. This delay is having an increased effect on pricing pressure for what work is available, and the small amount of project work is almost entirely being sourced offshore. We are planning on an extended period of extremely poor market conditions and are adjusting our capacity accordingly.</li> <li>Our facilities were severely flooded in Hurricane Harvey, so we had little production in September and are still in the process of repairing major production equipment.</li> <li>The global economies and the U.S. economy are very weak and uncertain\u00e2\u20ac\u201dpoor environment, business, etc.</li> <li>We saw a lull in orders in the third quarter and some into the fourth due to hurricane activity along the Southwest and Southeast. However, this short-term lull is due only to weather and will pick up in the fourth quarter and first quarter of 2018.</li> </ul> <p>Nonmetallic Mineral Product Manufacturing </p> <ul> <li>Public infrastructure spending drives the revenue cycle for our business. We need a long-term federal highway bill.</li> <li>We are seeing the effects of Hurricane Harvey on the activities of our customers.</li> </ul> <p>Machinery Manufacturing </p> <ul> <li>We remain optimistic about the future, although things have slowed down significantly.</li> </ul> <p>Computer and Electronic Product Manufacturing </p> <ul> <li>The world economy and high dollar have been a problem for our customers in the capital equipment industry.</li> </ul> <p>Electrical Equipment, Appliance and Component Manufacturing </p> <ul> <li>Things are generally good\u00e2\u20ac\u201dnot great. Hurricanes slowed down September and October, which are usually two of our best months. Competitors are pricing erratically, which is hurting profits.</li> </ul> <p>Printing and Related Support Activities </p> <ul> <li>The rebound from Hurricane Harvey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s impact on Houston business is still dragging. Some clients did not make it through and closed. Insurance companies are dragging out compensation on claims and slowing the recovery. Our mail volume from hundreds of customers is still down, and we are hoping that they will finally get their businesses repaired and begin to market their services again because the holiday season is upon us, and everyone knows they have to make it now or things will implode.</li> <li>We keep waiting for it to get busier, although we are very busy now, which is normal for this time of year. I see November and December possibly being slower than normal, which is concerning as we use the fat from these months to carry us through the lean winter months.</li> </ul> <p>Beverage and Tobacco Product Manufacturing </p> <ul> <li>October is looking better than September, which was weak. The two months will probably net out to about flat compared with the prior year. We have at least made up our first-half decline and are now up 0.2 percent year to date.

This is an important fact. Seven years of cuts have served merely to return public spending to its pre-crisis level as a share of national income.</p> <p>Total government receipts have risen by more as a share of national income since 2009\u00e2\u20ac\u201c10 than they fell over the preceding two years, such that they are now 0.4% of national income greater than in 2007\u00e2\u20ac\u201c08 (\u00e2\u20ac\u201c1.1% plus 1.4%; numbers do not sum due to rounding).

                "bodyText":"In an uncertain day ahead of a busy week, the Spanish stock market bucked the trend and jumped sharply on hopes that the Catalan independence crisis could be resolved. A positive set of GDP numbers for the country also helped sentiment. Elswhere the FTSE 100 slipped lower, as its overseas earners reacted badly to a stronger pound, which moved higher ahead of this week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Bank of England meeting where the first interest rise in a decade is widely expected. On Wall Street the latest developments in the investigation into possible Russian interference in the US election saw markets slip back. There was also talk that President Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s long awaited tax reforms may only be gradual. The final scores in Europe showed: The FTSE 100 finished down 17.22 points or 0.23% at 7487.81 Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax edged up 0.09% to 13,229.57 France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac closed 0.01% lower at 5493.63 Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB rose 0.39% to 22,752.89 Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ibex ended up 2.44% at 10,446.0 In Greece, the Athens market added 0.59% to 743.57 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 63 points or 0.27%. On that note, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time to close for the day. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be back tomorrow. On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&amp;P 500 continue to suffer, not helped by talk that the much anticipated Trump tax reforms could now only be gradual. So the Dow and the S&amp;P 500 are both down around 0.3%. But the Nasdaq Composite has slipped just 0.1% as investors still like the look of technology stocks in the wake of last week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bumper results. Apple and Facebook, which both give updates this week, are both in demand. The pound has moved higher ahead of the Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s latest meeting this week, with the first interest rate rise for a decade widely expected. Sterling is currently up 0.49% against the dollar at $1.3190 and 0.32% higher against the euro at \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.1341. The strength of the pound has however knocked 0.25% off the FTSE 100, dominated as it is by overseas earners who benefit from a weaker UK currency. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said: Sterling continued to strengthen on Monday, as investors spent a relatively quiet afternoon eyeing Thursday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Bank of England rate vote...Though an interest rate rise on Thursday is far from certain, today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trading seems to suggest investors think we might be in for the first hike in a decade. A UK rate rise is widely deemed to be good for the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s banks but Peter Thorne, senior financial analyst at Charles Stanley, is not convinced: Rock-bottom interest rates have been terrible for UK banks\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 profitability, but any interest rate rise ...could actually be a double-edged sword. Higher interest rates will boost UK banks\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 net interest income but the equity market is increasingly concerned about the slowdown in the UK economy and the negative effects it could have on loan growth and bad debt charges which a rate rise might worsen. Back with the UK public finances, and Labour MP Stella Creasy has found a tax loophole she believes could bring in some \u00c2\u00a38bn to the public purse. She writes: There is a country that taxes British residents, and British companies, when they make money on selling commercial real estate, but doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t tax foreigners. That country is the UK. Closing the tax loophole around non-UK companies and commercial property sales would level the playing field for British businesses and at the same time help tackle the overheated housing market. It would also generate substantial revenue \u00e2\u20ac\u201c enough to cover the entire public health budget for a year, for example. According to the British Property Federation there is about \u00c2\u00a3871bn worth of commercial real estate in the UK \u00e2\u20ac\u201c 10% of our nation\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s net wealth. Not only is this hugely important in its own right, its value impacts on the price of land, and hence of new homes. About 20% of commercial real estate is sold each year \u00e2\u20ac\u201c worth an eye-watering \u00c2\u00a3115bn in 2015, according to Her Majesty\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Revenue and Customs. When a seller is a UK individual or company, they are subject to UK corporation tax on their capital gains. Yet where the seller is foreign they are not. Approximately one-third of all UK commercial real estate \u00e2\u20ac\u201c including most high value property \u00e2\u20ac\u201c is held through offshore companies. Typically these companies are in tax havens, or structured so they pay no tax on the capital gain. Indeed, British taxpayers should be asking tough questions as to why their government turns a blind eye to anyone who holds UK property in offshore companies. Her full analysis is here: Here are some of the comments from the Dallas manufacturing survey: Chemical Manufacturing Our input for October is impacted by hurricane effects on the Gulf Coast\u00e2\u20ac\u201dmonth/month improvements were driven by industrial shutdowns and a prolonged recovery effort. We are having huge problems getting raw materials following Hurricane Harvey. We could not get deliveries due to a lack of drivers when the material was available. These problems are continuing. Fabricated Metal Product Manufacturing The shutdowns and damage as a result of Hurricane Harvey and to a lesser extent Hurricane Irma have caused refinery operators to reschedule a lot of their planned work into 2018. This delay is having an increased effect on pricing pressure for what work is available, and the small amount of project work is almost entirely being sourced offshore. We are planning on an extended period of extremely poor market conditions and are adjusting our capacity accordingly. Our facilities were severely flooded in Hurricane Harvey, so we had little production in September and are still in the process of repairing major production equipment. The global economies and the U.S. economy are very weak and uncertain\u00e2\u20ac\u201dpoor environment, business, etc. We saw a lull in orders in the third quarter and some into the fourth due to hurricane activity along the Southwest and Southeast. However, this short-term lull is due only to weather and will pick up in the fourth quarter and first quarter of 2018. Nonmetallic Mineral Product Manufacturing Public infrastructure spending drives the revenue cycle for our business. We need a long-term federal highway bill. We are seeing the effects of Hurricane Harvey on the activities of our customers. Machinery Manufacturing We remain optimistic about the future, although things have slowed down significantly. Computer and Electronic Product Manufacturing The world economy and high dollar have been a problem for our customers in the capital equipment industry. Electrical Equipment, Appliance and Component Manufacturing Things are generally good\u00e2\u20ac\u201dnot great. Hurricanes slowed down September and October, which are usually two of our best months. Competitors are pricing erratically, which is hurting profits. Printing and Related Support Activities The rebound from Hurricane Harvey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s impact on Houston business is still dragging. Some clients did not make it through and closed. Insurance companies are dragging out compensation on claims and slowing the recovery. Our mail volume from hundreds of customers is still down, and we are hoping that they will finally get their businesses repaired and begin to market their services again because the holiday season is upon us, and everyone knows they have to make it now or things will implode. We keep waiting for it to get busier, although we are very busy now, which is normal for this time of year. I see November and December possibly being slower than normal, which is concerning as we use the fat from these months to carry us through the lean winter months. Beverage and Tobacco Product Manufacturing October is looking better than September, which was weak. The two months will probably net out to about flat compared with the prior year. We have at least made up our first-half decline and are now up 0.2 percent year to date. This is a slight improvement from the 1 to 2 percent annual declines we have experienced the last few years. Apparel Manufacturing Military apparel sewing projects are anticipated to increase significantly. Paper Manufacturing September and October were good months. More positive economic data from the US, more fuel to the flames as far as a December rate hike is concerned. The Dallas Federal Reserve manufacturing index of general business activity came in at 27.6 in October, much higher than the expected 21 and September\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s figure of 21.3. The manufacturing output index rose from 19.5 in September to 25.6. US markets have eased back from their record breaking run last week, which was partly fuelled by a surge in technology shares after forecast-beating results from the likes of Amazon and Microsoft. As well as some profit taking, investors are playing it cautiously ahead of the latest US Federal Reserve meeting this week - which is not expected to alter interest rates but could point to a rise in December - and crucially, Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision as to who he will pick for the next Fed chair. On top of that, traders are also trying to weigh up the latest developments in the enquiry into possible Russian interference in the US election. So the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 37 points or 0.16%, while the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq Composite both opened a few points lower. Over in Europe, and the Spanish market has jumped 2.4%, recovering all of Friday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s losses and more despite the continuing dispute over Catalonian independence. Some concerns were eased a little after a weekend poll suggested secessionists may lose their majority in elections scheduled for December. David Madden, market analyst at CMC Markets UK, said: The Spanish government has dissolved the parliament in Catalonia, and has announced a snap election in December. According to the opinion poll that was published in El Mundo, the Catalan separatists might lose their majority in the region. On top of that, came some positive Spanish GDP figures as we reported earlier. So all in all, the MSCI world equity index hit yet another new peak, up 0.2%. The IFS\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s warning that Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fiscal position is worse than forecast has cast some autumnal gloom over the economy. And with Halloween looming, Anthony Doyle, fixed interest investment director at M&amp;G, has send over some more spooky charts to give us the shivers. This one shows how the G20 advanced economies now owe $135 trillion US dollars, or 260% of their annual economic outlook. As Doyle says: Governments, corporates, and households have never lived beyond their means by so much. This chart shows how the European Central Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s huge asset purchase scheme has driven down the interest rate on eurozone government debt. So, what happens when the ECB stops buying?.... With interest rates so low, and central banks so active in the market, investors have been forced to buy riskier assets in search of a decent return. So if the markets turn south and investors \u00e2\u20ac\u0153head for the exits\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, there could be \u00e2\u20ac\u0153substantial price declines\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd if everyone tries to sell these assets at the same time. After decades of weakened unions, workers now face poor wage growth and limited job protection. Indeed, the situation is so bad that central bankers are now calling for wage increases. Doyle says: For the first time, central bankers like Mario Draghi and Haruhiko Kuroda have been calling on unions to increase wage demands, with Draghi stating wages are the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153primary driver of inflation\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd..... Unless workers can start demanding higher rates of pay, it is likely they will continue to suffer real-wage declines. This has been the case in the UK, with unit labour costs and inflation growing by 16% and 25% respectively since 2008.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd And finally, a chart showing why \u00e2\u20ac\u02dchard Brexit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 could be scarier than the costumed children who\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be knocking on our doors tomorrow night: Doyle explains: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153In March 2019, unless some form of deal is agreed, the UK will have to negotiate trade deals with the majority of its current trading partners. This would be a major challenge as complex trade agreements are not easy to negotiate and often take years to agree to. If the UK finds itself outside the European Union Single market and the EU Customs Union, tariff and non-tariff trade barriers (like quotas, embargoes, and levies) are likely to be implemented between the UK and its main European trading partners. Some sectors and companies may face much more restricted access to the European market, and that will prove to be a significant headwind to UK economic growth in the short-term.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Just in: The cost of living in Germany rose by less than expected this month. Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s harmonised consumer prices index rose by 1.5% per year in October, a smaller rise than expected. The European Central Bank will see this as vindication for its strategy of keeping interest rates at record lows (even though it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s very unpopular with German savers). Newsflash from America: US consumer spending has surged at its fastest rate since the early days of the financial crisis. Consumer spending jumped by 1% in August, a very sharp increase. It may be driven by people replacing furniture and automobiles damaged by the hurricane season. This is the biggest jump since summer 2009, when US launched a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dccash for clunkers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 scrappage scheme to encourage people to buy new cars. Lloyd Blankfein, the CEO of Goldman Sachs, has a new hobby -- baiting the UK government over its Brexit strategy. Blankein has just tweeted a photo of Goldman\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new European headquarters, currently being built in the City of London. Jolly impressive it looks too.... but Blankein hints that Goldman might not fill the site, if it is forced to relocate staff overseas because of Brexit. This is Blankfein\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s second pointed tweet of the month. Two weeks ago, he couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t resist telling his 66,000 followers how much he loves Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s financial capital, Frankfurt. For balance, we should note that the weather in London is rather splendid today.... Over in the City, sterling has risen this morning despite the IFS\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s gloomy prognosis. The pound has gained over half a cent against the US dollar to $1.318, largely driven by expectations that the Bank of England will raise interest rates from 0.25% to 0.5% on Thursday. It could be a split decision; some BoE policymakers, including deputy governor Jon Cunliffe and Dave Ramsden, have sounded a little nervous about a rate hike recently. But the BoE, led by governor Mark Carney, has dropped a lot of hints that a rate hike is coming.... so it would be real shock if it doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t happen. Kallum Pickering of German bank Berenberg explains: When it comes to monetary policy, talk matters almost as much as action. Now that the market is ready and waiting for a hike this week, the BoE would risk a major hit to its credibility if it did not meet this expectation. In short, if the BoE didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t intend to hike it probably would have told us by now. If you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re just tuning in, here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the key message from the IFS today : As you can see, Britain is probably going to have to borrow more than expected over the next few years, and a lot more if the Office for Budget Responsibility concludes that UK productivity growth will remain \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcvery weak\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 in the next few years. Back in London, the Institute of Fiscal Studies is briefing experts about its new assessment of the UK economy, ahead of next month\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s budget. Helen Miller, the head of tax research at the IFS, is tweeting some key charts. They show how Philip Hammond is in a real fix if, as seems likely, Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s weak productivity growth drives up Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s deficit by \u00c2\u00a320bn by 2020-21. This one, for example, highlights how health spending has been pretty modest since the financial crisis, once you adjust for population changes. This chart shows how government is already planning further public spending cuts over this parliament..... ....while Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s environment department has suffered the biggest spending cuts since 2010. The Justice department has also been squeezed - and there are now signs that this is causing real damage: But where could Hammond raise money from? He could increase national insurance, or abandon cuts to corporation tax. But would the House of Commons approve?.... Breaking: Economic confidence across the eurozone has hit its highest level in around 16 years. Following Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decent growth figures this morning, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fresh evidence that 2017 is turning into a vintage year for the eurozone. The lack of a debt crisis is helping the region to catch up with Britain, just as the UK economy slows.... Newsflash: British consumers are still racking up bills on their credit cards. New figures from the Bank of England shows that borrowing via credit cards jumped by by 9.3% year-on-year last month. Britons now owe \u00c2\u00a369.4bn on their credit cards, up from \u00c2\u00a369.0bn in August. This may be a sign that rising inflation, and falling real wages, is forcing more people to borrow to make ends meet. In total, all consumer credit grew by almost 10% per year since June, dipping slightly in September to 9.9%. The Bank of England also reports that the number of mortgage approvals fell by exactly 1,000 last month to 66,232. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s close to the recent average, but may show a cooling in demand... Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s another neat chart from the IFS, showing how chancellors like to hit the public with tax rises shortly after a general election (perhaps hoping that we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll have forgotten by the time we vote again) But, as Paul Johnson warned on the Today programme.... parliament isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t in the mood to raise taxes. The BBC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Kamal Ahmed points out that the new budget black hole might be bigger than \u00c2\u00a320bn (as explained at 7.57am, it all depends on productivity...) Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s another stunning fact from the IFS: Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy would be 15% bigger, even adjusted for population increases, if it had continued to grow at its pre-crisis pace since 2008. Instead, the economy didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t really bounce back from its very sharp downturn after the financial crisis. Apologies, we had a technical glitch with the comments this morning (OK, I might have forgotten to press the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcOn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 button). They\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re turned on now..... The Institute for Fiscal Studies\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 report is online here. It concludes with a grim assessment of the challenge facing \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcSpreadsheet Phil\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Hammond: The first Budget of a new parliament is often the best chance a Chancellor has to set out her stall. She can raise taxes if need be, set an agenda for the next five years, and set in train economic and fiscal reforms. Mr Hammond, though, has been dealt a very tricky hand indeed. The political arithmetic makes any significant tax increase look very hard to deliver. It looks like he will face a substantial deterioration in the projected state of the public finances. He will know that seven years of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153austerity\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd have left many public services in a fragile state. And, in the known unknowns surrounding both the shape and impact of Brexit, he faces even greater than usual levels of economic uncertainty.... Which is why the chancellor may decide to ditch his goal of balancing the books by the mid 2020s... Liberal Democrat leader Sir Vince Cable tweets: And... here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s why the government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s deficit reduction strategy has spluttered. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s report also shows that seven years of austerity have only brought Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tax receipts and government spending back to its levels before the financial crisis: The IFS says: As national income fell between 2007\u00e2\u20ac\u201c08 and 2009\u00e2\u20ac\u201c10, public spending increased sharply as a share of national income while government revenues fell. Since then, most of the increase in spending has been unwound, such that it in 2017\u00e2\u20ac\u201c18 it was 0.5% of national income greater than it was in 2007\u00e2\u20ac\u201c08 (6.1% less 5.6%). This is an important fact. Seven years of cuts have served merely to return public spending to its pre-crisis level as a share of national income. Total government receipts have risen by more as a share of national income since 2009\u00e2\u20ac\u201c10 than they fell over the preceding two years, such that they are now 0.4% of national income greater than in 2007\u00e2\u20ac\u201c08 (\u00e2\u20ac\u201c1.1% plus 1.4%; numbers do not sum due to rounding). So overall borrowing is now only slightly greater than it was in 2007\u00e2\u20ac\u201c08, with both receipts and spending slightly above their pre-crisis shares of national income. Labour MP Jack Dromey isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t impressed.... Every weekday morning, Business Today will deliver the biggest stories, smartest analysis and hottest topics, direct to your inbox.

You can sign up here. Q: Could the government really raise taxes specifically to get more funding for social care and the NHS, as Oliver Letwin says? IFS director Paul Johnson says it can be done in theory -- a chancellor can put a penny on income tax and say they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll spend it on the NHS. But that doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t mean that you actually change NHS spending as the revenues from that new \u00e2\u20ac\u02dchypothecated\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 tax rise and fall, Johnson warns, adding: It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s just a tax rise to increase spending. Letwin rebuts this. He argues that there could be legal safeguards that a new tax would be definitely be used on social care and the NHS. And that would be acceptable to the public, he says. Labour\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Peter Dowd also criticises the idea. He says that after five or 10 years you can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t tell how money is going into spending because of hypothecation, and how much because of general taxation. It also becomes harder to decide how to spend the hypothecated tax revenues, as demands and priorities changes. If you invest in productivity improvements, then eventually you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t need \u00e2\u20ac\u0153hypothecation and whizzes and wheezes\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, Dowd declares. Peter Dowd, Labour\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shadow chief secretary to the Treasury, is also on the Today programme. Dowd argues that Britain needs more medium and long-term investment in the UK economy, to boost productivity. Labour\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economic plan also includes raising taxes, but only for the top 5%, he adds. Sir Oliver Letwin, a Conservative MP, says he believes the IFS is roughly right. He believes that the UK should continue to aim for a balanced budget, as the medium-term risks facing the economy are considerable. Letwin argues that there is a case for raising taxes, if the receipts were used to spend more on social care and the NHS. Paul Johnson, director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies, is discussing the IFS\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s report on the Radio 4\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Today Programme right now. Johnson explains that Hammond needs to reduce spending or raise taxes if he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s serious about hitting his fiscal targets. But the pressure is on him to do the opposite and rise spending - by eliminating the public sector pay cap, for example, or reversing cuts to benefits. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also no appetite among MPs for tax rises. But if he raises spending without raising taxes, he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not sticking to his own fiscal targets. Q: But Hammond could borrow more.... interest rates are very low. Johnson points out that the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s borrowing costs have been low for many years - Hammond and George Osborne didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t taken much advantage before. Raises borrowing also means the UK has to repay more eventually. Hammond could borrow more, but if he does then he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcjunking\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 his own fiscal goals. Q: So what would you do if you were the chancellor? I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m very glad I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m not, Johnson replies. There is a case for raising taxes a bit, and raising spending a bit more, but it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not feasible to raise taxes right now. In the end, Johnson concludes, Hammond may have to say he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not fixated on getting the deficit eliminated by 2025. That would give him some flexibility to take some risks (and potentially borrow more). Newsflash from Madrid: Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s GDP expanded by 0.8% in the third quarter of 2017. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a solid result, and means Spanish economy grew twice as fast as Britain in the last quarter. The IFS\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s gloomy forecast suggest Britain may struggle to balance the books by the middle of the next decade, warns the Financial Times. As the FT\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Gemma Tetlow puts it: When he took the job last year, the chancellor set himself the target of reducing public borrowing to less than 2 per cent of national income by 2020-21 and eliminating borrowing altogether by the mid-2020s. The commitment to strict fiscal discipline was seen as one of the important dividing lines between the Conservative party and Labour in this year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s general election. But Carl Emmerson, deputy director of the IFS, said on Monday: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Given all the current pressures and uncertainties \u00e2\u20ac\u201d and the policy action that these might require \u00e2\u20ac\u201d it is perhaps time to admit that a firm commitment to running a budget surplus from the mid-2020s onwards is no longer sensible.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The BBC agrees that Hammond faces a tough balancing act in next month\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Budget. The IFS says Mr Hammond is also under \u00e2\u20ac\u0153increasingly intense\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd political pressure to spend more, while the Parliamentary arithmetic makes tax increases look difficult. The chancellor has been dealt a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153very tricky hand indeed\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, it says. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Does he allow higher borrowing to persist, does he add to that with more spending, or does he try to offset that with greater taxes?\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said IFS deputy director Carl Emmerson. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Public sector workers, the NHS, the prison service, schools and working-age benefit recipients, among others, would like more money. City AM\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Jasper Jolly points out that Hammond could tackle his deficit problems by hiking taxes - although this would be unpopular.... The Budget on 22 November may also include new revenue-raising measures. One option floated by the Treasury is a clampdown on companies using self-employed contractors, rather than employees, to avoid paying national insurance. Such a move could affect firms ranging from multinational behemoths like BP to tiny businesses with three employees, according to Jonathan Riley, head of tax at accountants Grant Thornton, as well as hitting professionals who are paid through personal service companies. These charts how how Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s budget deficit could be billions of pounds bigger than was forecast, back in March: It all depends how severely the Office for Budget Responsibility downgrades its forecasts for Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s productivity. The \u00c2\u00a320bn deficit black hole is based on a moderate downgrade, to \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcweak\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 productivity - which seems very plausible, given this year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economic data. But the OBR may conclude that productivity improvements will be \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcvery poor\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, at the recent rate of just 0.4% per year. If that happens, the deficit could still be \u00c2\u00a370bn by 2021-22 -- not the \u00c2\u00a317bn previously forecast. As the IFS puts it: If the OBR were to decide that the terrible productivity growth of the last seven years were now the new normal (the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcvery poor\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 scenario, under which output per hour grows at just 0.4% a year), without further policy action structural borrowing would rise above 3% of national income (almost \u00c2\u00a370 billion) in 2021\u00e2\u20ac\u201c22 and rise further thereafter. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Philip Hammond has woken up to some bad news. According to the well-respected Institute for Fiscal Studies, the chancellor is facing a new \u00c2\u00a320bn black hole that could sink any hopes of a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcgiveaway budget\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. The IFS has calculated that Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s deficit is on track to still be \u00c2\u00a336bn by the 2012-22 fiscal year. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s twice as much as the \u00c2\u00a317bn forecast earlier this year. It erodes the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcwriggle room\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 which Hammond would hope to use to either cut taxes or boost public spending. So what\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s gone wrong? In short, Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s long-running productivity problems means that growth is unlikely to be as strong as hoped, meaning the deficit will be even harder to eradicate: My colleague Richard Partington explains: The stark analysis adds to pressure on the chancellor as he appears increasingly trapped between the government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fiscal targets and calls to raise spending as the economy deteriorates and uncertainty over Brexit persists. He is due to deliver his budget on 22 November. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It is hard to see how the chancellor can both maintain the credibility of his fiscal targets and respond effectively to the growing demands for spending\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, the IFS said. At the root of the problem for Hammond is an admission by the government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s official economic forecaster that weak levels of productivity since the financial crisis are unlikely to improve any time soon. The Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) has said it will need to significantly lower its estimates for the economic output per hour worked in Britain. Brexit uncertainty is also weighing on the economy, says Paul Johnson, head of the IFS: Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Richard\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s full story: I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll pull together more details and reaction now.... The IFS report tees up a busy day for economic news. Later this morning the Bank of England will release new figures showing how much Britons borrowed in September; this will show whether the consumer credit boom is cooling. We also get new growth figures from Spain \u00e2\u20ac\u201c which is timely, as the Catalonian independence crisis deepens by the day. Plus, a fresh reading of Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s inflation rate. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the agenda 8am GMT: Spanish GDP growth report for July-September 9.30am GMT: UK consumer credit and mortgage approvals report 10am GMT: Eurozone economic confidence figures for October 1pm GMT: German consumer prices figures for October",
