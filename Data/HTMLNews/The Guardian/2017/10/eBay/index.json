                "bodyText":"At the annual meeting of Starbucks shareholders in March, executives were confronted by a barista who demanded more paid family leave for new moms like her. Now, if a group of Starbucks investors has its way, the people asking that question will soon be the shareholders themselves. On Monday, a group led by Zevin Asset Management announced it would pressure Starbucks to inform shareholders of whether its paid family leave policy \u00e2\u20ac\u201c which offers less leave to retail workers than to corporate employees \u00e2\u20ac\u201c might count as employment discrimination. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Paid family leave is a huge factor in how well women can stay involved in the workforce after having a baby, or how much time out they have to take in their careers,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Pat Tomaino, Zevin\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s associate director of socially responsible investing. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Women and their families benefit from equal and generous paid family leave \u00e2\u20ac\u201c but companies do too.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd It appears to be the first shareholder proposal calling for a company to rethink its policy on paid family leave.

As with the other proposals, these called for the companies to produce a report about whether men and women in their workforces are paid equally.</p> <p>Major institutional investors like State Street rarely support shareholder resolutions they see as dealing with \u00e2\u20ac\u0153social issues\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, such as gender and racial equality and climate change. The proposals typically originate with small investors and rarely pass.</p> <p>But shareholder resolutions have become a powerful way to compel companies to reveal more about gender equality among their employees. Arjuna Capital, which introduced many of the gender pay gap resolutions on which State Street voted no, has used the prospect of similar proposals to get companies like Nike and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/oct/02/starbucks-investors-coffee-family-parental-birth-leave\">Starbucks</a> to disclose and close their gender pay gaps.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/NYCMayor/status/852154909235564544\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Men who don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t like women taking up space are exactly why we need the Fearless Girl. <a href=\"https://t.co/D2OZl4ituJ\">https://t.co/D2OZl4ituJ</a></p>&mdash; Bill de Blasio (@NYCMayor) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/NYCMayor/status/852154909235564544?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">April 12, 2017</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>Just because these proposals rarely pass, said Ric Marshall, who specializes in corporate governance research, doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t mean State Street\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s vote doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t matter.</p> <p>\u00e2\u20ac\u0153Their job is to vote on the issues that are on the agenda,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Marshall, an executive director at MSCI ESG Research. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153They cast a vote, they have to stand by it, one way or the other.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd</p> <p>Occasionally, a gender equality measure nearly passes.

But while State Street may be pressuring companies to diversify at the top, it isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t wielding its influence to promote gender equality for the workforce. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153You would have thought they would, if you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re going to so publicly announce \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcthis is our position,\u00e2\u20ac\u2122\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Peter Henning, a professor of law at Wayne State University. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153But no one\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s watching.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Fearless Girl was an instant, viral success. Within a few weeks of her debut on International Women\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Day, she had starred in nearly a quarter-million Instagram posts. The promotion would go on to generate an estimated $7.4m in free marketing for State Street. Some of State Street\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no votes on gender equality measures involved its She Fund \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a multimillion dollar index fund created to advance gender diversity in business leadership. A share of its revenues go towards charities that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153empower girls to become future business leaders\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, State Street says. Fearless Girl started life as a She Fund advertisement. When the statue was installed, a plaque at her feet read: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Know the power of women in leadership. She makes a difference.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd State Street voted She Fund\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shares against gender pay gap proposals for American Express, Mastercard, and Aetna, according to a document State Street prepared for the SEC. As with the other proposals, these called for the companies to produce a report about whether men and women in their workforces are paid equally. Major institutional investors like State Street rarely support shareholder resolutions they see as dealing with \u00e2\u20ac\u0153social issues\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, such as gender and racial equality and climate change. The proposals typically originate with small investors and rarely pass. But shareholder resolutions have become a powerful way to compel companies to reveal more about gender equality among their employees. Arjuna Capital, which introduced many of the gender pay gap resolutions on which State Street voted no, has used the prospect of similar proposals to get companies like Nike and Starbucks to disclose and close their gender pay gaps. Just because these proposals rarely pass, said Ric Marshall, who specializes in corporate governance research, doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t mean State Street\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s vote doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t matter. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Their job is to vote on the issues that are on the agenda,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Marshall, an executive director at MSCI ESG Research. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153They cast a vote, they have to stand by it, one way or the other.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Occasionally, a gender equality measure nearly passes. That was the case with a 2016 proposal for eBay to disclose its goals and methods for reducing the gender pay gap. A major investor advisory group encouraged a yes vote, saying: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153eBay lags its peers in addressing gender pay disparity at its company.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Investors voted \u00e2\u20ac\u0153yes\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in extraordinary numbers. But not State Street. Ebay urged investors to oppose the measure. State Street did so. Using data from the firm Fund Votes, Bloomberg found that State Street supported gender proposals in just two instances in 2017 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c pay gap proposals before Facebook and Alphabet. It voted against gender pay gap proposals before both companies on other occasions. State Street did not immediately respond to a request for comment. In its voluminous guidelines for proxy voting, State Street addresses \u00e2\u20ac\u0153environmental and social issues\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Although the section is comparatively short, it reads, in part: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We consider the financial and economic implications of environmental and social issues first and foremost. Environmental and social factors not only can have an impact on the reputation of companies; they may also represent significant operational risks and costs to business\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 \u00e2\u20ac\u0153In their public reporting, we expect companies to disclose information on relevant management tools and material environmental and social performance metrics.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd In an email to Bloomberg News, Rakhi Kumar, head of asset stewardship at State Street, said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We are taking into account how the organization is holistically approaching diversity based on a number of factors that go well beyond just gender or pay.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Some proposals, she said, were \u00e2\u20ac\u0153too limited in scope, which can in turn limit their effectiveness\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 This article was amended on 19 October 2017 because an earlier version referred to Rakhi Kumar as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153he\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd.",

                "body":"<p>As we enjoy an era of contactless payment, credit cards and bitcoin, Sunday appears set to signal another blow to the longevity of cash. From midnight, the round pound coin, a British institution dating back to 1983, will pass its use-by date. Is cold, hard money going the way of the chequebook and the high-street bank&#xa0;branch?</p> <p>Certainly, the old pound coin as we knew it is for the scrap heap. It will lose its legal tender status and no longer be accepted in restaurants and shops except for a few including <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2017/oct/11/aldi-to-accept-old-1-pound-coin-for-two-weeks-after-deadline\" title=\"\">Tesco, Aldi and Poundland,</a> which say they will take it for a little while longer. Approximately \u00c2\u00a3500m worth of the coins are believed to still be in circulation.</p> <p>That is a lot of loose change. But official figures show the value of hard cash in the economy is increasing at a rapid rate. Annual growth in the run-up to last Christmas was the fastest in a decade, and the total value of all banknotes and coins has now surged to almost <a href=\"http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/statistics/Pages/fnc/2017/apr.aspx\" title=\"\">\u00c2\u00a383bn</a>.</p> <p>That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s more than \u00c2\u00a31,200 in cash for every man, woman and child in the UK. Research shows the average person has about \u00c2\u00a377 in cash in their purse, pocket and at home. However, an increasing number have much more squirrelled away safely. And most of it is in \u00c2\u00a320 notes, which account for more than half of the total.</p> <p>But this is not a peculiar quirk of the British character. There are mountains of cash around the world \u00e2\u20ac\u201c although you would struggle to see them. There were <a href=\"https://www.federalreserve.gov/paymentsystems/coin_currcircvalue.htm\" title=\"\">$1.5tn (\u00c2\u00a31.1tn)</a> of US dollars in circulation last year, an increase of 6% on 2015, with more than a trillion made up of $100 notes. There were <a href=\"https://www.ecb.europa.eu/stats/policy_and_exchange_rates/banknotes+coins/circulation/html/index.en.html\" title=\"\">\u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.1tn (\u00c2\u00a31tn)</a> of euro notes in circulation in August, up by 6% on a year ago. Millions of mattresses are being stuffed with notes around the globe.</p> <p>Mass cash stashing might signal a widespread fear of a looming apocalypse \u00e2\u20ac\u201c or, more prosaically, it could signal rampant illegality.

                "bodyText":"As we enjoy an era of contactless payment, credit cards and bitcoin, Sunday appears set to signal another blow to the longevity of cash. From midnight, the round pound coin, a British institution dating back to 1983, will pass its use-by date. Is cold, hard money going the way of the chequebook and the high-street bank branch? Certainly, the old pound coin as we knew it is for the scrap heap. It will lose its legal tender status and no longer be accepted in restaurants and shops except for a few including Tesco, Aldi and Poundland, which say they will take it for a little while longer. Approximately \u00c2\u00a3500m worth of the coins are believed to still be in circulation. That is a lot of loose change. But official figures show the value of hard cash in the economy is increasing at a rapid rate. Annual growth in the run-up to last Christmas was the fastest in a decade, and the total value of all banknotes and coins has now surged to almost \u00c2\u00a383bn. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s more than \u00c2\u00a31,200 in cash for every man, woman and child in the UK. Research shows the average person has about \u00c2\u00a377 in cash in their purse, pocket and at home. However, an increasing number have much more squirrelled away safely. And most of it is in \u00c2\u00a320 notes, which account for more than half of the total. But this is not a peculiar quirk of the British character. There are mountains of cash around the world \u00e2\u20ac\u201c although you would struggle to see them. There were $1.5tn (\u00c2\u00a31.1tn) of US dollars in circulation last year, an increase of 6% on 2015, with more than a trillion made up of $100 notes. There were \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.1tn (\u00c2\u00a31tn) of euro notes in circulation in August, up by 6% on a year ago. Millions of mattresses are being stuffed with notes around the globe. Mass cash stashing might signal a widespread fear of a looming apocalypse \u00e2\u20ac\u201c or, more prosaically, it could signal rampant illegality. The rapid growth in cash sloshing around the UK could be a warning sign for the economy, as banknotes can facilitate crime and tax evasion. In a nod to the doom-mongers, the Bank of England estimates some people could be hoarding money for a rainy day.
