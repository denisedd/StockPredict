                "bodyText":"Vodafone is to introduce a tough new global policy to prevent its advertising from appearing on fake news and hate speech sites. The telecoms company, which spends close to \u00a3400m of its \u00a3750m annual global ad budget on digital ads, is thought to be the first to move beyond relying on Google and Facebook\u2019s automated technology. Working with Google, Facebook and ad agencies, it is setting up a \u201cwhitelist\u201d of sites on which its ads can run. \u201cIt is relatively easy to blacklist certain sites, such as those relating to porn and gambling, but it is difficult to exclude content that is \u2013 in editorial terms \u2013 at odds with an advertiser\u2019s own principles and beliefs,\u201d said Matt Peacock, group director of corporate affairs at Vodafone. \u201cWhen it comes to making a judgment about a site or channel focused on fake news or hate speech, what\u2019s needed is a human judgment, an editorial assessment. It\u2019s not possible to rely on algorithms alone. For that reason, we\u2019ve concluded that the best way to ensure brand safety is to use a whitelist approach.\u201d Vodafone\u2019s whitelist will feature sites it has identified as \u201chighly unlikely to be focused on harmful content\u201d. \u201cHate speech and fake news threaten to undermine the principles of respect and trust that bind communities together,\u201d said the Vodafone chief executive, Vittorio Colao. \u201cVodafone has a strong commitment to diversity and inclusion; we also greatly value the integrity of the democratic processes and institutions that are often the targets of purveyors of fake news. We will not tolerate our brand being associated with this kind of abusive and damaging content.\u201d The whitelist will be reviewed regularly to make sure it is \u201cappropriate and neither too broad nor too narrow\u201d. Vodafone\u2019s definition of sites peddling hate speech has been updated to include those that \u201cdeliberately intend to degrade women or vulnerable minorities\u201d. Its definition of fake news sites includes those \u201cpresented as fact-based news (as opposed to satire or opinion) that has no credible primary source (or relies on fraudulent attribution to a primary source) with what a reasonable person would conclude is the deliberate intention to mislead\u201d. The company said an outlet will only be blocked from its whitelist if its \u201cpredominant purpose\u201d is hate speech or fake news, meaning it will not move to block tabloid or extreme rightwing or leftwing publishers if they occasionally are at odds with its new rules. Vodafone stressed that its rules do not cover the type of content its customers can access. Facebook, which has toughened its own policies on fake news on its site, said Vodafone\u2019s new policy would work hand in hand with its own efforts. \u201cWe welcome Vodafone\u2019s new global rules,\u201d said a Facebook spokesman. \u201cWe work closely with all of our advertiser partners to ensure that they have control over where their ads appear on our platform, and vigorously enforce our community standards which include policies against hate speech, violence or extremist content.\u201d Both Google and Facebook have moved to introduce tools to stem the spread of false information and minimise the chances of advertising appearing next to inappropriate content. However, there is evidence that these are not 100% effective. \u201cWhile automated advertising is a powerful tool in a small minority of instances it can also lead to unintended and potentially harmful outcomes including advertising appearing next to offensive content,\u201d said Vodafone. \u201cAdditionally, automated advertising technologies can have the effect of generating revenue for outlets focused on hate speech and fake news.\u201d Facebook said it would \u201ccontinue to work with all advertisers to help them deliver great advertising experiences that drive business results\u201d.

The election outcome looks set to further complicate the process of negotiating the UK\u2019s departure from the EU, as the government only has a narrow majority in parliament \u2013 and even this looks vulnerable in the context of Conservative MPs\u2019 widely differing views on post-Brexit UK-EU relations. Given the backdrop of an already slowing economy (the UK posted the lowest real GDP growth of all 28 EU economies in Q1 2017), it is not surprising that businesses are beginning to express a lack of confidence. We believe it\u2019s highly unlikely that the first round of Brexit talks between the British government and the EU (scheduled for 19/20 June) will deliver more clarity or significant results. This means that companies will have to wait even longer to assess the impact of these negotiations on their business. </p> <p>\u201cOur analysis indicates that uncertainty will remain high in the next 18 months, regardless of what happens in the wake of the election, and we are maintaining our risk rating of DB2d and our \u2018deteriorating\u2019 risk outlook for the UK economy. We predict that, in the long run, the election result could make a \u2018hard\u2019 Brexit - which we believe would be harmful for the British economy - impossible.</p> </blockquote> <h2><strong>Jenni Hibbert, Managing Partner for Financial Services Europe &amp; Africa at executive headhunters Heidrick &amp; Struggles</strong></h2> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\u201cWorries about the future are not just relegated to those in financial services: we recently conducted a wide-ranging survey with hospitality CEOs, the UK\u2019s fourth largest employer accounting for 180,000 businesses in the UK, with less than one in ten confident about the future and almost half describing themselves as concerned.\u201d </p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-593e9c3ce4b00493c827c072\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-06-12T14:12:19.599Z\">3.12pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Former UK shadow chancellor Ed Balls has also weighed in on Brexit today by co-authoring a report which found that a bad deal would be a disaster for the UK.</strong></p> <p>A survey of small UK businesses by Harvard University found that \u201calmost all\u201d business leaders wanted to retain membership of the single market and customs union, to make it easier to keep trading with the EU.</p> <p>Balls says:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\u201cAt the time of the referendum, many British companies thought that Brexit might lead to a reduced regulatory burden.

That could be bad for Britain\u2019s credit rating, which is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/nov/02/moodys-warns-uk-credit-rating-downgrade-brexit\">currently Aa1 with Moody\u2019s, one notch below AAA</a>.</p> <p>But.... Moody\u2019s also suspects that Theresa May (or her successor) will now steer away from a hard Brexit, which would be <strong>good</strong> for Britain\u2019s credit rating.</p> <p> Here are the key points from the report</p> <ul> <li><strong>Inconclusive election outcome will complicate and probably delay Brexit negotiations, a credit negative. </strong>The negotiations with the EU were due to begin on 19 June, but we now expect a delay to the start of those negotiations or at least a period during which no substantive issues will be discussed. The time frame for the UK\u2019s withdrawal from the EU in March 2019 remains unchanged, reducing still further the time available to achieve the transition agreement needed to avoid a \u2018hard\u2019 Brexit.<br></li> <li><strong>We expect fiscal risks to increase because consolidation will have a lower priority, a credit negativ</strong>e. In our view, the budget deficit will increase this year and next, as the government reacts to the economic slowdown under way. The election outcome, with significant gains for the Labour Party which had campaigned for increased public spending, will likely be seen as a \u201cvote against austerity\u201d.

                "bodyText":"Time for a quick recap Sterling has lost ground today as fresh signs of UK political instability rattled investors. The pound has hit a seven-month low against the euro and is close to an eight-week low against the US dollar. Here\u2019s today\u2019s lows: \u00a31 = \u20ac1.1280, lowest since November 2016 \u00a31 = $1.1265, close to the eight-week low set in Friday The selloff came as rumours swirled through Westminster that next Monday\u2019s Queen\u2019s Speech might be postponed. This has highlighted that Theresa May\u2019s position in Downing Street remains vulnerable (and potentially creates a very awkward diary clash with the monarch\u2019s duties at Royal Ascot.) Political insiders are also reporting that the cabinet is split, with some members pushing for a softer Brexit plan. Business leaders have warned that confidence has been badly hit by the hung parliament delivered by last week\u2019s general election, which has left May chasing some sort of deal with the Democratic Unionist Party, which won 10 seats in Northern Ireland. The Institute for Directors said: \u201cIt is hard to overstate what a dramatic impact the current political uncertainty is having on business leaders, and the consequences could \u2013 if not addressed immediately \u2013 be disastrous for the UK economy. The needs of business and discussion of the economy were largely absent from the campaign, but this crash in confidence shows how urgently that must change in the new government. Rating agencies have weighed in too. Moody\u2019s warned that the hung parliament was \u2018credit negative\u2019 for the UK; a hint that Britain\u2019s credit rating could be downgraded. They said: Election result heightens uncertainty over Brexit negotiations and increases fiscal risks, a credit negative\u201d. S&amp;P\u2019s chief economist predicted that UK growth would be hurt. Harvard University added to the mix, with a study finding that most businesses want to remain in the single market. The Resolution Foundation warned that UK firms are worryingly unprepared for migration curbs. Meanwhile on Wall Street, US technology giants are suffering a second day of losses, with the Nasdaq down 1% in early trading. Is it the end of the tech boom?... ...not necessarily! Chris Beauchamp of IG says: Attention is concentrated on the ongoing rout in US tech stocks. Having been such a one-way bet so far this year, this sudden turn to the downside will have caught out more than a few over-eager latecomers. However, those rushing to proclaim the demise of one of the big rallies of not only the past year but the past eight years too need to be careful \u2013 there will be plenty of dip buyers out there who have been waiting for a pullback of this kind of size. And in Europe, the markets have just closed for the day. The FTSE 100 shed 15 points, or 0.25%, to 7511 - failing to get any benefit from the cheaper pound. The the German DAX shed almost 1% and the French CAC lost 1.2% That\u2019s all for tonight. Thanks for reading and commenting. GW Dr Mike Ellington of the University of Liverpool has written an interesting article on how sterling will suffer from the political crisis in Westminster. He\u2019s analysed UK economic uncertainty (measured by recording how many articles on economic and political unrest appear in the media each day), and tracked it against the value of the pound. He conclude that there is a \u2018negative relationship\u2019 between the two, with sterling suffering losses whenever It is clear that the negative relationship between policy uncertainty and the euro to sterling exchange rate is intensifying. This implies that increases in economic policy uncertainty are met with depreciations in the sterling to euro exchange rate running up to June 9, 2017. This indicates that currency markets do not feel the government has a strong negotiation position for Brexit (otherwise sterling wouldn\u2019t be so volatile). Ellington concludes that this means trouble ahead.... This, coupled with May\u2019s lack of support in the general election, should put her leadership into question, particularly when it comes to entering divorce talks with the EU. The very fact that the domestic political landscape of the UK is shrouded by yet another layer of uncertainty suggests that economic policy, the exchange rate, and indeed the wider economy, is in for a rough ride. Here\u2019s the full piece: Why the hung parliament spells economic turbulence for the UK economy The Institute of Director\u2019s warning that UK business confidence has plunged since the general election has caused quite a stir. Here\u2019s some of the best reaction: Markus Kuger, senior economist at business services firm Dun &amp; Bradstreet \u201cAfter the surprising election result, political and economic uncertainty in the UK has risen considerably. The election outcome looks set to further complicate the process of negotiating the UK\u2019s departure from the EU, as the government only has a narrow majority in parliament \u2013 and even this looks vulnerable in the context of Conservative MPs\u2019 widely differing views on post-Brexit UK-EU relations. Given the backdrop of an already slowing economy (the UK posted the lowest real GDP growth of all 28 EU economies in Q1 2017), it is not surprising that businesses are beginning to express a lack of confidence. We believe it\u2019s highly unlikely that the first round of Brexit talks between the British government and the EU (scheduled for 19/20 June) will deliver more clarity or significant results. This means that companies will have to wait even longer to assess the impact of these negotiations on their business. \u201cOur analysis indicates that uncertainty will remain high in the next 18 months, regardless of what happens in the wake of the election, and we are maintaining our risk rating of DB2d and our \u2018deteriorating\u2019 risk outlook for the UK economy. We predict that, in the long run, the election result could make a \u2018hard\u2019 Brexit - which we believe would be harmful for the British economy - impossible. Jenni Hibbert, Managing Partner for Financial Services Europe &amp; Africa at executive headhunters Heidrick &amp; Struggles \u201cWorries about the future are not just relegated to those in financial services: we recently conducted a wide-ranging survey with hospitality CEOs, the UK\u2019s fourth largest employer accounting for 180,000 businesses in the UK, with less than one in ten confident about the future and almost half describing themselves as concerned.\u201d Former UK shadow chancellor Ed Balls has also weighed in on Brexit today by co-authoring a report which found that a bad deal would be a disaster for the UK. A survey of small UK businesses by Harvard University found that \u201calmost all\u201d business leaders wanted to retain membership of the single market and customs union, to make it easier to keep trading with the EU. Balls says: \u201cAt the time of the referendum, many British companies thought that Brexit might lead to a reduced regulatory burden. But now they\u2019re worried that if Britain leaves the single market and the customs union, the opposite will be true.\u201d Here\u2019s the full story: During the election campaign, both the Labour and Conservative leadership said Britain would leave the single market after Brexit - in order to impose migration controls. However, Labour\u2019s Brexit secretary, Sir Kier Starmer, has suggested today that the UK could stay inside the single market; a reminder that there are differing views on Brexit in both major parties... Newsflash: Shares in tech companies are falling again at the start of trading on Wall Street. The Nasdaq has shed 1%, losing 64 points to 6,143, at the start of trading. That adds to Friday\u2019s 1.8% tumble, Amazon, Alphabet/Google and Apple are all leading the fallers, as concerns grow that these tech giants have become overvalue. Ouch! The pound has just hit a new seven-month low against the euro, and is falling further against the dollar too. Sterling dropped as low as \u20ac1.1280, down almost one euro cent today. That\u2019s its lowest level since last November. Sterling is also continuing to lose ground against the US dollar; it\u2019s now down 0.5% at $1.2671- close to the eight-week low hit after the general election. The selloff comes as Theresa May government fails to show a great deal of strength and stability - with the Queen\u2019s speech reportedly postponed. FXTM Vice President of Market Research, Jameel Ahmad, argues that the pound will suffer fresh losses as Brexit talks begin next week. He isn\u2019t convinced that a move towards a \u2018softer Brexit\u2019 will provide much support. I personally still see downside risks for the Sterling and see the potential for the market to become encouraged towards selling in the likelihood that the UK is set to begin negotiations next week and looks very unprepared for such complex negotiations. The whole reason for the UK election in the first place was so that Theresa May would have more powers to influence the Brexit process, but not only has this play backfired, the UK looks more unprepared than ever to go head-to-head with the EU as it currently stands. I personally remain bearish on the Sterling. Carolyn Fairbairn, the director-general of the Confederation of British Industry, has also weighed in on the issue of EU migrants. She warns that British firms can\u2019t be expected to replace EU nationals with UK citizens, at a time when employment in Britain is already at record high levels. Fairbairn also told the Resolution Foundation\u2019s conference that politicians need to concentrate on the economy again.. Speaking of EU migration.... Britain\u2019s businesses are \u201ctotally unprepared\u201d for the drop in migration after Brexit, according to a new report from the Resolution Foundation today. The think tank polled more than 500 UK businesses who employ EU workers, and found that 17% expect no change to the current system of freedom of movement for EU/EEA nationals to the UK. Another 30% believe this system will be maintained for anyone from the EU who arrives in Britain with a job offer. These are \u201ctotally unrealistic expectations\u201d, warns Resolution, because: The Prime Minister in contrast has ruled out either option, stating that her government \u2013 rather than firms\u2019 demand for workers \u2013 will control migrant numbers. The Conservative Manifesto recommitted the government to reducing net migration down to the tens of thousands. The report was presented to a conference in London today, which also heard that the UK agriculture sector needs tens of thousands of season workers each year. The National Farmers Union is urging the government to consider this issue during the Brexit talks: Guardian Business has launched a daily email. Besides the key news headlines that you\u2019d expect, there\u2019s an at-a-glance agenda of the day\u2019s main events, insightful opinion pieces and a quality feature to sink your teeth into each day. For your morning shot of financial news, sign up here: Another dollop of uncertainty has just landed on our plates; Downing Street are hinting that the Queen\u2019s Speech might not take place next Monday after all. Our political liveblogger Andrew Sparrow has just returned from the regular lobby briefing with Theresa May\u2019s spokesman, and reports: The spokesman said that the new leader of the Commons, Andrea Leadsom, would be making a statement about the date of the Queen\u2019s speech in due course. The spokesman would not say anymore, but he would not confirm that it will go ahead as planned on Monday next week. It may be that the government has decided to delay it until it has agreed its deal with the DUP. A delay would be most unusual - and rather irksome for Queen Elizabeth II, who is expecting to spend most of next week at the Royal Ascot races. Sterling has fallen against every other major currency today, according to Bloomberg, which explains: The pound fell against all its Group-of-10 peers on the prospect of an unstable coalition government heading into Brexit talks with the European Union in a week\u2019s time. Betfair reckon there\u2019s a one-in-three chance that Britain will hold a second general election this year. Here are the latest odds: Year of Next General Election 2017 3.0 (2/1 or 33% chance) 2018 4.0 (3/1 or 25% chance) 2019 4.9 (4/1) 2020 8.8 (8/1) 2021 9.4 (17/2) 2022 7.6 (13/2) They\u2019ve also provided some odds for Theresa May\u2019s likely replacement: Next Conservative Leader Boris Johnson 3.4 (12/5) David Davis 4.7 (7/2) Amber Rudd 9.0 (8/1) Ruth Davidson 10.0 (9/1) Phillip Hammond 17.5 (16/1) Michael Gove 23.0 (22/1) Speculation that Theresa May might change her Brexit stance is propping up sterling, says Lee Hardman, currency analyst at MUFG. \u201cThe rise of softer Brexit speculation is another reason why the pound has not declined more sharply following the UK general election result\u201d. More here: Britain\u2019s unstable political situation means the pound will remain volatile for some times, says investment bank JP Morgan. It told its clients that: The UK delivered another electoral surprise this week with the Conservative party losing its majority in Parliament. This means the Conservatives would be reliant on the Northern Irish DUP with its 10 seats to establish a thin parliamentary majority. This raises questions about PM May\u2019s ability to deliver a hard Brexit given the desire in Northern Ireland for a frictionless border with the Republic of Ireland. For sterling rates, this means markets are likely to be caught between the opposing forces of political instability associated with a Conservative minority government, and a potential softening of the Brexit stance. Moody\u2019s gloomy report on the UK\u2019s election has knocked the pound, says Neil Wilson of ETX Capital: \u201cSentiment around the pound took a bit of a dive in morning trading in London. After treading water around $1.274 for the last few days since the election, cable eased back below the $1.27 handle after Moody\u2019s warned that the election result is \u2018credit negative\u2019 for the UK. This seems to have woken traders from their slumber and the pound is on the defensive as we start the week. It wouldn\u2019t take much bad news from the UK political scene to force cable to take another leg lower. Still there is plenty of bid to catch on the way down as the dips are being viewed as short-term buying opportunities. Sentiment remains pretty bearish. As Moody\u2019s points out there is a chance of a softer Brexit but we must also think there is a heightened risk of a cliff-edge exit from the EU.\u201d Sterling is also dropping against the euro, losing 0.6% to \u20ac1.1322. On Friday it hit an eight-month low of \u20ac1.1285 before recovering a little. Update: the pound had now dropped below $1.27, towards the eight-week low struck on Friday morning as the election results came in. The pound is dipping back towards $1.27, down 0.2% today, as investors analyse these warnings from Moody\u2019s and S&amp;P and wait for developments in Westminster. Joshua Mahony, market analyst at IG, says the drop in business confidence, and the slowdown in household spending, are worrying the City: This decline in economic indicators may have been a long time coming, yet with a weakened political mandate and Brexit negotiations about to start, it is likely that we will see the UK continue to struggle. The fallout from the UK election continues and will remain key to expectations for the pound. Newsflash from the Bank of England: Andy Haldane, the BoE\u2019s chief economist, has been reappointed to the Monetary Policy Committee. That means Haldane will continue to vote on UK interest rates and the Bank\u2019s stimulus programme until 2020. It\u2019s not a big surprise, but it is worth noting as Haldane is one of the most dovish members of the committee. Speaking of Brexit delays..... The formal Brexit talks are due to begin on 19 June, the same day as the Queen\u2019s speech.... Rating agency Moody\u2019s has also issued a report on the UK election, and it\u2019s not very cheery reading. It is titled: \u201cElection result heightens uncertainty over Brexit negotiations and increases fiscal risks, a credit negative\u201d. And it warns that negotiating to leave the EU will now be a more complicated process. Moody\u2019s fears that those talks (which are due to start next week) may be delayed, or may not focus on \u201csubstantive issues\u201d for a while as the Conservative Party tries to agree a deal with the Democratic Unionist Party. Moody\u2019s is also worried that Britain\u2019s national debt will keep rising for longer, as the government wrestles with a slowing economy and the public backlash against austerity. That could be bad for Britain\u2019s credit rating, which is currently Aa1 with Moody\u2019s, one notch below AAA. But.... Moody\u2019s also suspects that Theresa May (or her successor) will now steer away from a hard Brexit, which would be good for Britain\u2019s credit rating. Here are the key points from the report Inconclusive election outcome will complicate and probably delay Brexit negotiations, a credit negative. The negotiations with the EU were due to begin on 19 June, but we now expect a delay to the start of those negotiations or at least a period during which no substantive issues will be discussed. The time frame for the UK\u2019s withdrawal from the EU in March 2019 remains unchanged, reducing still further the time available to achieve the transition agreement needed to avoid a \u2018hard\u2019 Brexit. We expect fiscal risks to increase because consolidation will have a lower priority, a credit negative. In our view, the budget deficit will increase this year and next, as the government reacts to the economic slowdown under way. The election outcome, with significant gains for the Labour Party which had campaigned for increased public spending, will likely be seen as a \u201cvote against austerity\u201d. The public debt ratio will rise further and for longer than we had expected, placing the UK among the few highly rated European sovereigns whose public debt is still rising. However, the election outcome also means that the government may now consider \u201csofter\u201d Brexit options, which could be credit positive. While we still expect Brexit to happen and the \u201ccliff\u201d risk of sudden exit remains, the election result suggests an electoral shift away from the \u201chard\u201d Brexit that the Prime Minister had ostensibly sought. Hence, a move towards \u201csofter\u201d versions of Brexit \u2013 potentially with continued access of some sort to the Single Market \u2013 might now be considered. And here\u2019s a chart showing why Moody\u2019s is worried about Britain\u2019s national debt: Britain\u2019s economic growth is likely to be damaged by the current political instability, according to the European chief economist of ratings agency Standard &amp; Poor\u2019s. Jean-Michel Six told the AJEF association of financial journalists in Paris that: \u201cFor the time being, the outlook remains negative.\u201d \u201cIn terms of the outlook for growth, it\u2019s clear that things are not going in the right direction. This latest bit of instability can only weaken the business environment and consumer confidence,\u201d Thanks to Reuters for the quotes....and this chart, showing how the UK economy has deteriorated recently: The shock election result has fuelled speculation that Britain may aim for a less \u2018hard\u2019 Brexit than Theresa May had planned. Kalum Pickering of Berenberg Bank explains: On the continent, most observers have taken the UK election result as a rebuke of Theresa May\u2019s hard Brexit rhetoric of the \u201cno deal is better than a bad deal\u201d kind. For example, EU Commission \u00d6ttinger has expressed hope that the UK may now agree to stay in the Customs Union and the Common Market, possibly by joining EFTA. To remain in the Common Market and thus maintain preferential access to the EU27 market (except for some financial products where regulators will insist that some activities have to be carried out under the direct sway of EU regulators), the UK would have to accept the free movement of labour and continue to pay into the EU budget like EFTA members do. Whether or not a Tory-led government could agree to that remains a very open question, though, to put it mildly. Indeed! And in the last few minutes, Brexit secretary David Davis has played down the idea that the government could soften its stance - insisting that leaving the EU meant leaving the single market. More in our Politics Live blog: Buzzfeed\u2019s Alberto Nardelli tweets: Traders will be watching Wall Street nervously when it opens later today, to see if technology stocks keep falling. Apple fell by 4% on Friday, while Alphabet (Google), Microsoft, Amazon and Facebook all shed 3% - wiping almost $100bn off their market value. The selloff comes after a long surge in tech stocks, so investors are wondering if the rally is over. Kathleen Brooks of City Index says other assets could be spooked.... Friday\u2019s sell off in some of the US\u2019s biggest tech names was sharp and severe on Friday. But was this just a bit of profit taking after a note from Goldman Sachs questioned the $600bn increase in some tech firms\u2019 market cap in the past year? This is an important question that we need answered as tech stock weakness is having an impact on other growth assets today. The MSCI emerging markets index fell on Friday, yet the Aussie dollar, which is correlated with growth assets, was relatively stable on Monday. The BBC has a good take on the IoD\u2019s business confidence survey: The uncertainty caused by the general election has led business confidence to sink \u201cthrough the floor\u201d, according to a lobby group. A snap poll of 700 members of the Institute of Directors found a \u201cdramatic drop\u201d in confidence following the hung parliament. Members saw no clear way to resolve the political impasse quickly, the IoD said. However, it found there was \u201cno desire\u201d for another election this year.... More here: Europe\u2019s stock markets are a sea of red this morning, as investors digest the tumble in UK business confidence in the last couple of days. Shares are being pulled down by worries over UK politics, and the selloff in the tech sector. Connor Campbell of SpreadEx says there isn\u2019t much optimism in the City this morning. Falling around half a percent the UK index found itself back below the 7500 mark, if only just, as the Institute of Directors warned that its members were feeling pretty damn pessimistic about the state of the UK economy in the next 12 months. The pound, meanwhile, neither continued last week\u2019s decline nor substantially recovered any of those election-losses, opening 0.1% higher against the dollar and flat against the euro. The FTSE 250 index, which is more UK-focused than the FTSE 100, has dropped by 50 points (or 0.25%) in early trading to 19,719. The IoD\u2019s gloomy warning on business confidence is helping to keep a lid on the pound this morning. Sterling is hovering around $1.274, close to Friday night\u2019s close. It tumbled by over two cents when the election exit polls came out on Thursday night. Craig Erlam, senior market analyst at OANDA, warns that the pound is vulnerable to political uncertainty, as prime minister May tries to cling onto power. With Theresa May scrambling to repair the self-inflicted damage suffered as a result of the election, there remains a huge amount of uncertainty around her position and with only a week to go before Brexit talks with the EU begin, I feel there may be a few more twists to come yet. May has not delivered the strong and stable government she wanted and instead looks weak and vulnerable. I find it hard to see how she recovers from this. Mike van Dulken of Accendo Markets agrees, saying: Sentiment remains dented by politics following the UK\u2019s hung parliament and shift in the balance of UK political power. European stock markets have opened in the red, with the FTSE 100 losing 27 points (or 0.4%). Technology stocks are the biggest fallers, following a selloff on Wall Street on Friday night. Manish Singh of CrossBridge Capital, an investment advisory firm, isn\u2019t surprised that business confidence has fallen since the UK election. He says many business leaders are now pondering the prospect of Jeremy Corbyn becoming prime minister, after he smashed expectations and gained 32 seats. Speaking on Bloomberg TV, Singh says: If you are a business, you really need to start thinking \u2018what is in the Labour manifesto?\u2019.... It will have some businesses worrying about Mr Corbyn\u2019s policies. Labour\u2019s manifesto included raising income tax on those earning over \u00a380,00 per year, increasing corporation tax, and renationalising the water companies, as well as free childcare, ending the freeze on welfare benefits and abolishing tuition fees. Singh says political instability can deter businesses from investing, especially when the Brexit talks are also hanging over them. But he also agrees that younger voters are right too feel aggrieved, as yound people in Europe will be poorer than previous generations. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. European stock markets are set to fall this morning, as evidence piles up that Britain\u2019s mounting political uncertainty is hurting the economy. The Institute of Directors have issued a stark warning that business optimism has plunged after Theresa May lost her House of Commons majority last week. A new survey of IoD members found that 57% are either quite pessimistic or very pessimistic about the UK economy over the next 12 months. Just a fifth described themselves as optimistic -- which gives a \u2018net confidence\u2019 score of minus 37. That\u2019s a serious deterioration compared to the previous month, when 34% were optimistic and 37% pessimistic. The poll, conducted over the weekend, found that many business leaders are alarmed by the prospect of a hung parliament, just as the Brexit negotiations begin. Stephen Martin, director general of the Institute of Directors, says British politicians need to urgently refocus on the state of the economy. \u201cIt is hard to overstate what a dramatic impact the current political uncertainty is having on business leaders, and the consequences could \u2013 if not addressed immediately \u2013 be disastrous for the UK economy. The needs of business and discussion of the economy were largely absent from the campaign, but this crash in confidence shows how urgently that must change in the new government. This chart might focus a few minds in Westminster: The IoD\u2019s survey isn\u2019t the only cause for concern this morning. Visa have reported that household spending fell last month, for the first time in almost four years. It highlights how consumers are being squeezed by rising inflation and political uncertainty, and cutting back on non-essential items. As things stand this morning, May\u2019s grip on Number 10 is looking precarious, with insiders saying she cannot lead the Conservative Party into another election. Yesterday she was savaged as a \u201cdead woman walking\u2019 by former chancellor George Osborne (who seems to be enjoying his new career in journalism). But the game isn\u2019t over, yet. Later today May will appeal to her MPs for support, in an attempt to remain as prime minister. Our political editor Heather Stewart explains: The prime minister is expected to signal to her parliamentary colleagues that she will run her government in a more collegiate, less controlling way, after sacrificing her two closest advisers, Fiona Hill and Nick Timothy. With many backbenchers blaming May for the party\u2019s poor performance at the polls, one senior Conservative said she would have to give a \u201cbarnstorming\u201d performance at the meeting of the party\u2019s 1922 committee of MPs to hold on to her job. Spread-betting firm IG expect the main European markets to fall by up to 0.5% this morning. While Britain is gripped by May\u2019s crisis-of-her-own-making, France\u2019s Emmanuel Macron is showing us how to lead a country. The French president\u2019s En Marche party is on track for a landslide win in parliamentary elections, giving him enough muscle to start pushing through economic reforms. There\u2019s very little in the economic calendar today, alas.",

                "bodyText":"Carlsberg has unveiled plans to reduce its brewery carbon emissions to zero, singling out Donald Trump\u2019s withdrawal of the US from the Paris climate agreement as a motivating factor. The Danish brewer, whose beers also include Holsten Pils and San Miguel, said it would eliminate brewery emissions and halve its water usage by 2030 as part of a new sustainability drive. This will include closing down small coal power stations at breweries in China, India and Poland, replacing them with renewable sources such as solar panels and biogas. Carlsberg\u2019s resolve to go green had been hardened by Trump announcing plans for the US to withdraw from the Paris climate agreement, its chief executive Cees t\u2018Hart said. \u201cPeople in Carlsberg are more energised after Trump said no to the Paris agreement,\u201d he said. \u201cWe feel we can take responsibility in our own hands and don\u2019t need to depend on politicians for this.

                "bodyText":"That\u2019s it for today folks. Thank you for your comments and have a lovely weekend. AM My colleague Rob Davies reports that the material used in the cladding that covered the Grenfell Tower was the cheaper, more flammable version of the two available options. Omnis Exteriors manufactured the aluminium composite material (ACM) used in the cladding, a company director, John Cowley, confirmed to the Guardian. Read the full story here: New US homebuilding fell for a third month in May, to the lowest level in eight months. Housing starts fell 5.5% to an annual rate of 1.09 million units, the US Commerce Department said. It was the lowest level since September 2016, and reflected a broad slowdown in construction. It was weaker than expected, with economists polled by Reuters predicting 1.2 million starts. Over in Greece, prime minister Alexis Tsipras has called last night\u2019s Eurogroup decision a \u201cdecisive step\u201d towards ending the country\u2019s eight-year-long economic crisis. Helena Smith reports from Athens: In upbeat mood, Alexis Tsipras described the decision to throw Greece a new credit line as a \u201cclear sign\u201d of confidence towards markets. Briefing head of state President Prokopis Pavlopoulos on the details, Tsipras said the agreement thrashed out between eurozone member states and the IMF in Luxembourg late Thursday, amounted to \u201ca clear commitment\u201d that Greece would emerge from international stewardship. A clear sign of confidence was given to markets and a clear commitment [was given] to the Greek people, who have suffered so much. [A clear commitment] that the programmes will end decisively with the end of the third [bailout] programme in a year from now. Tsipras\u2019 own poll ratings and that of his two-party coalition have fallen precipitously as the government, under pressure from creditors, has time and again been forced to legislate highly unpopular pension cuts and tax increases. Now we must step up our efforts to create the conditions for a dynamic recovery which will be felt by citizens in their every day life with a view to \u2026 healing the wounds of the crisis.\u201d Tsipras\u2019 term ends in 2019. In a bid to turn around flagging morale, the government is expected to launch an all-out drive to spin the results of last night\u2019s deal - even if it did not get the debt relief it had been hoping for. Time for a market update. European indices have held on to earlier gains, with the latest scores as follows: FTSE 100: +0.5% at 7,458 FTSE 250: +0.9% at 19,721 Germany\u2019s DAX: +0.3% at 12,725 France\u2019s CAC: +0.7% at 5,252 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB: +0.4% at 20,937 Spain\u2019s IBEX: +0.3% at 10,728 Greece\u2019s ATG: +1.6% at 812.5 Europe\u2019s STOXX 600: +0.6% at 388 The yen is at a two-week low against the dollar after the Bank of Japan kept interest rates on hold and said it was in no hurry to follow the US Fed and tighten monetary policy. The yen fell nearly 0.5% to 111.415 per dollar. Martin Arnold, currency strategist at ETF Securities, said: The theme continues to be the potential for further yen weakness because they are still grappling with the deflationary mindset of the Japanese consumer. I think safe haven trade is the only light at the end of the tunnel - there has to be some sort of significant [risk] event to light a spark under the yen. Foreign tourists came to Britain in bigger numbers in April, taking advantage of the weaker pound. There were 3.7 million visits during the month, up 19% compared with the same April 2016. They spent 20% more too, at \u00a32bn according to the ONS figures. Numbers were partly boosted by the timing of Easter, which fell in April this year but March the year before. However, the number of Brits travelling abroad is far greater, at 6.1m visits in April, up 2% compared with a year earlier. UK residents spent \u00a33.5bn, down 1%. Patricia Yates, director of Visit Britain (the UK\u2019s tourist authority) commented on the figures: Tourism is one of Britain\u2019s most valuable export industries and it is very encouraging to see this continued growth as we head into the peak summer season and beyond. We continue to drive home the message of value and welcome globally, particularly in our high spending markets China and the US and the valuable European market. The pound is roughly flat against the dollar, after receiving a boost on Thursday from the shock news that three Bank of England policymakers voted to raise interest rates at their June meeting. They were outvoted 5-3 but it signalled a deeper-than-expected split among the Monetary Policy Committee and edged the Bank closer to a rate hike. Sterling is up 0.1% at $1.2765, but down 0.1% against the euro at \u20ac1.1423. David Madden, market analyst at CMC Markets: The GBP/USD has been trading within a tight range, the pound hasn\u2019t made any more gains versus the US dollar in the wake of the surprisingly hawkish BoE vote yesterday, but neither has it given up much ground. Philip Hammond has been speaking to reporters in Luxembourg, where finance ministers are gathered for today\u2019s Ecofin meeting. He said Britain must prioritise jobs and future prosperity when Brexit negotiations kick-off next week. As we enter negotiations next week we will do so in a spirit of sincere co-operation taking a pragmatic approach to trying to find a solution that works both for the UK and for the European Union 27. My clear view, and I believe the view of the majority of people in Britain, is that we should prioritise protecting jobs, protecting economic growth, protecting prosperity as we enter those negotiations and take them forward. The poll below suggests other EU countries have no appetite to follow the UK out of the union: Former finance minister Yanis Varoufakis is not the only one sceptical about the Greek deal struck in Luxembourg last night. Kit Juckes at Societe Generale also suggests it was an elaborate exercise in kicking the can down the road: The politics of debt relief are too toxic to cope with so [Eurogroup president] Jeroen Dijsselbloem called for the tee, put the debt can on top of it, lined it up and kicked it straight between the posts and down the road behind. Then he declared it a \u2018major step forward\u2019 that would help put the Greek economy on a sounder footing. Job done. I expect this to be greeted with muted applause by European bond investors, by which I mean peripheral debt should do fine and the currency won\u2019t care.

Besides the key news headlines that you\u2019d expect, there\u2019s an at-a-glance agenda of the day\u2019s main events, insightful opinion pieces and a quality feature to sink your teeth into each day. For your morning shot of financial news, sign up here: The eurozone\u2019s headline rate of inflation in May has been confirmed at 1.4% by statistics office Eurostat, down from 1.9% in April. Petrol prices and hotel stays were more expensive than a year earlier, while phone costs and clothing prices fell. At 1.4%, eurozone is well below UK inflation of 2.9%. The sharp fall in the value of the pound since the Brexit vote has pushed up the cost of goods imported from abroad and is feeding through to higher shop prices. Greece has long hoped that a deal with creditors will pave the way to inclusion in the European Central Bank\u2019s stimulus programme, in turn enabling a return the capital markets. However, Athens will probably have to wait a while longer: A spokesman for the Greek government has commented this morning on the deal struck between Athens and its eurozone lenders. \u201cYesterday\u2019s Eurogroup decision is a very positive decision which gives the Greek side what it wanted and the possibility to proceed with security until it completes the programme,\u201d Dimitiris Tzanakopoulos told the radio station Real FM. The agreement had laid out clear commitments regarding the country\u2019s staggering debt pile and clear commitments regarding its growth, he said, commitments that would put it on the path to successfully exiting its third bailout programme in August 2018. \u201cWe have before us a clear two-year period, in which we can change the image of Greece \u2026 We have a concrete goal. This goal is to complete the programme, for Greece to stand on its own feet,\u201d he continued, adding that the government\u2019s overriding aim was to free the country from the \u201charsh oversight\u201d of international lenders keeping it afloat. Despite the air of triumphalism in Athens this morning, prime minister Alexis Tsipras leftist-led coalition has come under heavy fire for wasting precious time haggling with creditors to get to this point. In the uncertainty wrought by nine months of stalled negotiations, the real economy has suffered tremendously as investors have stayed away. Varoufakis has also updated his blog with an annotated version of last night\u2019s Eurogroup statement on Greece. Sceptical could probably sum up his view. For example, his response to the Eurogroup\u2019s statement that an end to the bailout programme in 2018 could pave the way for a Greek return to the capital markets, he writes: A little like promising pigs that they will be offered flying lessons! On Greece\u2019s commitment to maintain a primary surplus of 3.5% until 2022, and about 2% from 2023 to 2060, he notes: Put a little more clearly: the Eurogroup remains committed to an insane level of austerity (for this is what 3.5% of GDP means) until 2022. After those further four years of mind and soul numbing recession, for those Greeks that remain in the country (and who have not migrated as a result of the utter misery the Eurogroup has spread all over the land), the austerity will be a little lessened until\u2026 2060. (We are really experiencing levels of cynicism that have never been observed in Europe, or indeed anywhere else, before!) Yanis Varoufakis, Greece\u2019s former finance minister, has given his reaction to the news that Athens has secured another \u20ac8.5bn in emergency funds. Greece\u2019s ATG index has opened up 1.2% at the highest level since mid-June 2015. Meanwhile the yield on Greece\u2019s 10-year government bonds has fallen to 5.78% - the lowest level in almost a month - in another sign that investors are breathing a huge sigh of relief at the long-awaited and much-needed bailout deal. Here is how events unfolded last night. Investors have a spring in their step this morning, boosted by the news that Greece clinched a bailout deal last night, averting a fresh crisis. Here are the scores so far in Europe\u2019s main markets: FTSE 100: + at 0.3% at 7,445 Germany\u2019s DAX: +0.4% at 12,739 France\u2019s CAC: +0.8% at 5,259 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB: +0.5% at 20,959 Spain\u2019s IBEX: +0.2% at 10,722 Europe\u2019s STOXX 600: +0.5% at 388 The FTSE 250 - which includes companies focused more on the UK market than those in the FTSE 100 - is up 0.7% at 19,698 after the index suffered its biggest daily fall since last summer on Thursday. Britain\u2019s biggest supermarket chain says it has protected customers from the full impact of inflation. Inflation is currently running at 2.9%, but Tesco has raised its food prices by just 1.4%. The sharp drop in the value of the pound since the Brexit vote a year ago has driven up the cost of goods and raw materials imported from abroad. Consumers are increasingly feeling the pinch as inflation is higher than wage growth, currently running at 1.7% according to the latest official stats. Tesco said that its decision to limit price rises was helping to drive sales, which rose 2.3% in the UK on a like-for-like basis in the first quarter, comfortably beating analysts\u2019 expectations for a 1.9% rise. It was Tesco\u2019s best quarterly UK growth for seven years. Here is what Dave Lewis, Tesco\u2019s chief executive, had to say: In tough market conditions, we have stayed true to our commitment to helping customers - working closely with our supplier partners to keep prices low. Customers have responded by doing more of their shopping with us and as a result we continue to grow volumes, particularly in fresh food. This is a good start to the year, with our sixth consecutive quarter of positive like-for-like sales growth across the group. We are confident in our plans to create long-term, sustainable value for our key stakeholders and to deliver on the ambitions we have set out. Tesco\u2019s annual meeting will be held at 2pm today at London\u2019s Excel centre. The FT is reporting that Google could be fined more than \u20ac1bn as Brussels prepares to announce the first of its trio of antitrust decisions involving the global search engine giant. EU officials are expected to say in the coming weeks that Google exploited its dominant market position to promote its other services - such as shopping and travel \u2013 in a way that was detrimental to the its rivals, the FT said. Google and the European Commission declined to comment. Watch this space. Traders at spread-betting firm IG are expecting Europe\u2019s main markets to open higher this morning: Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Investors will be relieved this morning as Greece finally managed to agree a deal with its eurozone creditors last night to unlock \u20ac8.5bn of urgently needed bailout funds. The deal was clinched at the Eurogroup meeting of finance minsters, which is followed today by Ecofin, attended by ministers from the wider EU. We will bring reaction to the Greek deal and any developments a Ecofin. Here is our full story on Greece: The economic data calendar is fairly thin, but with a couple of highlights: At 10am we get final eurozone inflation figures for May. Economists are expecting a headline annual rate of 1.4%. At 13.30 we get the latest snapshot of the US property market with housing starts figures for May.",

A second factory was built in nearby Avrig in 2009, also to make components for handbags and suitcases.</p> <p>A spokeswoman for the factory finally agreed to meet to discuss details of its production. Senior managers, she said, are French and the materials used are likewise imported from France. After assembly, she explained, the factory exports the goods to France and Italy, where they are \u201cfinished\u201d so that they qualify for a \u201cmade in France\u201d or \u201cmade in Italy\u201d label in accordance with EU law.</p> <p>The European parliament voted for compulsory \u201cmade in\u201d labels in 2014 to untangle the knotted thread of globalised production. For goods produced in more than one country, the country of origin is the one where the items underwent \u201c<a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/taxation_customs/business/calculation-customs-duties/rules-origin/nonpreferential-origin/introduction_en\">the last, substantial, economically justified processing</a>\u201d. Accordingly, the soles of the shoes are always added after they are exported.</p> <p>The Romanian factory affords visitors both a real and metaphorical window onto the production process, as a glass wall opens up the offices to the factory floor.</p> <p>Beyond the window, the work environment is clean and bright and the staff work sitting down. \u201cHere in Romania, these are things that the workers appreciate,\u201d the LV spokeswoman said, referring to the poor working conditions elsewhere in the country that have led campaigners to describe <a href=\"https://cleanclothes.org/livingwage/stitched-up-factsheets/stitched-up-romania-factsheet\">Romania\u2019s substantial garment sector</a> as \u201cEurope\u2019s cheap sweatshop\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cIn Europe\u2019s low-wage countries, workers rights and human rights at work are publicly a taboo and not protected at all,\u201d said Bettina Musiolek of the Clean Clothes Campaign, which works to improve conditions in the industry.</p> <p>Louis Vuitton\u2019s factories give workers weekends off, pay for overtime and use non-toxic chemicals, the spokeswoman said, facts confirmed by the <a href=\"http://www.itmsibiu.ro/\">Inspectoratul Teritorial de Munca</a>, the labour inspectorate in nearby Sibiu. Somarest is a point of pride in this community, the inspectorate made clear. \u201cThere have been no complaints, \u201d said Enciu Dumitru.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1ee728da290dd66a89b88ac4c98c8c1146c5e849\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1ee728da290dd66a89b88ac4c98c8c1146c5e849/837_1035_4061_2437/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Louis Vuitton pokerface ankle boot, spotted in Duesseldorf, Germany.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Louis Vuitton pokerface ankle boot, spotted in Duesseldorf, Germany.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Christian Vierig/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The <a href=\"http://somarest.ro/despre-noi/\">factories employ 734 local people</a> who, according to the spokeswoman, are paid average Romanian garment worker wages. According to Clean Clothes Campaign, that is about \u20ac133 (\u00a3116) a month. At that rate it would take a worker nearly six months to earn enough to buy a single pair of mid-priced Louis Vuitton leather court shoes.</p> <p>At such wage rates, garment production in Romania is cheaper than elsewhere in the EU, but lower prices do not mean lower quality, according to Ioana Ciolacu, a leading Romanian fashion designer. \u201cNor should it be mistaken for child labour, sweatshops and all those horror stories we hear now and then happening in let\u2019s say China or Bangladesh,\u201d she said.</p> <p>The products at Somarest are moulded and stitched by hand, just as they are in Louis Vuitton\u2019s advertisements, but the craft is not handed down through generations. Most of the workers are trained on site.</p> <p>Ten years ago the brand opened <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://eu.louisvuitton.com/eng-e1/point-of-sale/romania/louis-vuitton-bucarest-mariott\">a store in Bucharest</a> . Shoes produced in Romania can therefore be soled and labeled in France or Italy and then sent back to the Romanian capital to be sold as goods made elsewhere.</p> <p>The start of this process can be seen through the big glass window that overlooks the Somarest factory floor and the hundreds of workers inside.Visitors are closely watched, however, and it was a matter of just a few moments before a senior manager appeared to usher the Guardian away from the glass \u2013 and to direct the spokeswoman into an office for a conversation that appeared terse and stern. The factory visit then came to an abrupt end.</p> <p>\u2022The average wage stated in the original article was from a 2014 report from the Clean Clothes Campaign. Since then the minimum wage has been raised to about \u20ac321.17 gross or \u20ac232 after tax. As the company pays a standard wage for Romanian garment workers, the current wages are therefore likely to reflect that increase.</p>",

After assembly, she explained, the factory exports the goods to France and Italy, where they are \u201cfinished\u201d so that they qualify for a \u201cmade in France\u201d or \u201cmade in Italy\u201d label in accordance with EU law. The European parliament voted for compulsory \u201cmade in\u201d labels in 2014 to untangle the knotted thread of globalised production. For goods produced in more than one country, the country of origin is the one where the items underwent \u201cthe last, substantial, economically justified processing\u201d. Accordingly, the soles of the shoes are always added after they are exported. The Romanian factory affords visitors both a real and metaphorical window onto the production process, as a glass wall opens up the offices to the factory floor. Beyond the window, the work environment is clean and bright and the staff work sitting down. \u201cHere in Romania, these are things that the workers appreciate,\u201d the LV spokeswoman said, referring to the poor working conditions elsewhere in the country that have led campaigners to describe Romania\u2019s substantial garment sector as \u201cEurope\u2019s cheap sweatshop\u201d. \u201cIn Europe\u2019s low-wage countries, workers rights and human rights at work are publicly a taboo and not protected at all,\u201d said Bettina Musiolek of the Clean Clothes Campaign, which works to improve conditions in the industry. Louis Vuitton\u2019s factories give workers weekends off, pay for overtime and use non-toxic chemicals, the spokeswoman said, facts confirmed by the Inspectoratul Teritorial de Munca, the labour inspectorate in nearby Sibiu. Somarest is a point of pride in this community, the inspectorate made clear. \u201cThere have been no complaints, \u201d said Enciu Dumitru. The factories employ 734 local people who, according to the spokeswoman, are paid average Romanian garment worker wages. According to Clean Clothes Campaign, that is about \u20ac133 (\u00a3116) a month. At that rate it would take a worker nearly six months to earn enough to buy a single pair of mid-priced Louis Vuitton leather court shoes. At such wage rates, garment production in Romania is cheaper than elsewhere in the EU, but lower prices do not mean lower quality, according to Ioana Ciolacu, a leading Romanian fashion designer. \u201cNor should it be mistaken for child labour, sweatshops and all those horror stories we hear now and then happening in let\u2019s say China or Bangladesh,\u201d she said. The products at Somarest are moulded and stitched by hand, just as they are in Louis Vuitton\u2019s advertisements, but the craft is not handed down through generations. Most of the workers are trained on site. Ten years ago the brand opened a store in Bucharest . Shoes produced in Romania can therefore be soled and labeled in France or Italy and then sent back to the Romanian capital to be sold as goods made elsewhere. The start of this process can be seen through the big glass window that overlooks the Somarest factory floor and the hundreds of workers inside.Visitors are closely watched, however, and it was a matter of just a few moments before a senior manager appeared to usher the Guardian away from the glass \u2013 and to direct the spokeswoman into an office for a conversation that appeared terse and stern. The factory visit then came to an abrupt end. \u2022The average wage stated in the original article was from a 2014 report from the Clean Clothes Campaign. Since then the minimum wage has been raised to about \u20ac321.17 gross or \u20ac232 after tax. As the company pays a standard wage for Romanian garment workers, the current wages are therefore likely to reflect that increase.",

Plenty of middle-income families, coping with mega-mortgages, car loans and ballooning credit card bills, are concerned about the cost of credit.</p> <p>This week was particularly confusing for anyone who tries to read the Threadneedle Street runes. On Tuesday morning at the Mansion House in the City of London, Mark Carney was clearly worried about the impact of Brexit, Britain\u2019s low productivity and slow wages growth. The Bank\u2019s governor would vote against raising rates for a long time to come, he said in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/jun/20/bank-of-england-mark-carney-interest-rates-hold-brexit-eu\" title=\"\">a speech that sent the pound plummeting</a>.</p> <p>The currency rallied on Wednesday when the Bank\u2019s chief economist, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/jun/21/bank-of-england-interest-rate-rise-andy-haldane-mark-carney-mpc\" title=\"\">Andy Haldane</a>, usually a nailed-on supporter of low rates, said the time was nearing when he might vote for a rise. Despite agreeing with Carney that the UK economy was entering choppy waters during the Brexit negotiations, he warned that without higher interest rates the Bank would be impotent when the next crash came along. The time for a rise was therefore imminent.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/jun/22/inflation-rate-increase-economy-bank-mpc-member\" title=\"\">Kristin Forbes</a>, who is about to be replaced by London School of Economics academic Silvana Tenreyro, has long argued for higher rates as a way of arming the central bank for the next financial war. She popped up on Thursday to accuse her colleagues on the monetary policy committee of keeping rates low by virtue of a colossal misjudgment.</p> <p>They had failed to understand that inflation would soon rocket, demanding a rise in rates to calm the situation. Also, the use of regulation to keep the banking sector in check denied the central bank a significant reason for raising rates. When macro-prudential tools were used aggressively, there was no need for higher rates to curb excessive bank lending.</p> <p>But all this antagonistic energy appears to cancel itself out, leaving the situation unchanged. And that looks like being the case for some time. Maybe the infighting shows that, after almost 10 years without a rate rise, the MPC is getting bored. More likely, the majority of members can see consumers and businesses need all the help they can get at the moment, and ultra-cheap credit is worth fighting for.</p> <h2>HS2 needs high-speed experts from overseas</h2> <p>The uproar over the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/bidders-for-2-rail-franchises-named-by-government\" title=\"\">shortlist of foreign firms</a> battling to run Britain\u2019s high speed HS2 trains from 2026 needs a little perspective.</p> <p>First, those Chinese, Italian and French rail companies have already operated trains in such far-flung places as Essex and south London without arousing concern. Second, the Department for Transport stipulated that bidders should have experience of running high-speed services. In Britain, such trains have only ever been run by Govia, operator of the High Speed 1 route but better known as the arch-villains behind the Southern network.</p> <p>Yes, Govia is partly French too, with ownership of the company split between France\u2019s SNCF \u2013 also bidding for HS2 \u2013 and the UK\u2019s Go-Ahead Group. But SNCF has an enviable reputation as a high-speed pioneer; Trenitalia is likewise an experienced operator; and Guangshen Railway has teamed up with Hong Kong\u2019s excellent MTR. Britain\u2019s long-suffering commuters should get on board.</p>",

Kristin Forbes, who is about to be replaced by London School of Economics academic Silvana Tenreyro, has long argued for higher rates as a way of arming the central bank for the next financial war. She popped up on Thursday to accuse her colleagues on the monetary policy committee of keeping rates low by virtue of a colossal misjudgment. They had failed to understand that inflation would soon rocket, demanding a rise in rates to calm the situation. Also, the use of regulation to keep the banking sector in check denied the central bank a significant reason for raising rates. When macro-prudential tools were used aggressively, there was no need for higher rates to curb excessive bank lending. But all this antagonistic energy appears to cancel itself out, leaving the situation unchanged. And that looks like being the case for some time. Maybe the infighting shows that, after almost 10 years without a rate rise, the MPC is getting bored. More likely, the majority of members can see consumers and businesses need all the help they can get at the moment, and ultra-cheap credit is worth fighting for. HS2 needs high-speed experts from overseas The uproar over the shortlist of foreign firms battling to run Britain\u2019s high speed HS2 trains from 2026 needs a little perspective. First, those Chinese, Italian and French rail companies have already operated trains in such far-flung places as Essex and south London without arousing concern. Second, the Department for Transport stipulated that bidders should have experience of running high-speed services. In Britain, such trains have only ever been run by Govia, operator of the High Speed 1 route but better known as the arch-villains behind the Southern network. Yes, Govia is partly French too, with ownership of the company split between France\u2019s SNCF \u2013 also bidding for HS2 \u2013 and the UK\u2019s Go-Ahead Group. But SNCF has an enviable reputation as a high-speed pioneer; Trenitalia is likewise an experienced operator; and Guangshen Railway has teamed up with Hong Kong\u2019s excellent MTR. Britain\u2019s long-suffering commuters should get on board.",

                "bodyText":"The European Union has handed Google a record-breaking \u20ac2.42bn (\u00a32.14bn) fine for abusing its dominance of the search engine market in building its online shopping service, in a dramatic decision that has far-reaching implications for the company. By artificially and illegally promoting its own price comparison service in searches, Google denied both its consumers real choice and rival firms the ability to compete on a level playing field, European regulators said. The Silicon Valley giant has 90 days to stop its illegal activities and explain how it will reform its ways or face fines of up to \u20ac10.6m a day, which equates to 5% of the average daily worldwide turnover of its parent company Alphabet. On the back of the finding that Google is the dominant player in the European search engine market, the EU regulator is further investigating how else the company may have abused its position, specifically in its provision of maps, images and information on local services. The commission\u2019s decision, following a seven-year probe into Google\u2019s dominance in searches and smartphones, suggests the company may need to fundamentally rethink the way it operates.

In a second investigation into AdSense, a Google service that allows websites to run targeted ads, the commission is concerned that Google has reduced choice by preventing sites from sourcing search ads from competitors.

                "bodyText":"And finally (probably), European stock markets have ended the day in the red. In London the FTSE100 lost 12 points to 7434, despite mining shares rallying, and there were deeper losses in Europe. Currency moves are to blame; the euro strengthened after ECB president Mario Draghi spoke about reflation returning to the Eurozone as its recovery picked up. The pound gained against the US dollar after the IMF cut its growth forecasts. Political developments in Scotland also nudged sterling up, as Josh Mahony of IG explains: News that the SNP have formally abandoned their plan for a second referendum before the completion of Brexit has helped the pound\u2019s ascent, with GBPUSD hitting the highest level in a week. The IMF cut their outlook for the US economy today, which when considering the negative path of core PCE inflation, makes a September rate hike increasingly unlikely. Newsflash: American consumer morale has jumped this month, despite the IMF\u2019s concerns about the US economy. The Conference Board\u2019s consumer confidence index rose in June to 118.9, defying expectations that it would fall to 116.0 this month. Optimism is close to a 16-year high, says Lynn Franco of the The Conference Board: \u201cExpectations for the short-term have eased somewhat, but are still upbeat. Overall, consumers anticipate the economy will continue expanding in the months ahead, but they do not foresee the pace of growth accelerating.\u201d Howard Archer, Chief Economic Advisor to the EY ITEM Club, is struck by the Bank of England\u2019s decision to bring forwards its consumer credit stress tests by a couple of months: \u201cThe risk to financial stability coming from the recent rapid growth in consumer credit would undoubtedly be magnified if there is a near-term interest rate hike. While any interest rate hike would be small with further increases some way off, even small increases could cause problems for some consumers given their high borrowing levels. \u201cIt is notable that the Bank of England is bringing forward its testing of banks\u2019 ability to cope with major losses on consumer loans to September from November. Additionally, regulators will in July publish their expectations for lenders in the consumer credit market.\u201d Wall Street has opened lower, with the IMF\u2019s downgraded growth forecasts dampening the mood in New York. The main indices are all in the red, with shares in Alphabet (Google) shedding more than 1.2% after it was slapped with a \u20ac2.4bn fine by Brussels today. The news that the IMF has downgraded its US growth forecasts and criticised Trump\u2019s budget plans, has sent a ripple through the financial markets. Here\u2019s some snap reaction: Here\u2019s more reaction to the Bank of England\u2019s financial stability report, from Hannah Maundrell, Editor in Chief of money.co.uk: \u201cThe Bank of England is right to flag our debt binge as a big concern. Rock bottom interest rates have made borrowing cheap and we\u2019ve definitely been making the most of it. The harsh reality is many households would struggle to pay back what they owe if interest rates went up. Many are just about managing now and have little in savings to fall back on. Banks need to be prepared for this worst case scenario so they aren\u2019t on shaky ground if rates go up.\u201d Newsflash: The International Monetary Fund has cut its US growth forecasts, and concluded that Donald Trump won\u2019t boost economic activity after all. The IMF now expects US GDP to rise by 2.1% in 2017, down from 2.3% back in April. For 2018, it also sees growth of 2.1%, down from 2.5% three months ago. The IMF had hoped that Trump\u2019s pledge to boost fiscal spending, and cut taxes, would deliver a economic boost. But having seen the president in action, the Fund has had a rethink. Importantly, it criticises Trump\u2019s recent budget proposals, warning that they benefit the richest Americans more than the rest. Reuters explains: The IMF said the Trump administration\u2019s latest budget plans would place a disproportionate share of spending cuts onto low-and middle-income households, adding \u201cthis would appear counter to the budget\u2019s goals of promoting safety and prosperity for all Americans.\u201d Instead, the Fund suggested a tax policy that would improve the federal revenue-to-GDP ratio, more balanced cuts that strengthen the social safety net\u2019s efficiency, and efforts to contain healthcare cost inflation. It\u2019s been an eventful couple of days in Greece, where prime minister Alexis Tsipras has held emergency talks with striking municipal rubbish collectors over demands for expiring short-term contracts to be replaced with permanent jobs. With the sweltering heat fuelling mounting concerns that mounds of uncollected rubbish could soon become a public health risk, Tsipras invited unionists representing the workers to his office for talks last night. In a statement his office said the invitation was addressed to unionists \u201cto find a solution to the claims of the refuge workers and to avoid the dangers to public heath\u201d posed by the prolonged strike\u201d and very high temperatures that are expected in the coming days.\u201d Earlier today, scuffles broke out between unionists and security guards outside the building housing the prime minister\u2019s quarters when attempts were made to unfold banners emblazoned with slogans and demands. The meeting is being described as critical by insiders who say given the heat wave now gripping Greece - and the arrival of hundreds of thousands of tourists in the capital alone - the strike has become a major political issue. How Tsipras will be able to negotiate his way out of the crisis - and keep labour reform demanding international creditors on board - is anyone\u2019s guess. Alex Buttle, director of car buying website Motorway.co.uk, argues that Mark Carney is right to worry about the boom in car loans. Here\u2019s why: \u201cThe growth of Personal Contract Plans over the past few years has been astronomical, and the level of consumer debt this is causing is getting out of hand. \u201cDespite the many hidden costs, it\u2019s hard to resist the temptation of owning a new luxury car without having to find tens of thousands of pounds upfront to pay for it. \u201cThe problem is that household finances are starting to get stretched and many people are probably living beyond their means because of readily available credit, including car loans. \u201cIf people really do start to struggle financially, then the priority will be keeping a roof over their heads, and they are far more likely to default on a car loan than a mortgage. \u201cWe could well see a spike in people defaulting on their car loans in favour of losing their home if the economic climate takes a turn for the worst.\u201d The pound has inched higher against the US dollar through the day, and is currently 0.3% higher at $1.2764. However, it is still down 0.5% against the euro at \u20ac1.1314, after ECB chief Mario Draghi gave an optimistic view of the eurozone economy. Connor Campbell of SpreadEx says that the \u201cbarrage of information\u201d in the Bank of England\u2019s financial stability review didn\u2019t actually move the markets that much. He says: The FTSE maintained its 15 point drop, the gains in the commodity and banking sectors \u2013 the former benefiting from a Brent Crude bounce, the latter from yesterday\u2019s Italian bank bailout \u2013 failing to counteract the effects of the drop in consumer confidence revealed by YouGov. As for the pound, while it suffered some serious losses against the euro, it still managed to climb 0.2% against the dollar. That wasn\u2019t the most illuminating press conference with Mark Carney, but here\u2019s what we learned. The Bank of England is pushing the UK financial sector to prepare for a downturn, by making them hold an extra \u00a311bn of capital. But.... Carney says this won\u2019t be a problem, as banks already hold more capital than required, since the rule were relaxed after the Brexit vote. As Carney puts it: We want to move the levels of capital back up to the level they should be -- any time you move into more benign credit conditions there have been fewer defaults. The BoE is concerned that some lenders are becoming too reckless, saying that: \u201cConsumer credit has increased rapidly. Lending conditions in the mortgage market are becoming easier. Lenders may be placing undue weight on the recent performance of loans in benign conditions.\u201d The Bank\u2019s key target appears to be complacency, as it scrambles to bring its consumer credit stress tests forward by three months to September. It is particularly interested in the car market, following the boom in \u201cPersonal Contract Purchase\u201d deals. These allow customers to pay a monthly fee for a new car, and then either pay a hefty \u2018balloon payment\u2019 to actually own it, or switch to a new deal with a new vehicle. The fear is that customers could be left high and dry if financial conditions tighten. However (and this is where the confusion starts) the Bank doesn\u2019t want consumers to cut up their credit cards and stop trying to shimmy up the housing ladder. Instead, it wants them to be sensible when borrowing, and trust that the Bank is keeping the financial system strong. Those families who are most over-extended, and wouldn\u2019t cope with higher borrowing costs, are a concern, though: On Brexit, Carney repeatedly said the Bank\u2019s contingency planning is focusing on the most disruptive scenario, in which Britain crashes out of the EU without a deal. But that doesn\u2019t mean the BoE expects such a cliff-edge exit..... If you\u2019re just tuning in, here\u2019s Jill Treanor\u2019s story about the Bank of England\u2019s financial stability report: Final question: Q: You say you expect to raise the counter-cyclical buffer to 1% in November, but could Brexit force a cut back from 0.5% to 0% (reversing today\u2019s move) Mark Carney says the BoE thinks the buffer should be around 1% in stable times. The BoE had started the process of raising the buffer last year, before the Brexit vote, which led it to be cut back to 0% to take worries about lending \u2018off the table\u2019. So.... we could have decided to hike the buffer to 1% today, but it was more sensible to allow a \u2018gradual build\u2019 (to 0.5% today, and 1% in November) On Brexit, we want the system to be as resilient as possible to prepare for any outcome in 640 days time, he concludes. I think that means the BoE want the banking sector to be well capitalised, in case of any Brexit shock in March 2019, when Britain leaves the EU. Q: You say that West End asset prices are \u2018unsustainable\u2019; when might they return to reality, and what impact would that happen? Carney reiterates his earlier point that Britain currently have \u201cVery low risk-free rates, and high valuation levels\u201d. So either those rates should rise, or asset prices should fall. It would be foolish to put a timescale on it - prices can stay unsustainable for a long time, and then correct quickly, he warns. Q: The report talks about the need for \u2018consistent implementation\u2019 of international standards; are you particularly worried about the Trump administration? Carney says it is important to have open global standards, and even more important that they are implemented, to avoid another financial crisis. You also need supervisory co-operation between regulators...and we want to reinforce that where possible. On the US, we have had \u201cvery productive discussions\u201d with regulators about it. Carney explains how many countries have some unique rules (such as America\u2019s Volcker rule, or bank ring-fencing in the UK), which they can change without affecting other nations. But there needs to be more co-ordination when it comes to global standards, if there are areas of \u2018inconsistency\u2019 that need to be addressed. [Explainer: Donald Trump has vowed to cut regulations in the financial sector, such as the Volcker rule which is meant to prevent banks taking dangerous trading risks. Trump is also keen to repeal Dodd-Frank, which was brought in after the financial crisis. ] Q: You point out that commercial real estate assets are overvalued, and could unwind if people try to sell them in a rush. That happened after the Brexit vote - has anything changed since? [explainer: several property funds froze redemptions after the EU referendum, to stop investors cashing out, exposing the dangers of investing in \u2018illiquid assets\u2019 such as shopping centres] Carney says there is a disconnect between the market expectations for future growth, and the value of commercial buildings. So either those expectations will rise, or commercial asset values will fall. Q: Isn\u2019t the boom in consumer credit due to you keeping interest rates so low? Carney insists he\u2019s not to blame, and points to the broader context of a UK economy that has grown solidly over the last 12 months (despite slowing in the first quarter of 2017). Here\u2019s a chart showing how consumer debt has grown: Carney says the boom in car loans is a major factor behind the pick-up in consumer debt recently, but he remains \u201csanguine\u201d about the banking sector\u2019s overall exposure to it. Q: Your charts show that consumer finance has been growing faster than household income since 2014, so shouldn\u2019t you have issued today\u2019s warning sooner? Deputy governor Sir John Cunliffe says consumer borrowing actually picked up in 2013, but overall household lending actually grew slower than the UK economy. Consumer borrowing is \u00a3200bn, compared to \u00a31.4 trillion in mortgage lending, he explains - so the BoE has to decide when it\u2019s a serious worry. We\u2019ve been watching consumer credit for a while, and now is the time to look at whether underwriting standards are starting to slip, and bring forwards our stress test (by three months, to September) Q: Are banks misbehaving and gaming the system, and is there a cultural problem? They\u2019re not gaming the system, but they\u2019re not learning the lessons of the past, Carney says. Q: Which consumer borrowing are you most worried about? Carney cites the sharp build up in car financing \u2013 both in volume, and the move towards \u2018personal contract purchasing\u2019 deals (where buyers pay monthly repayments, and then face a large balloon payment to actually own their car) Q: How confident are you that banks can raise the extra capital you are demanding? They all have this capital on their books at present, Carney replies. It\u2019s a question of reallocating capital from other areas (and perhaps choosing to raise more capital) The extra capital buffer will mean UK banks must meet a 4% leverage ratio, Carney explains, but the current leverage ratio is actually 5.25%. In other words, Banks shouldn\u2019t face a massive challenge meeting the BoE\u2019s demands. Q: Has the general election changed your view of how the Brexit talks will evolve, and raised the risks from political instability? The short answer is no, governor Carney replies. Our job is to work out what might go wrong and prepare for it, rather than assessing quite how likely various scenarios are. So June\u2019s general election hasn\u2019t changed the Bank\u2019s contingency planning for Brexit. Q: How worried are you about the British banking sector\u2019s exposure to China? Risks from China are at the top end of global risks, Carney replies. That\u2019s due to the build-up of debt, structural issues in the financial system, and the challenge of growing the economy while also maintaining stability. Q: What role are interest rates playing in exaggerating or reining in financial stability risks? Monetary policy is the \u2018last line of defence\u2019, says Carney, and we don\u2019t need monetary policy to do our job of ensuring financial stability, Carney continues. If the Financial Policy Committee does its job properly, then the MPC can focus on its job of getting inflation back to target. Q: And what would you say to those who think that being responsible for financial stability is distracting you from the job of setting interest rates and controlling inflation? Carney (who chairs both the FPC and the Monetary Policy Committee which sets borrowing costs) denies that he\u2019s got too much on his plate. It takes as long to decide to raise rates as to cut then as to leave them on hold, he replies. I\u2019ve been doing this job for many years at two central banks (the BoE and the Bank of Canada). And he\u2019s not biting.... Q: You\u2019re telling banks that times are changing, and they should set aside more capital, but shouldn\u2019t consumers also recognise that times are changing and rein in our borrowings? I\u2019m not going to give individual financial advice, says Mark Carney (you\u2019re on your own, folks, sorry). He then explains that the Bank is trying to strengthen the resilience of the core of the system, in case a crisis strike. The message for the public is that if things become bumpy, in the Brexit transition or because of problems in the global economy, then the financial system will be there for them, says the governor, adding: Individuals must take the judgement whether it\u2019s the right time to buy a property, or invest in a business, and we\u2019re trying to ensure that the financial system is there to help them with that. Q: You seem to be blaming lenders, rather than consumers, for the rise in consumer credit - but shouldn\u2019t people be more cautious about how much debt they take on? Carney says that UK households have deleveraged a lot since the financial crisis, and only releveraged recently. He wouldn\u2019t say that households as a whole are taking elevated risks. The first line of defence is that lenders themselves are responsible; the second line of defence is banks set aside enough capital incase of a downturn. Q: How concerned are you that UK consumers are borrowing too much, and will find themselves in difficulties when interest rates rise? Mark Carney replies that the BoE\u2019s message, in good times or bad ones, is that anyone who takes out a loan should consider that they could face adverse conditions in the future, such as weaker growth and higher interest rates. This \u201cstating the obvious, which is often what you get from a central banker\u201d, is particularly appropriate today, the governor adds smilingly. On cybercrime, Carney says the Bank is setting out the framework that will be needed to protect the UK financial system from computer attacks. On Brexit, Carney says the Bank is making contingency plans for all possible outcomes, and concentrating on those would have the greatest impact on the economy. That includes the possibility that Britain leaves the European Union without a deal (this is the \u2018cliff-edge Brexit\u2019 that many firms fear). Carney says that forcing banks to hold more capital (by raising the counter-cyclical buffer to 0.5% today, and probably to 1% in November) will more protection to losses. Mark Carney begins his press conference by saying that financial stability has been strengthened since the 2008 crisis. But the job of tackling financial dangers is \u201cnever done, and risks are evolving.\u201d The financial policy committee thinks that the overall risks from the domestic environment are at a \u201cstandard level\u201d, with most indicators neither \u201cparticularly elevated nor subdued\u201d. But there are some risks that require particular vigilance, he continues One is consumer credit \u2013 growth has \u201cfar outpaced\u201d household income in the last year, including credit cards and loans to buy new homes. And with the market competitive, lenders are vulnerable to a downturn. The second worry is Brexit \u2013 the range of possible outcomes as Britian leaves the EU, and the paths to them. Mark Carney is facing financial reporters at the Bank of England now, to explain the thinking behind today\u2019s financial stability report. You can watch it live here: Google has been handed a record \u20ac2.42bn fine by Brussels over alleged abuse of its market dominance. It was a much bigger than expected fine, with most predicting a penalty in the region of \u20ac1bn. EU antitrust officials have accused the search engine giant of illegally favouring its shopping service. It is the biggest fine for a single company in an EU antitrust case, and follows a seven-year investigation. European commissioner Margrethe Vestager, in charge of competition policy, said: Google has come up with many innovative products and services that have made a difference to our lives. That\u2019s a good thing. But Google\u2019s strategy for its comparison shopping service wasn\u2019t just about attracting customers by making its product better than those of its rivals. Instead, Google abused its market dominance as a search engine by promoting its own comparison shopping service in its search results, and demoting those of competitors. What Google has done is illegal under EU antitrust rules. It denied other companies the chance to compete on the merits and to innovate. And most importantly, it denied European consumers a genuine choice of services and the full benefits of innovation. More soon... And here is the background: City experts are trawling through the Bank of England\u2019s financial stability report. Duncan Weldon of Resolution Group has spotted a chart showing how consumer credit losses rise when unemployment increases. No wonder the Bank is forcing lenders to stash more capital in their vaults now, in case an economic downturn forces more consumers to default on their loans. Alistair McQueen of Aviva points to another chart, showing how a drop in house prices can ripple through the system, triggering \u2018fire sales\u2019 and further losses. Steve Hawkes of The Sun has a pithy summary: The BoE\u2019s financial stability report is online here. Here\u2019s an infographic form the Bank, setting the scene: The Bank of England is also boosting its work on cybercrime and continuing its work on Brexit\u2019s impact. That\u2019s on top of ordering UK banks to set aside more capital, and rushing forwards its consumer stress tests. Here are the five key points from the financial stability report. The Bank of England is.... \u2022 Increasing the UK countercyclical capital buffer rate to 0.5%, from 0%. Absent a material change in the outlook, and consistent with its stated policy for a standard risk environment and of moving gradually, the FPC expects to increase the rate to 1% at its November meeting. \u2022 Bringing forward the assessment of stressed losses on consumer credit lending in the Bank\u2019s 2017 annual stress test. This will inform the FPC\u2019s assessment at its next meeting of any additional resilience required in aggregate against this lending. The FPC further supports the intentions of the Prudential Regulation Authority and Financial Conduct Authority to publish, in July, their expectations of lenders in the consumer credit market. \u2022 Clarifying its existing insurance measures in the mortgage market, designed to prevent excessive growth in the number of highly indebted households. This will promote consistency across lenders in their application of tests to assess whether new mortgage borrowers can afford repayments. \u2022 Consistent with its previous commitment, restoring the level of resilience delivered by its leverage ratio standard to the level it delivered in July 2016 before the FPC excluded central bank reserves from the leverage ratio exposure measure. The FPC intends to set the minimum leverage requirement at 3.25% of non-reserve exposures, subject to consultation. \u2022 Overseeing contingency planning to mitigate risks to financial stability as the United Kingdom withdraws from the European Union. \u2022 Building on the programme of cyber resilience testing it instigated in 2013, by setting out the essential elements of the regulatory framework for maintaining cyber resilience. It will now monitor that each element is being fulfilled by the relevant UK authorities. Another important point: the Bank of England is also bringing forwards its planned stress test on consumer credit lending to September, from November. That test will assess whether UK banks can handle a jump in consumer credit losses. Today\u2019s change means that UK banks will have to set aside more than \u00a311bn of extra capital to cover potential losses if the economy weakens: From the BoE, my colleague Jill Treanor explains: The Bank of England is to force banks to hold more capital in the face of rapid growth in lending on credit cards, car finance and personal loans. The intervention by Threadneedle Street, which could amount to banks needing \u00a311.4bn of extra capital in the next 18 months, is one of a number of measures intended to protect the financial system from the growth in consumer finance. Here we go! The Bank of England has told Britain\u2019s banks to start setting aside more capital to protect themselves from a financial downturn. That\u2019s one of the key lines from the Financial Stability Report. As predicted, the BoE is raising the counter-cyclical capital buffer (CCyB), so that banks must set aside 0.5% of their assets as capital in case of a rainy day. That means it is reversing one of measures taken after the Brexit vote, a year ago. Interestingly, the BoE says it expecs to raise CCyB again, in November, to 1%. More to follow.... Tension is building in the City as traders wait for the Bank of England\u2019s financial stability report to hit the wires, in just five minutes. The rise in the euro has pushed Europe\u2019s stock markets down. Ever index is now in the red, with the Stoxx 600 losing 0.6%. A stronger euro isn\u2019t great news for eurozone exporters, of course. But the key point is that Draghi is being optimistic -- that\u2019s no reason to dump shares. Neil Wilson of ETX Capital says traders shouldn\u2019t be too skittish: Draghi suggested inflation is becoming more sustainable and deflationary forces have been replaced by reflationary forces. Importantly he suggests deflationary forces are external, temporary shocks and the ECB can overlook. That\u2019s what happens when you open the taps on a massive stimulus programme. The question is whether the Eurozone would survive without the QE support. Draghi sounded more circumspect on that front, arguing that he is confident that monetary policy is working but still needs to remain very loose. Again it\u2019s a stretch to describe it as hawkish \u2013 Draghi is simply affirming that loose monetary policy is working without significant adverse consequences and therefore should be maintained. He\u2019s not advocating tightening any time soon. The European commission just dropped a loud hint that the Google antitrust fine is coming this morning.... This tweet is from EC press officer Yizhou Ren: Mario Draghi\u2019s bullish talk has also sent the pound down against the euro, shedding 0.4% to \u20ac1.133. That means one euro buys 88.2p, up from 87.9p on Monday. Good news for eurozone holidaymakers heading to the UK this summer, but a blow to Britons planning a continental jaunt. Here\u2019s Reuters take on Draghi\u2019s speech: The euro zone still needs \u201cconsiderable\u201d monetary support from the European CentralBank even as its economy recovers steadily and inflation picks up, ECB President Mario Draghi said on Tuesday. \u201cAll the signs now point to a strengthening and broadening recovery in the euro area. Deflationary forces have been replaced by reflationary ones,\u201d Draghi said at the ECB\u2019s annual policy forum in Sintra, Portugal. \u201cHowever, a considerable degree of monetary accommodation is still needed for inflation dynamics to become durable and self-sustaining.\u201d Here\u2019s a chart showing how the euro spiked as Draghi spoke in Portugal: Oooh. The euro is rallying as Mario Draghi tells the ECB Forum that reflationary pressures in the eurozone are building, as the economy recovers. The single currency has jumped by half a cent against the US dollar, to $1.1235, with Draghi sounding more upbeat and hawkish than expected. Draghi has also told his audience that \u201ca considerable degree\u201d of stimulus is still needed in the eurozone, and that the ECB must be \u2018prudent\u2019 in how it unwinds it. Draghi has previously talked about a \u2018substantial degree\u2019 of help being needed, and Arne Petimezas, analyst at AFS Group in the Netherlands, thinks this wording is significant. Not for the first (or last) time, Mario Draghi\u2019s message is that his policies are delivering the goods.... Over in Sintra, European Central Bank president Mario Draghi is giving the keynote speech at the ECB\u2019s Forum now. It\u2019s being streamed here. Draghi says there are clear signs of a \u201cstrengthening and broadening\u201d recovery underway in the eurozone area. There have been 16 straight quarters of growth in the euro area, he says. But this nascent growth needs to become sustainable, and that means higher productivity growth. Central bankers face an unusual challenge today, Draghi continues \u2013 they face growth that is \u201cabove trend and well distributed across the euro area\u201d. But at the same time, inflation is more muted than you\u2019d expect. To decide the right approach (ie, when to cut the ECB\u2019s stimulus package), you need to understand the causes, Draghi cautions. And Draghi\u2019s assessment is that monetary policy is working to build up reflationary pressures. But it\u2019s being slowed by external price shocks, slack in the labour market, and a change in how the labour market and inflation interact, he concludes. The FT\u2019s Chris Giles has pulled together a list of key issues to watch for today, when the Bank of England releases its twice-yearly report on financial stability. Here\u2019s a flavour: Will the BoE remove its emergency support for banks? It could raise its \u201ccounter-cyclical capital buffer\u201d, to force banks to hold more capital. A year ago, after the EU referendum, the BoE reduced this buffer to zero, but it may now conclude that this emergency help is no longer needed. Will it try to curb consumer borrowing? The FPC may tell banks to cut back on \u201cteaser\u201d interest rates, to prevent a surge in defaults. Is car finance out of control? UK car sales have been strong for many months, thanks to cheap credit and new \u201cpersonal contract payment\u201d deals that make it easier to buy a new vehicle. Is the mortgage market a worry? A housing crash would have very serious consequences for the economy, so investors will want to hear Carney\u2019s views Brexit blues? With negotiations with Brussels finally underway, will the Bank say anything about the risks of a drop in confidence in UK assets? More here. UK consumer confidence has plunged since June\u2019s general election, as the shock of a hung parliament hits households. It gives the Bank of England a fresh headache as it considers the health of the UK economy, ahead of today\u2019s Financial Stability Report. Pollsters at YouGov found that UK citizens are fretting about political uncertainty, rising inflation, falling real wages, and the state of the housing market. YouGov found there was a \u201cpronounced collapse in consumer confidence following the election\u201d. The sight of Theresa May losing her majority sent its consumer morale index sliding to 105.2 from 109.1. For June as a whole, consumer confidence dropped to 106.9, its second-lowest level since the summer of 2013. Stephen Harmston, head of YouGov, says that the UK housing slowdown is causing particular alarm (Nationwide says prices have fallen for the last three months) \u201cThe hung parliament seems to have further dampened consumers\u2019 spirits, which were already sinking following the continued squeeze on household finances. \u201cBut the real cause for alarm will be the cooling of the property market, as this is one of the key things that has propped up consumer confidence over the past few years.\u201d More here: Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. We\u2019re facing central bank overload today, with monetary policy chiefs speaking in London, and the Portuguese town of Sintra. All eyes will be on the Bank of England, as its powerful Financial Policy Committee releases its latest report followed by a press conference with Governor Mark Carney. The FPC, which is charged with maintaining financial stability, could order banks to rein in their riskier lending, following growing fears that consumer borrowing is getting out of hand. The Bank could also tell City banks to start restocking their capital buffers, having previously told banks to lend more after the Brexit vote. Meanwhile in sunny (ish) Sintra, the European Central Bank is holding its annual forum. We\u2019ll be hearing from Mario Draghi, ECB president, who last night told students in Portugal that his massive stimulus scheme was creating employment. Challenged over the Bank\u2019s huge money-printing programme, Draghi declared that: \u201cThe millennials that found a job because of our policy, I\u2019m pretty sure they are okay\u201d [with the ECB\u2019s policies] . And he also denied that savers had been unfairly treated, arguing that they\u2019re also benefitting from the recovery, as: \u201cRecessions are not good for anybody, savers or non-savers, It could be a busy morning, as there\u2019s a strong chance that Google will be hit with a whopping fine this morning, of over \u20ac1bn, for breaching Europe\u2019s competition rules. That would end a long inquiry into whether Google used its dominant search engine to unfairly promote its Google Shopping service, but could spark an angry response from America. And then tonight, the world\u2019s most powerful central banker, Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen, is speaking at London\u2019s Royal Academy. We\u2019re promised a \u201cwide-ranging discussion about global economic issues.\u201d On the corporate front, retail group Debenhams and car hire chain Northgate are reporting results, plus there are retail sales figures in the UK and consumer confidence stats from America to keep us on our toes.

Thank you for all your comments today and please join us again tomorrow. AM Over in Dublin, Irish tourism leaders have been expressing concerns about the impact of Brexit on the industry. Reilly Dugery reports: At a British Irish Chamber of Commerce seminar on Thursday, Brexit was described as a \u201ctrain with lights coming screaming down the track at us\u201d by Eoin O\u2019Mara Walsh of the Irish Tourist Industry Confederation. Shane Clarke of Tourism Ireland warned that Brexit had already had a negative impact on tourism, with 900,000 fewer visitors from the UK and a 20% decrease in British spending on the island since the beginning of 2017. Over 12 months, this decrease is expected to cost the island more than \u20ac100 million. John Concannon of Creative Ireland insisted that in order to maintain its appeal to tourists, Ireland must find an identity, comparing the country to a younger sibling having the chance to step outside of his older brother\u2019s shadow. Concannon stated that economic investment in cultural events and initiatives would increase the satisfaction of the local population and subsequently entice potential visitors to the island. All members of the panel agreed that the loss of a soft border and a common travel area would be detrimental for the industry and that significant investment would be necessary to ensure a sustainable future for tourism in Ireland. George Osborne, editor of the Evening Standard and former chancellor of the exchequer, has got another job, taking the total to six. He will take on the unpaid role of honorary professor of economics at the University of Manchester, starting in July. In a series of lectures and masterclasses he will build on his work on the \u201cnorthern powerhouse\u201d, which he began in number 11. Osborne said he was \u201cbowled over by this honour\u201d. He now has six jobs: Editor, Evening Standard Chairman, Northern Powerhouse Partnership Advisor, Blackrock Speechmaker, Washington Speakers Bureau Fellow, McCain Institute Professor of economics, University of Manchester Read our full story here: There were no new revelations on interest rates when Mark Carney was interviewed earlier by Bloomberg TV. In fact there was no mention of rates at all, with the focus of the interview on a new report on climate change. Read our story on the report here: IG traders are forecasting a mixed opening for Wall Street: Sticking with the US, there were 244,000 new claims for jobless benefits last week, more than the 240,000 forecast by economists in Reuters poll. The figure for the previous week was revised up to by 1,000 to 242,000. US growth has been revised up to 1.4% (on an annual basis) in the first quarter, from an earlier estimate of 1.2%, the Commerce Department said. The boost came from unexpectedly higher consumer spending and a bigger rise in exports. It was still a slowdown compared with the fourth quarter of 2016, when GDP increased 2.1%. Thousands of striking public sector workers have held a mass protest rally in Athens as unionists consider whether they should continue a 12-day walk-out that has left tonnes of rotting rubbish on the streets. The government has not ruled out bringing in the army, or forcibly mobilising the strikers through recourse to the courts, if they decide to continue with the industrial action. Marching on parliament earlier, municipal employees held banners proclaiming : \u201cNo firings, make all contract workers permanent now.\u201d Temperatures hit 44C in some parts of Athens on Thursday with the heatwave now fuelling fears of a public health crisis on account of the massive mounds of rubbish that have accumulated. \u201cDepending on developments, all available state mechanisms will be used not to endanger public health,\u201d said the government spokesman Dimitirs Tzanakopoulos. With temperatures expected to rise on Friday the army could be brought in as early as this evening. The Greek prime minister, Alexis Tsipras, who held talks with unionists on Tuesday, said obligations to creditors behind the country\u2019s three international bailouts made it impossible to satisfy all demands. German consumer inflation rose unexpectedly in June, to 1.6% from 1.5% in May, the Federal Statistics Office said. It had been expected to fall to 1.4%. When harmonised to make the figures comparable with other EU countries, the rate rose to 1.5% from 1.4%. Carsten Brzeski, ING\u2019s chief economist for Germany, said this could be the \u201clast inflation hooray\u201d and considers the dilemma facing the ECB. Looking ahead, lower oil prices and the stronger euro exchange rate should lower headline inflation in the coming months. Today\u2019s German inflation data provides further evidence for the ECB\u2019s (and other central banks\u2019) current dilemma: a cyclical upswing without significant inflationary pressure. If even an economy which has just entered its ninth year of economic expansion and which has record high employment hardly shows any inflationary pressures, how could the eurozone as a whole do so any time soon? Over the last 48 hours, financial markets have been overly excited about the ECB and possible tapering. Looking back at the now famous Sintra speech of ECB president Draghi confirms our earlier view that the ECB has not drastically changed its stance, neither its own take on the economy or the future path of monetary policy. The ECB will strike a very cautious balance between moving towards tapering, without jumping the gun and distorting markets. This week\u2019s market reaction has been a clear reminder for the ECB that steering market expectations is an extremely tough job to do. Over in Greece, finance minister Euclid Tsakalotos is in confident mood. Speaking at a conference in Athens, Euclid Tsakalotos signalled that the debt-stricken country plans to return to markets within a year. He took many aback saying the country would attempt to access markets whether it had been included in the European Central Bank\u2019s bond-buying programme or not. Backtracking from the Greek government\u2019s previous stance that entry into the European Central Bank\u2019s quantitative easing programme was essential to market return, Tsakalotos said the belief now was that it would have a largely \u201csymbolic\u201d effect and, as such, should not be given with too much significance. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t elevate it too high \u2026 it would be very useful. It is important but mostly in symbolic terms,\u201d he told the conference also attended this year by officials representing Greece\u2019s quartet of creditors. The leftist-led government, he said, was now placing more emphasis on persuading investors that when the thrice-bailed out nation does tap markets it isn\u2019t a one-off. He insisted it was important that Greece - essentially exiled from capital markets since 2010 - didn\u2019t go in \u201ctoo early.\u201d \u201cWhat we need to do is ensure that the investment community knows there will be a programme of access to the markets. When we do go, we want to ensure that the markets know that it\u2019s apart of a strategy of going two, three, four times, so they understand not the details but the process.\u201d Here is our story on the government\u2019s decision to refer the Sky bid to the competition watchdog: Bradley says parties will have until 14 July to make representations before a final decision is made. Sky\u2019s shares are up: Karen Bradley, the culture secretary, says she is referring Fox\u2019s \u00a311.7bn offer for Sky to the Competition and Markets Authority for a \u201cphase two\u201d inquiry on the grounds of media plurality. The culture secretary is making a statement on her decision on Fox\u2019s proposed takeover of Sky... Eurozone economic sentiment rose more than expected in June to its highest level in almost 10 years, according to monthly data from the European commission. Optimism rose across all sectors of the economy, pushing the headline index to 111.1 in June from 109.2 in May. It was the highest since August 2007, and beat expectations of a smaller increase to 109.5. The commission\u2019s business confidence also rose, to its highest level since April 2011. So all in all, eurozone firms do not seem ruffled at the prospect of Brexit. Peter Vanden Houte, ING\u2019s chief economist for the eurozone, says the survey suggests the European Central Bank is safe to take \u201cbaby steps\u201d towards tightening policy. The eurozone economy continues its winning streak, making a growth figure above 2% no longer a fantasy. The current figures fit the picture painted by [ECB president] Mario Draghi earlier this week pretty well: the eurozone economy is definitely gaining momentum. One should note that the recent trend in oil prices is likely to push headline inflation down again in the coming months. At the same time, expectations for unemployment in the consumer survey fell to the lowest level since 2007. This could increase wage bargaining power and ultimately lead to higher wages, which is according to Mario Draghi the lynchpin for monetary policy. Howard Archer, chief economic adviser to the EY Item forecasting group, says that even small rises in interest rates could cause problems for households: It may be that the heightened squeeze on consumer purchasing power is increasing the need for some consumers to borrow. The Bank of England will be far from happy with the May consumer credit data, and it could bolster the case for a near-term interest rate hike to try to curb consumers\u2019 readiness to borrow. While any interest rate hike would be small with further increases some way off, even small increases could cause problems for some consumers given high borrowing levels. Andy Haldane, the Bank of England\u2019s chief economist and dove-turned-hawk, has been out and about on a mini tour of Wales (Barry, Porth and Ely in Cardiff). He reiterated his point that interest rates might have to \u201cedge up\u201d if the cost of living continues to rise in Britain. He told BBC Wales: We need to look seriously at the possibility of raising interest rates to keep the lid on those cost of living increases. For now we are happy with where the rates are, we need to be vigilant for what happens next. Last week Haldane stunned markets with the declaration that UK rates may have to rise later this year. Hannah Maundrell, editor in chief of comparison site money.co.uk, says the rise in consumer credit is worrying. This jump is concerning - it\u2019s worrying providers have been lending more money while the gap between how much credit they are willing to give v how much people are actually earning has got wider. Rock bottom interest rates have made borrowing cheap and we\u2019ve definitely been making the most of it. The harsh reality is many households would struggle to pay back what they owe if interest rates went up. If you\u2019re thinking of borrowing money you must be realistic with yourself. Work out if you can actually afford it and how stretched it will leave you each month. If you were to lose your job do you have the means to pay it back? News flash! The pound broke through the $1.30 barrier for the first time in five weeks. It is up more than half a cent or 0.5% against the dollar. Traders are standing by their bet that the Bank of England is readying for a rate rise after those comments from Governor Mark Carney on Wednesday. The stronger than expected consumer credit and mortgage approvals figures come just two days after the Bank of England told banks they must hold more capital in the face of a rapid growth in borrowing on credit cards, car finance and personal loans. Household finances are coming under increasing strain as inflation outpaces wage growth. That means consumers are forced to dip into their savings or take on more debt in order to maintain spending. Ruth Gregory, UK economist at Capital Economics, says the latest figures suggest consumers aren\u2019t losing too much sleep over the pay squeeze: May\u2019s UK money and credit figures provide another reason to think that the consumer slowdown shouldn\u2019t be too severe. Not only was the monthly rise in consumer credit of \u00a31.7bn up on April\u2019s \u00a31.5bn increase, but it was well above the consensus expectation (\u00a31.4bn) too. Meanwhile, the number of mortgages approved for new house purchase rose from an upwardly-revised 65,051 in April to 65,202 in May, also higher than the consensus expectation (of 64,000). This suggests that households remain confident enough to increase borrowing to help smooth consumption, in the face of the squeeze on their real incomes. Of course, this will do nothing to allay policymakers concerns about the recent rapid increases in unsecured lending and strengthens the case for the Financial Policy Committee to act to address this issue at its next meeting in September. The Bank of England has just published its latest consumer credit and mortgage approvals figures. Consumer lending rose by \u00a31.7bn in May, following a \u00a31.5bn rise in April. UK economists were predicting a slowdown in lending to \u00a31.4bn. There was a 10.2% rise in unsecured consumer borrowing, year-on-year in the three months to May, up from 9.7% in April. It was the joint highest since November. Meanwhile the number of mortgages approved for house purchase rose to 65,202 in May, little changed from April\u2019s 65,051. It beat economists\u2019 forecasts of 64,000 approvals. UK banking shares are benefiting this morning from developments in the US, where banks passed the second round of the Federal Reserve\u2019s stress test. It opened the door to higher payouts to shareholders, and boosted confidence about the general health of the sector. Neil Wilson, senior market analyst at ETX Capital, said UK banking shares are enjoying the \u201cUS halo effect\u201d. Banking stocks jumped on the open after regulators in the US gave the greenlight to higher dividends and buybacks, whilst the hints of a shift in tone from central bankers towards tightening is spurring hopes of higher interest rates again. HSBC led the FTSE 100, rising nearly 4% at the start of play. Standard Chartered rose 2%, while Barclays, Lloyds and RBS were all up more than 1%. With a big index weighting that HSBC boost powered the FTSE 100 higher, while gains for mining stocks as metal prices firmed also supported. The boost seems to have been the halo effect from the US, as all the major banks passed stress tests, which means they can now significantly raise shareholder returns. The Fed has effectively green-lighted up to $100bn in dividends and buybacks. US banks rose in after-hours trading as a result. FTSE 100\u2019s biggest risers this morning: It\u2019s been a mixed start for European markets this morning. The FTSE is leading the risers, boosted by the banking and mining sectors. The scores so far: FTSE 100: +0.4% at 7,42 Germany\u2019s DAX: +0.2% at 12,674 France\u2019s CAC: -0.1% at 5,248 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB: -0.3% at 20,994 Spain\u2019s IBEX: -0.1% at 10,697 Europe\u2019s STOXX 600: flat at 386 The government is due to announce today whether or not it will give the go ahead to 21st Century Fox\u2019s proposed \u00a311.7bn takeover of Sky. Karen Bradley, the culture secretary, is expected to make the announcement later this morning. She could decide to wave the deal through, discuss options with Fox to address any issues raised by Ofcom, or refer the takeover to the Competition and Markets Authority. Here is a reminder of the background: Some UK corporate news now. The Financial Reporting Council is to take a deeper look at the role played by \u2018Big Four\u2019 accountant PricewaterhouseCoopers in BT\u2019s \u00a3530m Italian accounting scandal. After \u201cinitial enquiries\u201d, the UK\u2019s corporate governance watchdog announced a full investigation into the audits performed by PwC on BT over the three years from 2015 to 2017. BT wrote off \u00a3530m in January over \u201cimproper practices\u201d, sending its shares tumbling 21% in a day. Chief executive Gavin Patterson has since seen his pay packet slashed by \u00a34m, while the firm\u2019s European head Corrado Sciolla lost his job over the affair. The euro is also climbing higher against the dollar this morning as investors bet on tighter monetary policy across Europe. It is currently up 0.4% at \u20ac1.1425, boosted by comments on Tuesday from Mario Draghi, president of the European Central Bank. Draghi\u2019s statement that \u201creflation\u201d was returning to the eurozone prompted speculation of policy tightening, even after ECB sources felt compelled to clarify on Wednesday that he was not signalling immediate action. Bloomberg TV will be showing an interview with Mark Carney at 11.30. Markets are now pricing in a 50% chance of a UK rate rise by the end of 2017. Let\u2019s see if the Bank of England governor provides any more clarity. The pound dropped sharply immediately after the 8 June general election, when it became clear Theresa May had lost her majority. Sterling has now returned to pre-election levels after Carney\u2019s rate rise hint. It is edging closer towards $1.30 this morning, at $1.2974. Traders at spread-betting firm IG predict European markets will open higher this morning: Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Markets had much to digest on Wednesday after surprise comments from Mark Carney were interpreted as a hint that he is moving closer to a vote for a rate hike. The pound jumped to a post-election high after his remarks at a European Central Bank conference in Portugal, and the currency has built on those gains this morning. The pound is currently up 0.3% against the dollar at $1.2963. However, the devil is in the detail and some analysts say that while his comments were certainly less dovish than his Mansion House speech, Carney wasn\u2019t suggesting he\u2019s ready to press the button on a rate rise just yet. We\u2019ll keep you updated on all the latest developments. Also coming up today... At 9.30am the Bank of England will publish the latest data on consumer credit and mortgage approvals data. This should be interesting following the Bank\u2019s warning earlier this week of a rapid growth in borrowing on credit cards, car finance and personal loans. A snapshot of eurozone business confidence in June is scheduled for 10am. German inflation data at 13.00 is expected to show a slight dip in the rate to 1.4% in June from 1.5% in May. In the US we have the second revision of first-quarter growth, and weekly jobless claims data, both at 13.30. And here is a reminder of what Mark Carney had to say on Wednesday:",

The regulator said that phone hacking at the News of the World and allegations of sexual and racial harassment at Fox News had amounted to significant corporate failure at the Murdochs companies \u2013 but this was not enough to prevent them from holding a broadcasting licence. Ofcom found there was no \u201cclear evidence\u201d that senior executives at Fox were aware of sexual misconduct before 2016, and that Fox and Sky\u2019s compliance record with the broadcasting code was in line with other broadcasters. The Murdoch\u2019s previous bid for Sky collapsed in 2011 when News Corporation was forced to withdraw its interest amid public furore over phone hacking at the News of the World. The company bidding this time is 21st Century Fox, which owns the 20th Century Fox film studio and the Fox TV network. It was carved out of Murdoch\u2019s News Corporation empire in the wake of the phone-hacking scandal. Murdoch\u2019s remaining newspapers, including the Sun and the Times, are now part of a separate company, News Corp, although both it and 21st Century Fox are still controlled by the media mogul and his family. Hacked Off, which represents phone hacking victims, condemned the decision not to refer the bid to the CMA on the grounds of broadcasting standards and said the Murdochs have an \u201cappalling record of corporate governance failures\u201d.
