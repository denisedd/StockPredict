                "bodyText":"Vodafone is to introduce a tough new global policy to prevent its advertising from appearing on fake news and hate speech sites. The telecoms company, which spends close to \u00a3400m of its \u00a3750m annual global ad budget on digital ads, is thought to be the first to move beyond relying on Google and Facebook\u2019s automated technology. Working with Google, Facebook and ad agencies, it is setting up a \u201cwhitelist\u201d of sites on which its ads can run. \u201cIt is relatively easy to blacklist certain sites, such as those relating to porn and gambling, but it is difficult to exclude content that is \u2013 in editorial terms \u2013 at odds with an advertiser\u2019s own principles and beliefs,\u201d said Matt Peacock, group director of corporate affairs at Vodafone. \u201cWhen it comes to making a judgment about a site or channel focused on fake news or hate speech, what\u2019s needed is a human judgment, an editorial assessment.

We will not tolerate our brand being associated with this kind of abusive and damaging content.\u201d The whitelist will be reviewed regularly to make sure it is \u201cappropriate and neither too broad nor too narrow\u201d. Vodafone\u2019s definition of sites peddling hate speech has been updated to include those that \u201cdeliberately intend to degrade women or vulnerable minorities\u201d. Its definition of fake news sites includes those \u201cpresented as fact-based news (as opposed to satire or opinion) that has no credible primary source (or relies on fraudulent attribution to a primary source) with what a reasonable person would conclude is the deliberate intention to mislead\u201d. The company said an outlet will only be blocked from its whitelist if its \u201cpredominant purpose\u201d is hate speech or fake news, meaning it will not move to block tabloid or extreme rightwing or leftwing publishers if they occasionally are at odds with its new rules. Vodafone stressed that its rules do not cover the type of content its customers can access. Facebook, which has toughened its own policies on fake news on its site, said Vodafone\u2019s new policy would work hand in hand with its own efforts. \u201cWe welcome Vodafone\u2019s new global rules,\u201d said a Facebook spokesman. \u201cWe work closely with all of our advertiser partners to ensure that they have control over where their ads appear on our platform, and vigorously enforce our community standards which include policies against hate speech, violence or extremist content.\u201d Both Google and Facebook have moved to introduce tools to stem the spread of false information and minimise the chances of advertising appearing next to inappropriate content.

                "body":"<p>About time too: a major advertiser has become so frustrated with Facebook and Google\u2019s limp attempts to police the content they publish that it has taken matters into its own hands. Vodafone will no longer rely on website \u201cblacklists\u201d drawn up by the social media titans and its own advertising agency. Instead, to prevent its ads appearing next to hate speech or fake news, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/jun/06/vodafone-ads-fake-news-hate-speech-google-facebook-advertising\">Vodafone will issue a \u201cwhitelist\u201d of sites on which it is happy for its commercial messages to appear</a>.</p> <p>The new approach is sensible. Indeed, it\u2019s a wonder that major advertisers have been so slow to protect themselves from Facebook and Google\u2019s failures. Vodafone spends \u00a3400m a year on online advertising. Even if 99% of that money ends up being directed to reputable sites, the other 1% can do serious damage to a brand while also generating revenue for some hideous websites.</p> <p>Advertisers\u2019 reluctance to take the initiative may stem from two factors. First, the worry that drawing up \u201cwhitelists\u201d and employing human judgment is a more expensive way to advertise. Second, a sense that Google and Facebook\u2019s machines are too big and powerful to challenge. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/jun/06/vodafone-ads-fake-news-hate-speech-google-facebook-advertising\">Vodafone to stop its ads appearing on fake news and hate speech sites</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Vodafone, let\u2019s hope, has shattered both ideas. Yes, it\u2019s a big advertiser that can afford to carry a few extra costs but it is surely right when it says algorithms, designed to carve up demographic categories, are simply not up to the job of making editorial judgments. It also seems to have little difficulty in laying down the new terms of trade to Google and Facebook.</p> <p>Other advertisers should follow Vodafone\u2019s lead \u2013 and, if not, explain why they\u2019re happy to turn a blind eye when even small portions of their advertising budgets end up funding some of the internet\u2019s most gruesome offerings.</p> <h2>Shawbrook would be better going private</h2> <p>Shawbrook is the challenger bank that has been a challenging investment at times for its shareholders. Floated at 290p in 2015, the shares fell as low at 130p a year ago after the referendum result \u2013 Brexit was deemed by the market to be unhelpful for UK buy-to-let lenders. Then came Shawbrook\u2019s confidence-rattling revelation of lending \u201cirregularities\u201d in one division.</p> <p>In the circumstances, you might have expected the board to embrace the takeover approach from Pollen Street, already a 38% owner, plus fellow private equity house BC Partners. That was the way the plot seemed to be heading when Shawbrook agreed to open its books. But the board has now rejected four offers, deeming the bidders\u2019 final pitch at 340p a share, or \u00a3868m, to be an undervaluation.</p> <p>One admires the independent directors\u2019 determination to squeeze Pollen Street for every last drop of value. In the end, however, resistance is likely to be futile since acceptances are already 45% and many of the other shares are already in the hands of arbitrage funds who are only there for the final bump in the bid. The real question is whether the bidders manage to pass 75%, at which point Shawbrook would be delisted.</p> <p>It would be a shame to see the ranks of quoted challenger banks depleted. But, actually, Pollen Street and BC make a fair point. The strength of the Brexit storms are unknowable for specialist lenders and may be better combated away from a public market that tends to demand lending growth in all circumstances.</p> <p>It\u2019s possible that Shawbrook, whose returns on equity have been strong when it has avoided cock-ups, will sail through happily.

                "bodyText":"About time too: a major advertiser has become so frustrated with Facebook and Google\u2019s limp attempts to police the content they publish that it has taken matters into its own hands. Vodafone will no longer rely on website \u201cblacklists\u201d drawn up by the social media titans and its own advertising agency. Instead, to prevent its ads appearing next to hate speech or fake news, Vodafone will issue a \u201cwhitelist\u201d of sites on which it is happy for its commercial messages to appear. The new approach is sensible. Indeed, it\u2019s a wonder that major advertisers have been so slow to protect themselves from Facebook and Google\u2019s failures. Vodafone spends \u00a3400m a year on online advertising. Even if 99% of that money ends up being directed to reputable sites, the other 1% can do serious damage to a brand while also generating revenue for some hideous websites. Advertisers\u2019 reluctance to take the initiative may stem from two factors. First, the worry that drawing up \u201cwhitelists\u201d and employing human judgment is a more expensive way to advertise. Second, a sense that Google and Facebook\u2019s machines are too big and powerful to challenge. Vodafone, let\u2019s hope, has shattered both ideas. Yes, it\u2019s a big advertiser that can afford to carry a few extra costs but it is surely right when it says algorithms, designed to carve up demographic categories, are simply not up to the job of making editorial judgments. It also seems to have little difficulty in laying down the new terms of trade to Google and Facebook. Other advertisers should follow Vodafone\u2019s lead \u2013 and, if not, explain why they\u2019re happy to turn a blind eye when even small portions of their advertising budgets end up funding some of the internet\u2019s most gruesome offerings. Shawbrook would be better going private Shawbrook is the challenger bank that has been a challenging investment at times for its shareholders. Floated at 290p in 2015, the shares fell as low at 130p a year ago after the referendum result \u2013 Brexit was deemed by the market to be unhelpful for UK buy-to-let lenders. Then came Shawbrook\u2019s confidence-rattling revelation of lending \u201cirregularities\u201d in one division. In the circumstances, you might have expected the board to embrace the takeover approach from Pollen Street, already a 38% owner, plus fellow private equity house BC Partners. That was the way the plot seemed to be heading when Shawbrook agreed to open its books. But the board has now rejected four offers, deeming the bidders\u2019 final pitch at 340p a share, or \u00a3868m, to be an undervaluation. One admires the independent directors\u2019 determination to squeeze Pollen Street for every last drop of value. In the end, however, resistance is likely to be futile since acceptances are already 45% and many of the other shares are already in the hands of arbitrage funds who are only there for the final bump in the bid. The real question is whether the bidders manage to pass 75%, at which point Shawbrook would be delisted. It would be a shame to see the ranks of quoted challenger banks depleted. But, actually, Pollen Street and BC make a fair point. The strength of the Brexit storms are unknowable for specialist lenders and may be better combated away from a public market that tends to demand lending growth in all circumstances. It\u2019s possible that Shawbrook, whose returns on equity have been strong when it has avoided cock-ups, will sail through happily. But the bidders aren\u2019t making a risk-free bet. It\u2019s probably best to let Shawbrook go private. Bailey stays on trend at Burberry The annual report would have been a good place for Burberry to explain what on earth the job of \u201cpresident\u201d involves. Christopher Bailey, the outgoing chief executive but continuing chief creative officer, will have presidential status from next month but the demands of the role remain obscure.

The election outcome looks set to further complicate the process of negotiating the UK\u2019s departure from the EU, as the government only has a narrow majority in parliament \u2013 and even this looks vulnerable in the context of Conservative MPs\u2019 widely differing views on post-Brexit UK-EU relations. Given the backdrop of an already slowing economy (the UK posted the lowest real GDP growth of all 28 EU economies in Q1 2017), it is not surprising that businesses are beginning to express a lack of confidence. We believe it\u2019s highly unlikely that the first round of Brexit talks between the British government and the EU (scheduled for 19/20 June) will deliver more clarity or significant results. This means that companies will have to wait even longer to assess the impact of these negotiations on their business. </p> <p>\u201cOur analysis indicates that uncertainty will remain high in the next 18 months, regardless of what happens in the wake of the election, and we are maintaining our risk rating of DB2d and our \u2018deteriorating\u2019 risk outlook for the UK economy.

That could be bad for Britain\u2019s credit rating, which is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/nov/02/moodys-warns-uk-credit-rating-downgrade-brexit\">currently Aa1 with Moody\u2019s, one notch below AAA</a>.</p> <p>But.... Moody\u2019s also suspects that Theresa May (or her successor) will now steer away from a hard Brexit, which would be <strong>good</strong> for Britain\u2019s credit rating.</p> <p> Here are the key points from the report</p> <ul> <li><strong>Inconclusive election outcome will complicate and probably delay Brexit negotiations, a credit negative. </strong>The negotiations with the EU were due to begin on 19 June, but we now expect a delay to the start of those negotiations or at least a period during which no substantive issues will be discussed. The time frame for the UK\u2019s withdrawal from the EU in March 2019 remains unchanged, reducing still further the time available to achieve the transition agreement needed to avoid a \u2018hard\u2019 Brexit.<br></li> <li><strong>We expect fiscal risks to increase because consolidation will have a lower priority, a credit negativ</strong>e. In our view, the budget deficit will increase this year and next, as the government reacts to the economic slowdown under way. The election outcome, with significant gains for the Labour Party which had campaigned for increased public spending, will likely be seen as a \u201cvote against austerity\u201d. The public debt ratio will rise further and for longer than we had expected, placing the UK among the few highly rated European sovereigns whose public debt is still rising.<strong><br></strong></li> <li><strong>However, the election outcome also means that the government may now consider \u201csofter\u201d Brexit options, which could be credit positive</strong>. While we still expect Brexit to happen and the \u201ccliff\u201d risk of sudden exit remains, the election result suggests an electoral shift away from the \u201chard\u201d Brexit that the Prime Minister had ostensibly sought. Hence, a move towards \u201csofter\u201d versions of Brexit \u2013 potentially with continued access of some sort to the Single Market \u2013 might now be considered.</li> </ul> <p>And here\u2019s a chart showing why Moody\u2019s is worried about Britain\u2019s national debt:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"50b814a37f829e3a931623cb4525f4a85ad62a89\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/50b814a37f829e3a931623cb4525f4a85ad62a89/0_0_656_262/500.jpg\" alt=\"UK fiscal profile\" width=\"500\" height=\"200\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-593e4dc7e4b0be3ed1925881\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-06-12T08:19:43.943Z\">9.19am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">S&amp;P: Election uncertainty will hurt growth</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Britain\u2019s economic growth is likely to be damaged by the current political instability, according to the European chief economist of ratings agency Standard &amp; Poor\u2019s.</strong></p> <p>Jean-Michel Six told the AJEF association of financial journalists in Paris that:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\u201cFor the time being, the outlook remains negative.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIn terms of the outlook for growth, it\u2019s clear that things are not going in the right direction.</p> <p>This latest bit of instability can only weaken the business environment and consumer confidence,\u201d </p> </blockquote> <p>Thanks to Reuters for the quotes....and this chart, showing how the UK economy has deteriorated recently:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/ReutersJamie/status/874178376399028224\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">UK economic surprises index - now negative, a 1-year low, and down sharply from (admittedly high levels) just a few months ago. <a href=\"https://t.co/1XpAhs98Di\">pic.twitter.com/1XpAhs98Di</a></p>&mdash; Jamie McGeever (@ReutersJamie) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ReutersJamie/status/874178376399028224\">June 12, 2017</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-593e4317e4b0be3ed192585c\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-06-12T08:15:48.241Z\">9.15am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>The shock election result has fuelled speculation that Britain may aim for a less \u2018hard\u2019 Brexit than Theresa May had planned.</strong></p> <p><strong>Kalum Pickering</strong> of<strong> Berenberg Bank</strong> explains:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>On the continent, most observers have taken the UK election result as a rebuke of Theresa May\u2019s hard Brexit rhetoric of the \u201cno deal is better than a bad deal\u201d kind.</p> <p>For example, EU Commission \u00d6ttinger has expressed hope that the UK may now agree to stay in the Customs Union and the Common Market, possibly by joining EFTA.

                "bodyText":"Time for a quick recap Sterling has lost ground today as fresh signs of UK political instability rattled investors. The pound has hit a seven-month low against the euro and is close to an eight-week low against the US dollar. Here\u2019s today\u2019s lows: \u00a31 = \u20ac1.1280, lowest since November 2016 \u00a31 = $1.1265, close to the eight-week low set in Friday The selloff came as rumours swirled through Westminster that next Monday\u2019s Queen\u2019s Speech might be postponed. This has highlighted that Theresa May\u2019s position in Downing Street remains vulnerable (and potentially creates a very awkward diary clash with the monarch\u2019s duties at Royal Ascot.) Political insiders are also reporting that the cabinet is split, with some members pushing for a softer Brexit plan. Business leaders have warned that confidence has been badly hit by the hung parliament delivered by last week\u2019s general election, which has left May chasing some sort of deal with the Democratic Unionist Party, which won 10 seats in Northern Ireland. The Institute for Directors said: \u201cIt is hard to overstate what a dramatic impact the current political uncertainty is having on business leaders, and the consequences could \u2013 if not addressed immediately \u2013 be disastrous for the UK economy. The needs of business and discussion of the economy were largely absent from the campaign, but this crash in confidence shows how urgently that must change in the new government. Rating agencies have weighed in too. Moody\u2019s warned that the hung parliament was \u2018credit negative\u2019 for the UK; a hint that Britain\u2019s credit rating could be downgraded. They said: Election result heightens uncertainty over Brexit negotiations and increases fiscal risks, a credit negative\u201d. S&amp;P\u2019s chief economist predicted that UK growth would be hurt. Harvard University added to the mix, with a study finding that most businesses want to remain in the single market. The Resolution Foundation warned that UK firms are worryingly unprepared for migration curbs. Meanwhile on Wall Street, US technology giants are suffering a second day of losses, with the Nasdaq down 1% in early trading. Is it the end of the tech boom?... ...not necessarily! Chris Beauchamp of IG says: Attention is concentrated on the ongoing rout in US tech stocks. Having been such a one-way bet so far this year, this sudden turn to the downside will have caught out more than a few over-eager latecomers. However, those rushing to proclaim the demise of one of the big rallies of not only the past year but the past eight years too need to be careful \u2013 there will be plenty of dip buyers out there who have been waiting for a pullback of this kind of size. And in Europe, the markets have just closed for the day. The FTSE 100 shed 15 points, or 0.25%, to 7511 - failing to get any benefit from the cheaper pound. The the German DAX shed almost 1% and the French CAC lost 1.2% That\u2019s all for tonight. Thanks for reading and commenting. GW Dr Mike Ellington of the University of Liverpool has written an interesting article on how sterling will suffer from the political crisis in Westminster. He\u2019s analysed UK economic uncertainty (measured by recording how many articles on economic and political unrest appear in the media each day), and tracked it against the value of the pound. He conclude that there is a \u2018negative relationship\u2019 between the two, with sterling suffering losses whenever It is clear that the negative relationship between policy uncertainty and the euro to sterling exchange rate is intensifying. This implies that increases in economic policy uncertainty are met with depreciations in the sterling to euro exchange rate running up to June 9, 2017. This indicates that currency markets do not feel the government has a strong negotiation position for Brexit (otherwise sterling wouldn\u2019t be so volatile). Ellington concludes that this means trouble ahead.... This, coupled with May\u2019s lack of support in the general election, should put her leadership into question, particularly when it comes to entering divorce talks with the EU. The very fact that the domestic political landscape of the UK is shrouded by yet another layer of uncertainty suggests that economic policy, the exchange rate, and indeed the wider economy, is in for a rough ride. Here\u2019s the full piece: Why the hung parliament spells economic turbulence for the UK economy The Institute of Director\u2019s warning that UK business confidence has plunged since the general election has caused quite a stir. Here\u2019s some of the best reaction: Markus Kuger, senior economist at business services firm Dun &amp; Bradstreet \u201cAfter the surprising election result, political and economic uncertainty in the UK has risen considerably. The election outcome looks set to further complicate the process of negotiating the UK\u2019s departure from the EU, as the government only has a narrow majority in parliament \u2013 and even this looks vulnerable in the context of Conservative MPs\u2019 widely differing views on post-Brexit UK-EU relations. Given the backdrop of an already slowing economy (the UK posted the lowest real GDP growth of all 28 EU economies in Q1 2017), it is not surprising that businesses are beginning to express a lack of confidence. We believe it\u2019s highly unlikely that the first round of Brexit talks between the British government and the EU (scheduled for 19/20 June) will deliver more clarity or significant results. This means that companies will have to wait even longer to assess the impact of these negotiations on their business. \u201cOur analysis indicates that uncertainty will remain high in the next 18 months, regardless of what happens in the wake of the election, and we are maintaining our risk rating of DB2d and our \u2018deteriorating\u2019 risk outlook for the UK economy. We predict that, in the long run, the election result could make a \u2018hard\u2019 Brexit - which we believe would be harmful for the British economy - impossible. Jenni Hibbert, Managing Partner for Financial Services Europe &amp; Africa at executive headhunters Heidrick &amp; Struggles \u201cWorries about the future are not just relegated to those in financial services: we recently conducted a wide-ranging survey with hospitality CEOs, the UK\u2019s fourth largest employer accounting for 180,000 businesses in the UK, with less than one in ten confident about the future and almost half describing themselves as concerned.\u201d Former UK shadow chancellor Ed Balls has also weighed in on Brexit today by co-authoring a report which found that a bad deal would be a disaster for the UK. A survey of small UK businesses by Harvard University found that \u201calmost all\u201d business leaders wanted to retain membership of the single market and customs union, to make it easier to keep trading with the EU. Balls says: \u201cAt the time of the referendum, many British companies thought that Brexit might lead to a reduced regulatory burden. But now they\u2019re worried that if Britain leaves the single market and the customs union, the opposite will be true.\u201d Here\u2019s the full story: During the election campaign, both the Labour and Conservative leadership said Britain would leave the single market after Brexit - in order to impose migration controls. However, Labour\u2019s Brexit secretary, Sir Kier Starmer, has suggested today that the UK could stay inside the single market; a reminder that there are differing views on Brexit in both major parties... Newsflash: Shares in tech companies are falling again at the start of trading on Wall Street. The Nasdaq has shed 1%, losing 64 points to 6,143, at the start of trading. That adds to Friday\u2019s 1.8% tumble, Amazon, Alphabet/Google and Apple are all leading the fallers, as concerns grow that these tech giants have become overvalue. Ouch! The pound has just hit a new seven-month low against the euro, and is falling further against the dollar too. Sterling dropped as low as \u20ac1.1280, down almost one euro cent today. That\u2019s its lowest level since last November. Sterling is also continuing to lose ground against the US dollar; it\u2019s now down 0.5% at $1.2671- close to the eight-week low hit after the general election. The selloff comes as Theresa May government fails to show a great deal of strength and stability - with the Queen\u2019s speech reportedly postponed. FXTM Vice President of Market Research, Jameel Ahmad, argues that the pound will suffer fresh losses as Brexit talks begin next week. He isn\u2019t convinced that a move towards a \u2018softer Brexit\u2019 will provide much support. I personally still see downside risks for the Sterling and see the potential for the market to become encouraged towards selling in the likelihood that the UK is set to begin negotiations next week and looks very unprepared for such complex negotiations. The whole reason for the UK election in the first place was so that Theresa May would have more powers to influence the Brexit process, but not only has this play backfired, the UK looks more unprepared than ever to go head-to-head with the EU as it currently stands. I personally remain bearish on the Sterling. Carolyn Fairbairn, the director-general of the Confederation of British Industry, has also weighed in on the issue of EU migrants. She warns that British firms can\u2019t be expected to replace EU nationals with UK citizens, at a time when employment in Britain is already at record high levels. Fairbairn also told the Resolution Foundation\u2019s conference that politicians need to concentrate on the economy again.. Speaking of EU migration.... Britain\u2019s businesses are \u201ctotally unprepared\u201d for the drop in migration after Brexit, according to a new report from the Resolution Foundation today. The think tank polled more than 500 UK businesses who employ EU workers, and found that 17% expect no change to the current system of freedom of movement for EU/EEA nationals to the UK. Another 30% believe this system will be maintained for anyone from the EU who arrives in Britain with a job offer. These are \u201ctotally unrealistic expectations\u201d, warns Resolution, because: The Prime Minister in contrast has ruled out either option, stating that her government \u2013 rather than firms\u2019 demand for workers \u2013 will control migrant numbers. The Conservative Manifesto recommitted the government to reducing net migration down to the tens of thousands. The report was presented to a conference in London today, which also heard that the UK agriculture sector needs tens of thousands of season workers each year. The National Farmers Union is urging the government to consider this issue during the Brexit talks: Guardian Business has launched a daily email. Besides the key news headlines that you\u2019d expect, there\u2019s an at-a-glance agenda of the day\u2019s main events, insightful opinion pieces and a quality feature to sink your teeth into each day. For your morning shot of financial news, sign up here: Another dollop of uncertainty has just landed on our plates; Downing Street are hinting that the Queen\u2019s Speech might not take place next Monday after all. Our political liveblogger Andrew Sparrow has just returned from the regular lobby briefing with Theresa May\u2019s spokesman, and reports: The spokesman said that the new leader of the Commons, Andrea Leadsom, would be making a statement about the date of the Queen\u2019s speech in due course. The spokesman would not say anymore, but he would not confirm that it will go ahead as planned on Monday next week. It may be that the government has decided to delay it until it has agreed its deal with the DUP. A delay would be most unusual - and rather irksome for Queen Elizabeth II, who is expecting to spend most of next week at the Royal Ascot races. Sterling has fallen against every other major currency today, according to Bloomberg, which explains: The pound fell against all its Group-of-10 peers on the prospect of an unstable coalition government heading into Brexit talks with the European Union in a week\u2019s time. Betfair reckon there\u2019s a one-in-three chance that Britain will hold a second general election this year. Here are the latest odds: Year of Next General Election 2017 3.0 (2/1 or 33% chance) 2018 4.0 (3/1 or 25% chance) 2019 4.9 (4/1) 2020 8.8 (8/1) 2021 9.4 (17/2) 2022 7.6 (13/2) They\u2019ve also provided some odds for Theresa May\u2019s likely replacement: Next Conservative Leader Boris Johnson 3.4 (12/5) David Davis 4.7 (7/2) Amber Rudd 9.0 (8/1) Ruth Davidson 10.0 (9/1) Phillip Hammond 17.5 (16/1) Michael Gove 23.0 (22/1) Speculation that Theresa May might change her Brexit stance is propping up sterling, says Lee Hardman, currency analyst at MUFG. \u201cThe rise of softer Brexit speculation is another reason why the pound has not declined more sharply following the UK general election result\u201d. More here: Britain\u2019s unstable political situation means the pound will remain volatile for some times, says investment bank JP Morgan. It told its clients that: The UK delivered another electoral surprise this week with the Conservative party losing its majority in Parliament. This means the Conservatives would be reliant on the Northern Irish DUP with its 10 seats to establish a thin parliamentary majority. This raises questions about PM May\u2019s ability to deliver a hard Brexit given the desire in Northern Ireland for a frictionless border with the Republic of Ireland. For sterling rates, this means markets are likely to be caught between the opposing forces of political instability associated with a Conservative minority government, and a potential softening of the Brexit stance. Moody\u2019s gloomy report on the UK\u2019s election has knocked the pound, says Neil Wilson of ETX Capital: \u201cSentiment around the pound took a bit of a dive in morning trading in London. After treading water around $1.274 for the last few days since the election, cable eased back below the $1.27 handle after Moody\u2019s warned that the election result is \u2018credit negative\u2019 for the UK. This seems to have woken traders from their slumber and the pound is on the defensive as we start the week. It wouldn\u2019t take much bad news from the UK political scene to force cable to take another leg lower. Still there is plenty of bid to catch on the way down as the dips are being viewed as short-term buying opportunities. Sentiment remains pretty bearish. As Moody\u2019s points out there is a chance of a softer Brexit but we must also think there is a heightened risk of a cliff-edge exit from the EU.\u201d Sterling is also dropping against the euro, losing 0.6% to \u20ac1.1322. On Friday it hit an eight-month low of \u20ac1.1285 before recovering a little. Update: the pound had now dropped below $1.27, towards the eight-week low struck on Friday morning as the election results came in. The pound is dipping back towards $1.27, down 0.2% today, as investors analyse these warnings from Moody\u2019s and S&amp;P and wait for developments in Westminster. Joshua Mahony, market analyst at IG, says the drop in business confidence, and the slowdown in household spending, are worrying the City: This decline in economic indicators may have been a long time coming, yet with a weakened political mandate and Brexit negotiations about to start, it is likely that we will see the UK continue to struggle. The fallout from the UK election continues and will remain key to expectations for the pound. Newsflash from the Bank of England: Andy Haldane, the BoE\u2019s chief economist, has been reappointed to the Monetary Policy Committee. That means Haldane will continue to vote on UK interest rates and the Bank\u2019s stimulus programme until 2020. It\u2019s not a big surprise, but it is worth noting as Haldane is one of the most dovish members of the committee. Speaking of Brexit delays..... The formal Brexit talks are due to begin on 19 June, the same day as the Queen\u2019s speech.... Rating agency Moody\u2019s has also issued a report on the UK election, and it\u2019s not very cheery reading. It is titled: \u201cElection result heightens uncertainty over Brexit negotiations and increases fiscal risks, a credit negative\u201d. And it warns that negotiating to leave the EU will now be a more complicated process. Moody\u2019s fears that those talks (which are due to start next week) may be delayed, or may not focus on \u201csubstantive issues\u201d for a while as the Conservative Party tries to agree a deal with the Democratic Unionist Party. Moody\u2019s is also worried that Britain\u2019s national debt will keep rising for longer, as the government wrestles with a slowing economy and the public backlash against austerity. That could be bad for Britain\u2019s credit rating, which is currently Aa1 with Moody\u2019s, one notch below AAA. But.... Moody\u2019s also suspects that Theresa May (or her successor) will now steer away from a hard Brexit, which would be good for Britain\u2019s credit rating. Here are the key points from the report Inconclusive election outcome will complicate and probably delay Brexit negotiations, a credit negative. The negotiations with the EU were due to begin on 19 June, but we now expect a delay to the start of those negotiations or at least a period during which no substantive issues will be discussed. The time frame for the UK\u2019s withdrawal from the EU in March 2019 remains unchanged, reducing still further the time available to achieve the transition agreement needed to avoid a \u2018hard\u2019 Brexit. We expect fiscal risks to increase because consolidation will have a lower priority, a credit negative. In our view, the budget deficit will increase this year and next, as the government reacts to the economic slowdown under way. The election outcome, with significant gains for the Labour Party which had campaigned for increased public spending, will likely be seen as a \u201cvote against austerity\u201d. The public debt ratio will rise further and for longer than we had expected, placing the UK among the few highly rated European sovereigns whose public debt is still rising. However, the election outcome also means that the government may now consider \u201csofter\u201d Brexit options, which could be credit positive. While we still expect Brexit to happen and the \u201ccliff\u201d risk of sudden exit remains, the election result suggests an electoral shift away from the \u201chard\u201d Brexit that the Prime Minister had ostensibly sought. Hence, a move towards \u201csofter\u201d versions of Brexit \u2013 potentially with continued access of some sort to the Single Market \u2013 might now be considered. And here\u2019s a chart showing why Moody\u2019s is worried about Britain\u2019s national debt: Britain\u2019s economic growth is likely to be damaged by the current political instability, according to the European chief economist of ratings agency Standard &amp; Poor\u2019s. Jean-Michel Six told the AJEF association of financial journalists in Paris that: \u201cFor the time being, the outlook remains negative.\u201d \u201cIn terms of the outlook for growth, it\u2019s clear that things are not going in the right direction. This latest bit of instability can only weaken the business environment and consumer confidence,\u201d Thanks to Reuters for the quotes....and this chart, showing how the UK economy has deteriorated recently: The shock election result has fuelled speculation that Britain may aim for a less \u2018hard\u2019 Brexit than Theresa May had planned. Kalum Pickering of Berenberg Bank explains: On the continent, most observers have taken the UK election result as a rebuke of Theresa May\u2019s hard Brexit rhetoric of the \u201cno deal is better than a bad deal\u201d kind. For example, EU Commission \u00d6ttinger has expressed hope that the UK may now agree to stay in the Customs Union and the Common Market, possibly by joining EFTA. To remain in the Common Market and thus maintain preferential access to the EU27 market (except for some financial products where regulators will insist that some activities have to be carried out under the direct sway of EU regulators), the UK would have to accept the free movement of labour and continue to pay into the EU budget like EFTA members do. Whether or not a Tory-led government could agree to that remains a very open question, though, to put it mildly. Indeed! And in the last few minutes, Brexit secretary David Davis has played down the idea that the government could soften its stance - insisting that leaving the EU meant leaving the single market. More in our Politics Live blog: Buzzfeed\u2019s Alberto Nardelli tweets: Traders will be watching Wall Street nervously when it opens later today, to see if technology stocks keep falling. Apple fell by 4% on Friday, while Alphabet (Google), Microsoft, Amazon and Facebook all shed 3% - wiping almost $100bn off their market value. The selloff comes after a long surge in tech stocks, so investors are wondering if the rally is over. Kathleen Brooks of City Index says other assets could be spooked.... Friday\u2019s sell off in some of the US\u2019s biggest tech names was sharp and severe on Friday. But was this just a bit of profit taking after a note from Goldman Sachs questioned the $600bn increase in some tech firms\u2019 market cap in the past year? This is an important question that we need answered as tech stock weakness is having an impact on other growth assets today. The MSCI emerging markets index fell on Friday, yet the Aussie dollar, which is correlated with growth assets, was relatively stable on Monday. The BBC has a good take on the IoD\u2019s business confidence survey: The uncertainty caused by the general election has led business confidence to sink \u201cthrough the floor\u201d, according to a lobby group. A snap poll of 700 members of the Institute of Directors found a \u201cdramatic drop\u201d in confidence following the hung parliament. Members saw no clear way to resolve the political impasse quickly, the IoD said. However, it found there was \u201cno desire\u201d for another election this year.... More here: Europe\u2019s stock markets are a sea of red this morning, as investors digest the tumble in UK business confidence in the last couple of days. Shares are being pulled down by worries over UK politics, and the selloff in the tech sector. Connor Campbell of SpreadEx says there isn\u2019t much optimism in the City this morning. Falling around half a percent the UK index found itself back below the 7500 mark, if only just, as the Institute of Directors warned that its members were feeling pretty damn pessimistic about the state of the UK economy in the next 12 months. The pound, meanwhile, neither continued last week\u2019s decline nor substantially recovered any of those election-losses, opening 0.1% higher against the dollar and flat against the euro. The FTSE 250 index, which is more UK-focused than the FTSE 100, has dropped by 50 points (or 0.25%) in early trading to 19,719. The IoD\u2019s gloomy warning on business confidence is helping to keep a lid on the pound this morning. Sterling is hovering around $1.274, close to Friday night\u2019s close. It tumbled by over two cents when the election exit polls came out on Thursday night. Craig Erlam, senior market analyst at OANDA, warns that the pound is vulnerable to political uncertainty, as prime minister May tries to cling onto power. With Theresa May scrambling to repair the self-inflicted damage suffered as a result of the election, there remains a huge amount of uncertainty around her position and with only a week to go before Brexit talks with the EU begin, I feel there may be a few more twists to come yet. May has not delivered the strong and stable government she wanted and instead looks weak and vulnerable. I find it hard to see how she recovers from this. Mike van Dulken of Accendo Markets agrees, saying: Sentiment remains dented by politics following the UK\u2019s hung parliament and shift in the balance of UK political power. European stock markets have opened in the red, with the FTSE 100 losing 27 points (or 0.4%). Technology stocks are the biggest fallers, following a selloff on Wall Street on Friday night. Manish Singh of CrossBridge Capital, an investment advisory firm, isn\u2019t surprised that business confidence has fallen since the UK election. He says many business leaders are now pondering the prospect of Jeremy Corbyn becoming prime minister, after he smashed expectations and gained 32 seats. Speaking on Bloomberg TV, Singh says: If you are a business, you really need to start thinking \u2018what is in the Labour manifesto?\u2019.... It will have some businesses worrying about Mr Corbyn\u2019s policies. Labour\u2019s manifesto included raising income tax on those earning over \u00a380,00 per year, increasing corporation tax, and renationalising the water companies, as well as free childcare, ending the freeze on welfare benefits and abolishing tuition fees. Singh says political instability can deter businesses from investing, especially when the Brexit talks are also hanging over them. But he also agrees that younger voters are right too feel aggrieved, as yound people in Europe will be poorer than previous generations. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. European stock markets are set to fall this morning, as evidence piles up that Britain\u2019s mounting political uncertainty is hurting the economy. The Institute of Directors have issued a stark warning that business optimism has plunged after Theresa May lost her House of Commons majority last week. A new survey of IoD members found that 57% are either quite pessimistic or very pessimistic about the UK economy over the next 12 months. Just a fifth described themselves as optimistic -- which gives a \u2018net confidence\u2019 score of minus 37. That\u2019s a serious deterioration compared to the previous month, when 34% were optimistic and 37% pessimistic. The poll, conducted over the weekend, found that many business leaders are alarmed by the prospect of a hung parliament, just as the Brexit negotiations begin. Stephen Martin, director general of the Institute of Directors, says British politicians need to urgently refocus on the state of the economy. \u201cIt is hard to overstate what a dramatic impact the current political uncertainty is having on business leaders, and the consequences could \u2013 if not addressed immediately \u2013 be disastrous for the UK economy. The needs of business and discussion of the economy were largely absent from the campaign, but this crash in confidence shows how urgently that must change in the new government. This chart might focus a few minds in Westminster: The IoD\u2019s survey isn\u2019t the only cause for concern this morning. Visa have reported that household spending fell last month, for the first time in almost four years. It highlights how consumers are being squeezed by rising inflation and political uncertainty, and cutting back on non-essential items. As things stand this morning, May\u2019s grip on Number 10 is looking precarious, with insiders saying she cannot lead the Conservative Party into another election. Yesterday she was savaged as a \u201cdead woman walking\u2019 by former chancellor George Osborne (who seems to be enjoying his new career in journalism). But the game isn\u2019t over, yet. Later today May will appeal to her MPs for support, in an attempt to remain as prime minister. Our political editor Heather Stewart explains: The prime minister is expected to signal to her parliamentary colleagues that she will run her government in a more collegiate, less controlling way, after sacrificing her two closest advisers, Fiona Hill and Nick Timothy. With many backbenchers blaming May for the party\u2019s poor performance at the polls, one senior Conservative said she would have to give a \u201cbarnstorming\u201d performance at the meeting of the party\u2019s 1922 committee of MPs to hold on to her job. Spread-betting firm IG expect the main European markets to fall by up to 0.5% this morning. While Britain is gripped by May\u2019s crisis-of-her-own-making, France\u2019s Emmanuel Macron is showing us how to lead a country. The French president\u2019s En Marche party is on track for a landslide win in parliamentary elections, giving him enough muscle to start pushing through economic reforms. There\u2019s very little in the economic calendar today, alas.",

                "bodyText":"ITV\u2019s hunt for a chief executive has narrowed to a shortlist that includes a senior Sky executive, the boss of an insurance group and the head of a Scottish broadcaster. Its board is expected to discuss the selection process at a meeting this week that could identify Adam Crozier\u2019s successor, with an official announcement expected in July. The shortlist is led by Andrew Griffith, chief operating officer at Sky, Paul Geddes, chief executive of Direct Line, and Rob Woodward, the outgoing chief executive of STV, which holds the ITV broadcasting licences for northern and central Scotland. Candidates thought to still be in the running also include Simon Pitts, the managing director of ITV\u2019s digital and pay TV strategy. Pitts is also thought to have made it to final interviews for the Channel 4 chief executive role. John Smith, a former chief operating officer at Burberry and ex-chief of BBC Worldwide, is also viewed as a contender. ITV\u2019s nominations committee is understood to be seeking a candidate with solid experience at a major publicly listed company, with headhunters Spencer Stuart looking beyond the media sector and flagging the candidacy of Geddes, who is also a non-executive director at Channel 4. ITV\u2019s chairman, Sir Peter Bazalgette, has no experience of chairing a listed business. It is thought that some FTSE experience would bolster ITV\u2019s board-level operations. Crozier leaves at the end of the month. Multiple sources have said that the ITV board has been aware of his intentions to leave as far back as October. The process for Channel 4 to appoint a new chief executive took less than three months, with Alex Mahon to take over from David Abraham in October or early November. ITV has put in place an interim measure in which Bazalgette will take the temporary role of executive chairman. Finance director Ian Griffith will run the company as chief operating officer until Crozier\u2019s replacement starts. Griffiths s highly rated by the City but not thought to have applied for the top job. When ITV announced Crozier\u2019s departure at the beginning of May, Bazalgette said the company had a \u201cwell-developed succession plan\u201d in place. The chairman was questioned by investors at ITV\u2019s annual meeting later that month, to which he said: \u201cNothing has gone wrong, we are in a good place.\u201d One top 10 ITV shareholder said that the despite outward appearances the broadcaster had been preparing for Crozier\u2019s departure for a considerable time. \u201cWe have been fully engaged with the board over the last six to none months over succession planning,\u201d said the investor, who did not wish to be named. \u201cWe saw the chairman at the end of last year and don\u2019t have concerns over the process. It is a fully thought out process.\u201d The chief executive of WPP, one of the biggest spenders of advertisers\u2019 money on ITV, said the broadcaster had a tough task choosing its next leader, with the TV advertising market under attack from Facebook and Google and viewers being lured away by the rise of streaming rivals businesses such as Netflix and Amazon. \u201cClearly [ITV] is going to need somebody who has a fundamental understanding of traditional and new, over the top [internet] services, so it is a balance,\u201d Sir Martin Sorrell said. \u201cThey probably need a global understanding as well, as ITV is now a much more international business.

It is also now liable to face civil actions for damages by any person or business affected by its anti-competitive behaviour.</p> <p>As<strong> </strong>the EU official in charge of competition policy, commissioner Margrethe Vestager<strong>, </strong>spelled out the case against Google, she denied accusations that Brussels had a bias against US firms, claiming the tech giant had been guilty of an \u201cold school\u201d form of illegality.</p> <p>\u201cGoogle has come up with many innovative products and services that have made a difference to our lives. That\u2019s a good thing,\u201d Vestager told reporters, as she announced the fine, the largest ever made in an antitrust case. \u201cBut Google\u2019s strategy for its comparison shopping service wasn\u2019t just about attracting customers by making its product better than those of its rivals.</p> <p>\u201cInstead, Google abused its market dominance as a search engine by promoting its own comparison shopping service in its search results, and demoting those of competitors.</p> <p>\u201cWhat Google has done is illegal under EU antitrust rules. It denied other companies the chance to compete on the merits and to innovate. And most importantly, it denied European consumers a genuine choice of services and the full benefits of innovation.\u201d</p> <p>In the wake of the announcement, shares in Alphabet fell 1.5% in pre-market trading in New York. Vestager brushed off suggestions that the move could harm transatlantic relations, adding that the EU was not willing to give Google a \u201cfree pass\u201d. </p> <p>She confirmed, however, that the EU regulator had stopped cooperating with the US Federal Trade Commission when it decided not to pursue charges in 2013.</p> <p>Google immediately rejected the commission\u2019s findings, and signalled its intention to appeal, in an indication of the gruelling legal battle to come between the two sides. A company spokesman said: \u201cWhen you shop online, you want to find the products you\u2019re looking for quickly and easily. And advertisers want to promote those same products.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s why Google shows shopping ads, connecting our users with thousands of advertisers, large and small, in ways that are useful for both. </p> <p>\u201cWe respectfully disagree with the conclusions announced today. We will review the commission\u2019s decision in detail as we consider an appeal, and we look forward to continuing to make our case.\u201d</p> <p>Vestager told reporters that Google had entered the shopping comparison market in 2004 with a service called Froogle which allowed its users to compare products and prices online.</p> <p>Within two years the company knew it was struggling, she said.

                "bodyText":"The European Union has handed Google a record-breaking \u20ac2.42bn (\u00a32.14bn) fine for abusing its dominance of the search engine market in building its online shopping service, in a dramatic decision that has far-reaching implications for the company. By artificially and illegally promoting its own price comparison service in searches, Google denied both its consumers real choice and rival firms the ability to compete on a level playing field, European regulators said. The Silicon Valley giant has 90 days to stop its illegal activities and explain how it will reform its ways or face fines of up to \u20ac10.6m a day, which equates to 5% of the average daily worldwide turnover of its parent company Alphabet. On the back of the finding that Google is the dominant player in the European search engine market, the EU regulator is further investigating how else the company may have abused its position, specifically in its provision of maps, images and information on local services. The commission\u2019s decision, following a seven-year probe into Google\u2019s dominance in searches and smartphones, suggests the company may need to fundamentally rethink the way it operates. It is also now liable to face civil actions for damages by any person or business affected by its anti-competitive behaviour. As the EU official in charge of competition policy, commissioner Margrethe Vestager, spelled out the case against Google, she denied accusations that Brussels had a bias against US firms, claiming the tech giant had been guilty of an \u201cold school\u201d form of illegality. \u201cGoogle has come up with many innovative products and services that have made a difference to our lives. That\u2019s a good thing,\u201d Vestager told reporters, as she announced the fine, the largest ever made in an antitrust case. \u201cBut Google\u2019s strategy for its comparison shopping service wasn\u2019t just about attracting customers by making its product better than those of its rivals. \u201cInstead, Google abused its market dominance as a search engine by promoting its own comparison shopping service in its search results, and demoting those of competitors. \u201cWhat Google has done is illegal under EU antitrust rules. It denied other companies the chance to compete on the merits and to innovate. And most importantly, it denied European consumers a genuine choice of services and the full benefits of innovation.\u201d In the wake of the announcement, shares in Alphabet fell 1.5% in pre-market trading in New York. Vestager brushed off suggestions that the move could harm transatlantic relations, adding that the EU was not willing to give Google a \u201cfree pass\u201d. She confirmed, however, that the EU regulator had stopped cooperating with the US Federal Trade Commission when it decided not to pursue charges in 2013. Google immediately rejected the commission\u2019s findings, and signalled its intention to appeal, in an indication of the gruelling legal battle to come between the two sides. A company spokesman said: \u201cWhen you shop online, you want to find the products you\u2019re looking for quickly and easily. And advertisers want to promote those same products. \u201cThat\u2019s why Google shows shopping ads, connecting our users with thousands of advertisers, large and small, in ways that are useful for both. \u201cWe respectfully disagree with the conclusions announced today. We will review the commission\u2019s decision in detail as we consider an appeal, and we look forward to continuing to make our case.\u201d Vestager told reporters that Google had entered the shopping comparison market in 2004 with a service called Froogle which allowed its users to compare products and prices online. Within two years the company knew it was struggling, she said. One internal document from 2006 discovered during the investigation stated: \u201cFroogle simply doesn\u2019t work.\u201d From 2008, Vestager said, Google began to implement, initially in the UK and Germany, and then further afield, a fundamental change in strategy to push its comparison shopping service, and break EU law. According to an analysis of around 1.7bn search queries, Google\u2019s search algorithm systematically was consistently giving prominent placement to its own comparison shopping service to the detriment of rival services. The placement of Google\u2019s product well ahead of its rivals was pivotal to the shopping service\u2019s success as, even on a desktop, the 10 highest-ranking generic search results on page one generally receive approximately 95% of all clicks on generic search results. The top result receives about 35% of all the clicks and the trend is exaggerated further for searches on mobile phones. The commission found that Google was dominant in general internet search markets in all 31 countries in the European Economic Area, with a market share of about 90%. As a result of Google\u2019s illegal practices, traffic to Google\u2019s comparison shopping service increased significantly \u2013 45-fold in the UK, for example \u2013 while rivals suffered very substantial losses of traffic on a lasting basis, Vestager said. The commission found specific evidence of sudden drops of traffic to certain rival websites of 85% in the UK, up to 92% in Germany and 80% in France. Some competitors have adapted and managed to recover some traffic but never in full, Vestager said. The commission\u2019s fine of \u20ac2,424,495,000 was said to take into account the \u201cduration and gravity of the infringement\u201d, and was based on Google\u2019s revenue from its comparison shopping service in the 13 countries where the illegality occured. If Google fails to comply with the commission\u2019s decision, it would be liable for non-compliance payments of up to 5% of the average daily worldwide turnover of Alphabet, which boasted of a turnover of \u20ac80bn last year. Any payment would be backdated to when the non-compliance started, Vestager said. The commission has already come to the preliminary conclusion that Google has abused a dominant position in two other cases, which are still being investigated. The first cases involve the Android operating system, where the commission is concerned that Google has \u201cstifled choice and innovation\u201d in a range of mobile apps and services by \u201cpursuing an overall strategy on mobile devices to protect and expand its dominant position in general internet search\u201d. In a second investigation into AdSense, a Google service that allows websites to run targeted ads, the commission is concerned that Google has reduced choice by preventing sites from sourcing search ads from competitors.

The regulator said that phone hacking at the News of the World and allegations of sexual and racial harassment at Fox News had amounted to significant corporate failure at the Murdochs companies \u2013 but this was not enough to prevent them from holding a broadcasting licence. Ofcom found there was no \u201cclear evidence\u201d that senior executives at Fox were aware of sexual misconduct before 2016, and that Fox and Sky\u2019s compliance record with the broadcasting code was in line with other broadcasters. The Murdoch\u2019s previous bid for Sky collapsed in 2011 when News Corporation was forced to withdraw its interest amid public furore over phone hacking at the News of the World. The company bidding this time is 21st Century Fox, which owns the 20th Century Fox film studio and the Fox TV network. It was carved out of Murdoch\u2019s News Corporation empire in the wake of the phone-hacking scandal. Murdoch\u2019s remaining newspapers, including the Sun and the Times, are now part of a separate company, News Corp, although both it and 21st Century Fox are still controlled by the media mogul and his family. Hacked Off, which represents phone hacking victims, condemned the decision not to refer the bid to the CMA on the grounds of broadcasting standards and said the Murdochs have an \u201cappalling record of corporate governance failures\u201d.
