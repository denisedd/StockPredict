                "body":"<p>It was night, stormy, and the oil rig Transocean Winner was somewhere in the North Atlantic on 7 August 2016 when her tow-line broke. No crew members were on board. The rig was being dragged by a tugboat called Forward, the tethered vessels charting a course out of Norway that was meant to take them on a month-long journey to Malta. Within the offices of Transocean Ltd, the oil-exploration company that owned the rig, such a journey might have been described with corporate seemliness as an \u00e2\u20ac\u0153end-of-life voyage\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd; but in the saltier language heard offshore, the rig was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153going for fucking razorblades\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u201c for scrap, to be dismantled in a shipbreaking yard east of Malta. In that Atlantic storm, several thousand miles from her intended destination, Winner floated free.</p> <p>The 33-year-old rig had never moved with so little constraint. Winner was huge \u00e2\u20ac\u201c 17,000 tonnes, like an elevated Trafalgar Square, complete with a middle derrick as tall as Nelson\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Column, her four legs the shape of castle keeps; all this was borne up in the water on a pair of barge-sized pontoons \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and its positioning had always been precisely controlled. While moored, she was held in place by eight heavy anchors. At other times, she was sailed with a pilot at the helm as if she were any other ship. When contracted to drill in the North Sea, as she had been since the 1980s, boring into the bedrock for hidden reservoirs of oil, Winner\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s anchors and underwater propellers worked together with her on-board computers to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153dynamically position\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd her \u00e2\u20ac\u201c that is, keep her very still. The men and women who formed Winner\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s crew \u00e2\u20ac\u201c drillers and engineers and geologists and divers and cleaners and cooks, most of them Norwegian \u00e2\u20ac\u201c imagined this rig to have a character that would resist such checks. They nicknamed her <em>Svanen</em>, or Swan, because to them she was both elegant and unyielding. Scheduled as she was for destruction, Winner could not have chosen a better moment to bolt.</p> <p>The master on the tugboat Forward radioed for help. Through a series of exchanges with Transocean, as well as with the British coastguard and Forward\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s owners, the Rotterdam-based ALP Maritime, the master explained his situation. Both tugboat and rig had been caught in heavy weather while circumnavigating the Hebrides, sailing a mile and a half off the Scottish islands. It turned into the worst summer storm in the region for years, with winds of 40 knots and waves 10 metres high. Throughout the afternoon of 7 August, Forward and Winner were tossed on a course running parallel with the coast of Lewis, one of the outermost Hebridean islands. For a time it seemed they would be sent on by, still fettered to each other, still Mediterranean-bound. But in the early evening the wind changed direction, and Forward and Winner \u00e2\u20ac\u201c or more accurately, Winner and Forward, given that the rig was now acting as a huge metal sail and comfortably tugging her own tugboat \u00e2\u20ac\u201c were forced landward. It was around 4am when the master radioed to confirm that the tow-line had snapped.</p> <p>Winner had, for all of her life, been painted bright orange. The colour had become chipped and rust-stained over time, but was still vivid in daylight, visible for miles. In the storm, the rig disappeared completely. Radar data from those early-morning hours showed Forward moving back and forth in the water off Lewis, as if retracing steps for something misplaced. It was agreed between Transocean, ALP, the coastguard and other emergency authorities that Winner was irretrievable. Everybody would wait until sunrise, and see.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/audio/2017/may/12/where-oil-rigs-go-to-die-podcast\">Where oil rigs go to die \u00e2\u20ac\u201c podcast</a> </p> </aside>  <h2>Stavanger</h2> <p>The world has a problem with its oil rigs. There are too many of them, and for the first time since the earliest manufacture of seaborne drilling platforms 50 or 60 years ago, decisions are being made about how and where to get rid of them in number. That there should be a sudden surplus is vexing for those invested in undersea drilling: as recently as 2010 the rigs were thought too few. Back then, had an oil company such as Shell or BP or Marathon wanted to dig down and discover what was lying beneath a particular patch of sea, it wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t unusual for them to wait as long as a year until an exploration company such as Transocean or Diamond or Ensco had a rig available to lease to them. It was a time of undersupply. Dozens of new rigs were commissioned, and worldwide orders tripled between 2010 and 2011. But oil rigs take two or three years to build, and by the time these were ready for use, the price of oil had declined sharply, and with it the industry\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hunger to prospect \u00e2\u20ac\u201c thus the oversupply. Rigs without contracts to drill were either \u00e2\u20ac\u0153cold-stacked\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd (anchored without crew) to wait for a market recovery, or sold for demolition. More than 40 oil rigs were waved off on end-of-life voyages in 2015, according to data gathered by a Brussels-based maritime NGO called Shipbreaking Platform; up from a single dispensed-with rig, so far as the NGO knew, in 2014.</p> <p>It was a hasty and disordered rebalancing of the global fleet, and not all the decisions made were sensible. In the spring of 2016, for instance, at about the time Transocean was considering whether or not to decommission Winner, its drilling rival Ensco sent away two rigs that were relatively new: built in 2004, and meant to bear 30 or 40 years of graft, but hurriedly euthanised after 12. Winner, by comparison, had lived long and busily. She was launched in 1983, and in the decades since had bobbed through market downturns and upturns, through winter hurricanes and underwater blowouts, and at least two on-board deaths. For the most part, Winner\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 33 years at sea had been characterised by day after day of patient, repetitive work \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the stuff that gives offshore life its rhythm and, for many, its special comfort. Drill supervisor Andr\u00c3\u00a9 Arctander, a tanned greybeard from Stavanger in Norway, calculated that he had spent a third of his life on this rig. The colour of his boilersuit had changed, Arctander said, in accordance with the branding requirements of drilling clients, but he retained throughout a deeper loyalty to Winner and her regular crew \u00e2\u20ac\u0153that went beyond corporate logos\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. He spoke of getting so in tune with the rig during his fortnight-long stints on board that he could fall asleep in his cabin and wake up knowing half of what had happened while he was under, just from having felt the changes in Winner\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s vibrations and having heard her machine-purrs.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/aug/15/transocean-winner-oil-platform-salvage-crew-isle-of-lewis\">Salvage crew boards stricken Transocean Winner oil platform</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In spring 2016, as Winner was nearing the end of an 11-month contract with Marathon to drill in the Norwegian sector of the North Sea, rumours of her possible scrapping spread around the crew. In the rig\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u0153smoko\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd rooms and coffee shops, they discussed the contradiction that underpinned their industry: while the price of oil might move up and down, shareholders in drilling companies tended to prefer numbers that moved in only one direction. It was difficult and expensive to maintain a cold-stacked rig. Winner had herself been cold-stacked once, and the crew\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s first task after reboarding was to snap away the icicles in their cabins. Meanwhile, there were immediate returns to be made by selling for scrap. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It would be better to have long-term plans and a buffer of funds to use during hard times,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Arctander thought. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153But this is not how it works.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd In July, Winner\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s scrapping was confirmed. A Norwegian crane operator posted a message on the rig\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Facebook page: <em>\u00e2\u20ac\u0153Malta og spiker next</em>.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Loosely translated, he meant: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Malta next, then a furnace \u00e2\u20ac\u201c somewhere.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--immersive\" data-media-id=\"51370940379b5a46c6f1f917b3f025e4da3a8f6c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/51370940379b5a46c6f1f917b3f025e4da3a8f6c/0_0_4500_2988/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Transocean Winner drilling rig off the coast of the Isle of Lewis after it ran aground in severe weather conditions.

On 3 August, Winner sent out a final blip from a fjord in southern Norway, near Stavanger, and then stopped sending a signal. The tugboat Forward then took her out into the North Sea. On 6 August, Winner entered the Atlantic, and the next day she was lost in the storm off the Hebrides. On 8 August, shortly before sunrise on the Isle of Lewis, the oil rig washed in with the tide.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <h2>Dalmore Bay</h2> <p>Her 17,000 tonnes came in on Dalmore Bay, one of the island\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s prettiest beaches, a quarter-mile crescent of bone-coloured sand and muscular swell that, on a normal Monday morning, could expect to be visited by dog-walkers, surfers, kayakers, seabirds, even dolphins. Back behind the sand, where the beach narrowed and formed an uneven track up to the coastal road, lay the gravestones of a hundred or so islanders. A fractional difference in the gusts and tides overnight, and the runaway Winner might have brought her great weight down on the resting place of one Malcolm MacCauley, whose grave was set closest to the water. As it was, the rig collided with the headland that defined Dalmore Bay\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s southern edge \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a slope of marram grass busy with snails that rose to a boggy cliff and then fell away to rocks on the foreshore. Winner\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pontoons scraped into the shallows and a strut of her crosswise steel snagged on a tall, tooth-shaped crag. The rig pitched to the south, away from the beach, her derrick cutting obliquely across the sky and her helipad inclining at an angle that to the human eye read as almost apologetic. However terrific a noise this made nobody was around to hear it, bar the seabirds and snails. The police started to arrive around 7am, as did the first stunned residents.</p> <p>Lewis is made of old, old rock. There is presumed to be Viking DNA coursing through the islanders, and it is a general trait of the community that its members be stoic and unhysterical, whatever difficulties \u00e2\u20ac\u201c generally weather-borne \u00e2\u20ac\u201c come this far north to trouble them. Perhaps there were some on Lewis that week who heard that an oil rig had struck and shrugged. But most who were mobile and even mildly curious put aside their habitual stoicism to make a trip to the beach and stare. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153On Lewis?\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Don MacKay, a fisherman. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This was seismic.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd</p> <p>When MacKay journeyed to Dalmore to see Winner, he was put in mind of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/apr/22/china-mieville-covehithe-short-story\">a steel spider, poised on the shore</a> as if plotting some sinister next move. Laura Carse, a surfer, felt it was like the time she returned home to find her house had been burgled. Not because Winner\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s presence struck her as violent, or a violation, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153but because my brain could not quite manage the image\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. This was as if a church or a rollercoaster had suddenly manifested on the sand. Don MacKay said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Yes. It took a wee bit of time to absorb the info.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd</p> <p>Winner\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s name was painted on her forward side, the black-on-yellow letters so large as to be crisply distinguishable from the shore \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a scale that would only start to make sense to onlookers when emergency salvage workers boarded the rig, and it could be seen that each letter was about three humans tall. The first salvage mission to Winner was made by coastguard helicopter. A team of six were lowered one by one by winch to the deck of the rig, and were removed again by helicopter that evening. By Winner\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s second day in Dalmore, the weather made any more such airborne trips impossible. For a week the rig simply stayed where she was, unoccupied, her weight against the rocks. When the salvors got back on board, they did so by boat, sailing close enough to hop on to a pontoon and scale one of the rig\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s legs using ropes. It was not easy to go back and forth from rig to shore this way, so the team sequestered cabins and stayed aboard. One of them reported that, because of Winner\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tilt, her bunks were uncomfortable to sleep in, at least until they removed the cabin doors and propped them horizontally beneath the mattresses.</p> <p>Tugboats and other support vessels now filled Dalmore Bay, waiting for the go-ahead to tow Winner off the rocks. Robotic diving units were sent underwater to collect images of the rig\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pontoons. Both were badly damaged, one with a narrow triangular hole that was at least 10 metres from end to end, the metal drawn and furled at the base so that it resembled a heaved-open theatre curtain. Early visitors to Dalmore had reported a smell of fuel coming over the sands. Nobody in this part of the country could forget what had happened in the Shetlands in the early 1990s when <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-north-east-orkney-shetland-20913560\">a tanker, Braer, foundered in a storm</a> off the islands\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 southern edge and disgorged many thousands of tonnes of crude oil into the water. There were fears of a similar spill from Winner, but the truth was that, although she was often referred to as an oil rig, Winner\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s real business was mud. During her decades at sea, Winner was generally a tunneller, commissioned to bore through layers of undersea rock and sludge, after which a purpose-built tanker would float in and slurp up any finds. It was estimated at the time of her grounding that Winner carried a few hundred tonnes of diesel fuel, kept in tanks in her pontoons. Some of this fuel had escaped through the tears in the pontoons. Salvors drained what remained into tanks on the surrounding support boats, and meanwhile concocted a plan to pump compressed air into the newly emptied pontoons. This would set Winner afloat again. She could then be towed off the headland on a high or rising tide, and dragged to a bay on the other side of Lewis, where it could be figured out how to make her properly seaworthy.</p> <p>What had begun as the quiet removal of Winner from Norway \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a journey scarcely noticed by anyone outside the oil business \u00e2\u20ac\u201c was now a richly public event. Nothing quite like it had happened in the Hebrides since the 1940s, when the cargo ship Politician, abundantly loaded with bottled spirits, ran aground on the nearby island of Eriskay. The local response on that occasion \u00e2\u20ac\u201c an outrageous carrying-away of the booze \u00e2\u20ac\u201c inspired a novel and a film, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2011/jul/28/whisky-galore-film-review\">Whisky Galore</a>. In the case of Winner, her plunder value existed in her bones \u00e2\u20ac\u201c her predominantly steel frame \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and it was residual value that would not be easily released; something to which Transocean could by now attest. It had in its fleet more rigs than any other drilling company \u00e2\u20ac\u201c more than 70 in 2016 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and the earlier pruning of about a dozen of these vessels had been conducted with discretion. Now the sun was up on a fiasco.</p> <p>Dave Walls was one of the Transocean directors who flew to Lewis from the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s headquarters in Aberdeen. At a press conference on the island 11 days after the accident, Walls pledged that Winner would be recovered from the rocks and put her back on her journey east. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We will make right any damage,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Walls said. Transocean later gave the Dalmore community \u00c2\u00a3120,000 in reparations. A financial statement released by the oil company in November 2016 made clear the larger cost of the accident: at least $21m (\u00c2\u00a316m). That month, on 21 November, Walls was asked at a parliamentary hearing about the circumstances leading up to Winner\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s nighttime escape. Why had the rig been pulled into a storm that was long forecast? Walls seemed to suggest that the master on the tugboat Forward had tried, in error, to outrun or outmuscle the Hebridean seas. (The Marine Accident Investigation Branch has been looking into the incident since the summer of 2016, and its report is expected later this year. In response to my request for comment, Transocean cited this ongoing investigation and declined to answer my questions about Winner. In a statement, Transocean added: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We will continue to meet our responsibilities arising out of this incident.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd)</p> <p>On Lewis, in the aftermath of the grounding, there were historically unprecedented traffic jams on the single-track road to the beach. Access was now forbidden, and a policeman guarded the junction. Arriving on the island, I made enquiries about getting aboard Winner and was told, roughly speaking, that I had about as much chance of getting on the whisky-carrying Politician, which had been on the bottom of the sea for 70 years. A restriction zone around Winner took in land, sea and air, so that hikers were forbidden to walk the fringing coastal paths and fishermen were told to putter their boats at a distance. On the evening of 22 August, allowances were made for a seismic local event, and islanders were permitted back to their beach to watch Winner be towed away. Around a hundred people came to watch, a shuttle bus running them down the beach road in shifts. A tea station was set up by volunteers. Midges hummed about. At 9pm the sun went down behind the rig, quite spectacularly, and after that the tow-lines between Winner and her tugs visibly tautened. The underwater pontoons were filled with compressed air. A shout went up on the shore: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153She\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s on the move!\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd There was a ripple of applause.</p> <p>As she came off the rocks, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153seemingly inch by inch\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, said Don MacKay, Winner continued to list very badly. She was towed north across the bay until hidden by a distant headland. There was another round of applause on the beach, then a polite rush for the first shuttle bus. MacKay was not sorry to see Winner go, he said, but like many of the islanders, he had become curious about the rig\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fate and intended to follow her progress. Authorities had said they expected Winner to arrive on the eastern side of Lewis the next day, a Tuesday. But when MacKay checked that day, she had not yet appeared. He checked again early on Wednesday. Still no sign. The runaway rig had once more disappeared from public view.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <h2>Gothenburg</h2> <p>That Winner floated at all when she came off the rocks was the consequence of an old tragedy, half-forgotten by the summer of 2016, but rawly felt at the time of this rig\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s invention. In 1980, a North Sea rig called Alexander Kielland had been struck by savage winds that weakened one of its legs and, with lethal suddenness, <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/march/27/newsid_2531000/2531091.stm\">caused it to list and capsize</a>. Of 212 crew, only 89 survived. North Sea rigs, it was ruled by British and Scandinavian authorities, must be fit to withstand such winds, and worse. That year, at the G\u00c3\u00b6taverken Arendal shipyard in Gothenburg, Sweden, an engineer called Hadar Liden sketched Winner\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shape on paper with these instructions in mind. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153If she lost a leg on the water,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd recalled Liden, who in the 1970s and 80s was G\u00c3\u00b6taverken\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chief of structural design, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153even then she should be able to float.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd At his drawing board, Liden conceived a rig that would remain buoyant in 100-knot winds, in 100-metre-high waves, even after being hit by, say, a fuel tanker. For improved stability, the new rig would be squatter, squarer and more symmetrical than the clumsily shaped, five-legged Kielland. Four-legged rigs had been built before, but were not then common. Inside G\u00c3\u00b6taverken, which had built rigs to order but never before designed its own, Liden\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s creation was nicknamed \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the Little Chair\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd.</p> <p>G\u00c3\u00b6taverken wanted $65m to build the rig for a client (about $180m today), and a first order was placed in 1981 by a maritime firm in Oslo. Liden watched through his ninth-floor window at G\u00c3\u00b6taverken headquarters, peering deep into the bed of the shipyard as a pair of 80m pontoons were constructed, each in a dry dock. Four circular stumps were built, each the size of pitched-over ferris wheels, added to in pie\u00e2\u20ac\u2018quarter portions, to make the rig\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s legs. In 1982, the half-made rig was set afloat, and a multi-layered box of steel was craned into place to form the deck. Jutting struts, front and back, were strung with lifeboats. A 49m derrick was erected. By now the rig reached higher than Liden\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ninth-floor window. By 1983 it was ready for delivery, and its owners in Oslo promptly chartered the rig for several years to Saga Petroleum, a Norwegian firm that assumed naming rights. In her early years, the rig was known as Treasure Saga. A picture of her, freshly orange and resplendent, made the cover of one industry magazine.</p> <p>Here was a rig, wrote the trade press, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153for the 90s\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Liden and his colleagues expected their creation would last longer than that. In fact, the rig outlasted both the shipyard in which she was built (G\u00c3\u00b6taverken closed in 1990) and the oil company she was first leased to (Saga was absorbed by a rival in 1999). Treasure Saga was bought by Transocean in 1998 and rechristened Transocean Winner. She was leased for months and years at a time on contracts to drill in North Sea oil fields, many of which had been given mythological names such as Asgard and Midgard, but which held in their depths somewhat more earthly riches. In 1969, a rig called Ocean Viking had been idly and unhopefully prospecting in this region, when a worker named Stale Salvensen, down on the drill floor enjoying a sly cigarette, smelled the distinctive, sour scent of unprocessed crude. By the time a superior was summoned from his cabin, there was so much oil sloshing around Viking\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s lower deck that Salvensen\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s boss slipped and fell in his pyjamas. And thus, ingloriously, a continent got its oil industry. The North Sea has been profitably drilled ever since, with exploration rights shared between its bordering countries, Norway, Denmark and the United Kingdom. Winner achieved some fame, in 2010, for striking the year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest find, a reservoir in the Norwegian sector that yielded many hundreds of millions of barrels.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/may/31/big-gamble-dangerous-british-betting-shops\">The big gamble: the dangerous world of British betting shops | Tom Lamont</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Hadar Liden had retired by then. He was living in Gothenburg when I called him at his home, in the autumn, not long after Winner\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s grounding. I asked the 88-year-old if he had thought about his rig at all, since seeing it off out of G\u00c3\u00b6taverken, and he said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Oh, always.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Liden could recall in detail the proportion of high-tension steel that made up Winner\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s overall weight (48%), and the mill in Sweden this steel had come from (Oxel\u00c3\u00b6sund, on the Baltic Sea). He found it harder to grasp just how much life had been lived aboard his Little Chair over three decades \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the birthday cakes and Christmases, the bingo games and barbecues. Every evening she spent on board in the 1980s and 90s, a geologist named Brit Riise Fredheim would take a walk around the rim of the upper deck, and afterwards climb the derrick, for the exercise and the view. Of watching North Sea sunsets from Winner\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pinnacle, Fredheim said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I felt like I owned the world.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The oil rig had a gym, and one year they brought on board a running machine. The crew got a slow satellite internet service. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We watched movies and farted and laughed together,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Andr\u00c3\u00a9 Arctander said. He had been the rig\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s unofficial counsellor, reassuring colleagues when the isolation of offshore life got overwhelming. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Many times,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Arctander, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153grown men came into my office and started to cry. My wife cannot believe this.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd</p> <p>Liden was unaware of Winner\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trials in Scotland: the storm, the grounding, and how, after lengthy relief work to tow the rig out of Dalmore Bay, Winner had seemed to vanish again, her reappearance after a 50-mile circumnavigation of Lewis dramatically delayed because of fears she would capsize. The rig eventually arrived in Broad Bay on the east of Lewis two days behind schedule, crewed by exhausted salvors who had hardly slept. While I told Liden about this, he listened patiently, with sympathy. Then the retired chief of structural design asked if I thought the rig had got into difficulties because of her <em>structure</em>. I said I thought not \u00e2\u20ac\u201c that, if anything, her essential strength had prevented a worse disaster. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Good,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Liden, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153good.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd</p> <h2>* * *</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--immersive\" data-media-id=\"ccebc6f07cb4a4c97ef04907a44dced71df9e6fb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ccebc6f07cb4a4c97ef04907a44dced71df9e6fb/0_51_2048_1229/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The oil rig Transocean Winner being loaded on to the semi-submersible heavy-lifting ship Hawk.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The oil rig Transocean Winner being loaded on to the semi-submersible heavy-lifting ship Hawk.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Heather Skull/Maritime and Coastguard Agency</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Broad Bay</h2> <p>The rig had been in Broad Bay for five weeks. Before dawn one morning in September, a salvage master called Sylvia Tervoort stood next to the boot of her car, putting on her work clothes in the dark. Half a mile over her shoulder, illuminated by onboard lights, Winner bobbed at anchor. Tervoort, a slight 38-year-old Dutchwoman from Castricum near Amsterdam, was quickly encased in bulky safety wear. Her padded orange coat was streaked all over with crusted oil. These streaks, she explained, were traceable back to some wild maritime calamity. There was the sunken rig she had helped raise in Alaska. The scuppered bulk carrier refloated in India. A pair of collided cargo ships (one carrying explosives) that had to be separated off Greece. For months in 2012 and 2013, Tervoort had hiked over the exposed hull of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/gallery/2016/jan/22/inside-costa-concordia-in-pictures\">Costa Concordia</a>, the Italian cruiseship that ran aground off the coast of Tuscany. Tervoort had for many years worked for the Dutch salvage firm SMIT, the only female salvage master at the company \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and perhaps, she thought, in the world. She had never encountered another woman in such a position, and she had been all over: to South America, to Africa, deep out in the Atlantic \u00e2\u20ac\u201c wherever a stricken vessel came to occupy the uncertain middle ground between serviceable craft and sea junk, she had been called to attend. Whether she was there to bring a craft back to life, or to siphon off its environment-threatening pollutants before a spill, or simply to strip a ship of its tangible riches before it sank, depended on the situation and the wants of her contractor in each case.</p> <p>Tervoort put on a helmet and moved towards a motorboat that would take her and her team out to Winner in the bay. For this job, SMIT had been contracted by Transocean to oversee the curious work of fixing up a maimed and ailing rig, in order that that it might resume its voyage to be destroyed absolutely. Tervoort was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153not interested in the politics\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u201c as with the grounded fuel carrier she had dragged off a beach in Morocco, and the flaming cargo ship her team had boarded at sea, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a job\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a job. If people are happy making the signature on my salary, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s OK.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd As a salvage master, she tended to think about troubled vessels in binary terms. If not \u00e2\u20ac\u0153assets\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd still afloat, then \u00e2\u20ac\u0153wrecks\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. She knew the transition from asset to wreck could be lethally quick, and a consequence of either impatience or overcaution by salvors.</p> <p>With Winner, Tervoot had prescribed caution rather than haste \u00e2\u20ac\u201c much to the frustration, I was told, of authorities, who would have preferred to see the rig leave Scotland as quickly as possible. Tervoort would not be hurried. She had once spent a month in the hold of a stranded bulk carrier off Cuba, without the means to wash, except when a rainstorm gathered, at which point she trotted up on to deck in her bikini. Her life as a salvor seemed to require that she be in possession of a crazy array of skills: seamanship, engineering, calculus, rope climbing, parkour, mild piracy, among others. More than anything, though, the work demanded composure and courage, plus a total lack of awe about outsized seacraft. Civilians crane their necks and coo at large ships. Tervoort saw only assets \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and moreover, assets that itched to become wrecks.</p> <p>It was in my capacity as a neck-craner that I had followed Winner to the Hebrides, getting as close to the rig as I could, which was never that close. Tervoort\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s team arrived in the car park, bussed in from the north of the island where they had been billeted at Transocean\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s expense in a holiday lodge. While they boarded the motorboat, I asked Tervoort if I could sail out with them. Get up close, see the rig. Tervoort replied, levelly, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153No.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd As the boat sped away, I could hear her tease her team about the cold. The sun had started to rise, turning Winner a striking crimson.</p> <p>On a hillside to the east of the bay, I met a pair of hikers who were admiring the rig and counting the support vessels that floated near her. The most impressive of these vessels, a heavy-lifting ship called Hawk, was one of the largest in her class \u00e2\u20ac\u201c really preposterously large, with an awesome rectangular deck that was something like the size of a Pall Mall or a Piccadilly to Winner\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Trafalgar Square. Hawk had been ordered to the Hebrides from Singapore. Most of the smaller boats around her were chartered from Lewis. James Morrison, one of the hikers, itemised the mini economic boom that had bobbed in to Lewis with the rig: day rates for sailors, hotels booked out, all those minicab minutes ferrying oil execs back and forth from the airport. As sun and drizzle conspired to form a rainbow over Broad Bay, Morrison pointed out that, for a moment, Winner seemed to float at the end of it.</p> <p>During the weeks of the rig\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stay on Lewis, there had been an unbargained-for turn in public opinion. Though initially seen as a poised steel spider, and a possible environmental threat, residents had by and large become fond of Winner. In pubs and on coastal paths, they discussed the progress of Tervoort\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s salvage with an easy familiarity, as they did weather or tides. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Every day you look at it,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Norman Macdonald, a taxi driver. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Wherever you drive round this part of the island, you look for the rig, to see how it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s doing.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd When I called to book a room at a B&amp;B, the proprietor asked if I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d like \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a room with a rig view\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. In a Lewis primary school, pupils made cardboard models of Winner, and Tervoort was invited to visit and judge them. If islanders had developed a coy affection for the oil rig, they had become openly adoring of the salvage master, and Tervoort rapidly advanced to local celebrity status. She was invited to take part in the island\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fun-run. She gave a hit lecture at a local university, about a salvor\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s life.</p> <p>It was Tervoort\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s opinion that Winner would never survive being towed any serious distance, certainly not to the Mediterranean as planned, and so efforts were directed to get the rig on to the back of the heavy-lifting ship, Hawk. In a complicated process that would involve Hawk sinking herself into the water, drifting beneath the rig and then rising again, Winner would have to be lifted up and carried out of Scotland. They call this dry-towing. It happened in early October, after several false starts. Conditions had to be just right for Hawk to submerge and re-emerge, and islanders had several times gathered at vantage points to wave the rig away, only for the departure to be called off because of bad weather.</p> <p>In the end, on 6 October, Winner left Lewis unobserved, stealing away in the dark, her departure as abrupt and even as dashing as her arrival. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I miss her,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Laura Carse, the Dalmore surfer.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <h2>Malta</h2> <p>Strapped to Hawk, Winner moved south. She passed the outstretched fingers of mainland Scotland and patiently negotiated the busy shipping lanes of the Irish Sea. On 9 October the crafts passed the mouth of the Channel and then picked up speed, ripping through the Bay of Biscay in the better part of a day.</p> <p>After a fortnight at sea, both vessels had passed by Spain and Portugal and were in horn-hailing distance of Africa. They sailed between Tangier and Gibraltar and into the Alboran Sea, then pressed on past Sardinia and into the Mediterranean. Standing tall on the deck of her carrier ship, Winner looked as cool and improbable as a heron crossing water on the back of a paddling hippo. Hawk and Winner made Maltese waters on 25 October, dropping anchor off the capital, Valletta. High in the water as she was, Winner was easily visible over the square, stone rooftops of this ancient city, and she drew many Maltese to the seafront. A sightseers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 boat, known as a <em>luzzu</em>, freighted with tourists, was piloted closer for a look.</p> <p>At anchor in Malta, repair work was carried out on the rig\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s damaged pontoons, while her owners exchanged export permissions with various authorities. Otherwise, Winner basked. It was bright and hot in the Mediterranean, and this old rig, once so profoundly chilled by North Sea winters that her steel would be painful to touch, at last warmed through. The Times of Malta sent a photographer to snap a northern celebrity come south to sunbathe. Carmel Pule, a retired professor of engineering, and also a keen sailor and ship-spotter, trained binoculars on Winner from the roof of his home. The 77-year-old had seen countless vessels come and go, Malta being a popular stopping point for shipping enterprise of every sort, and brisk handling of maritime paperwork a key part of the island economy. Pule could not recall seeing an oil rig come in piggy-back before. He got on his motorbike and rode to the coast. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Not beautiful to look at as individual craft,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he told his wife that evening, describing the trussed-together Winner and Hawk. But an appealing couple, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153together for the sake of convenience, or a temporary love affair\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd.</p> <p>Pule did it, I did it \u00e2\u20ac\u201c we do this, as humans, we humanise seacraft. Vessels are christened under bottles of fizz. They\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re given nicknames and ascribed character. Months after disembarking Winner for the last time, her crew could describe for me with precision, as if they were established personality traits, the rig\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s distinctive pitch and roll, the chatter of her anchor chains in wind, the subtle but thrilling smell of helicopter fuel that came through the ventilation system to let them know a batch of letters and newspapers had arrived.</p> <p>Meanwhile, in Malta, Pule kept a vigil on Winner from his roof, and sent me long emails in which he ruminated on the rig\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s visible old age, on her retirement, on an end to the obvious usefulness of things; he did not always register a distinction between the vessel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s state and his own. Seacraft engender affinity, and perhaps only those who are obliged to take a wider perspective can remain entirely unromantic about them. The master salvor Sylvia Tervoort, who tended to meet vessels when something had gone dreadfully wrong with them, considered my question about whether she felt any affection towards the craft she had worked on and said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Maybe if this was a movie.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd When I spoke with Patrizia Heidegger of Shipbreaking Platform, she stressed that her organisation was concerned with the humanitarian and environmental burden of shipbreaking. As such, she was politely unenthusiastic about too much sentiment being spent on the boats.</p> <p>On 24 October, a day before Winner\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s arrival in Malta, Transocean had put out a statement to investors, confirming her sale as scrap. The company added that the rig would now be dismantled; \u00e2\u20ac\u0153recycled\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd was their word. In describing a great, curling route out of Scandinavia, west and then south and then east (east, east) to the Med, Winner had passed 18 EU-approved facilities for shipbreaking, including those in Fosen in Norway, Grenaa in Denmark, Lowestoft in England, Bordeaux in France, Ghent in Belgium and Vinaroz in Spain. Unwanted sea junk does not often find its way to Europe, or stay long there. Had Winner been a fixed-drill platform, built into northern bedrock, exacting regulations and conventions would have insisted that this structure be dismantled and recycled in place. When an oil rig has an engine and a propeller, however \u00e2\u20ac\u201c when she is classed as a vessel; a mobile <em>she</em>, not a stationary <em>it</em> \u00e2\u20ac\u201c regulations can be outdistanced. Berths can be sought where conventions are not quite so stringent.</p> <p>And to sail a condemned vessel east from Europe is to adjust the financials of a demolition substantially. A secondhand vessel is currently worth about $190 per tonne to a shipbreaking yard in Turkey, a price established by the local market in reclaimed steel. Sail on to China and a different market, and the same metal is worth $210 per tonne. At breakers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 yards in Alang in India, Chittagong in Bangladesh and Gadani in Pakistan, they will pay around $280 per tonne. Meanwhile, at the EU-approved shipbreaking sites, which are bound to conform to continental waste laws, and where vessels are dismantled in closed-off quays or dry docks, rates are less competitive: European yards offer zero dollars per tonne, and, in fact, tend to ask a fee to take a shipowners\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 junk. Of the 864 vessels that were dismantled around the world last year, nine were dismantled in Europe. Give or take a dozen (sent to Mexico, the Philippines, Russia and South Korea), the remainder went to breaking yards in Turkey, China, India, Bangladesh and Pakistan.</p> <p>The NGO Shipbreaking Platform has for some years tracked the movements of surplus ships to these sites, finding it necessary, over time, to start documenting human as well as vessel expiry. They add to their records the blunt, dire summaries of a tragedy every time a shipbreaker is killed in an accident anywhere in the world. Chaudhry Baliram Indrajit, crushed by a crane in Alang in January 2016. Muhammad Asif, killed by fire in Gadani in March 2016. Shibbir Ahmed and Jalal Uddin, both of whom fell to their deaths in Chittagong in July 2016. There are dozens of such deaths every year, the majority of them in yards in India, Bangladesh and Pakistan, where men and boys pick apart vessels without appropriate tools or safety equipment, assuming terrific risks. As Winner underwent repairs in Malta, that October, the tally of acknowledged deaths in 2016 stood at 30, all in yards in south Asia.</p> <p>Of those 864 vessels sent for demolition that year, 668 went to yards in that region. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The incentive is to go to south Asia,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Patrizia Heidegger of Shipbreaking Platform, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153because the highest price paid per tonne is there.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Whether individual shipowners took up that incentive depended, in her view, on a moral-financial reckoning. How much they cared about profits, as against how much they cared. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The reason you have owners going to beaches in India, Pakistan and Bangladesh is money,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Petter Heier, head of Grieg Green, a subsidiary of the Norwegian maritime group Grieg established to promote and advise on responsible shipbreaking. Since 2010, Heier has sought to persuade divesting owners to send their excess to one of a group of vetted breaking yards in Turkey and China, rather than the higher-paying, less-audited yards in south Asia. Heier continued: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153There are major accidents in India, Pakistan and Bangladesh every week. No company wants to be associated with that. So they sell through middlemen. They change the name of their vessels. They try to hide their [radar] tracking.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd</p> <p>These evasions infuriate the watchdog groups in their efforts to hold a shadowy industry to account, but do not always scuttle them. For instance, Shipbreaking Platform had laboriously tracked through its final movements a German-owned cargo ship called HS Colon, which happened to arrive in Malta at the same time as Winner. While at anchor in the Mediterranean, HS Colon disappeared. When the NGO caught up with her, she had undergone a brisk identity change, shedding the initials that linked her to her former owners, Hansa Treuhand, and was heading for Alang under the name of Colo. That month, a tanker called Gaz Fountain was bought for scrap by a yard in Gadani. Before she sailed, Gaz Fountain became Rain. On 9 January this year, Rain caught fire during demolition on a Pakistani beach, killing five workers. A few weeks earlier, in November, another ship had exploded at Gadani, killing at least 27 workers.</p> <p>Still astride Hawk, Winner left Maltese waters on 27 October. She moved east towards Crete and wove between a scattering of Aegean islands. She was bound for Turkey, and a place on its west coast called Aliaga, where the Turkish shipbreaking industry is based.</p> <p>This was an expensive choice of destination by Transocean. Around $80 or $90 per tonne in value had been foregone, more than $1m in total, compared with what might have been wrangled for Winner from a yard in south Asia. Petter Heier at Grieg Green said he believed that \u00e2\u20ac\u201c slowly, gradually \u00e2\u20ac\u201c owners such as Transocean were coming to acknowledge the longer-term, intangible gains of careful disposal, even if this meant shorter-term, tangible loss. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Insurance companies are putting pressure on shipowners to recycle responsibly. Their employees are putting pressure. Society is putting pressure.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd In the case of Transocean, Heier offered an opinion (\u00e2\u20ac\u0153a personal opinion\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd) that the company was further influenced in its thinking by its involvement in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/bp-oil-spill\">Deepwater Horizon</a> catastrophe. When it exploded in the Gulf of Mexico in 2010, Deepwater Horizon was contracted, notoriously, to BP. But it was Transocean\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rig.</p> <p>\u00e2\u20ac\u0153I would guess Deepwater Horizon triggered something,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Heier said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153They are very careful [now], that if something happens with them on the beach in India, Bangladesh or Pakistan, that might ruin their name in the market.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd When I expressed surprise that Winner should have departed Malta still a Winner, without a change of identity in the manner of Colon or Gaz Fountain, Heier said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153They didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t change the name because they didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t need to hide anything. They chose a good yard.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd</p> <h2>* * *</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--immersive\" data-media-id=\"049e77b32446c776123adc5331e9ad74455193a1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/049e77b32446c776123adc5331e9ad74455193a1/0_12_1200_720/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Transocean Winner arrives in Aliaga, Turkey to be dismantled\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Transocean Winner oil rig arrives in Aliaga, Turkey to be dismantled.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Deniz Haber Ajansi</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Aliaga</h2> <p>They lit up the shore with flares on the day the rig came in at Aliaga. This was to acknowledge the end of a three-week journey that had ended up taking three months, and to show a pack of tugboats \u00e2\u20ac\u201c now that Winner was off the submerged Hawk and being pulled and pushed towards the beach \u00e2\u20ac\u201c just where to put her. The float-off took place at lunchtime on 5 November. Winner had a token crew again: representatives from Transocean and SMIT back aboard for the final tow. Guiding flares on the shore, at least from Winner\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s deck, appeared only as spots of fire among hundreds. Aliaga beach was aflame \u00e2\u20ac\u201c in the shallows, where carcasses of ships and rigs were disassembled by spark-showering blowtorches, and in the narrow yards beyond, where amputated pieces were further torched. Dense smoke filled the air above the yards.</p> <p>From the water, it must have appeared to the uninitiated that Aliaga had been freshly, plentifully bombed; perhaps doused and jumbled by tidal waves, too. In fact, this was a normal working day on the beach. At its western edge, a Del Monte fruit boat had been perfectly halved. To the east was a cargo carrier, Modern Express, that had some months earlier been abandoned by her crew while stricken and drifting in the Bay of Biscay. Nearby were two demobbed frigates, recently owned by the Spanish navy. Winner was put in next to the halved Del Monte boat, on a part of the beach owned by a local shipbreaking company called Isiksan.</p> <p>Isiksan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s foreman, a muscular 30-year-old Istanbulite named H\u00c3\u00bcsseyin Essen, sailed out to meet the rig. Essen had been the foreman here when Isiksan accepted its first oil rig for demolition, in early 2015. Ocean Concord had shown up 200 metres from the shore, and when Essen and his colleagues sailed out to meet her, they had no idea what to do next. Ever since they started shipbreaking in Aliaga in the 1970s, vessels had been brought ashore using a method known as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153beaching\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd; that is, they were piloted inland and made to mount the beach at speed. (<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYltdonj2iE&amp;feature=youtu.be\">Trembling phone footage from 2013</a> of a ferry being beached in an explosion of smoke and water has been viewed more than 3m times on YouTube.) With the sterns half-ashore, breakers could then cut in and dismantle the ships laterally, as a snacker might eat through a baguette. But oil rigs were not fast enough or strong enough for beaching. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know what the hell we were going to do,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Essen said. There was an idea to work on Concord at sea. In the end, heavy chains were tied around her legs and connected via winches to powerful vehicles on the shore. Concord was hauled through the shallows like a struggling fish. Through many oil rig landings since, this method had proved fine. Winner, towed and carried and storm-propelled on this fantastically harried trip east, would be dragged the last metres by straining bulldozers.</p> <p>Unlike the colossal breakers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 beaches of south Asia, or the disparate yards scattered around coastal China, Turkish shipbreaking is packed close in one place, concentrated entirely on this government-allotted mile of coast on the outskirts of Aliaga. The beach here has been divided into as many slim, neighbouring yards as will fit \u00e2\u20ac\u201c 25 of them. Considering its comparative scale, Aliaga should be a minor consumer of the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s excess sea-tonnage. But since Ocean Concord arrived 18 months ago, it has established itself, improbably, as the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s foremost consumer of oil rigs. Something like 300,000 tonnes of unwanted rig had been brought here \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Hunter and Yatzy and JW McLean and John Shaw and Southern Cross and Aleutian Key and Amirante and Scarabeo 4 and Arctic I and Arctic III \u00e2\u20ac\u201c as well as that pair of young Enscos, the two rigs that were barely a decade old when they were sent by their owners for disposal. The Isiksan yard, its opening on to the Aegean no wider than an average-sized rig, had undertaken most of the demolitions. Petter Heier of Grieg Green, which advised Transocean on these latter stages of the disposal, said Isiksan had been chosen because of this expertise.</p> <p>It was expertise hard-won. Essen and his colleagues learned over the months that the best way to scrap a rig was to deposit a group of blowtorchers on the upper deck (carrying them there in a crane-hoisted cage) and then to let them burn their way downwards. The process took months, but because more men could get at more vessel on a rig than on a beached ship, and because rigs tended to have cranes that could be co-opted into the effort of self-destruction, Essen\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s scrappers were getting faster and faster at their work. With Winner, they targeted the helipad first, weakening it with blowtorches before a crane came in to pick it clean away. Winner\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s galley went next, then half her accommodation block. A fortnight into the demolition, the horizontal decks were still in place, but the walls between had been so gnawed at that Winner looked liked one of the cut-away diagrams sketched by Hader Liden at his drawing board decades earlier.</p> <p>The rig\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sale to Isiksan was formalised and finalised the moment she came off the back of Hawk. In the words of Isiksan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s young chief, a 26-year-old Aliagan named Soner Sari, Winner was a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153cooked meal\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, in that she had been brought to the yard whole and the workers there only had to digest her. They did this by cutting 50-tonne pieces off her, lifting these pieces into the yard, where the steel could be separated from everything else, then trucking off this valuable metal in one-metre-squared pieces that would be sold to a foundry nearby. Not all vessels in Aliaga were \u00e2\u20ac\u0153cooked meals\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Other deals struck by Sari specified that Isiksan must fetch unwanted craft from wherever they had outlasted their use. These agreements, known in the industry as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153cash-buyer\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd deals, could be profitable \u00e2\u20ac\u201c but they were also risky. Early in 2016, an old ship called Bannock had been cash-bought by Sari from her owners in Italy. Sailed into the Matapan Sea, bound for Aliaga, Bannock had quickly listed and capsized, ceasing to exist in the old-fashioned way, by sinking to the bottom. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153That was a shitty feeling,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Sari said.</p> <p>We were sitting in his office on the yard, watching the slow destruction of Winner through a picture window. Boyish, dark, smartly dressed, Sari sometimes threw out his hands when he spoke, showing a bracelet on each wrist, one of them decorated with pictures of turtles. He had a Range Rover parked outside, in which we had driven together from central Aliaga, passing various chemical factories, oil refineries and foundries. Closer to the breakers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 beach, an informal flea market of maritime bric-a-brac had been established, where traders sold recovered items from the dismantled ships. Sari continued: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153When we buy in a faraway port it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s cheaper, because we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re taking certain risks, and if it works out, we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll we make money for taking those risks.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd On his phone he had photographs of Bannock sinking. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153At that point, your company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s $20m \u00e2\u20ac\u201c or whatever you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve paid \u00e2\u20ac\u201c is gone. Poof. It hurts.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd</p> <p>Sari did not want to say exactly how much Isiksan had paid Transocean for the right to scrap Winner. Estimating based on local market rates, it could have been as much as $3.5m, though Sari only allowed that it was a seven-figure sum, and that Isiksan expected to turn a profit on the recovered steel. Parts other than a rig\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s steel could also be valuable to a breaking firm \u00e2\u20ac\u201c for instance, any deck cranes that were in resellable condition. The lifeboats that came stitched to vessels could also be sold on to the bric-a-brac guys beyond the yard. Hundreds waited to be sold there, bordering the road like giant orange crash barriers.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/oct/13/the-death-and-life-of-a-great-british-pub\">The death and life of the great British pub | Tom Lamont</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Through Sari\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s office window, we looked at a newly removed piece of Winner\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s accommodation block, which had just been brought up into the yard. It might once have been a section of corridor, and electric cabling and insulation foam still clung to its steel walls. A hydraulic excavator started tossing and rolling it in the dirt \u00e2\u20ac\u201c cartwheeling it over and over to shake away the wire and the foam. By the end of the day, Sari judged, that steel would be on a foundry floor. About $3,000 worth, he said, pricing it by eye.</p> <p>While we drank strong, tarry coffee, we discussed the environmental consequences of shipbreaking. It was no coincidence, Sari said, that Aliaga\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s yards were huddled up beside refineries and foundries. Heavy industry had been moved to Aliaga en masse in the 1970s, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153because the government wanted to wrap it up in one area, keep everything <em>else</em> nice\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Sari acknowledged that the local yards had not always upheld the strictest standards when it came to minimising environmental damage, but he was working to change that. Beneath the Isiskan yard he had installed a drainage system to catch and pump off pollutants. Down in the water there were brightly coloured booms, bobbing in a circle around Winner\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s legs, there in theory to stop any floating waste from getting out into the Aegean. A confidential 2015 report by the shipping consultancy Litehauz, obtained by journalists from the <a href=\"https://www.danwatch.dk/en/undersogelse/maersk-and-the-hazardous-waste/\">investigative agency Danwatch</a> last year, detailed the potential impact of ships that were torch-cut on tidal water. The report estimated that for every 10,000 tonnes of vessel torched, about 120 tonnes of molten steel and two tonnes of chipped-away paint escaped into the sea. Sari insisted that the water off Isiksan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s yard was regularly tested for pollutants. When I asked if he would swim out there, he thought for a moment and answered: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Why not?\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Petter Heier of Grieg Green said his company had audited the Isiksan yard and found its environmental procedures acceptable. Look, Sari said, it might be distasteful, but somebody had to get rid of shipowners\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 garbage. He gestured at the yard through the window. In his view, it was better that it happened out there than on the deadly beaches of Alang or Chittagong. He had applied for European recognition for the Isiksan yard, hoping to see it added to a list of EU-approved shipbreaking sites.</p> <h2>* * *</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--immersive\" data-media-id=\"cbd05d56a2048f52e50a3fd74555f34ccd37377a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cbd05d56a2048f52e50a3fd74555f34ccd37377a/0_0_3500_2330/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ship-breaking yards in the Turkish port city of Aliaga.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"666\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ship-breaking yards in the Turkish port city of Aliaga.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Osman Orsal/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>The shipbreaking yard</h2> <p>We took a walk together through the yard, where the immediate noise was at first so much to contend with \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the guttural, football-crowd \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Ooooh!\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd of ignited blowtorches, the grating complaint of metal on metal, bulldozer rumbles, generator whines \u00e2\u20ac\u201c that I put off the matter of sights until a second lap. In the reddish-brown dust, fine as powder in places, a combination of soil and dirt and tiny coloured chips of paint, I found a Norwegian chocolate bar called a Stratos, still in its packaging. Nearby was a plastic shoehorn, apparently flung from the cartwheeling corridor, and a takeaway menu from a Chinese restaurant in Lewis. The discoveries increased in size \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a gas mask, a boot, a barrel on fire, a pile of fire extinguishers, a larger mountain of green and white foam \u00e2\u20ac\u201c until we were standing beside great, upright sections of mud pipe, tall enough for a person to walk through, cut into giant, swiss-roll slices and now being lifted into the bed of a truck.</p> <p>Early in Winner\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s demolition, a big, square piece of her decking, like the mat of a boxing ring, had been retained because it was flat and smooth and would skim briskly through the dusty yard when dragged behind a bulldozer. It now served as a carrying palette for the rig\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s disparate amputations, and brought sliding up from the shore an entire utility closet, placed upside down. An equipment rack on the closet\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s outer wall was slung with vices, chains and thick bolts the size of milk bottles. A sign above the inverted door warned that it might close violently at sea. When I tried to step inside, Sari said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Uh, don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t go in there yet.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd He indicated that parts of the room were so freshly torched that they were still smouldering.</p> <p>Airhorns sounded: lunch. I walked among yellow-helmeted breakers \u00e2\u20ac\u201c about 70 of them were rostered to work today \u00e2\u20ac\u201c as they streamed off Winner. The men I met lived locally. They said they earned wages of about $1,300 a month. According to investigations by Asli Odman, a member of Labour Watch Turkey, there had been at least 10 fatal accidents in the various yards of Aliaga since 2010. On the oil-refining ship Kuito, being dismantled at a neighbouring yard in 2015, a worker fell into the hold and died. On the cruise ship Pacific, dismantled by Izmir Ship Recycling Co in 2013, two workers were poisoned by carbon monoxide. I asked a 31-year-old Isiksan employee named Zafer Erdem, who operated a crane, whether he felt any fear whenever the next new rig arrived for demolition. No, said Erdem, when a rig came in he thought: work, two or three months of it. Erdem and his colleague Kamil Conge, a 45-year-old field manager, had a combined 30 years of experience on the beach. An inch beneath the dirt, Conge said, there was a layer of concrete that extended most of the way to the shore \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a recent addition, before which the yard became a muddy horror whenever it rained. In those days, Conge said, a ship \u00e2\u20ac\u0153could take a year to dismantle\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. I was told there had been injuries to workers in the Isiksan yard; accidental scorchings was the example given. Everyone remembered the recent death on Kuito, along the beach. Work stopped for a day in a show of respect.</p> <p>Not far from the mess hall, in the mud, I came across something colourful \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a Norwegian consumer magazine, six years out of date and splayed open at an article about red wines. A 26-year-old yard worker called Omer Dogan, about to skip lunch and go to prayers at a nearby mosque, said they had sometimes found \u00e2\u20ac\u0153funnier stuff\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd on incoming oil rigs. Omer reddened, not wanting to say pornography. H\u00c3\u00bcsseyin Essen told me he had many times come across collections of family photographs. Sari was once inspecting a brought-in trawler when he found a full outfit of ski gear in a cupboard. The Spanish frigates had come to Aliaga, he said, stripped of computers, but still with several missile launchers intact. Sari liked it best when they found a certain type of brass valve on ships. Isiksan owned a small foundry that processed non-ferrous metals, mostly salvaged bronze, which would be melted down and fashioned into storm valves, for resale to the shipbuilding industry. Sometimes, Isiksan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s valves found their way back to Isiksan, got removed and were melted down again. I mentioned to Sari that I had met a man on the Isle of Lewis, an eccentric local professor called Arne V\u00c3\u00b6gler, who had led a volunteer mission to scour the waters of Dalmore Bay after Winner had gone. V\u00c3\u00b6gler, searching for debris that might harm the environment, had ended up fishing out Winner\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s enormous propeller. He joked to me about installing it as garden furniture. Hearing this, Sari raised an eyebrow. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I wondered where that propeller had gone,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said, and sniffed. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Brass alloy. Tell the guy he owes me $50,000.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd</p> <p>At the water\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s edge, the big steel carrying palette waited in the dirt. Sari stood on one of its upturned corners, hands in his pockets, bouncing on the flexible metal. The Aegean lapped at Winner\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ruptured pontoons. From here I could see the intricate patterning of rust up the oil rig\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s legs \u00e2\u20ac\u201c grades of peach, grey, green, black and bleach-white stains, recording, as if they were a sailor\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tattoos, Winner\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s many tours in the North Sea. I knew from studying Hadar Liden\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sketches that the thick legs were actually hollow, with ladders inside them to provide a route between the decks and the pontoons in case of emergency. In Aliaga, a doorway had been torched in one of these forward legs, and square windows cut at intervals up to the deck, so that when his workers climbed, Sari said, they didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have to do so in the dark.</p> <p>I suggested that I try climbing up the inside of Winner myself. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153No,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Sari. By this point I was accustomed to being refused requests to get aboard the rig. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153No,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he continued, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve tried going up by the ladder and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s like scaling a 10-storey building. Better take the cage.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd</p> <p>He signalled to an operator in a nearby crane, who answered by rotating and depositing on the shore a carry-cage about the size of a couple of telephone boxes, painted blood-red. I stepped inside and held on to the cage\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s central pole, like a commuter on a bus, as it was hoisted fast into the air, spinning through several terrible rotations before settling into a queasy, side-to-side sway. Before landing the cage on the rig, the crane swung me high and wide above the beach, so that for the first time I could see the full, fiery chaos of Aliaga. The fruit boats and frigates and oil rigs were not going quietly, but inchingly, they <em>were</em> going; and soon their berths on the shore would be filled by the next redundant or repented-of thing.</p> <p>Back in his office, I had asked Sari what would happen when the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fleet had been adequately thinned, when there were no more superfluous rigs for him to buy and dismantle. He said he expected this to happen soon. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Next year? The year after?\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd As rigs disappeared, rates to hire the remaining ones would rise and, eventually, an incautious oil industry would find an economic (if not glowingly ethical) equilibrium. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153And we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll go looking for the next thing.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Sari had in mind a smaller type of oil platform known as a jack-up, of which there were many hundreds filling the seas. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Cold-stacked all over, no jobs, no <em>prospects</em> of jobs \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd</p> <p>I asked him if it ever seemed a pity to break up such monumental and characterful structures. Did he look at Winner in the way that I had come to look at her, in the way her former crew looked at her, as something dignified? Sari said the only emotion he could feel about Winner was relief, when she was gone, on schedule. But not long ago, he acknowledged, he had had a wobble. It was over those two young Ensco rigs \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Ensco 6003 and 6004 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c that had come out of Brazilian waters. When Sari won the right to scrap them, he took the unusual decision to sail the rigs under their own power from South America to Turkey. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I piloted one myself, for the last mile to Aliaga. I wanted to try it out.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Sari mimed adjusting thrusters, striking buttons. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Everything was like new, all the controls.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd They demolished Ensco 6003 and 6004 over the course of about 10 weeks. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Beautiful machines. Beautiful machines,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Sari said.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <h2>On the Transocean Winner</h2> <p>The cage was lowered on to Winner\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s deck, where it smelled of propane and singed steel, of grease and hydraulic fuel. Disorientatingly, here, the rig\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s insides were outside, so that a payphone that had once stood in the accommodation block was now upright and exposed in the open air. Two ping-pong balls, mysterious survivors of the long voyage, juddered on the payphone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s coin shelf. Nearby, blowtorchers cut their way out from inside a cabin, and above them a deputation of breakers directed liquid from a hose into a vat marked \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Chemical Spill\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Thinking of the geologist Brit Fredheim, and her evening constitutionals around the rig, I set off to walk Winner\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s circumference.</p> <p>All along the perimeter fence were signs that ordered \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Respect this barrier\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, signs that continued until the barrier fell away completely, mangled, torn and disrespected by the storm back in the Hebrides. I moved towards the interior, passing pools of standing water on the corrugated floor, and crater-bursts of rust where it was dry. Someone had left a dozen eggs on the floor by a ladder. There were stacks of dusty computer towers in a cupboard, and orange lifejackets that filled two bath-sized tubs to the brim. In a windowless office, where there were two leather-effect chairs and a tacked-up poster of a motorbike, I found a whiteboard on which somebody had written \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Crew 6 says goodbye\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Below, on a shelf, there was a leather-bound logbook, neatly filled with the signatures of men and women who had seen through a particular watch on Winner. There were pages and pages of names, going back to the early 1990s. I considered stealing the book, or adding my own signature. In the end, I put it back on the shelf, to be destroyed with the rest. Outside, I passed Zafer Erdem in his crane, merrily terrorising a piece of racking at the base of the derrick. We waved.</p> <p>By the end of November, Winner had been stripped of everything above the midriff, bar her derrick. This was pulled down on 3 December, then chained to bulldozers, which laboured until the tower toppled forward; instead of landing on an outstretched jetty that was meant to catch the pieces, it twisted and crashed pinnacle-first into the shallows. Once the pieces had been fished out, work resumed to reduce the rig\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s legs. By mid-December, Winner amounted to little more than a pair of pontoons under blackened stumps, the dwindling structure kept stable by thin strips of horizontal decking, so that it resembled a pair of ice skates strung together by the laces. By Christmas Day, only the pontoons were left. These were dragged out of the water and into the dirt so that another unwanted rig, Transocean Driller, could be parked on the slipway behind. Winner\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s port-side pontoon was sliced up and trucked away in the first days of January. Very likely, by this point, there were swirls of the rig\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s old steel in the refashioned blocks and beams that were leaving the local foundries, to be sold on for use in construction projects around the Turkish interior.</p> <p>On 5 January, something curious happened on Aliaga beach. Winner\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s final piece, her starboard pontoon, was half gone. Snow began to fall, rare in this part of Turkey, carrying on for four days and keeping the breakers from their work. A reprieve \u00e2\u20ac\u201c days in which Winner was left out and unmolested, in weather she knew well. By the following week, the snow had gone and the cutting resumed. The last of the pontoon was lifted on to a truck on 13 January, and smelted that afternoon.</p> <p><em>Photographs by Andrew Milligan/PA; Heather Skull; Deniz Haber Ajansi; Osman Orsal/Reuters</em></p> <p>\u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Follow the Long Read on Twitter at <a href=\"https://twitter.com/@gdnlongread\">@gdnlongread</a>, or sign up to the long read weekly email <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2015/jul/20/sign-up-to-the-long-read-email\">here</a>.</p> <p>\u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 This article was amended on 3 May 2017.

                "bodyText":"It was night, stormy, and the oil rig Transocean Winner was somewhere in the North Atlantic on 7 August 2016 when her tow-line broke. No crew members were on board. The rig was being dragged by a tugboat called Forward, the tethered vessels charting a course out of Norway that was meant to take them on a month-long journey to Malta. Within the offices of Transocean Ltd, the oil-exploration company that owned the rig, such a journey might have been described with corporate seemliness as an \u00e2\u20ac\u0153end-of-life voyage\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd; but in the saltier language heard offshore, the rig was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153going for fucking razorblades\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u201c for scrap, to be dismantled in a shipbreaking yard east of Malta. In that Atlantic storm, several thousand miles from her intended destination, Winner floated free. The 33-year-old rig had never moved with so little constraint. Winner was huge \u00e2\u20ac\u201c 17,000 tonnes, like an elevated Trafalgar Square, complete with a middle derrick as tall as Nelson\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Column, her four legs the shape of castle keeps; all this was borne up in the water on a pair of barge-sized pontoons \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and its positioning had always been precisely controlled. While moored, she was held in place by eight heavy anchors. At other times, she was sailed with a pilot at the helm as if she were any other ship. When contracted to drill in the North Sea, as she had been since the 1980s, boring into the bedrock for hidden reservoirs of oil, Winner\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s anchors and underwater propellers worked together with her on-board computers to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153dynamically position\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd her \u00e2\u20ac\u201c that is, keep her very still. The men and women who formed Winner\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s crew \u00e2\u20ac\u201c drillers and engineers and geologists and divers and cleaners and cooks, most of them Norwegian \u00e2\u20ac\u201c imagined this rig to have a character that would resist such checks. They nicknamed her Svanen, or Swan, because to them she was both elegant and unyielding. Scheduled as she was for destruction, Winner could not have chosen a better moment to bolt. The master on the tugboat Forward radioed for help. Through a series of exchanges with Transocean, as well as with the British coastguard and Forward\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s owners, the Rotterdam-based ALP Maritime, the master explained his situation. Both tugboat and rig had been caught in heavy weather while circumnavigating the Hebrides, sailing a mile and a half off the Scottish islands. It turned into the worst summer storm in the region for years, with winds of 40 knots and waves 10 metres high. Throughout the afternoon of 7 August, Forward and Winner were tossed on a course running parallel with the coast of Lewis, one of the outermost Hebridean islands. For a time it seemed they would be sent on by, still fettered to each other, still Mediterranean-bound. But in the early evening the wind changed direction, and Forward and Winner \u00e2\u20ac\u201c or more accurately, Winner and Forward, given that the rig was now acting as a huge metal sail and comfortably tugging her own tugboat \u00e2\u20ac\u201c were forced landward. It was around 4am when the master radioed to confirm that the tow-line had snapped. Winner had, for all of her life, been painted bright orange. The colour had become chipped and rust-stained over time, but was still vivid in daylight, visible for miles. In the storm, the rig disappeared completely. Radar data from those early-morning hours showed Forward moving back and forth in the water off Lewis, as if retracing steps for something misplaced. It was agreed between Transocean, ALP, the coastguard and other emergency authorities that Winner was irretrievable. Everybody would wait until sunrise, and see. * * * Stavanger The world has a problem with its oil rigs. There are too many of them, and for the first time since the earliest manufacture of seaborne drilling platforms 50 or 60 years ago, decisions are being made about how and where to get rid of them in number. That there should be a sudden surplus is vexing for those invested in undersea drilling: as recently as 2010 the rigs were thought too few. Back then, had an oil company such as Shell or BP or Marathon wanted to dig down and discover what was lying beneath a particular patch of sea, it wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t unusual for them to wait as long as a year until an exploration company such as Transocean or Diamond or Ensco had a rig available to lease to them. It was a time of undersupply. Dozens of new rigs were commissioned, and worldwide orders tripled between 2010 and 2011. But oil rigs take two or three years to build, and by the time these were ready for use, the price of oil had declined sharply, and with it the industry\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hunger to prospect \u00e2\u20ac\u201c thus the oversupply. Rigs without contracts to drill were either \u00e2\u20ac\u0153cold-stacked\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd (anchored without crew) to wait for a market recovery, or sold for demolition. More than 40 oil rigs were waved off on end-of-life voyages in 2015, according to data gathered by a Brussels-based maritime NGO called Shipbreaking Platform; up from a single dispensed-with rig, so far as the NGO knew, in 2014. It was a hasty and disordered rebalancing of the global fleet, and not all the decisions made were sensible. In the spring of 2016, for instance, at about the time Transocean was considering whether or not to decommission Winner, its drilling rival Ensco sent away two rigs that were relatively new: built in 2004, and meant to bear 30 or 40 years of graft, but hurriedly euthanised after 12. Winner, by comparison, had lived long and busily. She was launched in 1983, and in the decades since had bobbed through market downturns and upturns, through winter hurricanes and underwater blowouts, and at least two on-board deaths. For the most part, Winner\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 33 years at sea had been characterised by day after day of patient, repetitive work \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the stuff that gives offshore life its rhythm and, for many, its special comfort. Drill supervisor Andr\u00c3\u00a9 Arctander, a tanned greybeard from Stavanger in Norway, calculated that he had spent a third of his life on this rig. The colour of his boilersuit had changed, Arctander said, in accordance with the branding requirements of drilling clients, but he retained throughout a deeper loyalty to Winner and her regular crew \u00e2\u20ac\u0153that went beyond corporate logos\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. He spoke of getting so in tune with the rig during his fortnight-long stints on board that he could fall asleep in his cabin and wake up knowing half of what had happened while he was under, just from having felt the changes in Winner\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s vibrations and having heard her machine-purrs. In spring 2016, as Winner was nearing the end of an 11-month contract with Marathon to drill in the Norwegian sector of the North Sea, rumours of her possible scrapping spread around the crew. In the rig\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u0153smoko\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd rooms and coffee shops, they discussed the contradiction that underpinned their industry: while the price of oil might move up and down, shareholders in drilling companies tended to prefer numbers that moved in only one direction. It was difficult and expensive to maintain a cold-stacked rig. Winner had herself been cold-stacked once, and the crew\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s first task after reboarding was to snap away the icicles in their cabins. Meanwhile, there were immediate returns to be made by selling for scrap. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It would be better to have long-term plans and a buffer of funds to use during hard times,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Arctander thought. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153But this is not how it works.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd In July, Winner\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s scrapping was confirmed. A Norwegian crane operator posted a message on the rig\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Facebook page: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Malta og spiker next.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Loosely translated, he meant: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Malta next, then a furnace \u00e2\u20ac\u201c somewhere.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd It is common for rigs on end-of-life voyages to be towed with their tracking systems switched off. On 3 August, Winner sent out a final blip from a fjord in southern Norway, near Stavanger, and then stopped sending a signal. The tugboat Forward then took her out into the North Sea. On 6 August, Winner entered the Atlantic, and the next day she was lost in the storm off the Hebrides. On 8 August, shortly before sunrise on the Isle of Lewis, the oil rig washed in with the tide. * * * Dalmore Bay Her 17,000 tonnes came in on Dalmore Bay, one of the island\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s prettiest beaches, a quarter-mile crescent of bone-coloured sand and muscular swell that, on a normal Monday morning, could expect to be visited by dog-walkers, surfers, kayakers, seabirds, even dolphins. Back behind the sand, where the beach narrowed and formed an uneven track up to the coastal road, lay the gravestones of a hundred or so islanders. A fractional difference in the gusts and tides overnight, and the runaway Winner might have brought her great weight down on the resting place of one Malcolm MacCauley, whose grave was set closest to the water. As it was, the rig collided with the headland that defined Dalmore Bay\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s southern edge \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a slope of marram grass busy with snails that rose to a boggy cliff and then fell away to rocks on the foreshore. Winner\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pontoons scraped into the shallows and a strut of her crosswise steel snagged on a tall, tooth-shaped crag. The rig pitched to the south, away from the beach, her derrick cutting obliquely across the sky and her helipad inclining at an angle that to the human eye read as almost apologetic. However terrific a noise this made nobody was around to hear it, bar the seabirds and snails. The police started to arrive around 7am, as did the first stunned residents. Lewis is made of old, old rock. There is presumed to be Viking DNA coursing through the islanders, and it is a general trait of the community that its members be stoic and unhysterical, whatever difficulties \u00e2\u20ac\u201c generally weather-borne \u00e2\u20ac\u201c come this far north to trouble them. Perhaps there were some on Lewis that week who heard that an oil rig had struck and shrugged. But most who were mobile and even mildly curious put aside their habitual stoicism to make a trip to the beach and stare. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153On Lewis?\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Don MacKay, a fisherman. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This was seismic.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd When MacKay journeyed to Dalmore to see Winner, he was put in mind of a steel spider, poised on the shore as if plotting some sinister next move. Laura Carse, a surfer, felt it was like the time she returned home to find her house had been burgled. Not because Winner\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s presence struck her as violent, or a violation, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153but because my brain could not quite manage the image\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. This was as if a church or a rollercoaster had suddenly manifested on the sand. Don MacKay said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Yes. It took a wee bit of time to absorb the info.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Winner\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s name was painted on her forward side, the black-on-yellow letters so large as to be crisply distinguishable from the shore \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a scale that would only start to make sense to onlookers when emergency salvage workers boarded the rig, and it could be seen that each letter was about three humans tall. The first salvage mission to Winner was made by coastguard helicopter. A team of six were lowered one by one by winch to the deck of the rig, and were removed again by helicopter that evening. By Winner\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s second day in Dalmore, the weather made any more such airborne trips impossible. For a week the rig simply stayed where she was, unoccupied, her weight against the rocks. When the salvors got back on board, they did so by boat, sailing close enough to hop on to a pontoon and scale one of the rig\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s legs using ropes. It was not easy to go back and forth from rig to shore this way, so the team sequestered cabins and stayed aboard. One of them reported that, because of Winner\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tilt, her bunks were uncomfortable to sleep in, at least until they removed the cabin doors and propped them horizontally beneath the mattresses. Tugboats and other support vessels now filled Dalmore Bay, waiting for the go-ahead to tow Winner off the rocks. Robotic diving units were sent underwater to collect images of the rig\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pontoons. Both were badly damaged, one with a narrow triangular hole that was at least 10 metres from end to end, the metal drawn and furled at the base so that it resembled a heaved-open theatre curtain. Early visitors to Dalmore had reported a smell of fuel coming over the sands. Nobody in this part of the country could forget what had happened in the Shetlands in the early 1990s when a tanker, Braer, foundered in a storm off the islands\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 southern edge and disgorged many thousands of tonnes of crude oil into the water. There were fears of a similar spill from Winner, but the truth was that, although she was often referred to as an oil rig, Winner\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s real business was mud. During her decades at sea, Winner was generally a tunneller, commissioned to bore through layers of undersea rock and sludge, after which a purpose-built tanker would float in and slurp up any finds. It was estimated at the time of her grounding that Winner carried a few hundred tonnes of diesel fuel, kept in tanks in her pontoons. Some of this fuel had escaped through the tears in the pontoons. Salvors drained what remained into tanks on the surrounding support boats, and meanwhile concocted a plan to pump compressed air into the newly emptied pontoons. This would set Winner afloat again. She could then be towed off the headland on a high or rising tide, and dragged to a bay on the other side of Lewis, where it could be figured out how to make her properly seaworthy. What had begun as the quiet removal of Winner from Norway \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a journey scarcely noticed by anyone outside the oil business \u00e2\u20ac\u201c was now a richly public event. Nothing quite like it had happened in the Hebrides since the 1940s, when the cargo ship Politician, abundantly loaded with bottled spirits, ran aground on the nearby island of Eriskay. The local response on that occasion \u00e2\u20ac\u201c an outrageous carrying-away of the booze \u00e2\u20ac\u201c inspired a novel and a film, Whisky Galore. In the case of Winner, her plunder value existed in her bones \u00e2\u20ac\u201c her predominantly steel frame \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and it was residual value that would not be easily released; something to which Transocean could by now attest. It had in its fleet more rigs than any other drilling company \u00e2\u20ac\u201c more than 70 in 2016 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and the earlier pruning of about a dozen of these vessels had been conducted with discretion. Now the sun was up on a fiasco. Dave Walls was one of the Transocean directors who flew to Lewis from the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s headquarters in Aberdeen. At a press conference on the island 11 days after the accident, Walls pledged that Winner would be recovered from the rocks and put her back on her journey east. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We will make right any damage,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Walls said. Transocean later gave the Dalmore community \u00c2\u00a3120,000 in reparations. A financial statement released by the oil company in November 2016 made clear the larger cost of the accident: at least $21m (\u00c2\u00a316m). That month, on 21 November, Walls was asked at a parliamentary hearing about the circumstances leading up to Winner\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s nighttime escape. Why had the rig been pulled into a storm that was long forecast? Walls seemed to suggest that the master on the tugboat Forward had tried, in error, to outrun or outmuscle the Hebridean seas. (The Marine Accident Investigation Branch has been looking into the incident since the summer of 2016, and its report is expected later this year. In response to my request for comment, Transocean cited this ongoing investigation and declined to answer my questions about Winner. In a statement, Transocean added: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We will continue to meet our responsibilities arising out of this incident.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd) On Lewis, in the aftermath of the grounding, there were historically unprecedented traffic jams on the single-track road to the beach. Access was now forbidden, and a policeman guarded the junction. Arriving on the island, I made enquiries about getting aboard Winner and was told, roughly speaking, that I had about as much chance of getting on the whisky-carrying Politician, which had been on the bottom of the sea for 70 years. A restriction zone around Winner took in land, sea and air, so that hikers were forbidden to walk the fringing coastal paths and fishermen were told to putter their boats at a distance. On the evening of 22 August, allowances were made for a seismic local event, and islanders were permitted back to their beach to watch Winner be towed away. Around a hundred people came to watch, a shuttle bus running them down the beach road in shifts. A tea station was set up by volunteers. Midges hummed about. At 9pm the sun went down behind the rig, quite spectacularly, and after that the tow-lines between Winner and her tugs visibly tautened. The underwater pontoons were filled with compressed air. A shout went up on the shore: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153She\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s on the move!\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd There was a ripple of applause. As she came off the rocks, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153seemingly inch by inch\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, said Don MacKay, Winner continued to list very badly. She was towed north across the bay until hidden by a distant headland. There was another round of applause on the beach, then a polite rush for the first shuttle bus. MacKay was not sorry to see Winner go, he said, but like many of the islanders, he had become curious about the rig\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fate and intended to follow her progress. Authorities had said they expected Winner to arrive on the eastern side of Lewis the next day, a Tuesday. But when MacKay checked that day, she had not yet appeared. He checked again early on Wednesday. Still no sign. The runaway rig had once more disappeared from public view. * * * Gothenburg That Winner floated at all when she came off the rocks was the consequence of an old tragedy, half-forgotten by the summer of 2016, but rawly felt at the time of this rig\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s invention. In 1980, a North Sea rig called Alexander Kielland had been struck by savage winds that weakened one of its legs and, with lethal suddenness, caused it to list and capsize. Of 212 crew, only 89 survived. North Sea rigs, it was ruled by British and Scandinavian authorities, must be fit to withstand such winds, and worse. That year, at the G\u00c3\u00b6taverken Arendal shipyard in Gothenburg, Sweden, an engineer called Hadar Liden sketched Winner\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shape on paper with these instructions in mind. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153If she lost a leg on the water,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd recalled Liden, who in the 1970s and 80s was G\u00c3\u00b6taverken\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chief of structural design, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153even then she should be able to float.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd At his drawing board, Liden conceived a rig that would remain buoyant in 100-knot winds, in 100-metre-high waves, even after being hit by, say, a fuel tanker. For improved stability, the new rig would be squatter, squarer and more symmetrical than the clumsily shaped, five-legged Kielland. Four-legged rigs had been built before, but were not then common. Inside G\u00c3\u00b6taverken, which had built rigs to order but never before designed its own, Liden\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s creation was nicknamed \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the Little Chair\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. G\u00c3\u00b6taverken wanted $65m to build the rig for a client (about $180m today), and a first order was placed in 1981 by a maritime firm in Oslo. Liden watched through his ninth-floor window at G\u00c3\u00b6taverken headquarters, peering deep into the bed of the shipyard as a pair of 80m pontoons were constructed, each in a dry dock. Four circular stumps were built, each the size of pitched-over ferris wheels, added to in pie\u00e2\u20ac\u2018quarter portions, to make the rig\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s legs. In 1982, the half-made rig was set afloat, and a multi-layered box of steel was craned into place to form the deck. Jutting struts, front and back, were strung with lifeboats. A 49m derrick was erected. By now the rig reached higher than Liden\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ninth-floor window. By 1983 it was ready for delivery, and its owners in Oslo promptly chartered the rig for several years to Saga Petroleum, a Norwegian firm that assumed naming rights. In her early years, the rig was known as Treasure Saga. A picture of her, freshly orange and resplendent, made the cover of one industry magazine. Here was a rig, wrote the trade press, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153for the 90s\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Liden and his colleagues expected their creation would last longer than that. In fact, the rig outlasted both the shipyard in which she was built (G\u00c3\u00b6taverken closed in 1990) and the oil company she was first leased to (Saga was absorbed by a rival in 1999). Treasure Saga was bought by Transocean in 1998 and rechristened Transocean Winner. She was leased for months and years at a time on contracts to drill in North Sea oil fields, many of which had been given mythological names such as Asgard and Midgard, but which held in their depths somewhat more earthly riches. In 1969, a rig called Ocean Viking had been idly and unhopefully prospecting in this region, when a worker named Stale Salvensen, down on the drill floor enjoying a sly cigarette, smelled the distinctive, sour scent of unprocessed crude. By the time a superior was summoned from his cabin, there was so much oil sloshing around Viking\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s lower deck that Salvensen\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s boss slipped and fell in his pyjamas. And thus, ingloriously, a continent got its oil industry. The North Sea has been profitably drilled ever since, with exploration rights shared between its bordering countries, Norway, Denmark and the United Kingdom. Winner achieved some fame, in 2010, for striking the year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest find, a reservoir in the Norwegian sector that yielded many hundreds of millions of barrels. Hadar Liden had retired by then. He was living in Gothenburg when I called him at his home, in the autumn, not long after Winner\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s grounding. I asked the 88-year-old if he had thought about his rig at all, since seeing it off out of G\u00c3\u00b6taverken, and he said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Oh, always.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Liden could recall in detail the proportion of high-tension steel that made up Winner\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s overall weight (48%), and the mill in Sweden this steel had come from (Oxel\u00c3\u00b6sund, on the Baltic Sea). He found it harder to grasp just how much life had been lived aboard his Little Chair over three decades \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the birthday cakes and Christmases, the bingo games and barbecues. Every evening she spent on board in the 1980s and 90s, a geologist named Brit Riise Fredheim would take a walk around the rim of the upper deck, and afterwards climb the derrick, for the exercise and the view. Of watching North Sea sunsets from Winner\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pinnacle, Fredheim said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I felt like I owned the world.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The oil rig had a gym, and one year they brought on board a running machine. The crew got a slow satellite internet service. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We watched movies and farted and laughed together,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Andr\u00c3\u00a9 Arctander said. He had been the rig\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s unofficial counsellor, reassuring colleagues when the isolation of offshore life got overwhelming. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Many times,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Arctander, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153grown men came into my office and started to cry. My wife cannot believe this.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Liden was unaware of Winner\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trials in Scotland: the storm, the grounding, and how, after lengthy relief work to tow the rig out of Dalmore Bay, Winner had seemed to vanish again, her reappearance after a 50-mile circumnavigation of Lewis dramatically delayed because of fears she would capsize. The rig eventually arrived in Broad Bay on the east of Lewis two days behind schedule, crewed by exhausted salvors who had hardly slept. While I told Liden about this, he listened patiently, with sympathy. Then the retired chief of structural design asked if I thought the rig had got into difficulties because of her structure. I said I thought not \u00e2\u20ac\u201c that, if anything, her essential strength had prevented a worse disaster. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Good,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Liden, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153good.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd * * * Broad Bay The rig had been in Broad Bay for five weeks. Before dawn one morning in September, a salvage master called Sylvia Tervoort stood next to the boot of her car, putting on her work clothes in the dark. Half a mile over her shoulder, illuminated by onboard lights, Winner bobbed at anchor. Tervoort, a slight 38-year-old Dutchwoman from Castricum near Amsterdam, was quickly encased in bulky safety wear. Her padded orange coat was streaked all over with crusted oil. These streaks, she explained, were traceable back to some wild maritime calamity. There was the sunken rig she had helped raise in Alaska. The scuppered bulk carrier refloated in India. A pair of collided cargo ships (one carrying explosives) that had to be separated off Greece. For months in 2012 and 2013, Tervoort had hiked over the exposed hull of Costa Concordia, the Italian cruiseship that ran aground off the coast of Tuscany. Tervoort had for many years worked for the Dutch salvage firm SMIT, the only female salvage master at the company \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and perhaps, she thought, in the world. She had never encountered another woman in such a position, and she had been all over: to South America, to Africa, deep out in the Atlantic \u00e2\u20ac\u201c wherever a stricken vessel came to occupy the uncertain middle ground between serviceable craft and sea junk, she had been called to attend. Whether she was there to bring a craft back to life, or to siphon off its environment-threatening pollutants before a spill, or simply to strip a ship of its tangible riches before it sank, depended on the situation and the wants of her contractor in each case. Tervoort put on a helmet and moved towards a motorboat that would take her and her team out to Winner in the bay. For this job, SMIT had been contracted by Transocean to oversee the curious work of fixing up a maimed and ailing rig, in order that that it might resume its voyage to be destroyed absolutely. Tervoort was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153not interested in the politics\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u201c as with the grounded fuel carrier she had dragged off a beach in Morocco, and the flaming cargo ship her team had boarded at sea, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a job\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a job. If people are happy making the signature on my salary, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s OK.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd As a salvage master, she tended to think about troubled vessels in binary terms. If not \u00e2\u20ac\u0153assets\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd still afloat, then \u00e2\u20ac\u0153wrecks\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. She knew the transition from asset to wreck could be lethally quick, and a consequence of either impatience or overcaution by salvors. With Winner, Tervoot had prescribed caution rather than haste \u00e2\u20ac\u201c much to the frustration, I was told, of authorities, who would have preferred to see the rig leave Scotland as quickly as possible. Tervoort would not be hurried. She had once spent a month in the hold of a stranded bulk carrier off Cuba, without the means to wash, except when a rainstorm gathered, at which point she trotted up on to deck in her bikini. Her life as a salvor seemed to require that she be in possession of a crazy array of skills: seamanship, engineering, calculus, rope climbing, parkour, mild piracy, among others. More than anything, though, the work demanded composure and courage, plus a total lack of awe about outsized seacraft. Civilians crane their necks and coo at large ships. Tervoort saw only assets \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and moreover, assets that itched to become wrecks. It was in my capacity as a neck-craner that I had followed Winner to the Hebrides, getting as close to the rig as I could, which was never that close. Tervoort\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s team arrived in the car park, bussed in from the north of the island where they had been billeted at Transocean\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s expense in a holiday lodge. While they boarded the motorboat, I asked Tervoort if I could sail out with them. Get up close, see the rig. Tervoort replied, levelly, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153No.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd As the boat sped away, I could hear her tease her team about the cold. The sun had started to rise, turning Winner a striking crimson. On a hillside to the east of the bay, I met a pair of hikers who were admiring the rig and counting the support vessels that floated near her. The most impressive of these vessels, a heavy-lifting ship called Hawk, was one of the largest in her class \u00e2\u20ac\u201c really preposterously large, with an awesome rectangular deck that was something like the size of a Pall Mall or a Piccadilly to Winner\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Trafalgar Square. Hawk had been ordered to the Hebrides from Singapore. Most of the smaller boats around her were chartered from Lewis. James Morrison, one of the hikers, itemised the mini economic boom that had bobbed in to Lewis with the rig: day rates for sailors, hotels booked out, all those minicab minutes ferrying oil execs back and forth from the airport. As sun and drizzle conspired to form a rainbow over Broad Bay, Morrison pointed out that, for a moment, Winner seemed to float at the end of it. During the weeks of the rig\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stay on Lewis, there had been an unbargained-for turn in public opinion. Though initially seen as a poised steel spider, and a possible environmental threat, residents had by and large become fond of Winner. In pubs and on coastal paths, they discussed the progress of Tervoort\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s salvage with an easy familiarity, as they did weather or tides. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Every day you look at it,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Norman Macdonald, a taxi driver. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Wherever you drive round this part of the island, you look for the rig, to see how it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s doing.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd When I called to book a room at a B&amp;B, the proprietor asked if I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d like \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a room with a rig view\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. In a Lewis primary school, pupils made cardboard models of Winner, and Tervoort was invited to visit and judge them. If islanders had developed a coy affection for the oil rig, they had become openly adoring of the salvage master, and Tervoort rapidly advanced to local celebrity status. She was invited to take part in the island\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fun-run. She gave a hit lecture at a local university, about a salvor\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s life. It was Tervoort\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s opinion that Winner would never survive being towed any serious distance, certainly not to the Mediterranean as planned, and so efforts were directed to get the rig on to the back of the heavy-lifting ship, Hawk. In a complicated process that would involve Hawk sinking herself into the water, drifting beneath the rig and then rising again, Winner would have to be lifted up and carried out of Scotland. They call this dry-towing. It happened in early October, after several false starts. Conditions had to be just right for Hawk to submerge and re-emerge, and islanders had several times gathered at vantage points to wave the rig away, only for the departure to be called off because of bad weather. In the end, on 6 October, Winner left Lewis unobserved, stealing away in the dark, her departure as abrupt and even as dashing as her arrival. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I miss her,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Laura Carse, the Dalmore surfer. * * * Malta Strapped to Hawk, Winner moved south. She passed the outstretched fingers of mainland Scotland and patiently negotiated the busy shipping lanes of the Irish Sea. On 9 October the crafts passed the mouth of the Channel and then picked up speed, ripping through the Bay of Biscay in the better part of a day. After a fortnight at sea, both vessels had passed by Spain and Portugal and were in horn-hailing distance of Africa. They sailed between Tangier and Gibraltar and into the Alboran Sea, then pressed on past Sardinia and into the Mediterranean. Standing tall on the deck of her carrier ship, Winner looked as cool and improbable as a heron crossing water on the back of a paddling hippo. Hawk and Winner made Maltese waters on 25 October, dropping anchor off the capital, Valletta. High in the water as she was, Winner was easily visible over the square, stone rooftops of this ancient city, and she drew many Maltese to the seafront. A sightseers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 boat, known as a luzzu, freighted with tourists, was piloted closer for a look. At anchor in Malta, repair work was carried out on the rig\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s damaged pontoons, while her owners exchanged export permissions with various authorities. Otherwise, Winner basked. It was bright and hot in the Mediterranean, and this old rig, once so profoundly chilled by North Sea winters that her steel would be painful to touch, at last warmed through. The Times of Malta sent a photographer to snap a northern celebrity come south to sunbathe. Carmel Pule, a retired professor of engineering, and also a keen sailor and ship-spotter, trained binoculars on Winner from the roof of his home. The 77-year-old had seen countless vessels come and go, Malta being a popular stopping point for shipping enterprise of every sort, and brisk handling of maritime paperwork a key part of the island economy. Pule could not recall seeing an oil rig come in piggy-back before. He got on his motorbike and rode to the coast. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Not beautiful to look at as individual craft,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he told his wife that evening, describing the trussed-together Winner and Hawk. But an appealing couple, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153together for the sake of convenience, or a temporary love affair\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Pule did it, I did it \u00e2\u20ac\u201c we do this, as humans, we humanise seacraft. Vessels are christened under bottles of fizz. They\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re given nicknames and ascribed character. Months after disembarking Winner for the last time, her crew could describe for me with precision, as if they were established personality traits, the rig\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s distinctive pitch and roll, the chatter of her anchor chains in wind, the subtle but thrilling smell of helicopter fuel that came through the ventilation system to let them know a batch of letters and newspapers had arrived. Meanwhile, in Malta, Pule kept a vigil on Winner from his roof, and sent me long emails in which he ruminated on the rig\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s visible old age, on her retirement, on an end to the obvious usefulness of things; he did not always register a distinction between the vessel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s state and his own. Seacraft engender affinity, and perhaps only those who are obliged to take a wider perspective can remain entirely unromantic about them. The master salvor Sylvia Tervoort, who tended to meet vessels when something had gone dreadfully wrong with them, considered my question about whether she felt any affection towards the craft she had worked on and said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Maybe if this was a movie.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd When I spoke with Patrizia Heidegger of Shipbreaking Platform, she stressed that her organisation was concerned with the humanitarian and environmental burden of shipbreaking. As such, she was politely unenthusiastic about too much sentiment being spent on the boats. On 24 October, a day before Winner\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s arrival in Malta, Transocean had put out a statement to investors, confirming her sale as scrap. The company added that the rig would now be dismantled; \u00e2\u20ac\u0153recycled\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd was their word. In describing a great, curling route out of Scandinavia, west and then south and then east (east, east) to the Med, Winner had passed 18 EU-approved facilities for shipbreaking, including those in Fosen in Norway, Grenaa in Denmark, Lowestoft in England, Bordeaux in France, Ghent in Belgium and Vinaroz in Spain. Unwanted sea junk does not often find its way to Europe, or stay long there. Had Winner been a fixed-drill platform, built into northern bedrock, exacting regulations and conventions would have insisted that this structure be dismantled and recycled in place. When an oil rig has an engine and a propeller, however \u00e2\u20ac\u201c when she is classed as a vessel; a mobile she, not a stationary it \u00e2\u20ac\u201c regulations can be outdistanced. Berths can be sought where conventions are not quite so stringent. And to sail a condemned vessel east from Europe is to adjust the financials of a demolition substantially. A secondhand vessel is currently worth about $190 per tonne to a shipbreaking yard in Turkey, a price established by the local market in reclaimed steel. Sail on to China and a different market, and the same metal is worth $210 per tonne. At breakers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 yards in Alang in India, Chittagong in Bangladesh and Gadani in Pakistan, they will pay around $280 per tonne. Meanwhile, at the EU-approved shipbreaking sites, which are bound to conform to continental waste laws, and where vessels are dismantled in closed-off quays or dry docks, rates are less competitive: European yards offer zero dollars per tonne, and, in fact, tend to ask a fee to take a shipowners\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 junk. Of the 864 vessels that were dismantled around the world last year, nine were dismantled in Europe. Give or take a dozen (sent to Mexico, the Philippines, Russia and South Korea), the remainder went to breaking yards in Turkey, China, India, Bangladesh and Pakistan. The NGO Shipbreaking Platform has for some years tracked the movements of surplus ships to these sites, finding it necessary, over time, to start documenting human as well as vessel expiry. They add to their records the blunt, dire summaries of a tragedy every time a shipbreaker is killed in an accident anywhere in the world. Chaudhry Baliram Indrajit, crushed by a crane in Alang in January 2016. Muhammad Asif, killed by fire in Gadani in March 2016. Shibbir Ahmed and Jalal Uddin, both of whom fell to their deaths in Chittagong in July 2016. There are dozens of such deaths every year, the majority of them in yards in India, Bangladesh and Pakistan, where men and boys pick apart vessels without appropriate tools or safety equipment, assuming terrific risks. As Winner underwent repairs in Malta, that October, the tally of acknowledged deaths in 2016 stood at 30, all in yards in south Asia. Of those 864 vessels sent for demolition that year, 668 went to yards in that region. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The incentive is to go to south Asia,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Patrizia Heidegger of Shipbreaking Platform, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153because the highest price paid per tonne is there.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Whether individual shipowners took up that incentive depended, in her view, on a moral-financial reckoning. How much they cared about profits, as against how much they cared. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The reason you have owners going to beaches in India, Pakistan and Bangladesh is money,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Petter Heier, head of Grieg Green, a subsidiary of the Norwegian maritime group Grieg established to promote and advise on responsible shipbreaking. Since 2010, Heier has sought to persuade divesting owners to send their excess to one of a group of vetted breaking yards in Turkey and China, rather than the higher-paying, less-audited yards in south Asia. Heier continued: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153There are major accidents in India, Pakistan and Bangladesh every week. No company wants to be associated with that. So they sell through middlemen. They change the name of their vessels. They try to hide their [radar] tracking.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd These evasions infuriate the watchdog groups in their efforts to hold a shadowy industry to account, but do not always scuttle them. For instance, Shipbreaking Platform had laboriously tracked through its final movements a German-owned cargo ship called HS Colon, which happened to arrive in Malta at the same time as Winner. While at anchor in the Mediterranean, HS Colon disappeared. When the NGO caught up with her, she had undergone a brisk identity change, shedding the initials that linked her to her former owners, Hansa Treuhand, and was heading for Alang under the name of Colo. That month, a tanker called Gaz Fountain was bought for scrap by a yard in Gadani. Before she sailed, Gaz Fountain became Rain. On 9 January this year, Rain caught fire during demolition on a Pakistani beach, killing five workers. A few weeks earlier, in November, another ship had exploded at Gadani, killing at least 27 workers. Still astride Hawk, Winner left Maltese waters on 27 October. She moved east towards Crete and wove between a scattering of Aegean islands. She was bound for Turkey, and a place on its west coast called Aliaga, where the Turkish shipbreaking industry is based. This was an expensive choice of destination by Transocean. Around $80 or $90 per tonne in value had been foregone, more than $1m in total, compared with what might have been wrangled for Winner from a yard in south Asia. Petter Heier at Grieg Green said he believed that \u00e2\u20ac\u201c slowly, gradually \u00e2\u20ac\u201c owners such as Transocean were coming to acknowledge the longer-term, intangible gains of careful disposal, even if this meant shorter-term, tangible loss. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Insurance companies are putting pressure on shipowners to recycle responsibly. Their employees are putting pressure. Society is putting pressure.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd In the case of Transocean, Heier offered an opinion (\u00e2\u20ac\u0153a personal opinion\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd) that the company was further influenced in its thinking by its involvement in the Deepwater Horizon catastrophe. When it exploded in the Gulf of Mexico in 2010, Deepwater Horizon was contracted, notoriously, to BP. But it was Transocean\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rig. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I would guess Deepwater Horizon triggered something,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Heier said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153They are very careful [now], that if something happens with them on the beach in India, Bangladesh or Pakistan, that might ruin their name in the market.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd When I expressed surprise that Winner should have departed Malta still a Winner, without a change of identity in the manner of Colon or Gaz Fountain, Heier said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153They didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t change the name because they didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t need to hide anything. They chose a good yard.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd * * * Aliaga They lit up the shore with flares on the day the rig came in at Aliaga. This was to acknowledge the end of a three-week journey that had ended up taking three months, and to show a pack of tugboats \u00e2\u20ac\u201c now that Winner was off the submerged Hawk and being pulled and pushed towards the beach \u00e2\u20ac\u201c just where to put her. The float-off took place at lunchtime on 5 November. Winner had a token crew again: representatives from Transocean and SMIT back aboard for the final tow. Guiding flares on the shore, at least from Winner\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s deck, appeared only as spots of fire among hundreds. Aliaga beach was aflame \u00e2\u20ac\u201c in the shallows, where carcasses of ships and rigs were disassembled by spark-showering blowtorches, and in the narrow yards beyond, where amputated pieces were further torched. Dense smoke filled the air above the yards. From the water, it must have appeared to the uninitiated that Aliaga had been freshly, plentifully bombed; perhaps doused and jumbled by tidal waves, too. In fact, this was a normal working day on the beach. At its western edge, a Del Monte fruit boat had been perfectly halved. To the east was a cargo carrier, Modern Express, that had some months earlier been abandoned by her crew while stricken and drifting in the Bay of Biscay. Nearby were two demobbed frigates, recently owned by the Spanish navy. Winner was put in next to the halved Del Monte boat, on a part of the beach owned by a local shipbreaking company called Isiksan. Isiksan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s foreman, a muscular 30-year-old Istanbulite named H\u00c3\u00bcsseyin Essen, sailed out to meet the rig. Essen had been the foreman here when Isiksan accepted its first oil rig for demolition, in early 2015. Ocean Concord had shown up 200 metres from the shore, and when Essen and his colleagues sailed out to meet her, they had no idea what to do next. Ever since they started shipbreaking in Aliaga in the 1970s, vessels had been brought ashore using a method known as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153beaching\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd; that is, they were piloted inland and made to mount the beach at speed. (Trembling phone footage from 2013 of a ferry being beached in an explosion of smoke and water has been viewed more than 3m times on YouTube.) With the sterns half-ashore, breakers could then cut in and dismantle the ships laterally, as a snacker might eat through a baguette. But oil rigs were not fast enough or strong enough for beaching. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know what the hell we were going to do,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Essen said. There was an idea to work on Concord at sea. In the end, heavy chains were tied around her legs and connected via winches to powerful vehicles on the shore. Concord was hauled through the shallows like a struggling fish. Through many oil rig landings since, this method had proved fine. Winner, towed and carried and storm-propelled on this fantastically harried trip east, would be dragged the last metres by straining bulldozers. Unlike the colossal breakers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 beaches of south Asia, or the disparate yards scattered around coastal China, Turkish shipbreaking is packed close in one place, concentrated entirely on this government-allotted mile of coast on the outskirts of Aliaga. The beach here has been divided into as many slim, neighbouring yards as will fit \u00e2\u20ac\u201c 25 of them. Considering its comparative scale, Aliaga should be a minor consumer of the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s excess sea-tonnage. But since Ocean Concord arrived 18 months ago, it has established itself, improbably, as the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s foremost consumer of oil rigs. Something like 300,000 tonnes of unwanted rig had been brought here \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Hunter and Yatzy and JW McLean and John Shaw and Southern Cross and Aleutian Key and Amirante and Scarabeo 4 and Arctic I and Arctic III \u00e2\u20ac\u201c as well as that pair of young Enscos, the two rigs that were barely a decade old when they were sent by their owners for disposal. The Isiksan yard, its opening on to the Aegean no wider than an average-sized rig, had undertaken most of the demolitions. Petter Heier of Grieg Green, which advised Transocean on these latter stages of the disposal, said Isiksan had been chosen because of this expertise. It was expertise hard-won. Essen and his colleagues learned over the months that the best way to scrap a rig was to deposit a group of blowtorchers on the upper deck (carrying them there in a crane-hoisted cage) and then to let them burn their way downwards. The process took months, but because more men could get at more vessel on a rig than on a beached ship, and because rigs tended to have cranes that could be co-opted into the effort of self-destruction, Essen\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s scrappers were getting faster and faster at their work. With Winner, they targeted the helipad first, weakening it with blowtorches before a crane came in to pick it clean away. Winner\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s galley went next, then half her accommodation block. A fortnight into the demolition, the horizontal decks were still in place, but the walls between had been so gnawed at that Winner looked liked one of the cut-away diagrams sketched by Hader Liden at his drawing board decades earlier. The rig\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sale to Isiksan was formalised and finalised the moment she came off the back of Hawk. In the words of Isiksan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s young chief, a 26-year-old Aliagan named Soner Sari, Winner was a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153cooked meal\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, in that she had been brought to the yard whole and the workers there only had to digest her. They did this by cutting 50-tonne pieces off her, lifting these pieces into the yard, where the steel could be separated from everything else, then trucking off this valuable metal in one-metre-squared pieces that would be sold to a foundry nearby. Not all vessels in Aliaga were \u00e2\u20ac\u0153cooked meals\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Other deals struck by Sari specified that Isiksan must fetch unwanted craft from wherever they had outlasted their use. These agreements, known in the industry as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153cash-buyer\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd deals, could be profitable \u00e2\u20ac\u201c but they were also risky. Early in 2016, an old ship called Bannock had been cash-bought by Sari from her owners in Italy. Sailed into the Matapan Sea, bound for Aliaga, Bannock had quickly listed and capsized, ceasing to exist in the old-fashioned way, by sinking to the bottom. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153That was a shitty feeling,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Sari said. We were sitting in his office on the yard, watching the slow destruction of Winner through a picture window. Boyish, dark, smartly dressed, Sari sometimes threw out his hands when he spoke, showing a bracelet on each wrist, one of them decorated with pictures of turtles. He had a Range Rover parked outside, in which we had driven together from central Aliaga, passing various chemical factories, oil refineries and foundries. Closer to the breakers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 beach, an informal flea market of maritime bric-a-brac had been established, where traders sold recovered items from the dismantled ships. Sari continued: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153When we buy in a faraway port it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s cheaper, because we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re taking certain risks, and if it works out, we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll we make money for taking those risks.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd On his phone he had photographs of Bannock sinking. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153At that point, your company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s $20m \u00e2\u20ac\u201c or whatever you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve paid \u00e2\u20ac\u201c is gone. Poof. It hurts.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Sari did not want to say exactly how much Isiksan had paid Transocean for the right to scrap Winner. Estimating based on local market rates, it could have been as much as $3.5m, though Sari only allowed that it was a seven-figure sum, and that Isiksan expected to turn a profit on the recovered steel. Parts other than a rig\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s steel could also be valuable to a breaking firm \u00e2\u20ac\u201c for instance, any deck cranes that were in resellable condition. The lifeboats that came stitched to vessels could also be sold on to the bric-a-brac guys beyond the yard. Hundreds waited to be sold there, bordering the road like giant orange crash barriers. Through Sari\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s office window, we looked at a newly removed piece of Winner\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s accommodation block, which had just been brought up into the yard. It might once have been a section of corridor, and electric cabling and insulation foam still clung to its steel walls. A hydraulic excavator started tossing and rolling it in the dirt \u00e2\u20ac\u201c cartwheeling it over and over to shake away the wire and the foam. By the end of the day, Sari judged, that steel would be on a foundry floor. About $3,000 worth, he said, pricing it by eye. While we drank strong, tarry coffee, we discussed the environmental consequences of shipbreaking. It was no coincidence, Sari said, that Aliaga\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s yards were huddled up beside refineries and foundries. Heavy industry had been moved to Aliaga en masse in the 1970s, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153because the government wanted to wrap it up in one area, keep everything else nice\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Sari acknowledged that the local yards had not always upheld the strictest standards when it came to minimising environmental damage, but he was working to change that. Beneath the Isiskan yard he had installed a drainage system to catch and pump off pollutants. Down in the water there were brightly coloured booms, bobbing in a circle around Winner\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s legs, there in theory to stop any floating waste from getting out into the Aegean. A confidential 2015 report by the shipping consultancy Litehauz, obtained by journalists from the investigative agency Danwatch last year, detailed the potential impact of ships that were torch-cut on tidal water. The report estimated that for every 10,000 tonnes of vessel torched, about 120 tonnes of molten steel and two tonnes of chipped-away paint escaped into the sea. Sari insisted that the water off Isiksan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s yard was regularly tested for pollutants. When I asked if he would swim out there, he thought for a moment and answered: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Why not?\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Petter Heier of Grieg Green said his company had audited the Isiksan yard and found its environmental procedures acceptable. Look, Sari said, it might be distasteful, but somebody had to get rid of shipowners\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 garbage. He gestured at the yard through the window. In his view, it was better that it happened out there than on the deadly beaches of Alang or Chittagong. He had applied for European recognition for the Isiksan yard, hoping to see it added to a list of EU-approved shipbreaking sites. * * * The shipbreaking yard We took a walk together through the yard, where the immediate noise was at first so much to contend with \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the guttural, football-crowd \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Ooooh!\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd of ignited blowtorches, the grating complaint of metal on metal, bulldozer rumbles, generator whines \u00e2\u20ac\u201c that I put off the matter of sights until a second lap. In the reddish-brown dust, fine as powder in places, a combination of soil and dirt and tiny coloured chips of paint, I found a Norwegian chocolate bar called a Stratos, still in its packaging. Nearby was a plastic shoehorn, apparently flung from the cartwheeling corridor, and a takeaway menu from a Chinese restaurant in Lewis. The discoveries increased in size \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a gas mask, a boot, a barrel on fire, a pile of fire extinguishers, a larger mountain of green and white foam \u00e2\u20ac\u201c until we were standing beside great, upright sections of mud pipe, tall enough for a person to walk through, cut into giant, swiss-roll slices and now being lifted into the bed of a truck. Early in Winner\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s demolition, a big, square piece of her decking, like the mat of a boxing ring, had been retained because it was flat and smooth and would skim briskly through the dusty yard when dragged behind a bulldozer. It now served as a carrying palette for the rig\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s disparate amputations, and brought sliding up from the shore an entire utility closet, placed upside down. An equipment rack on the closet\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s outer wall was slung with vices, chains and thick bolts the size of milk bottles. A sign above the inverted door warned that it might close violently at sea. When I tried to step inside, Sari said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Uh, don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t go in there yet.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd He indicated that parts of the room were so freshly torched that they were still smouldering. Airhorns sounded: lunch. I walked among yellow-helmeted breakers \u00e2\u20ac\u201c about 70 of them were rostered to work today \u00e2\u20ac\u201c as they streamed off Winner. The men I met lived locally. They said they earned wages of about $1,300 a month. According to investigations by Asli Odman, a member of Labour Watch Turkey, there had been at least 10 fatal accidents in the various yards of Aliaga since 2010. On the oil-refining ship Kuito, being dismantled at a neighbouring yard in 2015, a worker fell into the hold and died. On the cruise ship Pacific, dismantled by Izmir Ship Recycling Co in 2013, two workers were poisoned by carbon monoxide. I asked a 31-year-old Isiksan employee named Zafer Erdem, who operated a crane, whether he felt any fear whenever the next new rig arrived for demolition. No, said Erdem, when a rig came in he thought: work, two or three months of it. Erdem and his colleague Kamil Conge, a 45-year-old field manager, had a combined 30 years of experience on the beach. An inch beneath the dirt, Conge said, there was a layer of concrete that extended most of the way to the shore \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a recent addition, before which the yard became a muddy horror whenever it rained. In those days, Conge said, a ship \u00e2\u20ac\u0153could take a year to dismantle\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. I was told there had been injuries to workers in the Isiksan yard; accidental scorchings was the example given. Everyone remembered the recent death on Kuito, along the beach. Work stopped for a day in a show of respect. Not far from the mess hall, in the mud, I came across something colourful \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a Norwegian consumer magazine, six years out of date and splayed open at an article about red wines. A 26-year-old yard worker called Omer Dogan, about to skip lunch and go to prayers at a nearby mosque, said they had sometimes found \u00e2\u20ac\u0153funnier stuff\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd on incoming oil rigs. Omer reddened, not wanting to say pornography. H\u00c3\u00bcsseyin Essen told me he had many times come across collections of family photographs. Sari was once inspecting a brought-in trawler when he found a full outfit of ski gear in a cupboard. The Spanish frigates had come to Aliaga, he said, stripped of computers, but still with several missile launchers intact. Sari liked it best when they found a certain type of brass valve on ships. Isiksan owned a small foundry that processed non-ferrous metals, mostly salvaged bronze, which would be melted down and fashioned into storm valves, for resale to the shipbuilding industry. Sometimes, Isiksan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s valves found their way back to Isiksan, got removed and were melted down again. I mentioned to Sari that I had met a man on the Isle of Lewis, an eccentric local professor called Arne V\u00c3\u00b6gler, who had led a volunteer mission to scour the waters of Dalmore Bay after Winner had gone. V\u00c3\u00b6gler, searching for debris that might harm the environment, had ended up fishing out Winner\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s enormous propeller. He joked to me about installing it as garden furniture. Hearing this, Sari raised an eyebrow. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I wondered where that propeller had gone,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said, and sniffed. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Brass alloy. Tell the guy he owes me $50,000.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd At the water\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s edge, the big steel carrying palette waited in the dirt. Sari stood on one of its upturned corners, hands in his pockets, bouncing on the flexible metal. The Aegean lapped at Winner\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ruptured pontoons. From here I could see the intricate patterning of rust up the oil rig\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s legs \u00e2\u20ac\u201c grades of peach, grey, green, black and bleach-white stains, recording, as if they were a sailor\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tattoos, Winner\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s many tours in the North Sea. I knew from studying Hadar Liden\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sketches that the thick legs were actually hollow, with ladders inside them to provide a route between the decks and the pontoons in case of emergency. In Aliaga, a doorway had been torched in one of these forward legs, and square windows cut at intervals up to the deck, so that when his workers climbed, Sari said, they didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have to do so in the dark. I suggested that I try climbing up the inside of Winner myself. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153No,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Sari. By this point I was accustomed to being refused requests to get aboard the rig. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153No,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he continued, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve tried going up by the ladder and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s like scaling a 10-storey building. Better take the cage.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd He signalled to an operator in a nearby crane, who answered by rotating and depositing on the shore a carry-cage about the size of a couple of telephone boxes, painted blood-red. I stepped inside and held on to the cage\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s central pole, like a commuter on a bus, as it was hoisted fast into the air, spinning through several terrible rotations before settling into a queasy, side-to-side sway. Before landing the cage on the rig, the crane swung me high and wide above the beach, so that for the first time I could see the full, fiery chaos of Aliaga. The fruit boats and frigates and oil rigs were not going quietly, but inchingly, they were going; and soon their berths on the shore would be filled by the next redundant or repented-of thing. Back in his office, I had asked Sari what would happen when the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fleet had been adequately thinned, when there were no more superfluous rigs for him to buy and dismantle. He said he expected this to happen soon. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Next year? The year after?\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd As rigs disappeared, rates to hire the remaining ones would rise and, eventually, an incautious oil industry would find an economic (if not glowingly ethical) equilibrium. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153And we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll go looking for the next thing.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Sari had in mind a smaller type of oil platform known as a jack-up, of which there were many hundreds filling the seas. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Cold-stacked all over, no jobs, no prospects of jobs \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd I asked him if it ever seemed a pity to break up such monumental and characterful structures. Did he look at Winner in the way that I had come to look at her, in the way her former crew looked at her, as something dignified? Sari said the only emotion he could feel about Winner was relief, when she was gone, on schedule. But not long ago, he acknowledged, he had had a wobble. It was over those two young Ensco rigs \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Ensco 6003 and 6004 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c that had come out of Brazilian waters. When Sari won the right to scrap them, he took the unusual decision to sail the rigs under their own power from South America to Turkey. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I piloted one myself, for the last mile to Aliaga. I wanted to try it out.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Sari mimed adjusting thrusters, striking buttons. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Everything was like new, all the controls.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd They demolished Ensco 6003 and 6004 over the course of about 10 weeks. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Beautiful machines. Beautiful machines,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Sari said. * * * On the Transocean Winner The cage was lowered on to Winner\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s deck, where it smelled of propane and singed steel, of grease and hydraulic fuel. Disorientatingly, here, the rig\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s insides were outside, so that a payphone that had once stood in the accommodation block was now upright and exposed in the open air. Two ping-pong balls, mysterious survivors of the long voyage, juddered on the payphone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s coin shelf. Nearby, blowtorchers cut their way out from inside a cabin, and above them a deputation of breakers directed liquid from a hose into a vat marked \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Chemical Spill\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Thinking of the geologist Brit Fredheim, and her evening constitutionals around the rig, I set off to walk Winner\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s circumference. All along the perimeter fence were signs that ordered \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Respect this barrier\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, signs that continued until the barrier fell away completely, mangled, torn and disrespected by the storm back in the Hebrides. I moved towards the interior, passing pools of standing water on the corrugated floor, and crater-bursts of rust where it was dry. Someone had left a dozen eggs on the floor by a ladder. There were stacks of dusty computer towers in a cupboard, and orange lifejackets that filled two bath-sized tubs to the brim. In a windowless office, where there were two leather-effect chairs and a tacked-up poster of a motorbike, I found a whiteboard on which somebody had written \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Crew 6 says goodbye\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Below, on a shelf, there was a leather-bound logbook, neatly filled with the signatures of men and women who had seen through a particular watch on Winner. There were pages and pages of names, going back to the early 1990s. I considered stealing the book, or adding my own signature. In the end, I put it back on the shelf, to be destroyed with the rest. Outside, I passed Zafer Erdem in his crane, merrily terrorising a piece of racking at the base of the derrick. We waved. By the end of November, Winner had been stripped of everything above the midriff, bar her derrick. This was pulled down on 3 December, then chained to bulldozers, which laboured until the tower toppled forward; instead of landing on an outstretched jetty that was meant to catch the pieces, it twisted and crashed pinnacle-first into the shallows. Once the pieces had been fished out, work resumed to reduce the rig\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s legs. By mid-December, Winner amounted to little more than a pair of pontoons under blackened stumps, the dwindling structure kept stable by thin strips of horizontal decking, so that it resembled a pair of ice skates strung together by the laces. By Christmas Day, only the pontoons were left. These were dragged out of the water and into the dirt so that another unwanted rig, Transocean Driller, could be parked on the slipway behind. Winner\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s port-side pontoon was sliced up and trucked away in the first days of January. Very likely, by this point, there were swirls of the rig\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s old steel in the refashioned blocks and beams that were leaving the local foundries, to be sold on for use in construction projects around the Turkish interior. On 5 January, something curious happened on Aliaga beach. Winner\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s final piece, her starboard pontoon, was half gone. Snow began to fall, rare in this part of Turkey, carrying on for four days and keeping the breakers from their work. A reprieve \u00e2\u20ac\u201c days in which Winner was left out and unmolested, in weather she knew well. By the following week, the snow had gone and the cutting resumed. The last of the pontoon was lifted on to a truck on 13 January, and smelted that afternoon.

You can be large as long as you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve got a well articulated business model\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. </p> <p>As for jail, Flint reckons there is no evidence that business people escaped justice: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think anyone is above the law but people in business shouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be subject to different standards of proof than ordinary citizens.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd</p> <p>He says efforts are now under way to make the financial system cleaner. Rather than report unusual transactions that might indicate money laundering, for instance, the banks are now expected to root them out. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Public expectations have changed in terms of policing of the financial system,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he says. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153What we have today is right.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd</p> <p>He likens it to the debate raging about controversial images posted on social media, which platforms such as Facebook insist are not their responsibility. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153That would have been kind of where we were 25 years ago. It will be interesting to see whether public policy changes.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd</p> <p>Flint<br></p> <p>\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s successor is former Prudential boss Mark Tucker. He takes over on 1 October and will be the first outsider to ever chair the 152-year-old bank.</p> <p>Tucker will then have to find a new chief executive \u00e2\u20ac\u201c because Gulliver has made clear he is also ready to go \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and steer the bank through Brexit. </p> <p>HSBC has already announced it is moving 1,000 roles to Paris as part of its preparations for a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153hard\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Brexit, but this is only one of the things on Tucker\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s list: the wider European situation, free trade, the relationship between China and the US.</p> <p>But Flint reckons London will survive as a financial centre, come what may. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re an industry that is used to change. The industry will reconfigure, London will reconfigure. The talent pool that is here, the ecosystem that exists of lawyers, accountants, trustees, the insurance market, brokers, every kind of financial sector player , the technology sector, legal system, the infrastructure and Greenwich mean time means that it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s an attractive place to run any business.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd</p> <p><br></p> <p>. </p>",

Flint obviously disagrees: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve got a very good management team. You can be large as long as you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve got a well articulated business model\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. As for jail, Flint reckons there is no evidence that business people escaped justice: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think anyone is above the law but people in business shouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be subject to different standards of proof than ordinary citizens.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd He says efforts are now under way to make the financial system cleaner. Rather than report unusual transactions that might indicate money laundering, for instance, the banks are now expected to root them out. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Public expectations have changed in terms of policing of the financial system,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he says. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153What we have today is right.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd He likens it to the debate raging about controversial images posted on social media, which platforms such as Facebook insist are not their responsibility. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153That would have been kind of where we were 25 years ago. It will be interesting to see whether public policy changes.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Flint \u00e2\u20ac\u2122s successor is former Prudential boss Mark Tucker. He takes over on 1 October and will be the first outsider to ever chair the 152-year-old bank. Tucker will then have to find a new chief executive \u00e2\u20ac\u201c because Gulliver has made clear he is also ready to go \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and steer the bank through Brexit. HSBC has already announced it is moving 1,000 roles to Paris as part of its preparations for a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153hard\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Brexit, but this is only one of the things on Tucker\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s list: the wider European situation, free trade, the relationship between China and the US. But Flint reckons London will survive as a financial centre, come what may. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re an industry that is used to change. The industry will reconfigure, London will reconfigure. The talent pool that is here, the ecosystem that exists of lawyers, accountants, trustees, the insurance market, brokers, every kind of financial sector player , the technology sector, legal system, the infrastructure and Greenwich mean time means that it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s an attractive place to run any business.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd .",

                "bodyText":"A five-year old British virtual simulation startup, co-founded by Cambridge computer science graduates, has been valued at more than $1bn after raising $502m (\u00c2\u00a3390m) from Japan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s SoftBank. The investment in the London-based firm Improbable is thought to be the largest made in a fledgling European tech firm. Improbable uses cloud-based software to create virtual worlds for use in games as well as large-scale simulations of the real world. The capabilities of the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s technology have been likened to The Matrix, in which humans plug into a simulated world powered by computers. The business was co-founded in 2012 by Herman Narula, 29, and Rob Whitehead, 26, who met while studying computer science at the University of Cambridge, and Peter Lipka, 28, an Imperial College graduate who worked at Goldman Sachs before launching Improbable. The three co-founders hold a majority equity stake in Improbable \u00e2\u20ac\u201c meaning they share a paper fortune of more than half a billion dollars \u00e2\u20ac\u201c with Narula holding enough voting rights to control the company. They are not taking any cash out of the business as a result of the investment. SoftBank, which has put its managing director, Deep Nishar, on Improbable\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s board, will have only a minority stake in the business. Narula, Improbable\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chief executive, said the company held talks with multiple investors but after a trip to Tokyo it was decided that Softbank had an \u00e2\u20ac\u0153alignment of vision that made them the obvious choice\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Narula and Whitehead, the chief technology officer, met at a dissertation review at Cambridge\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s computer lab, where they discovered \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a mutual interest in multiplayer games and virtual worlds\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd that put them on the path to creating the software that underpins Improbable. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We talked about so many games and so many ideas about how games are made and run,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Narula said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We believe the next major phase in computing will be the emergence of large-scale virtual worlds.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Narula was born in Delhi, India; he moved to the UK when he was three and attended Haberdashers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Aske\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s boys school.

                "body":"<p>It was an audacious plan for an unloved bit of Manchester. A \u00c2\u00a325m arts centre to be built on a derelict plot that had not felt a cultural pulse since the closure, 15 years earlier, of the legendary <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2012/jul/02/how-we-made-hacienda-club\">Ha\u00c3\u00a7ienda nightclub</a>. It would be called <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/home-in-manchester\">Home</a>, formed by the merger of two proud but financially imperilled institutions \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the <a href=\"https://homemcr.org/about/history/cornerhouse/\">Cornerhouse</a> cinema and gallery, and the <a href=\"https://homemcr.org/about/history/library-theatre-company/\">Library Theatre Company</a> \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and would, its backers hoped, revive a forgotten corner on the city\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s southern edge.</p> <p>\u00e2\u20ac\u0153There was confidence from the city leadership that it would work, but a lot of my peers and colleagues in the arts were saying to me, \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcWho\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s going to go there?\u00e2\u20ac\u2122\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd says Sheena Wrigley, executive director of Home, which includes two theatres, five cinema screens, an art gallery and a restaurant and bar. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It was a very unprepossessing area with a big car park and one large office block. It wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t visible or on a main thoroughfare.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd</p> <p>Programming would swim far from the mainstream, too. The centre opened in May 2015 with a challenging play about two thwarted lovers trying to survive a recession in a city like Manchester. This week the cinema is showing <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/apr/27/lady-macbeth-review-florence-pugh-william-oldroyd-peter-bradshaw\">Lady Macbeth</a>, a subversive Shakespearean noir, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/apr/13/the-handmaiden-review-park-chan-wook\">The Handmaiden</a>, an erotic Korean period thriller. The free gallery includes an exhibition of vibrant art from post-Franco Spain and an exploration of the role of <a href=\"https://homemcr.org/exhibition/house-ghetto-black-pride/\">vogueing in gay black culture</a>.</p> <p>Wrigley admits to having been nervous when she and her team set an ambitious target of 550,000 visits for the first year. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153But we smashed that in six months and did just shy of a million,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd she says. And they kept coming: as Home approaches its second birthday, it is about to welcome its two-millionth visitor. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fascinating to me that you can open a venue of this kind and size and it can find its audience straight away in a difficult period,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Wrigley adds. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Of course, I would like to say it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s all about good artistic choices, but something else is going on.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd</p> <p>Wrigley is right. A series of studies is revealing strange things about our spending habits. They call it the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153experience economy\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, which gives it the sense of a grand theory. And there is science behind it, but it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also very simple: regardless of political uncertainty, austerity and inflation, we are spending more on doing stuff, choosing instead to cut back on buying stuff.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"95fc37ab44d69fb0596a4c347c545d577cd7a148\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/95fc37ab44d69fb0596a4c347c545d577cd7a148/0_40_640_384/500.jpg\" alt=\"The restaurant at Home, a new arts centre in Manchester.\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The restaurant at Home, a major new arts centre in Manchester.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The latest figures come from Barclaycard, which processes about half of all Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s credit and debit card transactions.

Meanwhile, department stores suffered a 1% drop, vehicle sales were down 11% and spending on household appliances fell by 2.5%.</p> <p>Barclaycard says the trend began to emerge about a year ago. And retailers are feeling it. In March, Simon Wolfson, chief executive of Next, blamed the clothing chain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/mar/23/next-price-rises-profits-fall-pound-brexit\">first fall in profits for eight years</a> on the move from buying things to doing things. More startlingly, Ikea, the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest furniture retailer, told a Guardian conference last year that consumption of many goods had reached a limit. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153If we look on a global basis, in the west <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jan/18/weve-hit-peak-home-furnishings-says-ikea-boss-consumerism\">we have probably hit peak stuff</a>,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Steve Howard, the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s head of sustainability.</p> <p>It would be easy to assume that contemporary influences are at work here. The world is a bit of a depressing place right now, so let\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s have a nice evening out rather than buy a sixth pair of shoes. But theories abound of a much broader shift. And Ikea is arguably late in calling \u00e2\u20ac\u0153peak stuff\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. In 2011, Chris Goodall, a British environment writer, used government data called the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s <a href=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/environmentalaccounts/datasets/ukenvironmentalaccountsmaterialflowsaccountunitedkingdom\">Material Flows Account</a> to track consumption of stuff, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/oct/31/consumption-of-goods-falling\">identified 2001 as a tipping point, long before the 2008 recession</a> and everything that followed. He believed we had <a href=\"http://static.squarespace.com/static/545e40d0e4b054a6f8622bc9/t/54720c6ae4b06f326a8502f9/1416760426697/Peak_Stuff_17.10.11.pdf\">\u00e2\u20ac\u0153decoupled\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd economic growth and material consumption</a>.</p> <p>And as we consume less, we are doing more. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153If you think about the 20th century, the big dominant value system was materialism, the belief that if we had more stuff we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d be happier,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd says James Wallman, a trend forecaster and the author of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/jan/07/stuffocation-living-more-with-less-james-wallman-review\">Stuffocation: Living More with Less</a>, in which he charts the move from possessions to experience. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The big change to what I call experientialism is more about finding happiness and status in experiences instead.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd</p> <p>The happiness bit perhaps stands to reason, but studies suggest the anticipation of an experience has a crucial, additional value. In a 2014 paper called <a href=\"http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0956797614546556\">Waiting for Merlot</a>, psychologists Amit Kumar, Thomas Gilovich and Matthew Killingsworth showed how people report being mostly frustrated before the planned purchase of a thing, but mostly happy before they bought an experience. That feeling lingers longer, too, tied up as it is with memory. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We call it hedonic adaptation,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd says Colin Strong, the head of behavioural science at Ipsos, the market research group. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153And the hedonic payoff of experiences is much greater.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd</p> <p>We are also less likely to compare experiential purchases than we are products, in a way that means we are all happy with what we buy, regardless of what we can afford. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153So if you have a Nissan and your neighbour has a Porsche, there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no doubt who has the better car, and if you ask the Nissan driver to swap, they will,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Wallman says. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153But if you ask people who went on holiday to the Seychelles or south Wales, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s clear who had the fancier holiday, but surveys show the person who went to Wales won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t swap because they had an equally good time.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd</p> <p>If the experience economy has a levelling effect, research also suggests that part of the reason for its rise is its greater potential as a status booster.<strong> </strong>This supports the idea, questioned by some (and not backed up by Barclaycard, which does not account for age), that younger people \u00e2\u20ac\u201c namely millennials \u00e2\u20ac\u201c are driving the consumer shift. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It used to be that our car, or handbag or wallet showed our status. Now we post Facebook pictures from a chairlift in Chamonix or the latest music festival,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Wallman says. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Social media is supporting this change. Posting pictures of what you just bought is gauche; posting pictures of something you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re doing is fine.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Strong also thinks the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153slightly impoverished nature of millennials\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd is compelling them to get out more.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f7c5e628b4e19fb8c0551a66f8989124da5300e1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f7c5e628b4e19fb8c0551a66f8989124da5300e1/0_62_4900_2940/1000.jpg\" alt=\"couple on beach at sunset\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u00e2\u20ac\u02dcIt used to be that our car or handbag showed our status.

                "bodyText":"It was an audacious plan for an unloved bit of Manchester. A \u00c2\u00a325m arts centre to be built on a derelict plot that had not felt a cultural pulse since the closure, 15 years earlier, of the legendary Ha\u00c3\u00a7ienda nightclub. It would be called Home, formed by the merger of two proud but financially imperilled institutions \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the Cornerhouse cinema and gallery, and the Library Theatre Company \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and would, its backers hoped, revive a forgotten corner on the city\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s southern edge. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153There was confidence from the city leadership that it would work, but a lot of my peers and colleagues in the arts were saying to me, \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcWho\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s going to go there?\u00e2\u20ac\u2122\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd says Sheena Wrigley, executive director of Home, which includes two theatres, five cinema screens, an art gallery and a restaurant and bar. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It was a very unprepossessing area with a big car park and one large office block. It wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t visible or on a main thoroughfare.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Programming would swim far from the mainstream, too. The centre opened in May 2015 with a challenging play about two thwarted lovers trying to survive a recession in a city like Manchester. This week the cinema is showing Lady Macbeth, a subversive Shakespearean noir, and The Handmaiden, an erotic Korean period thriller. The free gallery includes an exhibition of vibrant art from post-Franco Spain and an exploration of the role of vogueing in gay black culture. Wrigley admits to having been nervous when she and her team set an ambitious target of 550,000 visits for the first year. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153But we smashed that in six months and did just shy of a million,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd she says. And they kept coming: as Home approaches its second birthday, it is about to welcome its two-millionth visitor. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fascinating to me that you can open a venue of this kind and size and it can find its audience straight away in a difficult period,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Wrigley adds. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Of course, I would like to say it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s all about good artistic choices, but something else is going on.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Wrigley is right. A series of studies is revealing strange things about our spending habits. They call it the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153experience economy\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, which gives it the sense of a grand theory. And there is science behind it, but it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also very simple: regardless of political uncertainty, austerity and inflation, we are spending more on doing stuff, choosing instead to cut back on buying stuff. The latest figures come from Barclaycard, which processes about half of all Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s credit and debit card transactions. Figures for April show a 20% increase in spending in pubs compared with the same month last year. Spending in restaurants went up 16%, while theatres and cinemas enjoyed a 13% rise. Meanwhile, department stores suffered a 1% drop, vehicle sales were down 11% and spending on household appliances fell by 2.5%. Barclaycard says the trend began to emerge about a year ago. And retailers are feeling it. In March, Simon Wolfson, chief executive of Next, blamed the clothing chain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s first fall in profits for eight years on the move from buying things to doing things. More startlingly, Ikea, the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest furniture retailer, told a Guardian conference last year that consumption of many goods had reached a limit. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153If we look on a global basis, in the west we have probably hit peak stuff,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Steve Howard, the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s head of sustainability. It would be easy to assume that contemporary influences are at work here.

Rightwinger Feeney issued a statement on Facebook after a meeting with local activists, declaring the environmental costs of the Adani project \u00e2\u20ac\u0153too high\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Whether you look at it financially or environmentally, this project just doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t stack up,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Feeney said. He said the Turnbull government should not approve any subsidies to the project \u00e2\u20ac\u0153but, even without this funding, the cost of this project to our future when it comes to the environment and real action on climate change is too high\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Fellow Victorian Khalil, who represents the neighbouring electorate of Wills, has also issued a statement to local activists that points in the direction of outright opposition. The statement says the project should not go ahead \u00e2\u20ac\u0153if it doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t stack up commercially and environmentally\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153A billion dollars of taxpayers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 money should not be used to prop up this project,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd the statement says. The Tasmanian Labor senator Lisa Singh also departed from the official federal ALP position on Adani on Monday, telling Guardian Australia: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153If we are going to be serious about climate change, we should not be starting any new coalmines in this country. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I believe the Adani coalmine is a big mistake for this country. Our future, like India, has to be in renewables.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Singh said she understood the need for jobs in the regions \u00e2\u20ac\u0153but those jobs need to be long-term sustainable jobs\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. With an eye on the looming Queensland state election, and on several marginal seats in north Queensland with the potential to decide the next federal election, federal Labor has adopted a position that says the Adani mine can proceed on its merits but the project should not be given federal support. The Labor leader, Bill Shorten, has argued there is no point having a giant coalmine if you wreck the reef \u00e2\u20ac\u0153but, on the other hand, if the deal does stack up, if the science safeguards are there, if the experts are satisfied, then all well and good and there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be jobs created\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. The recent breakout by federal Labor MPs follows an intensifying civil society campaign against the project, which is applying pressure to a number of major party MPs in metropolitan areas. A government MP from Queensland, Michelle Landry, acknowledged the pressure being placed on her colleagues in the southern states in a contribution she made during the Coalition party room meeting this week. According to government sources, Landry told colleagues she understood the Adani project was causing grief for government MPs in the southern states but it was important for regional job creation. The Labor breakout also follows a split in the Queensland Labor government about whether the mine should get a royalties holiday. Shorten stepped around the Queensland fight when he spoke to reporters in Canberra on Wednesday. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m running for prime minister, not for premier,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said. Shorten said what the state government in Queensland chose to do on royalties for Adani was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153ultimately a matter for them\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. He reiterated Labor\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s statements that Adani should not be given taxpayer support. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We will not use a dollar of the commonwealth taxpayers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 money,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Shorten told reporters. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153If the Adani mine is a commercial success, then it doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t need the taxpayers to underwrite a $1bn loan for a multibillion-dollar coal company.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd",

                "bodyText":"Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock markets have closed for the night, with the main indices losing ground. The FTSE 100 and German DAX both fell by around 0.25%, while France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s CAC shed 0.5%. Worries over Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bailout haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t faded, despite Alexis Tsipras hitting the phones in an attempt to reach a political solution with Angela Merkel and Emmanuel Macron. Bild\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s report that Greece might simply decline its next bailout loan, triggering a new debt repayment crisis this summer, has alarmed some traders - even though it has been robustly denied by Athens today. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a reminder that Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s debt crisis hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t gone away, with no sign of a serious debt relief deal. Predictions of an early general election in Italy has also given investors some concerns. Jasper Lawler of London Capital Group explains: Talk that Italy will spice up Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s political landscape again with its own snap election is unsettling the idea that Europe is now free of populist risk in 2017. Former Italian Prime Minister Renzi has suggested Italy could hold simultaneous elections with Germany in September. Not to be left out, Greece may opt out of its next bailout if debt relief deal isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t struck, adding to the potential for market disruption. European assets need the three pillars of stronger economic data, higher political risk in the US and reduced political risk in Europe to outperform. Italy and Greece could are holding the sledgehammer that could knock down one of those three pillars. On Wall Street, the Dow Jones is down 0.2% following the drop in US consumer confidence this month. But Amazon\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s burst over the $1,000/share mark has pushed the Nasdaq a little higher. Chris Beauchamp of IG says the tech stock boom has further to run. Momentum traders clearly still think that the likes of Facebook and Amazon can go higher, however, with the Nasdaq 100 having gained almost a fifth so far this year. Amazon has surpassed the $1000 mark this afternoon, an event that would mark the top in the market perfectly, but one that probably won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t. There seems to be no shortage of investors willing to jump on board this bandwagon. After an early wobble, the pound is higher tonight after a new poll gave Theresa May a 12-point lead ahead of next week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s election. Traders are also digesting an interesting research note from JP Morgan, which suggests that a hung parliament could actually be good for sterling. Strategist Paul Meggyesi argued that a centre-left coalition could be welcomed by the City, if it would aim for a softer Brexit. As he put it: In the post-referendum world, all political developments need to be viewed through a Brexit prism and an argument can be made that a hung parliament which delivered or held out the prospect of a softer-Brexit coalition of the left-of-centre parties (Labour/Lib Dems/SNP) might actually be sterling positive.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd And on that note, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time to wrap up. Thanks for reading and commenting. GW Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s some reaction to the US consumer confidence report, from Patrick Chovanec, chief Strategist at Silvercrest Asset Management. Just in: US consumer confidence has fallen, raising concerns that the Trump Bump may be fading. The monthly measure of consumer morale, from the Confidence Board, fell to 117.9 from 120.3 in April. The survey found that consumers are less optimistic about future economic prospects, but also a little happier about the current conditions. Analysts at Danske Bank say it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a sign that confidence may have peaked: But....Michael Pearce of Capital Economics says it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u0153nothing to be worried about\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. He points out that consumer confidence is still high by historical standards, suggesting the economy is in decent health. The index is still consistent on past form with consumption growth rising to over 4% annualised in the second quarter. Meanwhile, the current conditions index edged up in May, and is close to a 16-year high. The details of the survey highlight that labour market conditions remain exceptionally tight. The balance of consumers reporting that jobs are easy to find remains high, and is consistent with the unemployment rate falling below 4% in the months ahead. Meanwhile, the net balance expecting their incomes to rise points to wage growth accelerating to around 3% annualised by the end of the year. Amazon has just smashed another stock market landmark, as its surging rally continues. Shares in the e-commerce, web streaming and cloud computing giant have just hit $1,000 for the first time ever. Astonishingly, Amazon\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shares have gained around 33% since the start of 2017 -- helping to drive the Nasdaq to a series of record highs. Shares have dipped on Wall Street at the start of trading, as the New York stock market follows Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s lead. Energy companies are under some pressure, after Goldman cut its oil price forecasts. It now expects Brent crude to average $55.39 per barrel this year, down from a previous estimate of $56.76/barrel. The Greek prime minister\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s office is reporting that Alexis Tsipras has hit the phones in calls aimed squarely at putting across Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s desire for some sort of debt agreement at the next euro group meeting on June 15. The prime minister Alexis Tsipras spoke yesterday with the German chancellor Angela Merkel and the French president Emmanuel Macron, and just a little while earlier he had a telephone discussion with European Council president Donald Tusk. A statement released from Tsipras\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s office says: The prime minister conveyed the position of the Greek side of the need for a clear solution to the issue of Greek debt and everyone agreed they would continue to work ahead of the euro group on 15 June.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd When the going has got tough, Tsipras has often tried in the past to bypass creditor institutions by seeking a political solution at prime ministerial level ..... Newsflash: US house prices are rising at their fastest pace in almost three years. Prices across 20 key US cities jumped by 5.9% year-on-year in March, with low supply helping to keep prices buoyant. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s according to the S&amp;P/ Case-Shiller index, which also found that overall prices rose by 5.8%. Associated Press adds: Home values are increasing at more than double the pace of average hourly earnings, making it more difficult for many people to afford to buy a home. A steady job market has bulked up demand among many would-be buyers, but there are fewer properties on the market. Sales listings have plummeted 9 percent over the past year to 1.93 million, according to the National Association of Realtors. Back in Athens, a government official has told my colleague Helena Smith that Greece \u00e2\u20ac\u0153is not threatening anyone\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd over its bailout deadlock.

We have good news for German shoppers -- inflation in the eurozone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest economy has hit a five month low. Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Consumer Price Index rose by just 1.4% in May, sharply down from 2.0% in April. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a bigger fall than expected, and means the cost of living is rising by less than the European Central Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s target of just below 2%. This takes some of the pressure off the ECB to start unwinding its stimulus programme, says ING\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Carsten Brzeski. The FT\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Mehreen Khan points out that German\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy is enjoying a purple patch, with unemployment low and inflation so modest. Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s finance minister has hit back at claims that Athens might waive its next bailout payment, a move which would trigger a new summer debt crisis. Euclid Tsakalotos told Reuters that Bild, the German tabloid, had misinterpreted his call on Monday for Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s creditors to reach a deal next month or risk a new economic crisis. Tsakalotos insisted that Athens is not considering waiving the \u00e2\u201a\u00ac7bn loan which is due....over once all sides are happy about Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economic reforms, and have agreed a debt relief strategy. But Tsakalotos also stuck to his guns on debt relief, saying his government can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t support a deal that doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t tackle this issue. He said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Bild has distorted what I said yesterday. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153What I did say is that the disbursement (of bailout money) was not an issue, because all sides agreed that we have kept to our commitment. But the Greek government feels that a disbursement without clarity on debt is not enough to turn the Greek economy around.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd In the roundabout world of Greek bailouts, Athens needs to persuade its creditors to hand over this \u00e2\u201a\u00ac7bn aid tranche in June, so that it can hand it straight back to its lenders in July when various bonds mature. So if it were to \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcwaive\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 this loan, it would find itself in a very sticky situation this summer.... The threat of a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153coalition of chaos\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd has been a major factor in Theresa May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s election campaign, as she urges voters to trust her to negotiate Brexit. But JP Morgan have argued that a centre-left alliance could actually be positive for the pound, if it steered Britain towards a softer exit from the EU. In a new research note, strategist Paul Meggyesi estimates that there is an 86% chance of a Tory majority, despite the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153almost continuous decline\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in the party\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s lead over Labour since the election was called. Meggyesi also believes that sterling wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t necessarily crash if May suffered a shock rejection at the ballot box. Instead, the pound could actually rally if Jeremy Corbyn, Tim Farron and Nicola Sturgeon hammered out a coalition. Meggyesi says: A hung parliament would in more normal circumstances be viewed as quite negative for the British pound [GBP] \u00e2\u20ac\u201c that was very much the experience of the 2015 election when GBP was braced for one of a myriad of potential coalition permutations only for GBP to jump by 3% once David Cameron secured an improbable narrow majority. But in the post-referendum world, all political developments need to be viewed through a Brexit prism and an argument can be made that a hung parliament which delivered or held out the prospect of a softer-Brexit coalition of the left-of-centre parties (Labour/Lib Dems/SNP) might actually be GBP positive. FX investors might not exactly embrace various aspects of the Labour party\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s domestic policy agenda (the renationalisation of certain sectors, a large fiscal expansion), but they could potentially live with these as the price of a less disruptive Brexit under a government that was more willing to preserve the status quo on free movement of labour and trade (the Lib Dems have also committed to holding a second referendum on the final terms of a Brexit deal) Eurozone economic confidence remains close to its highest level since the financial crisis, new figures show, despite a dip this month. The European Commission\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s eurozone economic sentiment index fell to 109.2 in May, down from 109.7 in April, dragged down by a drop in service sector confidence Economists had expected it to rise to a new 10-year high of 110. But more encouragingly, confidence within the manufacturing industry rose, from 2.6 to 2.8. Investors are blaming Mario Draghi, head of the European Central Bank, for the euro\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s weakness this morning. Draghi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s dovish appearance before the European Parliament yesterday are dragging on the single currency, despite the better economic news from France today. Paresh Davdra, CEO of RationalFX, cites Draghi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s reluctance to unwind the ECB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stimulus programme: The euro has seen a difficult start to the week as it was hurt by fears over Greek debt, the prospect of an early Italian election and comments from ECB President Mario Draghi suggesting continued monetary support for the Eurozone. It is Draghi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s comments in particular that have led the currency to slip, as increasing signs of economic recovery including positive data releases have led to analysts hoping that the ECB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s dovish policies may be narrowed down. After Macron helped the shared currency to rally, investors would have been hoping for the euro\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s good fortunes to continue. Just as it is with the pound, political uncertainty has made the euro volatile, and analysts will be hoping that more stability lies ahead for the euro as events continue to develop.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Sweden\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy had a disappointing start to this year, new GDP figures show. The Swedish economy grew by 0.4% in January-March, down from 0.7% in Q4 2016, and only half as fast as expected. More here. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s some reaction to this morning\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s upbeat French economic data: New inflation figures how that consumer prices across Germany rose at a slower rate this month: We get the overall German inflation report at 1pm BST. And a low reading will strengthen the European Central Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s determination not to end its monetary stimulus programme too soon. European stock markets have fallen in early trading, putting them on track for their fourth day of losses. Worries over Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bailout, a possible early Italian general election, and Mario Draghi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s cautious comments about the eurozone recovery are all weighing on shares. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE has lost 0.5%, partly thanks to IAG\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 4% slide. Mining stocks and banks are also losing ground: Connor Campbell of SpreadEx says: The FTSE was one of the worst performers after the bell, plunging more than half a percent to lurk just above 7500. A 1% drop from copper \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the metal is now at its worst price in a week and a half \u00e2\u20ac\u201c weighed on the index\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s mining stocks, while the ongoing British Airway\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chaos is hurting its parent IAG, which fell 3.5% as the session got underway. The UK banks were also all in the red, taking their cue from their Italian counterparts, which plunged on early election fears. This morning\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s selloff has wiped around \u00c2\u00a3500m off IAG\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s market capitalisation. Shares in British Airways\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 parent company have slumped to the bottom of the London stock market this morning, after a long weekend of disruption. International Airlines Group\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shares fell by 4% at the start of trading, as investors try to calculate the cost of the IT problems that disrupted hundred of flights. BA cancelled all its flights from Heathrow and Gatwick (London\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s two largest airports) on Saturday, and there were further delays on Sunday as the airline battled to recover the situation. Experts reckon the compensation bill could hit \u00c2\u00a3100m, but the long-term impact of the crisis is hard to assess. BA blamed a power supply outage, and denied that a cyberattack was to blame. But unions pointed out that BA has made hundreds of IT staff redundant recently. Kathleen Brooks, research director at City Index, believes BA\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s reputation could be significantly damaged by the crisis: Even if you give BA the benefit of the doubt it still looks bad, if their systems are not strong enough to withstand a power surge, then this sort of thing could happen again, which could add downward pressure to the IAG stock price. Although cost cutting has been good for the share price in the last year, it will come back to bite IAG if it stops them from doing what they are supposed to do: fly passengers to their destinations. Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s government has scrambled to deny Bilt\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s report that it might default on its next debt repayment in July. Reuters has the details: A Greek government spokesman denied a German newspaper report on Tuesday that it was considering opting out of a loan repayment in July if lenders could not agree on debt relief. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It is not true,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd government spokesman Dimitris Tzanakopoulos told Reuters. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153There will be a solution on June 15.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Newsflash: France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy is growing faster than first estimated. Statistics body INSEE has reported that French GDP expanded by 0.4% in January-March, up from the 0.3% first estimated. That means France grew twice as fast as the UK in the first three months of this year. And in another boost for new president Emmanuel Macron, French consumer confidence is now rising at its fastest rate in a decade. INSEE\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s index of consumer morale has jumped to 102 in May, up from 100 in April, wth households saying they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re more optimistic about the economic situation. Growing concerns over Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bailout programme are weighing on the euro this morning. The European single currency has shed almost 0.5% to $1.113, on concerns that Athens and its creditors may not reach an agreement over its bailout programme in time. Overnight, finance minister Euclid Tsakalotos warned that Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s delicate recovery would be derailed if eurozone finance ministers didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t agree to release its next loan in June. Tsakalotos told journalists in Athens that Greece deserves to be given the debt relief promised by its lenders, if it stuck to its austerity programme. He said it is now vital that a real is reached on June 15, adding: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t accept a deal which is not what was on the table. What was on the table was if Greece carried out its reform package then creditors would ensure that there would be a clear runway through clarity for debt.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Greece had hoped to receive its latest bailout payment this month, but eurozone ministers couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t reach an agreement with the International Monetary Fund. Athens faces \u00e2\u201a\u00ac7bn of debt repayments this summer, so there is concern that the eurozone debt crisis could flare up again soon. Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Bilt newspaper is claiming this morning that it might \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcskip\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 its next bailout payment, if a deal on debt relief hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t been reached. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s added to the anxiety this morning: The euro is also suffering from worries over Italy, where former prime minister Matteo Renzi is pushing for early elections - perhaps in September. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. The pound is dipping in early trading today as anxiety over next month\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s general election continues to build. Sterling is down 0.2% this morning at $1.281, after a new opinion poll showed that the Conservatives have a lead of just six percentage points over Labour. After a similarly tight YouGov poll last week, City investors are less confident Last night, prime minister Theresa May and Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn both faced off against veteran political journalist Jeremy Paxman. Both sides are (predictably) claiming victory, after a robust (but not desperately enlightening) encounter that saw Corbyn deny being a dictator, and May accused of being \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a blowhard who collapses at the first sign of gunfire\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. The London stock market is expected to drop a little when trading resumes after the Bank Holiday weekend, having hit a record high on Friday night. We also get a raft of new eurozone economic data this morning, that may show if the European recovery is on track. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the agenda: 7.45am: The second estimate of French GDP for Q1 2017 is released. 10am: Eurozone economic confidence figures for May are published; economists expect another strong reading 1pm: German inflation figures for May are published, and may show that the CPI rate fell to 1.6%, from 2% in April 2pm: The S&amp;P/Case Shiller index of US house prices is released 3pm: US consumer confidence figures for May",

I consider that I have been lucky in life at least twice,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said. </p> <p>\u00e2\u20ac\u0153I inherited some wealth from my father, a self-made Greek-Cypriot shipping magnate, and then I was lucky enough to have been at the right place at the right time to start a business that did much better than I ever could have hoped.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd</p> <p>Haji-Ioannou was 28 years old when he founded easyJet in 1995, leasing two Boeing 737-200 aircraft in a bid to create a low-cost rival to traditional flag-carrier airlines such as British Airways. The business has since grown to become the second-largest carrier in Europe behind Ryanair in passenger numbers.

                "bodyText":"The easyJet founder, Sir Stelios Haji-Ioannou, has promised to give more than half of his \u00c2\u00a32bn fortune to charity after he was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153inspired\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd by the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s richest man, the Microsoft billionaire and philanthropist Bill Gates. Haji-Ioannou said he had signed up to the Giving Pledge, an organisation founded by Gates and fellow billionaire Warren Buffett, which asks the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s wealthiest people to give away the majority of their money. The Cypriot-born magnate, who has stamped his orange-hued \u00e2\u20ac\u0153easy\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd brand on everything from aeroplanes to cut-price convenience stores, was estimated to be worth \u00c2\u00a31.95bn in the latest Sunday Times rich list. He is expected to give away about \u00c2\u00a31bn of that, some of it in cash during his lifetime and the remainder by selling assets through the terms of his will. Haji-Ioannou joins a host of billionaires who have made the pledge, whose British contingent includes the Virgin Group founder, Sir Richard Branson, Ann Gloag, the transport group Stagecoach\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s co-founder, and Lord Sainsbury, whose family started the supermarket chain. In a letter accompanying his pledge, Haji-Ioannou said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Allow me to start by saying that I am not sure I am a worthy member of this group of extraordinary individuals. I consider that I have been lucky in life at least twice,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I inherited some wealth from my father, a self-made Greek-Cypriot shipping magnate, and then I was lucky enough to have been at the right place at the right time to start a business that did much better than I ever could have hoped.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Haji-Ioannou was 28 years old when he founded easyJet in 1995, leasing two Boeing 737-200 aircraft in a bid to create a low-cost rival to traditional flag-carrier airlines such as British Airways. The business has since grown to become the second-largest carrier in Europe behind Ryanair in passenger numbers. He is no longer involved in the day-to-day running of the business, but a large portion of his wealth is made up of a 34% stake in easyJet that he shares with family members, which is worth about \u00c2\u00a31.9bn. Haji-Ioannou said the no-frills airline was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153nothing special\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in comparison with the business empires of some of the Giving Pledge\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s other members, who include the Facebook co-founder Mark Zuckerberg and Elon Musk, the futurist and chief executive of electric car firm Tesla. Haji-Ioannou, who turned 50 this year, said he would channel his wealth through his philanthropic foundation, which funds projects in places where he has lived and worked. These include scholarships to the London School of Economics and City University and annual donations to the Red Cross and World Wildlife Fund. Other charitable projects include food donations in Greece and projects to reconcile differences between Greek-Cypriots and Turkish-Cypriots in the country of his birth. He also funds unspecified projects in the tax haven of Monaco, where he lives. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I guess my belief is that nobody has a monopoly on good charitable ideas and the problems in our world will never all go away,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153So we have to keep helping, within our means, forever.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd He added that he had been \u00e2\u20ac\u0153inspired\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd by a phone call from Gates, the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s richest man with an estimated fortune of $88.5bn (\u00c2\u00a369bn). While Haji-Ioannou became one of Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s wealthiest people thanks to easyJet, some of his other \u00e2\u20ac\u0153easy\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd ventures have proved more difficult. While easyCar and easyHotel are still going, he enjoyed less success applying the brand to other ventures such as easyCinema, easy4Men, easyMoney, easyInternetCafe, easyMusic, easyPizza and easyCruise. Last year, he applied the name to easyFoodstore, a budget convenience store on London\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s busy North Circular road, where everything was initially priced at 25p.",
