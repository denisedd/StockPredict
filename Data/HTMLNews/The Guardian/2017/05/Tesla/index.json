We\u2019ve waited years to hear again from Fred Goodwin and Sir Tom McKillop, chief executive and chairman of the bank when it sank in 2008. Now the board wants to kill the legal case that could see the duo, plus two other former directors, cross-examined in court.</p> <p>RBS\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/may/22/rbs-in-11th-hour-bid-to-avert-court-case-over-2008-cash-call\">attempt to settle with the 9,000 shareholders</a> who claim they were misled into backing the \u00a312bn rights issue in 2008 is not a great surprise. Chief executive Ross McEwan seems sick of a case that reminds the outside world of the state-backed bailout that happened six months after the rights issue was launched in April 2008.</p> <p>One can also sympathise with McEwan\u2019s sense of priorities. Four other shareholders groups settled before they got close to the courtroom. From where McEwan sits, the argument with the hold-outs can indeed be seen as a time-consuming distraction. The sums at stake are significant but they are a trifle compared to the multibillion-dollar territory that RBS will enter when it starts negotiations with the US Department of Justice over mortgage-backed securities that were allegedly mis-sold before the crisis.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/may/22/rbs-in-11th-hour-bid-to-avert-court-case-over-2008-cash-call\">RBS offers \u00a3200m to avert court case brought by 9,000 investors</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Yet, for all that, one hopes the 9,000 shareholders refuse RBS\u2019s improved offer and take their case to court. That is not, actually, because Goodwin and co might provide lively entertainment. In all likelihood, the case would be dominated by dense technical points related directly to the content of the rights issue document.</p> <p>But the exercise might still provide valuable insight into the biggest failure in British banking history. The period in question includes the critical months between the failure of Bear Stearns in March 2008 and the full disaster that arrived with the collapse of Lehman Brothers in September of that year. How seriously did the board contemplate the possibility that funding conditions could get much, much worse? And how credible was the assessment of the quality of assets that RBS had acquired the previous year with its acquisition of ABN Amro?</p> <p>A cross-examination of the key individuals by a QC might reveal more than the colourless official report on the failure of RBS by the Financial Services Authority in 2011. That document, which concluded that no enforcement action could be taken against individuals at RBS, was fine as far it went. But it lacked the authentic voice of the individuals at the heart of action. The litigants don\u2019t owe future historians anything \u2013 but they\u2019d be doing them a favour by going ahead. </p> <h2>Will Ford\u2019s management shakeup recharge its performance? </h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8197f21a2d8d1f9b18d28f96769fdce34bab9e85\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8197f21a2d8d1f9b18d28f96769fdce34bab9e85/0_0_3500_2359/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ford and Lincoln vehicles parked outside the Oakville assembly plant in Ontario, Canada.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"674\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ford and Lincoln vehicles parked outside the Oakville assembly plant in Ontario, Canada.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Chris Helgren/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>If you\u2019re Ford and your market capitalisation has fallen below that of the electric upstart Tesla, you\u2019re probably right to worry about investors\u2019 implied judgment that your business model is vulnerable to technological innovation. So here\u2019s the company\u2019s big idea: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/may/22/ford-sack-ceo-senior-bosses-push-build-self-driving-cars\">kick out Mark Fields as chief executive and appoint the executive who has been running the part of the company responsible for Ford\u2019s investment in electric and autonomous vehicles</a>.<br></p> <p>Chairman Bill Ford\u2019s promotion of Jim Hackett sounds logical on paper and, it might be said, Fields cannot complain about being ejected. The company\u2019s share price has fallen by a third during his three years in charge and GM is doing better in the production of conventional cars. The temptation for Ford\u2019s board to do something dramatic will have been great.</p> <p>Even so, this appointment looks odd. Hackett previously spent 30 years in the office furniture business at a company called Steelcase and has been running Ford\u2019s mobility division for less than a year, which is too soon to tell if the investments in exciting new ventures will pay off or are merely exciting in the sense of being expensive.</p> <p>Ford described Hackett as \u201ca true visionary who brings a unique, human-centred leadership approach\u201d. Maybe, but what was his big vision at Steelcase? \u201cHackett is recognised for predicting that the office landscape would shift away from cubicles to an open space environment,\u201d says Ford\u2019s biography of the new boss.</p> <p>Anticipating the rise of the open-plan office was, no doubt, vital in office furniture game. But it\u2019s not obviously a qualification for running a car company with 200,000 employees. We\u2019ll judge Hackett only once he\u2019s got to work \u2013 but one suspects Tesla founder Elon Musk\u2019s status as the top visionary in the car industry is not under immediate threat.</p> <h2>LSE chief adds voice to Brexit roar</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"39ac0f98fd2e34203d8505344437732e4ffccaf9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/39ac0f98fd2e34203d8505344437732e4ffccaf9/0_0_3132_1879/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Xavier Rolet, chief executive of the London Stock Exchange.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Xavier Rolet, chief executive of the London Stock Exchange.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Carl de Souza/AFP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Xavier Rolet should keep shouting. The chief executive of London Stock Exchange thinks costs to investors could increase by \u20ac100bn (\u00a386bn) over five years if the European Union, after Brexit, insists on moving large chunks of clearing activity to its own patch. </p> <p>Clearing, in this context, means the settlement of financial transactions. It\u2019s dull work (except when it goes wrong) and it is conducted on thin margins that are achieved by concentrating activity in one place.

                "bodyText":"What spoilsports they are at Royal Bank of Scotland. We\u2019ve waited years to hear again from Fred Goodwin and Sir Tom McKillop, chief executive and chairman of the bank when it sank in 2008. Now the board wants to kill the legal case that could see the duo, plus two other former directors, cross-examined in court. RBS\u2019s attempt to settle with the 9,000 shareholders who claim they were misled into backing the \u00a312bn rights issue in 2008 is not a great surprise. Chief executive Ross McEwan seems sick of a case that reminds the outside world of the state-backed bailout that happened six months after the rights issue was launched in April 2008. One can also sympathise with McEwan\u2019s sense of priorities. Four other shareholders groups settled before they got close to the courtroom. From where McEwan sits, the argument with the hold-outs can indeed be seen as a time-consuming distraction. The sums at stake are significant but they are a trifle compared to the multibillion-dollar territory that RBS will enter when it starts negotiations with the US Department of Justice over mortgage-backed securities that were allegedly mis-sold before the crisis. Yet, for all that, one hopes the 9,000 shareholders refuse RBS\u2019s improved offer and take their case to court. That is not, actually, because Goodwin and co might provide lively entertainment. In all likelihood, the case would be dominated by dense technical points related directly to the content of the rights issue document. But the exercise might still provide valuable insight into the biggest failure in British banking history. The period in question includes the critical months between the failure of Bear Stearns in March 2008 and the full disaster that arrived with the collapse of Lehman Brothers in September of that year. How seriously did the board contemplate the possibility that funding conditions could get much, much worse? And how credible was the assessment of the quality of assets that RBS had acquired the previous year with its acquisition of ABN Amro? A cross-examination of the key individuals by a QC might reveal more than the colourless official report on the failure of RBS by the Financial Services Authority in 2011. That document, which concluded that no enforcement action could be taken against individuals at RBS, was fine as far it went. But it lacked the authentic voice of the individuals at the heart of action. The litigants don\u2019t owe future historians anything \u2013 but they\u2019d be doing them a favour by going ahead. Will Ford\u2019s management shakeup recharge its performance? If you\u2019re Ford and your market capitalisation has fallen below that of the electric upstart Tesla, you\u2019re probably right to worry about investors\u2019 implied judgment that your business model is vulnerable to technological innovation. So here\u2019s the company\u2019s big idea: kick out Mark Fields as chief executive and appoint the executive who has been running the part of the company responsible for Ford\u2019s investment in electric and autonomous vehicles. Chairman Bill Ford\u2019s promotion of Jim Hackett sounds logical on paper and, it might be said, Fields cannot complain about being ejected. The company\u2019s share price has fallen by a third during his three years in charge and GM is doing better in the production of conventional cars. The temptation for Ford\u2019s board to do something dramatic will have been great. Even so, this appointment looks odd. Hackett previously spent 30 years in the office furniture business at a company called Steelcase and has been running Ford\u2019s mobility division for less than a year, which is too soon to tell if the investments in exciting new ventures will pay off or are merely exciting in the sense of being expensive. Ford described Hackett as \u201ca true visionary who brings a unique, human-centred leadership approach\u201d. Maybe, but what was his big vision at Steelcase? \u201cHackett is recognised for predicting that the office landscape would shift away from cubicles to an open space environment,\u201d says Ford\u2019s biography of the new boss. Anticipating the rise of the open-plan office was, no doubt, vital in office furniture game. But it\u2019s not obviously a qualification for running a car company with 200,000 employees. We\u2019ll judge Hackett only once he\u2019s got to work \u2013 but one suspects Tesla founder Elon Musk\u2019s status as the top visionary in the car industry is not under immediate threat. LSE chief adds voice to Brexit roar Xavier Rolet should keep shouting. The chief executive of London Stock Exchange thinks costs to investors could increase by \u20ac100bn (\u00a386bn) over five years if the European Union, after Brexit, insists on moving large chunks of clearing activity to its own patch. Clearing, in this context, means the settlement of financial transactions. It\u2019s dull work (except when it goes wrong) and it is conducted on thin margins that are achieved by concentrating activity in one place. Split it all up and costs will undoubtedly increase. A \u20ac100bn estimate should be enough to get the attention of even hardliners in Brussels. Rolet \u2013 a Frenchman, usefully \u2013 should be dispatched to give a breakdown in as much detail as he can manage.",
