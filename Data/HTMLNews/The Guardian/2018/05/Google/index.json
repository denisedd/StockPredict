Why did it fail? Did TSB perform thorough testing prior to flicking the switch on the migration of user accounts? Why did the testing not uncover the issues? How thorough can it have been, given issues became apparent almost immediately?<br></li> <li><strong>Was there a back-up? </strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2015/mar/20/how-will-the-takeover-of-tsb-affect-me\">Sabadell\u2019s takeover of TSB</a> was predicated almost entirely on the \u00a3100m savings to be made from cutting TSB free from the \u00a3214m-a-year bill it had to pay Lloyds for continuing to run the bank\u2019s accounts. Was it rushed through, without sufficient back-up? Why was the old system not still in place to mitigate customer troubles when it was clear Proteo4UK, the name given to the new platform, was not up to the task? <br></li> <li><strong>Why were customers misinformed? </strong>The transition was scheduled from Friday evening to Sunday evening. When <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/apr/23/tsb-online-banking-failure-prompts-complaints\">failures began appearing</a>, almost immediately afterwards, TSB initially said the problems were only \u201cintermittent\u201d.

But will they receive compensation only if they complain? Will the bankcontact customers? And what does it expect the compensation bill to be?</li> <li><strong>Did regulation work? </strong>MPs will want to know the extent to which the giant transfer of 1.3bn records was supervised by regulators such as the Financial Conduct Authority, and what it says about the robustness of Britain\u2019s banking infrastructure.

                "bodyText":"Any ambitious junior bank executives out there should watch that hearing again closely, as an example of how not to handle a select committee. In happier times, Paul Pester would challenge his staff to \u2018beat the boss\u2019 in triathlons. But today, the TSB CEO found himself on the wrong end of a beating from MPs. There\u2019s clearly a massive disconnect between TSB\u2019s view of its IT crisis, and the view which MPs hear from constituents who have been unable to get a decent banking service (or ANY, in some cases) for 12 days and counting. Although Pester did remember to apologise a few times (an essential shield on these occasions), it looked less-than-fully sincere when he then argued that many things were actually running smoothly. The correct response to being told that two of the committee\u2019s own staff can\u2019t log into TSB is NOT to joke about having so many customers. It looks arrogant, when contrition is required. No wonder Nicky Morgan accused Pester of simply not understanding the size of his mess, and the reputational damage to TSB and beyond, saying: What we are hearing this afternoon is the most staggering example of a chief executive who seems unwilling to realise the scale of the problem that is being faced. That could yet be his epitaph, if TSB can\u2019t get systems working properly, fast, and satisfy the 40,000 complaints filed in the last 12 days. Pester also failed to answer some predictable questions. For example: He couldn\u2019t say when the crisis will be over He didn\u2019t know exactly how many small firms have been hit He wouldn\u2019t say how large the compensation bill could be Pester has, finally, had the nous to give up any bonus for this IT migration - but this may be an empty gesture, as the board may well have decided that he\u2019d not earned it anyway. He could still get a bonus for his wider work (although not for today\u2019s performance, I suggest). MPs may have had some sympathy when Pester said how much he regretted the \u201cterrible\u201d decision to press on with the migration. But alas, Doc Brown wasn\u2019t waiting outside Portcullis House with a DeLorean - and with Pester\u2019s recent form, it might have stalled anyway. And on that note, we\u2019re wrapping up for the day. Thanks for reading and commenting. GW A TSB customer, Penny Simpson, isn\u2019t impressed by Pester\u2019s performance: Pester is in another world. He is producing sheets of data that tell him 95% of his customers can log on. WE CANNOT LOG ON and we have not been able to for 11 days. Is he in denial or just telling lies? Please media, help us. He is just telling people to contact him if they have problems. How? You cannot get through on the phone, you cannot log on. Nicky Morgan wraps up the session by telling TSB that the committee expects customers to be properly compensated -- including finding a replacement car for Simon Clarke\u2019s constituent. She also declares that the committee expects to see the full Slaughter and May report into what went wrong. Meddings politely protests, saying the committee can certainly see the key findings, but might not be allowed to see any commercially sensitive information. Morgan says the committee would like to see the full report...and early information on the compensation scheme. And she concludes with a fairly damning assessment of the situation at TSB: At the end of the day, this is a bank for whom many customers feel you are not saying \u201cyes\u201d...but making it as difficult as possible to get hold of the money to pay bills and putting them in an impossible financial situation. That\u2019s the end of the session. Q: With hindsight, would you do the migration again? CEO Paul Pester says he would not! If I had a time machine, I would take myself back to one minute before one o\u2019clock in the afternoon and change the decision. If there was one decision in my life I could change, it\u2019s the decision to go ahead with the migration on 1pm on Sunday afternoon Clearly it was \u201ca terrible decision\u201d for our bank, for our customers, and me personally, Pester explains ruefully. Of course I would change it. Chairman Richard Meddings concurs - but also insists that TSB didn\u2019t have any idea that the migration would go so badly. If it had seen any hint of the problems, it wouldn\u2019t have pressed on. Paul Pester can\u2019t say how many people have left TSB since the crisis began. And the committee\u2019s obvious amazement, Paul Pester thinks TSB can still win new customers in the weeks and months ahead. Nicky Morgan picks her jaw off the floor, and lashes Pester for simply not understanding the impact of this crisis: Do you recognise the reputational damage that this has caused, not just to TSB but to online banking generally? The UK needs TSB to be a challenger to the big five banks, Pester insists. Your customers need TSB to provide a good banking service, Morgan shoots back. Pester tried to pay tribute to TSB\u2019s thousands of hard working staff, saying he\u2019s confidence that his \u2018partners\u2019 can persuade customers to move to TSB in the future. Those partners have been badly let down by senior management, Morgan retorts. Quite. Pester says customers should use TSB\u2019s online complaint form to get in touch, rather than trying to phone or using social media to report problems. Everyone enjoys tweeting, but it is \u2018shouting into the void\u2019, TSB\u2019s CEO adds. Nicky Morgan won\u2019t stand for this, pointing out that TSB\u2019s own Twitter account says people should phone. They can phone if they prefer, Pester replies. After 90 minutes of evidence, Morgan has heard enough - and lays into Pester: What we are hearing this afternoon is the most staggering example of a chief executive who seems unwilling to realise the scale of the problem that is being faced. Saying that social media is \u2018shouting into the void\u2019 doesn\u2019t show much inclination to being a truly digital online presence, she adds firmly. Simon Clarke MP brings up the case of a third constituent, whose business is threatened because he can\u2019t access his banking services. Pester sounds concerned, but he is also insistent that most of TSB\u2019s services are working well. Millions of customers are using their bank cards every day, he says. There\u2019s clearly a disconnect here -- MPs (and the media) are hearing from people in a real fix, but TSB thinks problems are intermittent. Q: What is the quantum of the compensation bill? Pester sways away from this one, playing the \u201cwe\u2019ve been so focused fixing the problems that we haven\u2019t calculated it\u201d card. Conservative Simon Clarke MP now challenges Pester, citing the case of a constituent called Kerry. She has been stuck on telephone lines, paying 50p per minute. She relies on pensions credit, and is at her \u201cwits end\u201d with her gas about to be cut off. Q: who should she contact to resolve this today? Pester apologises to Kerry, and says that TSB wants to deal with complaints. Again, he encourages customers to get in touch with their problems. He also reveals that the bank is using \u2018artificial intelligence\u2019 to find vulnerable customers. (I\u2019m glad to see there\u2019s some intelligence involved in this mess). Clarke then cites another customer - Alison Wickes, who lost a non-returnable deposit on a car because she couldn\u2019t get the money to buy it out of TSB, and the dealer sold it to someone else. More reaction from irate customers.... ...and unimpressed journalists: Q: Has this shambles, or meltdown, put customers at risk of fraud? Based on experience, we know that fraudsters will be following the news, following social media and will take any opportunity to take advantage, Pester replies. That\u2019s why TSB wrote to customers this week warning them to be careful. Q: Will there be any legal action over this mess? Sabadell\u2019s Miquel Montes says not. But....TSB\u2019s chairman is more circumspect. Richard Meddings says it all depends on Slaughter and May\u2019s independent review: Q: When will this shambles be over, asks John Mann Meddings says TSB is seeing \u201cimprovement\u201d on its online services, and across its other channels. But it\u2019s still not good enough\u201d. The wrong thing to do would be to set a date, Meddings claims -- but \u201cwe are working as hard and as fast as we can\u201d. Q: Can you do better, Mr Pester? I can\u2019t give a fixed date, Pester replies. If I give one it\u2019s likely to be unfair to customers, he adds. Q: This week, next week, the week after next? Pester won\u2019t be drawn. Mann turns in exasperation to Sabadell\u2019s COO, Miguel Montes.... We are very close, Montes replies. Q: That sound like days. Could it be days? Hopefully yes, Montes replies cautiously [and not very convincingly, I fear]. John Mann turns to the issue of compensation, and the case of a TSB customer whose wedding planning thanks to the IT chaos. Q: How will TSB make things right? Meddings says TSB don\u2019t simply use a \u2018financial calculation\u2019 when assessing compensation. It will also take stress and inconvenience into account. Deloitte are helping TSB to draw up a framework to help deal with compensation claims, Meddings explains Q: What if customers aren\u2019t satisfied? They could consider appealing to a financial onbudsman, Meddings suggests. Mann turns his guns to chairman Richard Medding about the \u201cshambles\u201d at TSB. The only similar mess I can remember in my time on this committee is the Co-op Bank, says Mann. They lost their chief executive and chairman - are you going to lose yours too? No, Medding replies. Q: What about Mr Pester\u2019s bonuses? Boom! Meddings reveals that Pester has offered to give up the bonus related to the successful migration of the IT system. That\u2019s the right thing to do, Meddings adds. Q: So, no bonus for Mr Pester this year? It\u2019s not as simple as that. A decision over his total pay and bonus package will be taken at the end of the year, once the review into the IT project has been concluded, Meddings explains. Now it\u2019s Labour MP John Mann\u2019s turn. Q: How many SMEs have had problems? Pester doesn\u2019t know (again, not a good look). In percentage terms it\u2019s similar to the wider average (where around 50% of customers couldn\u2019t get online at any one time), he says. Q: How many customers have had problems speaking to your telephone helpline? We\u2019ve been very disappointed with the abandon rate -- Q:...with WHAT?!, Mann interjects. ....These are customers who decide not to wait, Pester explains Q: How long are you making them wait? The average wait time is 30 minutes, Pester says, it hasn\u2019t improved in recent days. [But as MPs realise, this wait time doesn\u2019t customers whose patience hits breaking point and hang up after a lengthy wait] Pester says that IBM experts are helping to fix the IT issues....but if it was a simple problem, we would have fixed it, he adds. Stuart Hosie now challenges Paul Pester over his claim that most of the bank is running smoothly. One of Hosie\u2019s constituents found that his standing orders had bounced yesterday (a problem TSB claims to have fixed). A second customer has an even more worrying story - he tried to pay seven cheques into his local branch, but the staff couldn\u2019t make the system work. He tried to access his balance on another account, Hosie continues, and staff couldn\u2019t get into it. This customer has been locked out of their business account since 20 April, and their complaint hasn\u2019t even been responded to. Fixing Pester with a steely look, Hosie declares: It isn\u2019t just the online, it isn\u2019t just the digital, it\u2019s the technology in the branch [too], and the complaints aren\u2019t being addressed, are they? Pester says TSB have responded to 22,290 of the 40,000 complaints received since the IT migration. It is in the process of dealing with the rest, and he apologises to this constituent. SNP MP Stuart Hosie asks if Pester understands the importance of digital services today, when a broken app is as bad as a closed branch. Pester agrees. He says TSB\u2019s busiest time is typically between 7.30am and 8.30am, as customers check balances over breakfast or on the way to work. Q: So why weren\u2019t you ready for the demand when you brought your services back online (on Sunday night, April 22nd)? Pester says the bank had assumed very high usage of its telephone services, the internet banking, and its mobile app. TSB thought that it was ready -- Slaughter and May\u2019s independent review has to discover why it wasn\u2019t. Nicky Morgan has more inside information from TSB - a worker who says they weren\u2019t actually allowed to fail things in testing, only say they had passed or need more work. Pester says TSB\u2019s testing operation will be examined as part of its review. Q: And why are people who closed accounts years ago now getting texts? Did you move too much data? Pester says TSB has to hold customer data for seven years. Q: Was your bonus contingent on getting this migration done now, Mr Pester? Pester denies it. He says there was a \u201creward\u201d for getting the operation done, but not at a particular time. [Background: in February, TSB\u2019s board decided to withholding a potential \u00a31 million-plus payment for Pester until the bank completed its delayed IT improvements.] Rushanara Ali turns to Sabadell\u2019s COO, Miquel Montes. Q: Would this migration have saved \u00a3100m per year? (on fees paid to Lloyds?) Montes confirms that this is the case Q: Did you speed the migration up because there was a financial benefit? Montes denies it. All decisions taken by the TSB board have been backed by Sabadell, he says. Q: So there was no pressure on TSB to move quickly? Pester jumps in, saying there was no pressure from TSB\u2019s parent company. Q: So why didn\u2019t the migration work? Pester says he\u2019s handled several migrations before - including bringing Alliance &amp; Leicester and Bradford &amp; Bingley onto Santander (following the financial crisis) and carving TSB out of Lloyds. Subtext: he knew what he was doing.... Now chairman Richard Meddings chips in - he confirms that TSB have called legal firm Slaughter &amp; May in to carry out a review. He\u2019s happy to share the conclusions with MPs when it\u2019s done. Labour MP Rushanara Ali takes issue with Pester\u2019s claim that TSB customers should get in touch with problems. She points out that customers have suffered long delays on its helplines, or lengthy journeys to their nearest bank. Q: What have the bank done to help? Pester says the bank have prioritised vulnerable customers, and also searched social media to find customers affected. Ali isn\u2019t impressed, saying that the tone of TSB\u2019s response hasn\u2019t been good enough. Pester isn\u2019t winning his audience over, judging by these tweets from watching journalists: CEO Paul Pester is trying to persuade the Treasury committee that the situation isn\u2019t that bad really. The engine of the bank is running smoothly, the issue is handling enough customers trying to log on simultaneously, particularly through our app and our digital channels. But Nicky Morgan has another trump card - a second member of the committee now can\u2019t into their TSB account. It\u2019s great to have so many customers, grins Pester (ill-advisedly, I think). \u201cThank you very much for using TSB\u201d Morgan shoots back that it\u2019s not clear how much longer they\u2019ll actually be TSB customers. Q: Hasn\u2019t this IT migration been a complete failure, asks Charlie Elphicke MP. It\u2019s not been a complete failure, Paul Pester insists - sticking to his earlier argument that much of the migration went smoothly (it\u2019s just that lots of customers couldn\u2019t actually do any banking). Pester reveals that TSB has received 40,000 complaints since the migration (on April 20-22nd). It would normally receive 3,000 over the same period. They are being investigated, and they will be put right. Charlie Elphicke MP takes up the cudgel, asking about TSB\u2019s senior management regime - and who take responsibility for this mess? Q: Who does the buck stop with? It stops with me, says Pester. Q: So you take responsibility? I take absolutely responsibility, Q: Have you failed in the basic duty to customers? Pester says he is proud of TSB\u2019s work since it was spun out of Lloyds in 2013. I\u2019m deeply sad that the good work of the last five years has been so damaged over the last 10 days, Pester continues, but we will come back. Q: But how can your customers ever trust you again, Mr Pester? Because I will ensure that we get TSB out of these problems, and that no customers end up out of pocket. A TSB customer has tweeted the committee about the irony of watching Paul Pester saying there are no problems logging into TSB, while \u201csimultaneously trying and failing to log into my account\u201d. How can you say that this migration went smoothly? Nicky Morgan asks. Paul Pester says he has data showing him that almost all customers are getting online,. If people are struggling, please contact us, he says. [That won\u2019t cut much ice with customers who have reported long delays on its telephone line] Nicky Morgan plays her trump card -- one of the committee\u2019s own staff are trying to log in, and they can\u2019t log in either. Nicky Morgan asks about another case, about a TSB customer who says they were let down by the bank, and has subsequently passed away. In response, chairman Richard Meddings also apologises for the IT migration failures. Nicky Morgan says Pester is downplaying the problems at TSB. She quotes an email from a TSB customer who has suffered disruption for the last two weeks. This person has seen their balance fluctuate, been unable to withdraw cash, and with no idea if their data has been compromised. How is someone supposed to cope without banking services for two weeks? Could Paul Pester cope? Pester says he doesn\u2019t recognise this situation. He says that there have been problems getting enough customers online at the same time, but that around 50% of customers who tried to log in, were able to at anyone time. Morgan isn\u2019t impressed - are you saying this customer isn\u2019t telling the truth? There\u2019s no group of customers who haven\u2019t been able to log in since the migration, Pester insists. Morgan cites another email, from a TSB customer who hasn\u2019t been able to buy a house as they can\u2019t access three months of bank statement? Isn\u2019t it complacent to say that this migration went well, when people are not in control of their bank accounts? The session is underway. Committee chair Nicky Morgan begins by quoting TSB\u2019s ambition to become \u201ca digital business that just happens to be a bank\u201d. Isn\u2019t the truth that it is actually a broken bank? CEO Paul Pester begins by apologising for the disruption suffered by customers since the IT migration last month, saying he is truly sorry. But he insists that much of the migration worked well - balances were accurately transferred \u201cto the penny\u201d and the underlying engine of the bank is running relatively smoothly But, the platform\u2019s ability to allow enough people to log in at the same time hasn\u2019t worked well enough - preventing some customers from using its internet banking service and mobile app. That has led to an unacceptable experience for some customer, Pester says, apologising again. While we wait for the hearing to begin, here\u2019s our latest news story on TSB.... The Treasury committee hearing on TSB\u2019s IT problems is due to start in five minutes. The witnesses are TSB chief executive Paul Pester and chairman Richard Meddings, plus Miquel Montes, chief operating officer of Sabadell Group (TSB\u2019s parent company). It should be streamed live here. Back in the 1980s, TSB billed itself as \u201cThe Bank That Likes to Say Yes\u201d, in a series of jaunty adverts: Satirical magazine Private Eye have now helpfully updated the slogan for today\u2019s circumstances: TSB\u2019s IT meltdown crisis has reared its head at Prime Minister\u2019s Questions. Nicky Morgan MP, chair of the Treasury committee, tells the House of Commons that the crisis has had very severe consequences for thousands of customers. It is unfair to businesses, to vulnerable customers, and it is particularly unfair when banks are closing branches, Morgan says (giving TSB a taste of this afternoon\u2019s grilling). Does the prime minister agree that \u201ca robust and reliable banking IT infrastructure\u201d is essential in the modern economy. Theres May says she certainly does agree that a \u201crobust, safe and reliable\u201d IT system is essential to underpin modern banking. She\u2019s sure the Treasury Committee will get to the bottom of what went wrong at TSB, starting with today\u2019s hearing. Another question for MPs: why has TSB\u2019s board called in a top UK law firm, Slaughter &amp; May? Sky News\u2019s Mark Kleinman has more details: Sky News has learnt that directors of the UK\u2019s sixth-biggest bank have asked Slaughter &amp; May to conduct an independent probe of the circumstances leading to the IT upgrade which has prompted a furious backlash from thousands of customers. The appointment of Slaughters, one of the so-called \u201cMagic Circle\u201d law firms, has been rubber-stamped by TSB\u2019s board and is expected to be confirmed by directors when they appear in front of MPs on the Treasury Select Committee later on Wednesday. MPs on the Treasury committee could also ask TSB about the weird and less-than-wonderful state of its online banking site. Technology expert Chris Applegate took a look under the bonnet yesterday, and recoiled after uncovering a host of errors and questionable coding work. Some of the errors suggest that stressed techies are making basic mistakes as they race to get TSB\u2019s banking services online again. Also... the site\u2019s security certificate - used to secure credit card transactions and log-in details - will soon be out of date. Not a good sign at all. This is TSB\u2019s front-end code, for the pages seen by customers, rather than the digital nuts and bolts underpinning the bank. But it\u2019s still not a reassuring sight. Oof! Britain\u2019s economy is suffering its worst run against the US and the eurozone in 12 years. So says Barret Kupelian, senior economist at PwC. He has crunched today\u2019s eurozone GDP figures (see 10.12am) and compared them to last Friday\u2019s growth data for Britain and America. And as you can see, Britain\u2019s annual growth rate started dipping at the end of 2016 -- the year of the EU referendum: It\u2019s particularly disappointing as the wider global economy has been enjoying decent growth of late, as Kupelian explains: \u201cToday\u2019s flash estimate of Eurozone GDP growth for the first quarter of 2018 shows that the bloc as a whole grew by 0.4% quarter-on-quarter. This is broadly in line with expectations but slower than the 0.7% growth rate recorded in Q4 2017. However, these preliminary Eurozone figures are likely to be revised once national authorities release their data. \u201cThis was the fifth out of seven consecutive quarters that the Eurozone grew faster than the UK following the EU referendum. This suggests that the UK has not been able to reap the full benefits of an upturn in global economic activity unlike other large economies like the Eurozone and the US. \u201cThis now means that the UK has been the slowest growing economy relative to the US and the Eurozone for the fourth consecutive quarter - something last experienced 12 years ago. Economist Rupert Seggins has also shown how Britain is lagging behind: Several TSB customers are tweeting their unhappiness that the bank has billed them their usual monthly charge, despite the disruption of the last 12 days. Although some of TSB\u2019s current accounts are free, it charges \u00a39.95 per month for its Silver account, and \u00a38.95/month for its \u2018select\u2019 option (no longer available). TSB wrote to customers this week, promised to waive overdraft fees for March and April and promising that no-one will be left \u2018out of pocket\u2019. But still, charging account fees when people haven\u2019t had the usual service clearly rankles with some customers. Another newsflash: Growth across the eurozone slowed to 0.4% in the first three months of 2018. That\u2019s down from 0.7% 0.6% in October-December 2017, and highlights how the global economy has softened in recent months. This also means the eurozone grew faster than Britain - again (as UK GDP only rose by 0.1% during the quarter). We\u2019d like to hear from TSB customers who are still suffering from the IT problems. You can get in touch anonymously here. Back to TSB, and writer Michelle Davies is still having problems with her bank account: Better news: UK construction sector returned to growth in April, as builders returned to work after the \u2018Beast from the East\u2019 disrupted activity in March. A quick economic newsflash: Growth across the eurozone\u2019s factories has slowed to a 13-month low. Data firm Markit reports that activity across Europe\u2019s manufacturers cooled in April, with growth slowing in the Netherlands, Germany, Italy, Spain and Greece. It\u2019s due to a drop in new order growth, meaning firms took on fewer new staff. Firms reported that new order growth slowed last month, as did new hirings, as the strong growth of 2017 fades. However, at least factories are still expanding. The overall eurozone factory PMI fell to 56.2 in April, from 56.6 in March (any reading over 50 shows growth). [for comparison, the UK factory PMI fell to 53.9 yesterday, a 17-month low) It\u2019s more than a week since TSB\u2019s chief Paul Pester tweeted that \u201cour mobile banking app and online banking are now up and running\u201d...and yet there are still problems. The bank\u2019s service status page warns that customers can\u2019t see their mortgage account via internet banking and the mobile app. Some business customers are still struggling to make payments online - which could be disastrous for a firm which needs to pay suppliers or staff. Replacement debit and credit cards are currently taking a little longer to process too. If customers can\u2019t get online, TSB recommends they try \u201cclosing your mobile app fully and then restarting it, or closing your internet browser and trying again\u201d. Advice straight out of The IT Crowd.... Reuters has also investigated the TBS crisis -- and confirmed that rushed and inadequate testing and poor internal communication were to blame. Reporter Lawrence White explains: \u201cThere wasn\u2019t time to test everything, digital and mobile payment testing weren\u2019t properly scoped, so it wasn\u2019t a surprise to me when it went live last week and those parts didn\u2019t work,\u201d said one source, a project manager who oversaw people working on the upgrade, referring to the testing up to the first deadline. A second source, a software tester, said tests were in some cases poorly designed or rushed in order to meet the initial project launch date. He also cited a lack of communication between IT and the business about who was managing the testing. Some background: TSB\u2019s IT meltdown was created because the bank moved from its old technology at Lloyds Bank (who sold it in 2013) onto a new system created by current owner Sabadell. Insiders have told us that the team working on the migration were set unrealistically tight deadlines that didn\u2019t acknowledge the challenge of unpicking TSB out of Lloyds\u2019 sprawling network of legacy systems. My colleague Sam Gibbs wrote about the mess on Saturday: By the summer of 2016, work on developing the new system was meant to be well under way and December 2017 was set as a hard-and-fast deadline for delivery. \u201cThe time period to develop the new system and migrate TSB over to it was just 18 months,\u201d the insider said. \u201cI thought this was ridiculous. TSB people were saying that Sabadell had done this many times in Spain. But tiny Spanish local banks are not sprawling LBG legacy systems.\u201d To make matters worse, the Sabadell development team did not have full control \u2013 and therefore a full understanding \u2013 of the system they were trying to migrate customer data and systems from because Lloyds Banking Group was still the supplier. \u201cThis turned what was a super-hard systems job [into] a clusterfuck in the making,\u201d the insider said. By March 2017, the nightmare for customers that was going to unfold a year later appeared inevitable. \u201cIt was unbelievable \u2013 hardly even a prototype or proof of concept, yet it was supposed to be fully tested and working by May before the integration work started,\u201d the insider continued. \u201cSenior staff were furious about the state it was in. Even logging in was problematic.\u201d MPs must ask Pester why the bank didn\u2019t heed these warning signs, and instead plunged on into the current mess. Some TSB customers are fuming this morning after it emerged that the bank had failed to execute their standing orders yesterday. The blunder affected important bills, such as monthly rent payments, set to be paid at the start of the new month. Scientist Stacey Bell found herself caught up in the mess, when her rent found its way back into her account: TSB says the issue has been fixed - but it has created further anxiety among its customers: Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Twelve days ago, TSB pressed the button to switch its 5 million customers onto a shiny new IT platform. Later today, the bank\u2019s top brass will try to explain to MPs why they made such a botch of it. TSB chief executive Paul Pester and chairman Richard Meddings will face parliament\u2019s Treasury committee at 2.30pm today, to answer questions about why millions of customers were locked out of their internet and mobile bank services for days. They\u2019ll be accompanied by Miquel Montes, chief operating officer of TSB\u2019s parent company, Sabadell, which oversaw the move onto the Proteo4UK platform. Pester - who took personal control of the mess nearly a week ago - will be quizzed on what exactly went wrong, and why TSB hasn\u2019t been able to get back online. Was the system tested properly, and why wasn\u2019t there a contingency plan in case gremlins struck? And are customers really going to be properly compensated for their losses, and the inconvenience they have suffered? My colleague Patrick Collinson has helpfully drawn up a list of questions for the MPs to bang over the net to the trio: Why didn\u2019t the new computer system work? TSB spent, by its own admission, 2,500 human years on the IT transfer from Lloyds, with 1,000 people involved in one way or another. Why did it fail? Did TSB perform thorough testing prior to flicking the switch on the migration of user accounts? Why did the testing not uncover the issues? How thorough can it have been, given issues became apparent almost immediately? Was there a back-up? Sabadell\u2019s takeover of TSB was predicated almost entirely on the \u00a3100m savings to be made from cutting TSB free from the \u00a3214m-a-year bill it had to pay Lloyds for continuing to run the bank\u2019s accounts. Was it rushed through, without sufficient back-up? Why was the old system not still in place to mitigate customer troubles when it was clear Proteo4UK, the name given to the new platform, was not up to the task? Why were customers misinformed? The transition was scheduled from Friday evening to Sunday evening. When failures began appearing, almost immediately afterwards, TSB initially said the problems were only \u201cintermittent\u201d. Early on Wednesday, Pester said the system was \u201cup and running\u201d again but customers continued to report problems. Who was in control? Much is being made of a rift between TSB in the UK and Sabadell in Spain. Pictures on LinkedIn showed celebrating IT workers in Madrid toasting the \u201csuccess\u201d of the transfer. Pester is now paying for IBM specialists to fix the problems. Will Pester pin the blame on head office in Spain or other external contractors? Will Pester still receive a \u00a31.6m bonus? He may try to dodge this by saying bonuses are at the discretion of the remuneration committee, and nothing has been decided. But MPs are likely to press Pester on whether he think he deserves a bonus after this fiasco. How will TSB compensate customers? The bank has promised that no one will be left out of pocket. But will they receive compensation only if they complain? Will the bankcontact customers? And what does it expect the compensation bill to be? Did regulation work? MPs will want to know the extent to which the giant transfer of 1.3bn records was supervised by regulators such as the Financial Conduct Authority, and what it says about the robustness of Britain\u2019s banking infrastructure. TSB will have to tell MPs how far the debacle has exposed customers\u2019 data, and how much, if at all, any accounts have been compromised Also coming up today We\u2019ll be wading through a river of data this morning, with new surveys of the eurozone factory sector and Britain\u2019s builders. We also get the first estimate of eurozone growth in the first quarter of this year. Growth is expected to have slowed to around 0.4%, from 0.6% in the last three months of 2017 - still rather better than Britain\u2019s slothlike 0.1% expansion... The agenda: 9am BST: Eurozone manufacturing PMI survey for April 9.30am: UK construction PMI for April 10am BST: Eurozone GDP for Q1 2018 (first estimate) 2.30pm BST: Treasury committee hearing on TSB\u2019s IT problems",

The government\u2019s now-defunct regional development agencies offered companies inducements to set up in high-unemployment areas. A legacy of that initiative is the number of call centres now based in places such as Wales and north-east England.</p> <p>By the turn of the century companies had begun to look for new ways to cut costs and the industry was gripped by the offshore bug. Customer relations suffered as calls were routed overseas when customers tried to contact the AA or even National Rail Enquiries.

If there is an area finding it tough it\u2019s retail, as the industry has been impacted by online shopping.\u201d She added that the digital boom had radically changed the job description, with the image of a headset-wearing phone operator now outdated as staff straddled multiple web chats, social media posts and emails, as well as answering calls. The complexity pushes up wages as employers seek multiskilled staff. \u201cThe job is getting tougher,\u201d she said. \u201cBusinesses are having to pay more, because the work is more complicated.\u201d The decline of heavy industry created a gap that call-centre jobs helped to fill, but now this sector also looks vulnerable to market forces. \u201cI\u2019d like to see more industry,\u201d said Harris. \u201cHistorically Swansea and south Wales was an industrial area, with steel and copper works and the mines. We have seen a big decline in skilled manual labour [jobs] and call centres replaced that. For young people call centres has been the work that is available to them.\u201d A brief history of the British call centre The birth of the modern call centre can be traced back to the 1960s and the creation of automated telephone exchanges that could handle huge call volumes. The Birmingham Press and Mail is credited with opening the first one in 1965, according to the website Callcentrehelper. In the 70s Barclaycard and British Gas were among the early adopters of this efficient new technology. In 1985, the entrepreneur Sir Peter Wood kickstarted the call-centre boom when he founded Direct Line, becoming the first company to sell insurance entirely over the telephone. The industry was coming of age as the sun was setting on Britain\u2019s coal industry, with pit closures accelerating in the 1990s. The government\u2019s now-defunct regional development agencies offered companies inducements to set up in high-unemployment areas. A legacy of that initiative is the number of call centres now based in places such as Wales and north-east England. By the turn of the century companies had begun to look for new ways to cut costs and the industry was gripped by the offshore bug. Customer relations suffered as calls were routed overseas when customers tried to contact the AA or even National Rail Enquiries. More recently, companies including BT and Vodafone have made a virtue of repatriating call-centre jobs. Today the US is the biggest player in the industry, with 40,000 centres employing 6 million people. Some of the customer tensions created by offshoring were captured in a scene from the hit 2008 film Slumdog Millionaire. When the main character, Jamal, who is a teaboy in a Mumbai call centre, is forced to answer an irate Scotswoman\u2019s call, she berates him when he can\u2019t pronounce the name of her home town, Kingussie. \u201cWhere are you from?\u201d she yells. \u201cAbroad, I bet!\u201d His attempt to make her believe he lives in Scotland fails when he says his address is \u201cLoch Big Ben, next to Sean Connery\u2019s flat\u201d.",

Inconclusive Brexit negotiations, and uncertainty around when the inflation impact from referendum-related currency depreciation will fade, create additional challenges for the BoE.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5b043fd9e4b0738b88745e29\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-05-22T16:06:45.653Z\">5.06pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>If the FTSE 100 is to reach 8000 for the first time, it might need to be soon, says Fiona Cincotta, senior market analyst at City Index, before the Bank of England decides to raise interest rates:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>A weaker pound, a further easing of tensions between US and China and stronger commodity prices encouraged the FTSE to continue its steady rise towards its 8000 target. Now just 100 points away, with momentum on its side and the pound looking more fragile than it has for a while, 8000 is a very reasonable target.</p> <p>The inverse relationship that exists between the pound and the FTSE thanks to a large percentage of FTSE firms earning revenue outside of the UK, is expected to help the FTSE break higher into unchartered territory towards 8000, sooner rather than later. After weeks of softer than forecast UK economic data, most recently a fall in factory output to the lowest level in two years, plus Brexit uncertainties and a BoE that is happy to sit on the side-lines, key factors are aligned for a soft pound and another push higher by the FTSE.</p> <p>With the harsh weather conditions well behind us, the outlook for the economy is looking up, according to the BoE, making an August rate hike once again a possibility. Should investors start to believe that the August hike is well and truly back on the table, the pound could start to pick up off year to date lows, making it harder for the FTSE to reach 8000. With this in mind, the FTSE\u2019s final move higher to 8000 needs to be in the bag sooner rather than later to guarantee a hit, otherwise a stronger pound is likely to prevent that psychological level being struck this summer. </p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5b043ae8e4b0738b88745de0\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-05-22T15:46:29.439Z\">4.46pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">FTSE 100 hits new closing high</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The UK\u2019s leading share index has closed at a new record, but it is off the intra-day highs it recorded earlier in the afternoon.</p> <p>The FTSE 100 finished up 0.23% at 7877.45 having early climbed to a new all time peak of 7903.50. </p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5b0435a3e4b05aef3eee8748\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-05-22T15:23:07.796Z\">4.23pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Chinese plans to cut import tariffs on US cars has helped support markets. Joshua Mahony, market analyst at IG, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p> European markets are pushing upwards amid improving US-Chinese trade talks, and a weakening pound. The pound has been suffering in late trade, coming off the back of a CBI report that showed UK manufacturing output to be growing at the slowest rate in two-years. With manufacturing failing to gather momentum, there is a fear that we will see the focus of UK economic weakness shift from construction in Q1 to manufacturing in Q2....</p> <p>Improving US-Chinese relations continue to help improve risk sentiment as the week progresses, with news that China has pledged to reduce levies on automakers and car parts helping the likes of General Electric gain ground. While car makers welcomed news that China will cut tariffs on both imported cars (15% from 25%) and car parts (6% from average of 10%), these still remain comparatively high and are unlikely to alter the status quo of firms basing production in China to avoid such levies. China remains the largest car producing nation in the world, and this token gesture is unlikely to really make any dent in that dynamic.</p> <p> While the benefits from this reduction in Chinese levies are questionable, the decision to let ZTE off the hook for brazenly defying US sanctions on Iran and North Korea is a big boost for China given they employed 80,000 workers. While on face value the Chinese seem to be getting more from this deal, todays deal at least helps reinstate demand for US listed firms Qualcomm and Dolby, from whom ZTE buy many of their processing chips.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2018-05-22T15:24:07.784Z\">at 4.24pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5b0433d4e4b0a1f834770c9c\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-05-22T15:15:07.168Z\">4.15pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The FTSE 100 continues to set new records, briefly breaking through the 7900 barrier for the first time as the close of the trading day approaches.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5b042c24e4b0a1f834770c1c\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/zoewood\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-05-22T14:42:44.486Z\">3.42pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>More bad news for retail workers:</p> <blockquote> <p>Tesco is shutting its clothing and homewares website <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/tesco\">Tesco</a> Direct in a surprise move that puts 500 jobs at risk.</p> <p>Staff were briefed on Tuesday afternoon about the decision to close the loss-making website which was the supermarket giant\u2019s attempt to take on Amazon.</p> <p>Tesco said it had conducted a detailed review of the operation but could not come up with a plan that would make the business, which sells thousands of products ranging from toys, to clothing and electrical appliances, profitable.

Against the dollar sterling is now up just 0.08% at $1.3435. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The fact cable\u2019s gains more than halved as the day went on freed the UK index up to shake off its early reticence, the FTSE adding around 25 points in value. That sent it above 7890 for the first time in its history, in the process making the mythic 8000 mark closer to becoming a reality.</p> <p>Whether or not the FTSE can actually reach that landmark level this week may be down to a couple of factors. One: the performance of Brent Crude. The black stuff re-crossed $80 per barrel on Tuesday as supply concerns relating to Venezuela and Iran continued to heighten. However, BP and Shell were resistant to this rise, instead falling 1.2% and 0.6% respectively. If the FTSE is to keep rising, then its oil colossi need to get on board. </p> <p>Two: how sterling reacts to the week\u2019s data. The inflation reading on Wednesday and the 2<sup>nd</sup> estimate Q1 GDP figure on Friday are both potential lightning rods for a pound-rebound, dependant on whether or not they beat the expected stagnation. If they don\u2019t, and cable hits a fresh 2018 low, then the FTSE may be in for a boost.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5b04276ee4b0a1f834770bbd\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-05-22T14:25:33.234Z\">3.25pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Oil is on the rise again with Brent crude back above the $80 a barrel level it breached last week.</p> <p>It is currently up 1.17% at $80.15 on renewed concerns about falling supplies from struggling Venezuela, as well as Iran after Donald Trump pulled out of the nuclear agreement. Mihir Kapadia, chief executive of Sun Global Investments, said: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The prospect of further Iran sanctions coupled with the disputed election results in Venezuela have helped to firm oil prices. President Trump and the White House have made clear that any new Iran deal would require the country to stop enriching all uranium and halt support for militant groups in the region. Iran\u2019s government has rejected these demands, increasing the chance that the US could impose severe economic sanctions on the country. Sanctions would reduce oil supply. The possibility of a drastic fall in Iran\u2019s output has helped to support oil prices in recent months. </p> <p>Oil prices were also pushed higher by the disputed election in Venezuela. The US has promptly responded with sanctions that seek to greatly restrict investment in debts issued by the Venezuelan government or Venezuelan agencies, although the US did not ban the purchase of oil itself. Analysts will be watching closely to see how the situation develops.</p> </blockquote> <p><em> <br></em></p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5b041fbbe4b05aef3eee860c\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-05-22T13:50:48.673Z\">2.50pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Wall Street opens higher</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Hopes for a positive outcome from the US-China trade talks, US markets have edged higher in early trading.</p> <p>With technology stocks benefiting from the prospect that the two countries can avoid a damaging trade war, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is up 11 points or 0.04% while the S&amp;P 500 opened 0.2% higher and the Nasdaq Composite was 0.36% better.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5b041df8e4b0a1f834770b2c\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/richard-partington\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-05-22T13:48:35.445Z\">2.48pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Here\u2019s our story on the Bank of England committee hearing:</p> <blockquote> <p>British households are more than \u00a3900 worse off following the vote to leave the European Union, according to the governor of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/bankofenglandgovernor\">Bank of England</a>. </p> <p>Comparing forecasts made by Threadneedle Street before the referendum, prepared on the basis of a remain vote, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/mark-carney\">Mark Carney</a> told MPs that household incomes were now significantly lower than expected.</p> <p>\u201cReal household incomes are about \u00a3900 per household lower than we forecast in May of 2016, which is a lot of money,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Speaking in front of the Treasury select committee of MPs, Carney also said the economy was 2% smaller than forecast before the EU referendum, despite the strength of the global economy and an emergency rate cut from the Bank after the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/eu-referendum\">Brexit</a> vote.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s a reasonable difference\u201d to forecasts for the economy made in May 2016, he added. </p> <p>Although admitting it was difficult to say with certainty that Brexit was the sole reason for lower household incomes, the Bank governor suggested the referendum outcome played a significant role.

That\u2019s despite the world economy, and particularly the eurozone, growing faster than forecast since then.</p> <p>According to Carney, if you adjust for the stronger global economy and the UK government\u2019s fiscal easing, the UK is actually around 1.75% smaller, <strong>perhaps even 2%</strong>, than you might expected today.</p> <p>That has a real impact on families and individuals across the country.</p> <p>As Carney puts it:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>If you map it onto household incomes, real household incomes are about \u00a3900 lower than we forecast, which is a lot of money.</p> </blockquote> <p>Some of this loss can clearly be ascribed to Brexit. Business investment has been up to 4% weaker than forecast -- as firms have been hit by uncertainty over Britain\u2019s future trading relationships.</p> <p>Households have suffered by the drop in real incomes (which turned negative last year), due to the plunge in sterling after the referendum. The weaker pound drove up inflation, meaning salaries and pensions didn\u2019t go as far in the shops.</p> <p>As Carney puts it:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\u201cThere are Brexit effects that come through\u201d</p> </blockquote> <p>But, the governor did also cite Britain\u2019s ongoing productivity problems - partly due to weak investment, but also due to a series of wider issues that can\u2019t be pinned on the Brexit vote.</p> <p>In conclusion, Carney warned:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\u201cIn the short term, over the last year and a half, there has been an impact relative to what we would have expected, even with some pretty good tailwinds on the back of this economy.\u201d</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2018-05-22T11:20:24.795Z\">at 12.20pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5b03ed98e4b0738b887458ed\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-05-22T10:35:27.730Z\">11.35am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>John Mann MP asks Mark Carney a series of mischievous and piercing questions.</strong></p> <p>Mann gets Carney to confirm that he is still planning to leave the Bank of England in June 2019. He\u2019s confident that the government can \u2018multitask\u2019 and choose a successor despite the pressure of Brexit.</p> <p>But Mann points out that there are rumours of a general election this autumn. So within a few months (if Labour wins power), the Bank of England could be given a new remit to target unemployment as well as inflation.</p> <p><em>Q: Is the Bank of England prepared for a change in your remit?</em></p> <p>Carney says he believes the Bank\u2019s remit should indeed be reviewed every five to eight years. Whatever remit parliament give us, we will implement.</p> <p>The current remit is \u2018absolutely fit for purpose\u2019, Carney insists.</p> <p>Mann suggests that it might be better to make any remit changed before, rather than after, a new governor is appointed. That could be an argument for Carney staying on longer at the Bank.</p> <p>Mann then swerves to a different issue:</p> <p><em>Q: What impact has Simon Cowell had on the UK economy?</em><br></p> <p>Mann explains that Cowell (of the X-Factor and Britain\u2019s Got Talent) has driven a change in behaviour - more people are staying in on Saturday nights rather than going out.</p> <p>Carney says the Bank has beefed up its expertise in behavioural economics in recent years, to track these trends. He suggests social media and the internet is probably a bigger factor, though:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/david_milliken/status/998872820523429888\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">One of the stranger questions for Bank of England&#39;s Carney at today&#39;s TSC- the impact over the past 5 years on the Saturday night economy of <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SimonCowell?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@SimonCowell</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BGT?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@BGT</a> (via <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JohnMannMP?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@JohnMannMP</a>) - Carney says a good research project but Google, social media probably more material...</p>&mdash; David Milliken (@david_milliken) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/david_milliken/status/998872820523429888?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">May 22, 2018</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p><em>Q: Britain has become a world leader in wind power.

                "bodyText":"Further optimism that a trade war between the US and China could be averted has helped lift European markets, despite a drag from Wall Street. Apart from the FTSE 100 reaching a new peak, other major markets also ended higher, even in Italy despite continuing concerns about the plans of its new coalition. As for the US, there were more signs of strength in the country\u2019s economy with a new manufacturing survey. Dave Madden of CMC Markets said: The US Richmond manufacturing index soared to 16 in May from -3 in April. Economists were expecting a reading of 9. The solid manufacturing report underlines the strength of the US economy. Some traders predict the Federal Reserve will raise rates three more times in 2018, and economic announcements like this reinforce their beliefs. The final scores in Europe showed: The FTSE 100 finished up 0.23% or 18.28 points at 7877.45 Germany\u2019s Dax rose 0.71% to13,169.92 France\u2019s Cac climbed 0.05% to 5640.10 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB added 0.54% to 23,216.57 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended up 0.72% at 10,138.8 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 37 points or 0.15%. On that note, it\u2019s time to close for the day. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. More on a possible UK interest rate rise this year, following the select committee appearance of Bank of England policymakers this morning. Andrew Wilson at Goldman Sachs Asset Management, said: Comments concerning monetary policy largely echo this month\u2019s Monetary Policy Meeting. We still see scope for one rate hike this year, most likely in the fourth quarter and we think the pace of UK monetary tightening thereafter will be gradual given uncertainties around determinants of recent activity softness. We also suspect policymakers will await further clarity from macro data before providing further guidance on the timing of any future rate hikes. Inconclusive Brexit negotiations, and uncertainty around when the inflation impact from referendum-related currency depreciation will fade, create additional challenges for the BoE. If the FTSE 100 is to reach 8000 for the first time, it might need to be soon, says Fiona Cincotta, senior market analyst at City Index, before the Bank of England decides to raise interest rates: A weaker pound, a further easing of tensions between US and China and stronger commodity prices encouraged the FTSE to continue its steady rise towards its 8000 target. Now just 100 points away, with momentum on its side and the pound looking more fragile than it has for a while, 8000 is a very reasonable target. The inverse relationship that exists between the pound and the FTSE thanks to a large percentage of FTSE firms earning revenue outside of the UK, is expected to help the FTSE break higher into unchartered territory towards 8000, sooner rather than later. After weeks of softer than forecast UK economic data, most recently a fall in factory output to the lowest level in two years, plus Brexit uncertainties and a BoE that is happy to sit on the side-lines, key factors are aligned for a soft pound and another push higher by the FTSE. With the harsh weather conditions well behind us, the outlook for the economy is looking up, according to the BoE, making an August rate hike once again a possibility. Should investors start to believe that the August hike is well and truly back on the table, the pound could start to pick up off year to date lows, making it harder for the FTSE to reach 8000. With this in mind, the FTSE\u2019s final move higher to 8000 needs to be in the bag sooner rather than later to guarantee a hit, otherwise a stronger pound is likely to prevent that psychological level being struck this summer. The UK\u2019s leading share index has closed at a new record, but it is off the intra-day highs it recorded earlier in the afternoon. The FTSE 100 finished up 0.23% at 7877.45 having early climbed to a new all time peak of 7903.50. Chinese plans to cut import tariffs on US cars has helped support markets. Joshua Mahony, market analyst at IG, said: European markets are pushing upwards amid improving US-Chinese trade talks, and a weakening pound. The pound has been suffering in late trade, coming off the back of a CBI report that showed UK manufacturing output to be growing at the slowest rate in two-years. With manufacturing failing to gather momentum, there is a fear that we will see the focus of UK economic weakness shift from construction in Q1 to manufacturing in Q2.... Improving US-Chinese relations continue to help improve risk sentiment as the week progresses, with news that China has pledged to reduce levies on automakers and car parts helping the likes of General Electric gain ground. While car makers welcomed news that China will cut tariffs on both imported cars (15% from 25%) and car parts (6% from average of 10%), these still remain comparatively high and are unlikely to alter the status quo of firms basing production in China to avoid such levies. China remains the largest car producing nation in the world, and this token gesture is unlikely to really make any dent in that dynamic. While the benefits from this reduction in Chinese levies are questionable, the decision to let ZTE off the hook for brazenly defying US sanctions on Iran and North Korea is a big boost for China given they employed 80,000 workers. While on face value the Chinese seem to be getting more from this deal, todays deal at least helps reinstate demand for US listed firms Qualcomm and Dolby, from whom ZTE buy many of their processing chips. The FTSE 100 continues to set new records, briefly breaking through the 7900 barrier for the first time as the close of the trading day approaches. More bad news for retail workers: Tesco is shutting its clothing and homewares website Tesco Direct in a surprise move that puts 500 jobs at risk. Staff were briefed on Tuesday afternoon about the decision to close the loss-making website which was the supermarket giant\u2019s attempt to take on Amazon. Tesco said it had conducted a detailed review of the operation but could not come up with a plan that would make the business, which sells thousands of products ranging from toys, to clothing and electrical appliances, profitable. As a result the retailer said approximately 500 staff were at risk of redundancy. \u201cThis decision has been a very difficult one to make, but it is an essential step towards establishing a more sustainable non-food offer and growing our business for the future,\u201d said Charles Wilson who is the new boss of Tesco\u2019s UK chain. \u201cWe want to offer our customers the ability to buy groceries and non-food products in one place and that\u2019s why we are focusing our investment into one online platform.\u201d Our full report is here: Wall Street has now slipped into negative territory but that has not stopped the FTSE 100 from hitting new heights. The UK index is now up 0.45% at a new intra-day peak of 7896, helped by the pound losing most of its earlier gains. Against the dollar sterling is now up just 0.08% at $1.3435. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said: The fact cable\u2019s gains more than halved as the day went on freed the UK index up to shake off its early reticence, the FTSE adding around 25 points in value. That sent it above 7890 for the first time in its history, in the process making the mythic 8000 mark closer to becoming a reality. Whether or not the FTSE can actually reach that landmark level this week may be down to a couple of factors. One: the performance of Brent Crude. The black stuff re-crossed $80 per barrel on Tuesday as supply concerns relating to Venezuela and Iran continued to heighten. However, BP and Shell were resistant to this rise, instead falling 1.2% and 0.6% respectively. If the FTSE is to keep rising, then its oil colossi need to get on board. Two: how sterling reacts to the week\u2019s data. The inflation reading on Wednesday and the 2nd estimate Q1 GDP figure on Friday are both potential lightning rods for a pound-rebound, dependant on whether or not they beat the expected stagnation. If they don\u2019t, and cable hits a fresh 2018 low, then the FTSE may be in for a boost. Oil is on the rise again with Brent crude back above the $80 a barrel level it breached last week. It is currently up 1.17% at $80.15 on renewed concerns about falling supplies from struggling Venezuela, as well as Iran after Donald Trump pulled out of the nuclear agreement. Mihir Kapadia, chief executive of Sun Global Investments, said: The prospect of further Iran sanctions coupled with the disputed election results in Venezuela have helped to firm oil prices. President Trump and the White House have made clear that any new Iran deal would require the country to stop enriching all uranium and halt support for militant groups in the region. Iran\u2019s government has rejected these demands, increasing the chance that the US could impose severe economic sanctions on the country. Sanctions would reduce oil supply. The possibility of a drastic fall in Iran\u2019s output has helped to support oil prices in recent months. Oil prices were also pushed higher by the disputed election in Venezuela. The US has promptly responded with sanctions that seek to greatly restrict investment in debts issued by the Venezuelan government or Venezuelan agencies, although the US did not ban the purchase of oil itself. Analysts will be watching closely to see how the situation develops. Hopes for a positive outcome from the US-China trade talks, US markets have edged higher in early trading. With technology stocks benefiting from the prospect that the two countries can avoid a damaging trade war, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is up 11 points or 0.04% while the S&amp;P 500 opened 0.2% higher and the Nasdaq Composite was 0.36% better. Here\u2019s our story on the Bank of England committee hearing: British households are more than \u00a3900 worse off following the vote to leave the European Union, according to the governor of the Bank of England. Comparing forecasts made by Threadneedle Street before the referendum, prepared on the basis of a remain vote, Mark Carney told MPs that household incomes were now significantly lower than expected. \u201cReal household incomes are about \u00a3900 per household lower than we forecast in May of 2016, which is a lot of money,\u201d he said. Speaking in front of the Treasury select committee of MPs, Carney also said the economy was 2% smaller than forecast before the EU referendum, despite the strength of the global economy and an emergency rate cut from the Bank after the Brexit vote. \u201cThat\u2019s a reasonable difference\u201d to forecasts for the economy made in May 2016, he added. Although admitting it was difficult to say with certainty that Brexit was the sole reason for lower household incomes, the Bank governor suggested the referendum outcome played a significant role. Previous analysis by economists has put the potential cost for each British household of voting to leave the EU at \u00a3600 a year. The full report is here: The recent poor performance of shares in Marks &amp; Spencer mean the venerable retailer is in danger of falling out of the FTSE 100 when the latest index changes are announced next week. It looks just about safe at the moment, despite a near 3% decline in its shares today, but the reaction to this week\u2019s results could be crucial. Helal Miah, investment research analyst at The Share Centre, said: Whilst investors will be hoping that the company\u2019s full year results, due to be released to the market tomorrow, will provide a similar boost to that rival Next received recently, the harsh reality is that the retail environment continues to hugely weigh on this well-known and respected retailer. M&amp;S is likely to find itself amongst the relegation places as a result of weak figures in its all-important food business released to the market earlier this year. Whilst there have been some encouraging signs that the new management team on the clothing side is having some impact, competitive pressure from rivals and relatively weak consumer sentiment has left sales growth uninspiring. Its full year results could ultimately decide its fate, at least in regards to its future in the FTSE 100. Ironically one of the candidates to replace M&amp;S if it did drop out is Ocado following the recent surge in its shares after its big US contract win. G4S and Severn Trent are among the others who could lose their place in the top flight index, while FTSE 250 constituents Weir and GVC are knocking on the door. Sterling moved higher during the Bank of England testimony, helped by what was seen as a hawkish tone from MPC policymaker Gertjan Vlieghe and a softening of the dollar ahead of this week\u2019s Federal Reserve minutes. But the rally did not last long amid renewed signs of a weak UK economy which casts some doubt on the pace of further interest rate rises. So the FTSE 100, whose overseas earners benefit from a slide in sterling, is heading for new heights. It has already hit a new all time peak of 7887 and even though it has fallen back to 7879, up 0.26%, that would still mark a new record close if it holds on to its gains. While Mark Carney was speaking to MPs, the UK economy received two pieces of bad news. Marks &amp; Spencer, the high street chain, has announced it is closing more than 100 stores by 2022, It has identified 14 stores that will close in the next year, affecting more than 600 staff, as the company tries to tackle falling profits and growing competition from online retailers. Secondly, UK factory orders have weakened this month to their lowest level since November 2016. The CBI reported that weak domestic demand hurt British manufacturers, while export orders held up better. The campaign for a second Brexit vote have seized on Mark Carney\u2019s comments: Ruth Lea, economic adviser at Arbuthnot Banking Group (who is optimistic about Brexit), isn\u2019t impressed by Carney\u2019s calculation: The Evening Standard is splashing on Carney\u2019s comments: Perhaps the editor, a prominent Remain campaigner two years ago, feels his warnings of economic pain if people voted for Brexit are coming true.... Liberal Democrat MP Tom Brake tweets: The Bank of England governor gave MPs a clear reminder of the cost of the 2016 EU referendum today, by warning that households are \u00a3900 worse off today than expected. During his testimony to the Treasury Committee, Mark Carney explained that the UK economy is currently 1% smaller than expected two years ago. That\u2019s despite the world economy, and particularly the eurozone, growing faster than forecast since then. According to Carney, if you adjust for the stronger global economy and the UK government\u2019s fiscal easing, the UK is actually around 1.75% smaller, perhaps even 2%, than you might expected today. That has a real impact on families and individuals across the country. As Carney puts it: If you map it onto household incomes, real household incomes are about \u00a3900 lower than we forecast, which is a lot of money. Some of this loss can clearly be ascribed to Brexit. Business investment has been up to 4% weaker than forecast -- as firms have been hit by uncertainty over Britain\u2019s future trading relationships. Households have suffered by the drop in real incomes (which turned negative last year), due to the plunge in sterling after the referendum. The weaker pound drove up inflation, meaning salaries and pensions didn\u2019t go as far in the shops. As Carney puts it: \u201cThere are Brexit effects that come through\u201d But, the governor did also cite Britain\u2019s ongoing productivity problems - partly due to weak investment, but also due to a series of wider issues that can\u2019t be pinned on the Brexit vote. In conclusion, Carney warned: \u201cIn the short term, over the last year and a half, there has been an impact relative to what we would have expected, even with some pretty good tailwinds on the back of this economy.\u201d John Mann MP asks Mark Carney a series of mischievous and piercing questions. Mann gets Carney to confirm that he is still planning to leave the Bank of England in June 2019. He\u2019s confident that the government can \u2018multitask\u2019 and choose a successor despite the pressure of Brexit. But Mann points out that there are rumours of a general election this autumn. So within a few months (if Labour wins power), the Bank of England could be given a new remit to target unemployment as well as inflation. Q: Is the Bank of England prepared for a change in your remit? Carney says he believes the Bank\u2019s remit should indeed be reviewed every five to eight years. Whatever remit parliament give us, we will implement. The current remit is \u2018absolutely fit for purpose\u2019, Carney insists. Mann suggests that it might be better to make any remit changed before, rather than after, a new governor is appointed. That could be an argument for Carney staying on longer at the Bank. Mann then swerves to a different issue: Q: What impact has Simon Cowell had on the UK economy? Mann explains that Cowell (of the X-Factor and Britain\u2019s Got Talent) has driven a change in behaviour - more people are staying in on Saturday nights rather than going out. Carney says the Bank has beefed up its expertise in behavioural economics in recent years, to track these trends. He suggests social media and the internet is probably a bigger factor, though: Q: Britain has become a world leader in wind power. So given the importance of green energy, shouldn\u2019t the Bank be taking a bigger role in driving the economic case? Carney agrees that this is a hugely important issue - citing Britain\u2019s \u2018world leadership\u2019 in, for example, using artificial intelligence to drive new power grids. This is too long-term to influence the Monetary Policy Committee...but it\u2019s certainly an important issue for the Bank\u2019s Financial Policy Committee, who are looking at whether firms are well-prepared for changes. Carney says the UK has taken a global lead in \u201cbetter climate disclosure\u201d - encouraging companies to report how climate change will affect them. He says the top six banks, asset managers, major insurers have signed up - there are now $90 trillion of assets behind the initiative. The backdrop to this question, though, is that activist investor Christopher Hohn has written to the BoE, demanding stricter rules on how banks deal with the risks of climate change. Hohn argues that UK banks are exposed to a wide range of \u201cserious climate-related risks\u201d through their loan books, but investors aren\u2019t being given enough information. More here. That\u2019s the end of the session. Deputy governor Dave Ramsden confirms Mark Carney\u2019s earlier estimate that UK households are \u00a3900 worse off today than forecast in May 2016, before the Brexit vote. Q: There\u2019s a lot of debate about whether the Brexit transition period should be extended. What\u2019s your view, governor? I watch the debate with interest, Mark Carney blocks smartly with a smile. Q: Is the current transition period long enough? It\u2019s what\u2019s been agreed by the political leaders, Carney replies smoothly. Q: You wouldn\u2019t have any objection to the transition period being extended? I think some could have an objection to me answering that question, the governor grins. Q: Surveys show that Brexit uncertainty among businesses has fallen recently. Do you think it remains high, and is it really falling? Carney agrees that there has been a small improvement in business confidence about Brexit since Britain and Europe agreed a transition deal in March, \u201cas you would hope\u201d. The decisive issue, though, will be whether a final agreement is reached later this year. Gertjan Vlieghe also denies that QE has fuelled Britain\u2019s housing market. He points out that many countries have used quantitative easing to stimulate their economies since the financial crisis - but Britain is the only one to have seen such as house price boom. [Bank policymakers recently published a paper on the consequence of QE - arguing that it had actually reduced wealth inequality.] Q: Hasn\u2019t QE solidified intergenerational inequality, and made it even harder for Generation Rent to buy a home? How can we unwind that problem? Deputy governor Dave Ramsden says it is an important issue...but not one that is particularly within the Bank of England\u2019s remit to solve. Ramsden (previously chief economic adviser to HM Treasury) points out that supply-side constraints have driven house prices up for decades. Tackling housing affordability is ultimately an issue for the government, Ramsden, insists, as they can change land use and the tax system. Q: Has the Bank of England\u2019s quantitative easing programme failed, by driving up asset prices when the Bank is meant to be targeting consumer price inflation? QE is the process by which the Bank buys government debt from commercial banks, to encourage them to buy other assets. Those assets (commercial bonds, shares, commodities) tend to be owned by wealthier people. Carney, though, denies that QE was a blunder. \u201cThe policy has worked\u201d, he says, pointing out that unemployment (arguably the biggest cause of inequality) has fallen steadily in recent years. The Brexit dividend? Q: Do you accept that Britain\u2019s extremely low interest rates mean there is no incentive for businesses to invest capital? No, Carney replies firmly. He doesn\u2019t accept that swathes of \u2018zombie firms\u2019 are being propped up across the UK by extra-low interest rates, making it hard for better firms to compete. The number of such companies has fallen in recent years, he insists, as poor performing companies are driven out of the economy. Instead, Brexit uncertainty has been hurting business investment - as firms decide to sit on the sidelines until the future becomes clearer. Back in parliament, Michael Saunders has been reminded that he\u2019s been outvoted no fewer than five times at the Bank of England when he has pushed, in vain, for interest rates. Q: Why were you outvoted so many times? Well, mathematically, it\u2019s because there were more votes to leave interest rates unchanged, says Saunders patiently. Saunders thinks borrowing costs should have risen faster, to reflect the strong UK labour market. With unemployment at its lowest rate since the early 1970s, wages should be rising (not that we can see much sign of it yet!), so the Bank should be alert for inflationary pressures building. The Treasury has welcome the news that UK borrowing fell last month. A Treasury spokesperson says: \u201cBorrowing is at the lowest level for a decade, which shows our balanced approach is working. We are backing public services, keeping taxes low, and investing \u00a331 billion more in infrastructure and skills as we build an economy that is fit for the future.\u201d Breaking away from parliament.... Britain\u2019s public finances were stronger than expected last month. The UK borrowed \u00a36.2bn in April, down from \u00a37.3bn a year ago. That\u2019s a better start to the new financial year than expected. In another boost, the total deficit for the last financial year was \u00a32bn lower than expected. John Hawksworth, chief economist at PwC, explains: \u201cThere was more good news for the Chancellor on the public finances today, with estimated public borrowing in 2017/18 revised down by just over \u00a32 billion relative to initial estimates published last month. This reflects a combination of stronger tax receipts and lower government spending. Carney adds that the economic activity lost under the snow last winter won\u2019t be clawed back - which is why the Bank was cautious about raising interest rates this month. Q: Why does the Bank of England think the \u2018Beast from the East\u2019 hurt growth in the last quarter, while the Office for National Statistics says snow didn\u2019t have an effect? Mark Carney says the ONS\u2019s data was based on a questionnaire sent to businesses - \u2018very few\u2019 people answered the question, he claims. The Bank, though, sent its regional agents out to actually talk to firms around the country. They reported that the snow had a negative effect. Q: Do you believe the Bank should give more \u2018explicit\u2019 guidance for the future path of interest rates, as Gertjan Vlieghe argued this morning? Deputy governor Dave Ramsden is sceptical that this is a good idea. He thinks it could be \u2018lost in translation\u2019, and mistaken for a promise for how interest rates would change. MPC member Michael Saunders agrees - he tells MPs there is \u201cno way\u201d the Bank could give an unconditional forecast for the path of interest rates. But, Saunders thinks there is value in giving an estimate for the neutral rate of interest (R*, for economists in the room) - the rate at which the economy is growing at its long-term trend rate, while inflation remains stable. Governor Carney says the MPC have discussed the issue, and a majority of members were opposed to giving more explicit guidance. Vlieghe has now been joined by the boss, governor Mark Carney, along with deputy governor Sir Dave Ramsden and fellow external policymaker Michael Saunders. As predicted, Carney is being asked to justify the Bank\u2019s decision to leave interest rate on hold in May, despite hinting at a rise in February. Governor Carney says that Britain\u2019s households and businesses understand the Bank\u2019s position, that interest rates will rise at a limited and gradual rate. They have got that message. On the May decision, Carney says he doesn\u2019t believe that the UK economy is as weak as suggested by the GDP figures for the first quarter of this year (growth of just 0.1%). There were \u201ctemporary, idiosyncratic factors that hit growth in the first quarter\u201d, the governor explains. So he felt it was best to leave interest rates on hold until more data comes in. NEWSFLASH: Bank of England policymaker Gertjan Vlieghe has predicted that interest rates could rise up to six times in the next three years, sending the pound jumping. Vlieghe makes the forecast in his written evidence to the Treasury committee, which has just been released. He predicts there will be one or two 0.25% increases per year, over the next 36 months. His forecast is a little more hawkish than the Bank of England\u2019s own central forecast. Vlieghe says: My current forecast for growth and inflation is consistent with a gradually rising path of interest rates. My own central projection will require one or two quarter point rate increases per year over the three-year forecast period. That path would bring us closer to the neutral policy rate, which I continue to think is likely to be well below the neutral rate that prevailed before the recession. Six quarter-point increases would take UK interest rates up to 2% by 2021, from 0.5% today. This has sent the pound up almost half a cent. Vlieghe adde that there is \u201csignificant uncertainty\u201d in this forecast, partly because he doesn\u2019t know how the UK economy will evolve in the years ahead (especially given the uncertainty created by Brexit). He adds: My central forecast for policy rates is slightly above the conditioning path of rates derived from market yields in the May Inflation Report forecast, which assumes just under three quarter point rate increases over the three-year forecast period. Gertjan Vlieghe has also suggested that the Bank of England could give clearer guidance on interest rate policy. He tells MPs that he has suggested that policymakers give more \u2018explicit\u2019 forecasts for how they think borrowing costs will change in the future. He concedes, though, that this could create a risk - investors could \u201cunderestimate the degree of uncertainty\u201d if central banks become too precise in their communication of the projected future path of interest rates. The US Federal Reserve has a similar policy already - its policymakers create a \u2018dot chart\u2019 each quarter suggesting how many interest rate changes they expect. The Treasury committee is now asking about the Bank of England\u2019s communications. Why did the Bank hint in February that interest rates would rise faster than previously expected, only to leave them on hold in May?. There\u2019s a difference between knowing that the future is uncertain, and not knowing what\u2019s going on, Vlieghe insists. As data comes in, the Bank adjusts its view for the future path of interest rates. Asked about Brexit, Gertjan Vlieghe says that there was \u201cmuch less of a response than we thought\u201d in the immediate aftermath of the referendum in 2016. But there is now a \u201cclear effect\u201d, he adds, citing the \u2018dampening effect\u2019 of Brexit on investment. The Treasury Committee is underway, starting with Gertjan Vlieghe - who is taking up a second three-year term on the Monetary Policy Committee. It\u2019s being streamed live here. Vlieghe cites the pick-up in the global economy, and the \u2018dampening effect\u2019 of the Brexit vote on UK growth, as the two big themes of his first three years Vleighe says he is broadly in line with the Bank\u2019s central forecast - and predicts that UK interest rates will rise very gradually over the next few years. Financial newswire RANsquawk point out that things could be worse for Carney - at least one critic won\u2019t be there today (JRM has moved to parliament\u2019s \u201cExiting the EU Committee\u201d). I suspect that Mark Carney would happily forego today\u2019s inquisition at parliament. He won\u2019t welcome being quizzed about his \u2018forward guidance\u2019 -- the hints about an interest rate rise that didn\u2019t materialise this week. He could do without another debate on Brexit risks too. And he would certainly rather avoid being asked whether he agrees with Ben Broadbent that the UK\u2019s economy is entering a \u2018climacteric\u2019, or \u2018menopausal\u2019, phase. Communication is a key weapon for today\u2019s central bankers. But perhaps Carney should ponder whether \u201cless is more\u201d when he speaks to financial markets. As Bloomberg puts it: After a bruising month that\u2019s seen his own signals on interest rates questioned and one of his deputies forced to apologize for calling the economy menopausal, communication is once again a hot topic for the Bank of England governor. Carney, who arrived at the BOE in 2013 with forward guidance as his signature policy, will come under more scrutiny this week when he faces a grilling from U.K. lawmakers. He\u2019ll also give speeches in London and Stockholm. \u201cSome people would say the safest thing for the Bank of England to do right now is to go back to being mystical,\u201d said Clea Bourne, a senior lecturer and financial communications specialist at Goldsmiths, University of London. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Mark Carney is in the spotlight this morning as MPs quiz the Bank of England governor about the state of the UK economy, and his latest u-turn on interest rates. The Treasury Committee will question Carney, deputy governor Dave Ramsden, and policymakers Michael Saunders and Gertjan Vlieghe, about this month\u2019s quarterly inflation report. They\u2019ll be asked to explain why the Bank\u2019s Monetary Policy Committee left UK borrowing costs unchanged this month at just 0.5%, having previously dropped hints that a rate rise was coming. That decision saw Carney labelled, again, as an \u2018unreliable boyfriend\u2019 for making promises and never sticking to them. But the governor has a defence. He can point to the sharp slowdown in UK growth this year - GDP rose by just 0.1% in January-March. But with unemployment at a 43-year low, and employment at a record high, is the economy really that weak? The quartet can also expect some questions about Brexit, as concern builds about Britain\u2019s likely trading relationships with the EU after 2019. Sterling is looking edgy ahead of the hearing, having dropped below $1.34 yesterday to its lowest level this year. The pound could rally if Carney and colleagues sound confident that rates will rise in the next few months. Michael Hewson of CMC Markets explains what investors will be looking for: Today\u2019s Treasury Select Committee testimony of Messrs Carney, Ramsden, Saunders and Vlieghe are also likely to be important benchmarks as to policymakers thinking with respect to the timing of such a move and in particular David Ramsden and Gertjan Vlieghe\u2019s thinking on it. There won\u2019t be any surprises around Michael Saunders view giving he voted to raise rates last month, and Mark Carney\u2019s view tends to change as often as the weather forecast, but Ramsden\u2019s views are likely to be key given that he suggested in a February interview that rates would have to rise more quickly given recent increases in wages. Against that backdrop it was a bit of a surprise that the Bank of England then proceeded to revise their assessment for wages lower for the rest of this year, so his views on why the central bank has become less bullish on wages are likely to be important, as are Vlieghe\u2019s. Unfortunately, deputy governor Ben Broadbent is not on the panel, so he won\u2019t be called to account for last week\u2019s gaffe (using the word \u2018menopause\u2019 when explaining how Britain\u2019s economy was past its peak). The Treasury Committee will kick off with a session with Gertjan Vlieghe, who is being reappointed for a second term at the MPC. Also coming up today..... We get public finance figures for April, which will probably show that Britain borrowed around \u00a37bn to balance the books last month. There\u2019s also a healthcheck on UK manufacturing from the CBI. European markets are expected to be subdued, after Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 hit a record high yesterday. In the City, bike and car parts chain Halfords, publisher Bloomsbury and building society Nationwide are releasing results (more on that shortly). Plus, oil giant Shell is holding its AGM. Shareholders will be pushing the company to set tougher carbon reduction targets to help tackle global warming. The agenda 9.30am BST: UK public finances for April 10am BST: Treasury committee hearing with Bank of England governor Mark Carney 11am BST: CBI industrial trends survey of UK factories",
