                "bodyText":"Fashion sales are in retreat across the UK as clothing purchases come under pressure from tight household finances and the lure of the gym, restaurants and entertainment. The volume of clothing sold is expected to fall for the second successive year, declining by 0.5% in 2018 after a fall of 0.8% the year before, as the recent woes of Marks &amp; Spencer are reflected across the high street. M&amp;S expanded its store closure programme to 100 sites this week, with the figures from GlobalData showing that the retailer\u2019s problems are an industry-wide issue. Women, who account for more than half the UK market and spend more than twice the amount men do on clothing, are cutting down on outfits and prioritising time with friends and family at pubs, restaurants and events, and going to the gym. \u201cIt comes down to the move to the experience economy,\u201d said Richard Lim, an analyst at Retail Economics. \u201cThe likes of M&amp;S are struggling to keep their head above water in a declining market with all these structural changes.\u201d Spending on women\u2019s clothing was down an average 4.1% a month in the first four months of this year, according to Barclaycard. This followed a 2.5% contraction in 2017, when spending on entertainment was up an average 10% and pubs 12%. Makeup and beauty product sales are on the rise among young women, with many also prioritising paying phone bills, rent and going to the gym. Lim says people either want a bargain \u2013 turning to the likes of Primark, B&amp;M, Aldi and Lidl \u2013 or are seeking rich experiences at higher-end stores such as Ted Baker, Selfridges and Fortnum &amp; Mason. Pointing to the part of the market where M&amp;S is positioned, he added: \u201cPeople are shying away from the middle.\u201d As a consequence, GlobalData expects Primark to overtake M&amp;S this year as Britain\u2019s biggest clothing retailer. The changes in consumer spending are having a painful impact on retail outlets and staff. The M&amp;S closure plan has affected 1,500 jobs so far, with the chain identifying 36 of the 100 stores that will shut over the next four years. New Look is closing up to 60 of its 593 outlets and House of Fraser is expected to close at least 20 of its 59 stores under a rescue restructure planned for next month. Some smaller chains, such as East and Bench, have called in administrators while even the previously fast-growing overseas chains H&amp;M and Inditex, the owner of Zara and Massimo Dutti, have been affected. H&amp;M closed six stores in the UK in the first three months of this year as sales stagnated; Inditex shut two last year. Rising costs from business rates \u2013 a monthly tax on commercial properties \u2013 and a struggle to adapt to shoppers switching to online buying have affected a variety of retailers. Meanwhile, households\u2019 spare cash has been squeezed by a rise in inflation since the EU referendum, although the pressure on prices has eased in recent months.

                "body":"<p>In one fell swoop DIY giant Homebase became the high street\u2019s latest pound shop last week after its Australian owner, Wesfarmers, offloaded the<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/may/25/bunnings-pulls-out-of-britain-after-1bn-plus-disaster\"> loss-making chain for a token sum</a> to a restructuring firm. The deal is expected to trigger fresh pain on a high street that is already shedding stores and jobs at a faster rate than during the recession in 2009. Major high-street names including <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/may/23/marks-and-spencer-reports-sharp-drop-in-annual-profits\">Marks &amp; Spencer</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/apr/19/debenhams-profits-slump-52-beast-from-the-east-sales\">Debenhams</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/may/23/arcadia-owner-tina-green-was-paid-25m-by-taveta-despite-topshop-slump\">Topshop</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/may/10/house-fraser-slides-44m-loss-ahead-chinese-takeover\">House of Fraser</a> are also struggling. On Friday the homewares chain Dunelm issued a profit warning, blaming \u201cchallenging\u201d conditions. So why is life so tough on the high street?</p> <h2>Online rivals</h2> <p>It is hardly a surprise that the high street is under pressure as the internet has hoovered up about a fifth of all retail spending, with non-food sales online rising by 7.5% in the past year. Now smartphones are ubiquitous, it is possible to buy a sofa on the bus, a designer handbag from the sofa or a new kitchen while in bed.</p> <p>The internet has made life challenging for retailers in a number of ways. Apart from directly diverting sales, it has given shoppers less reason to visit their high street, reducing small retailers\u2019 chances of drawing in passing trade, while the cost and complexity of building the infrastructure to deliver goods to homes efficiently has hit profits. As traditional retailers struggle to adapt, they are being pressed by online specialists, such as Asos, Amazon and Boohoo.com, unhindered by a long tail of outdated stores. The ease of comparing prices and accessing goods from around the world has given more options to those based in small towns who are no longer restricted to shopping local, making competition tougher than ever.</p> <p>The internet is also enabling savvy shoppers to trade goods among themselves much more easily. Whether it is bundles of baby clothes selling on Facebook, fashion fans searching for vintage on eBay or Etsy, or teenagers flogging their unwanted impulse purchases on fast-growing mobile app Depop, this market is on the rise. In the US, the fashion resale market, both on and offline, is expected to rise 13% between 2016 and 2021 to $33bn, and new specialist sites such as Hewi (Hardly Ever Worn It) and Vinted as well as Depop are also expected to drive growth in the UK.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"f5904679958514494aa0624f6090f7ae9fec636d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f5904679958514494aa0624f6090f7ae9fec636d/0_0_2169_3014/720.jpg\" alt=\"Amazon fulfilment centre\" width=\"720\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Online specialists such as Amazon are unhindered by a long tail of outdated stores.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jane Barlow/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Rising costs</h2> <p>As traditional retailers battle to fund adapting their businesses to cope with the shift to online shopping, they are being hit with a perfect storm of other cost rises. The fall in the value of the pound following the Brexit vote has pushed up the cost of sourcing goods abroad. The impending exit from the EU and lower value of sterling have also acted to push up wages in some areas as it has been more difficult to find skilled workers who have traditionally come from mainland Europe, such as van drivers. The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/apr/13/how-much-is-an-hour-worth-the-war-over-the-minimum-wage\">rise in the legal minimum wage</a> and imposition of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/nils-pratley-on-finance/2018/jan/25/ministers-should-listen-employers-apprenticeship-levy\">apprenticeship levy</a> have also pushed up costs, as has a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/nov/04/hammond-under-pressure-to-axe-business-rates-rise\">rise in business rates</a> this year. While some businesses have seen a cut, and many small stores were protected, those in the south, particularly in London, have seen major rate rises. About 1,400 shops, pubs, restaurants and hotels received an average rise of almost \u00a350,000 according to property adviser Altus Group.</p> <h2>Consumption fatigue</h2> <p>After years of filling their wardrobes and homes with material possessions, Brits appear to have reached \u201cpeak stuff\u201d. Young people are now more likely to be renters rather than buyers, meaning they\u2019ve no yearning to fill a bottom drawer with household goods they may have to lug between short-term lets. Barclaycard data for last year reveals a 10% increase in spending on entertainment and an 11.4% rise in spending on telecoms, which of course doesn\u2019t include all those direct debits paying for long-term phone contracts. Entertainment, pubs and restaurant spending was all up in double-digit percentages last year, according to Barclaycard, but women\u2019s clothing spending was down. The latest data from Visa indicates that spending on household goods and clothing continues to fall, while restaurants, hotels, pubs and bars are still on the up.</p> <h2>High-street decline</h2> <p>Retailers are currently closing stores at a faster rate than during the recession, but despite the underlying issues being well rehearsed, no coherent plan has emerged to tackle high-street decline. Some 50,000 stores are deemed surplus to requirements and MPs have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/may/10/mps-to-investigate-ways-of-reviving-online-hit-high-streets-inquiry-shopping\">recently launched a fresh inquiry</a>, with the goal of drawing up a vision of what high streets and town centres could look like by 2030. There is no shortage of brain power being devoted to this emotive subject; retail guru Bill Grimsey is currently <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/mar/12/retail-tsar-restarts-taskforce-amid-high-street-crisis\">leading a taskforce that is revisiting his influential 2013 review.</a> But while MPs and retail experts bang their heads together, the pace of decline only accelerates. Last week Marks &amp; Spencer confirmed plans <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/may/22/marks-spencer-close-stores\">to close 100 of its traditional high-street stores by 2022 as sales move online</a>. M&amp;S\u2019s predicament typifies that of large chains with long histories: stores opened on once-thriving high streets are now surrounded by discount stores and fast-food outlets. If shoppers have abandoned a high street and shops are ever more expensive to run, how can retailers be expected to stay?</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"30e99239ccfcd2fb261e9f1672de15fcf694041a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/30e99239ccfcd2fb261e9f1672de15fcf694041a/0_0_4500_3000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"M&S store front\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">M&amp;S\u2019s predicament typifies that of large chains with long histories: stores opened on once thriving high streets are now surrounded by discount stores and fast food outlets.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jack Taylor/Getty</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up for Business Today\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4139\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for Business Today\" data-form-description=\"Get the headlines and editors' picks every weekday morning.\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe>\u00a0 <figcaption>Business today: Get the headlines and editors\u2019 picks every weekday morning.</figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>Bad management</strong></h2> <p>Retail executives have plenty of excuses up their sleeves \u2013 ranging from the weather to declining footfall and the rise of the internet \u2013 for falling sales but no one admits to lacking skills and vision. The world wide web has been around for more than 25 years so retail bosses have had plenty of time to get used to the idea and adapt their businesses. Nearly 50% of Next\u2019s \u00a34bn sales are rung up online, whereas last week Marks &amp; Spencer admitted that despite spending the best part of \u00a3400m on its website operation, it is still too clunky and needs more money thrown at it. There are clear instances of bad management heightening the pressure created by the structural change bearing down on the high street: Homebase, which employs more than 11,000 people, was sold for just \u00a31 after its new Australian owners, Wesfarmers, made terrible decisions that turned a profitable business into a massive loss-maker; the struggling <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/may/17/mothercare-to-close-50-outlets-and-reinstate-ousted-ceo\">Mothercare</a> chain can no longer persuade new parents to shop there despite around 1,900 babies being born every day. Analysts level claims of inexperience at the bosses of retail chains such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/may/02/house-of-fraser-to-close-stores-restructuring-deal-jobs-at-risk-chinese-firm-cbanner\">House of Fraser</a>, which has joined a long list of household names that includes <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/mar/21/carpetright-moss-bros-kingfisher-high-street-retail-mothercare\">Carpetright, New Look and Mothercare</a> resorting to company voluntary arrangements (CVA), a form of insolvency, to jettison their weakest stores.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"309fc9b1fc861a48565441e6512ff071a5d31b44\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/309fc9b1fc861a48565441e6512ff071a5d31b44/0_168_5029_3017/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Homebase\u2019s Australian owners, Wesfarmers, saw a profitable business become a massive loss-maker.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Homebase\u2019s Australian owners, Wesfarmers, saw a profitable business become a massive loss-maker.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Spending squeeze</h2> <p>Consumers <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/mar/21/uk-earnings-interest-rate-rise-wages\">have just escaped a long period of falling real income</a> and the scars are now becoming visible on the high street.</p> <p>Last year saw inflation rise to 3%, while wages remained stuck between 2% and 2.5%. According to pay experts, most wage bargaining deals signed last year were nearer 2%. That made for a significant fall in inflation-adjusted earnings and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/jun/14/pay-squeeze-wages-growth-inflation-ons-unemployment-rate\">depressed the disposable incomes of most shoppers</a>.</p> <p>It wasn\u2019t supposed to be this way, with employment at record levels and unemployment so low that it has dropped to levels last seen in the 1970s. What many economists depict as full employment was meant to send wage rates soaring.</p> <p>However, Brexit uncertainty \u2013 and the transformation of working life following the rise of self-employment, part-time jobs and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/apr/23/number-of-zero-hours-contracts-in-uk-rose-by-100000-in-2017-ons\">zero-hours contracts</a> \u2013 more than offset the pressure from rising vacancy rates to send household incomes falling backwards. A lack of investment by British business has also played its part, keeping productivity and wage rises low.</p> <p>To maintain their standard of living, consumers have ramped up their borrowing, especially to buy cars and other big-ticket items. They have also run down their savings. The hope is that falling inflation this year will allow real incomes to rise again and a credit binge can be avoided. That\u2019s what most forecasters expect, though the twists and turns of Brexit could wreck that prediction.</p>",

Whether it is bundles of baby clothes selling on Facebook, fashion fans searching for vintage on eBay or Etsy, or teenagers flogging their unwanted impulse purchases on fast-growing mobile app Depop, this market is on the rise. In the US, the fashion resale market, both on and offline, is expected to rise 13% between 2016 and 2021 to $33bn, and new specialist sites such as Hewi (Hardly Ever Worn It) and Vinted as well as Depop are also expected to drive growth in the UK. Rising costs As traditional retailers battle to fund adapting their businesses to cope with the shift to online shopping, they are being hit with a perfect storm of other cost rises. The fall in the value of the pound following the Brexit vote has pushed up the cost of sourcing goods abroad. The impending exit from the EU and lower value of sterling have also acted to push up wages in some areas as it has been more difficult to find skilled workers who have traditionally come from mainland Europe, such as van drivers. The rise in the legal minimum wage and imposition of the apprenticeship levy have also pushed up costs, as has a rise in business rates this year. While some businesses have seen a cut, and many small stores were protected, those in the south, particularly in London, have seen major rate rises. About 1,400 shops, pubs, restaurants and hotels received an average rise of almost \u00a350,000 according to property adviser Altus Group. Consumption fatigue After years of filling their wardrobes and homes with material possessions, Brits appear to have reached \u201cpeak stuff\u201d. Young people are now more likely to be renters rather than buyers, meaning they\u2019ve no yearning to fill a bottom drawer with household goods they may have to lug between short-term lets. Barclaycard data for last year reveals a 10% increase in spending on entertainment and an 11.4% rise in spending on telecoms, which of course doesn\u2019t include all those direct debits paying for long-term phone contracts. Entertainment, pubs and restaurant spending was all up in double-digit percentages last year, according to Barclaycard, but women\u2019s clothing spending was down. The latest data from Visa indicates that spending on household goods and clothing continues to fall, while restaurants, hotels, pubs and bars are still on the up. High-street decline Retailers are currently closing stores at a faster rate than during the recession, but despite the underlying issues being well rehearsed, no coherent plan has emerged to tackle high-street decline. Some 50,000 stores are deemed surplus to requirements and MPs have recently launched a fresh inquiry, with the goal of drawing up a vision of what high streets and town centres could look like by 2030. There is no shortage of brain power being devoted to this emotive subject; retail guru Bill Grimsey is currently leading a taskforce that is revisiting his influential 2013 review. But while MPs and retail experts bang their heads together, the pace of decline only accelerates. Last week Marks &amp; Spencer confirmed plans to close 100 of its traditional high-street stores by 2022 as sales move online. M&amp;S\u2019s predicament typifies that of large chains with long histories: stores opened on once-thriving high streets are now surrounded by discount stores and fast-food outlets. If shoppers have abandoned a high street and shops are ever more expensive to run, how can retailers be expected to stay? Bad management Retail executives have plenty of excuses up their sleeves \u2013 ranging from the weather to declining footfall and the rise of the internet \u2013 for falling sales but no one admits to lacking skills and vision. The world wide web has been around for more than 25 years so retail bosses have had plenty of time to get used to the idea and adapt their businesses. Nearly 50% of Next\u2019s \u00a34bn sales are rung up online, whereas last week Marks &amp; Spencer admitted that despite spending the best part of \u00a3400m on its website operation, it is still too clunky and needs more money thrown at it. There are clear instances of bad management heightening the pressure created by the structural change bearing down on the high street: Homebase, which employs more than 11,000 people, was sold for just \u00a31 after its new Australian owners, Wesfarmers, made terrible decisions that turned a profitable business into a massive loss-maker; the struggling Mothercare chain can no longer persuade new parents to shop there despite around 1,900 babies being born every day. Analysts level claims of inexperience at the bosses of retail chains such as House of Fraser, which has joined a long list of household names that includes Carpetright, New Look and Mothercare resorting to company voluntary arrangements (CVA), a form of insolvency, to jettison their weakest stores. Spending squeeze Consumers have just escaped a long period of falling real income and the scars are now becoming visible on the high street. Last year saw inflation rise to 3%, while wages remained stuck between 2% and 2.5%. According to pay experts, most wage bargaining deals signed last year were nearer 2%. That made for a significant fall in inflation-adjusted earnings and depressed the disposable incomes of most shoppers. It wasn\u2019t supposed to be this way, with employment at record levels and unemployment so low that it has dropped to levels last seen in the 1970s. What many economists depict as full employment was meant to send wage rates soaring. However, Brexit uncertainty \u2013 and the transformation of working life following the rise of self-employment, part-time jobs and zero-hours contracts \u2013 more than offset the pressure from rising vacancy rates to send household incomes falling backwards. A lack of investment by British business has also played its part, keeping productivity and wage rises low. To maintain their standard of living, consumers have ramped up their borrowing, especially to buy cars and other big-ticket items. They have also run down their savings. The hope is that falling inflation this year will allow real incomes to rise again and a credit binge can be avoided. That\u2019s what most forecasters expect, though the twists and turns of Brexit could wreck that prediction.",
