Crossley said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no such thing as a free lunch when it comes to promised price reductions. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Cheaper prices for customers are likely to be unaffordable for farmers, suppliers, farm animals and for the environment. At a time when we need to face up to climatic shocks and resource scarcity, we need a resilient food system \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and the best route to resilience is diversity.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd",

The bid, which values the business at \u00c2\u00a32.2bn, is almost a third higher than ZPG\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s closing price on Thursday.</p> <p>The deal has been backed by more than 31% of investors including ZPG\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest investor DMGT, the parent company of the Daily Mail, which is in line for a \u00c2\u00a3640m pay day from the sale of its 29.9% stake. </p> <p>Alex Chesterman, the Zoopla founder and chief executive, is in line to make about \u00c2\u00a360m from the sale of the 12.5m shares he has in the business.</p> <p>It marks the latest successful exit of a business for serial entrepreneur Chesterman, who set up Zoopla in 2007 a year after he merged his online DVD rental business ScreenSelect with LoveFilm. LoveFilm was then sold to Amazon in 2011 for \u00c2\u00a3200m.<br></p> <p>\u00e2\u20ac\u0153Silver Lake is the global leader in technology investing and I am firmly of the belief that ZPG will benefit from their technology expertise and global network which will help accelerate our growth,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Chesterman. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I am very excited about the opportunity this offers to our employees, customers and partners as we move to the next stage of ZPG\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s development and growth.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd</p> <p>ZPG, which made a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/jun/18/zoopla-float-property-website-919m-pounds\">\u00c2\u00a31bn stock market flotation in 2014</a>, is being taken over six months after its <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/nov/14/gocompare-rejects-opportunistic-takeover-bid-zoopla-owner-zpg\">\u00c2\u00a3460m bid for rival GoCompare was rejected</a>. Shares in ZPG, which acquired uSwitch in 2015 for \u00c2\u00a3190m, jumped by more than 30% in early trading, while rival Rightmove rose by 5%.</p> <p>The deal has been agreed by ZPG\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s board but Silver Lake, which last year raised a $15bn (\u00c2\u00a311bn) fund to back a new round of tech deals, needs to gain approval from 75% of the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shareholders.. </p> <p>\u00e2\u20ac\u0153ZPG is a great growth technology company,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Simon Patterson, managing director of Silver Lake. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It has established strong positions in property classifieds, home and financial services markets by innovating in product and marketing.

He received an OBE in 2016 for services to digital entrepreneurship.</p> <h2>Profile of Zoopla founder</h2> <p>It was a parking ticket and a late fine on a video rental that turned the Zoopla founder, Alex Chesterman, into one of Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s most successful digital entrepreneurs.</p> <p>After working for Planet Hollywood in the US in the 1990s, he set up a UK bagels and coffee chain called Bagelmania. However, when he had to pay \u00c2\u00a352 in fines returning a DVD he started an online business renting out DVDs by post. In 2003 ScreenSelect was born.

                "bodyText":"The company behind the UK property sites Zoopla and PrimeLocation and the price comparison service uSwitch is being bought by a US private equity firm in a \u00c2\u00a32.2bn deal. California-based tech investor Silver Lake, which has investments in companies including Alibaba, GoDaddy and Tesla, has agreed a 490p a share bid for parent company ZPG. The bid, which values the business at \u00c2\u00a32.2bn, is almost a third higher than ZPG\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s closing price on Thursday. The deal has been backed by more than 31% of investors including ZPG\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest investor DMGT, the parent company of the Daily Mail, which is in line for a \u00c2\u00a3640m pay day from the sale of its 29.9% stake. Alex Chesterman, the Zoopla founder and chief executive, is in line to make about \u00c2\u00a360m from the sale of the 12.5m shares he has in the business. It marks the latest successful exit of a business for serial entrepreneur Chesterman, who set up Zoopla in 2007 a year after he merged his online DVD rental business ScreenSelect with LoveFilm. LoveFilm was then sold to Amazon in 2011 for \u00c2\u00a3200m. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Silver Lake is the global leader in technology investing and I am firmly of the belief that ZPG will benefit from their technology expertise and global network which will help accelerate our growth,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Chesterman. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I am very excited about the opportunity this offers to our employees, customers and partners as we move to the next stage of ZPG\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s development and growth.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd ZPG, which made a \u00c2\u00a31bn stock market flotation in 2014, is being taken over six months after its \u00c2\u00a3460m bid for rival GoCompare was rejected. Shares in ZPG, which acquired uSwitch in 2015 for \u00c2\u00a3190m, jumped by more than 30% in early trading, while rival Rightmove rose by 5%. The deal has been agreed by ZPG\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s board but Silver Lake, which last year raised a $15bn (\u00c2\u00a311bn) fund to back a new round of tech deals, needs to gain approval from 75% of the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shareholders.. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153ZPG is a great growth technology company,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Simon Patterson, managing director of Silver Lake. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It has established strong positions in property classifieds, home and financial services markets by innovating in product and marketing. We are delighted to partner with Alex Chesterman, one of Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s leading and most accomplished technology entrepreneurs, to invest in ZPG\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s continued growth.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Silver Lake said it did not expect to make any material headcount reductions following the completion of the deal and that it would preserve ZPG\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s existing management team, brand and culture to ensure continuity. Westhorpe, a subsidiary of Singaporean sovereign wealth fund GIC, and Canadian pension fund PSP will also take a minority stake by co-investing in ZPG with Silver Lake. Before Zoopla, Chesterman set up Bagelmania, a chain of bagel bars, and has invested in British start-ups including Graze, Secret Escapes and Farmdrop. He received an OBE in 2016 for services to digital entrepreneurship. Profile of Zoopla founder It was a parking ticket and a late fine on a video rental that turned the Zoopla founder, Alex Chesterman, into one of Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s most successful digital entrepreneurs. After working for Planet Hollywood in the US in the 1990s, he set up a UK bagels and coffee chain called Bagelmania. However, when he had to pay \u00c2\u00a352 in fines returning a DVD he started an online business renting out DVDs by post. In 2003 ScreenSelect was born. It merged with smaller rival Lovefilm and become the biggest DVD rental service in Europe. It was eventually sold to Amazon for \u00c2\u00a3200m in 2011. Chesterman launched Zoopla in 2007 to simplify home buying and rentals. A \u00c2\u00a31bn stock market flotation came in 2014. He has invested millions into other tech startups, including the snack box provider Graze, the holidays firm Secret Escapes and the farm produce distributor Farmdrop.",

And Brent crude continues to hold onto much of its gains, thanks to the threat of reduced supplies from Iran after the US withdrew from the nuclear deal. It is up 1.27% at $80.29 a barrel. On that note, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time to close for the day. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be back tomorrow. The rise in the oil price has helped push the FTSE 100 to a new closing high. The UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s leading index has been in fairly positive mood recently, along with other markets, after hopes that the US and China could resolve their trade differences. The continuing strength of the dollar against the pound has also been supporting the market, given the FTSE 100 is packed full of overseas earners which benefit when sterling is weaker. Brent\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s surge to $80 has given the index its final push to a new record close of 7787.97, up 0.7%. However it is still just below the intra-day record of 7792.56 set on 12 January this year. Meanwhile the FTSE 250 did hit a new peak, helped by the extraordinary jump in Ocado shares. Fiona Cincotta, senior market analyst at City Index, also thinks Brent could hit $100 a barrel: Fundamentally the price looks well supported here, OPEC are showing they are in no rush to end production cuts, Venezuela\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s oil industry is collapsing under its economic and political crisis and US sanctions aimed at Iran\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s oil industry are kicking in. Whilst US production is a constraint on the price, right now this is overshadowed by the Iran Venezuela shortfall. Could oil go higher? Venezuela\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s problems are unlikely to be resolved anytime soon and could be exasperated if the Trump aims sanctions at the troubled country following rigged and unfair elections; also if the US can get China to loosen energy ties with Iran, then regardless of increased US shale production, the price could close in on $100. Brent crude is currently up 0.86% at $79.96 a barrel, having earlier risen as high as $80.18. And the FTSE 100\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s energy companies are benefiting from the rise and helping to lift the leading index close to its record high. It is up 0.4% at 7767, around 25 points below its peak. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said: It took a while, but the FTSE finally become receptive to Brent Crude\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s latest rise, lifting the UK index that bit closer to a fresh all-time high.....Though not much has changed with Brent Crude \u00e2\u20ac\u201c it is still dancing about the $80 per barrel mark \u00e2\u20ac\u201c comments from Total CEO Patrick Pouyanne that the black stuff could hit $100 in the coming months if oil companies aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t given waivers by the US to work in Iran helped boost BP and Shell, in turn lifting the FTSE higher. My colleague Adam Vaughan has been looking at the reasons behind the surge in oil prices: Another voice adding to those suggesting oil has much further to climb. Following news that Total will quit Iran unless it gets a waiver from the US, the boss of the French energy giant has predicted crude at $100 a barrel: Worries about the trade talks between the US and China, along with President Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s withdrawal from the Iranian nuclear deal, continue to unsettle US equity investors. Add to that US bond yields hitting a new seven year high and a disappointing update from Cisco, and Wall Street has opened in negative territory. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 26 points or 0.1% while the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq Composite slipped by similar amounts at the open. Back with Iran and the US sanctions which have driven up the oil price to above $80 a barrel, and Europe is prepared to defend its businesses from the fallout. Reuters reports: The European Union will stick to the Iran deal and the bloc\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s leaders have mandated their Brussels-based executive to defend the interests of European companies dealing with Tehran from U.S. sanctions if needed, a top EU official said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153On the Iran nuclear deal, we agreed unanimously that the EU will stay in the agreement as long as Iran remains fully committed to it. Additionally the Commission was given a green light to be ready to act whenever European interests are affected,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd the chairman of a two-day EU leaders\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 summit in the Bulgarian capital, Donald Tusk, told a news conference. The head of the bloc\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s executive European Commission, Jean-Claude Juncker, told the same conference that the EU was ready to start trade liberalisation talks with the United States in some areas if Washington gives permanent exemptions from aluminum and steel tariffs. Over in the US, weekly jobless claims have risen by more than expected. The number of Americans claiming unemployment benefit increased to 222,000 from 211,000 the previous week, higher than the forecast 215,000. But the four week average fell to 213,250 from 216,000, according to the Labor Department, the lowest level for this average since December 13, 1969 when it was 210,750. Elsewhere in the markets, shares in online supermarket retailer Ocado have shot through the roof after it finally landed a major international deal. Ocado has been promising a big overseas tie-up for literally years, and today it delivered thanks to an alliance with US grocer giant Kroger. Kroger will used Ocado\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s technology to upgrade its warehouse operations, automation, logistics and delivery route planning in the US. This should strengthen its hand in the battle against Amazon, as grocers look to automate their systems and use robots to speed up processes and cut costs. Ocado\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shares have rocketed by up to 75% today, as traders bet that this deal is as transformation as Kroger claims. That drove its value up from around \u00c2\u00a33.7bn to \u00c2\u00a36bn, enough to get into the FTSE 100. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a disaster for the hedge funds who have been short-selling Ocado\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shares, betting that it would fail to achieve international expansion. As Neil Wilson of Markets.com explains, Ocado now seems to have real momentum. Bagging a giant US retailer is a major coup for [Ocado CEO] Tim Steiner and as previously noted, we should see many more deals. Shares are priced for these deals to be coming thick and fast. Peter Kiernan of the Economist Intelligence Unit say\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Total\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s (likely) withdrawal from Iran shows that Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sanctions could have a serious impact on the Iranian economy. Kiernan explains: The announcement by Total that that it will leave South Pars 11, unless it is granted a waiver from US secondary sanctions, reflects the likelihood that European energy companies with exposure to the American market or financial system will be unwilling to risk US penalties by deciding to participate in Iran\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s oil and gas sector. Iran will seek alternative sources of investment, such as Chinese companies, to get the funds it requires to develop its energy sector instead, but Iran\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s likely inability to attract major European companies going forward will be a setback. The Total announcement also gives notice to the difficulties that European policymakers could face in the longer term as they try to keep Iran itself in the nuclear agreement. If investment in Iran does dry up and Iran\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s oil exports are significantly cut, both due to US pressures, it will make Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s role in keeping the nuclear deal alive more problematic. China is poised to step in if France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Total does indeed pull out of the Iranian South Pars 11 gas field project (as seems likely). Iran\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s oil minister, Bijan Namdar Zanganeh, has revealed that state-owned Chinese oil firm CNPC is waiting in the wings, if needed. Zanganeh said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Total has said that if it doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get an exemption from the United States to continue its work, it will begin to pull out of the deal. If that happens, the Chinese firm CNPC will replace Total.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Given its strong rally over the last year, analysts are wondering how much higher oil could go. Morgan Stanley have predicted that Brent will trade at $90 per barrel in 2020, thanks to increased demand for diesel (due to new anti-pollution rules on shipping) and jet fuel. Bank of America Merrill Lynch is even more bullish. It estimates that oil could hit $100 per barrel next year, due to supply constrains from Iran (due to sanctions) and Venezuela (where political instability could hit supplies). Francisco Blanch, head of commodities research at BAML, says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Looking into the next 18 months, we expect global oil supply and demand balances to tighten.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd US crude oil has also hit its highest level since 2014. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s up nearly 1% at over $72 per barrel, mirroring today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rise in Brent crude (which is sourced from the North Sea) Rising oil prices are a boost to the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s crude producers, but a blow to those countries who are net importers of energy. For them, $80 per barrel oil means higher inflation, and could be bad for growth if consumers have less disposable income to spend once they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve covered their fuel and energy costs. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s some instant reaction: Newsflash: Brent crude has hit $80 per barrel for the first time since November 2014. The news that Total is planning to withdaw from its large Iran gas field deal has pushed prices steadily higher this morning. The price of a barrel of Brent crude has now gained more than 16% since early April, as traders anticipate supply shortages if geopolitical tensions in the Middle East continue to rise. Norbert Ruecker, head of macro and commodity research at Julius Baer, says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Supply concerns are top of mind after the U.S. left the Iran nuclear deal. The geopolitical noise and escalation fears are here to stay.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Now this is interesting.... Iranian state TV is reporting that a British consortium called Pergas has signed a deal to develop an oil field in the south of Iran. Associated Press have the details: The agreement is the first between Iran and a key Western ally of the United States since Washington last week announced it will pull out of the landmark 2015 nuclear deal between Iran and Western powers. Managing Director of Pergas International Consortium Colin Rowley, and Bijan Alipour, managing director of National Iranian South Oil Co., signed a preliminary deed on the partnership in the presence of British Ambassador Rob Macaire in Tehran on Wednesday night. The project, if the agreement turns into a contract, will require more than $1 billion to produce 200,000 barrels of crude oil per day during the next decade in the 55-year old Karanj oil filed. But what about the prospect of US sanctions? Well....Pergas is clear that its focus is on the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Eastern Hemisphere\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, with projects in the Middle East, South East Asia and Africa. It must feel safe from Washington\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s threat to ban foreign firms from accessing the entire US banking and financial system if they deal with Iran. Total isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t alone! Moller-Maersk, the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest shipping firm is also planning to pull out of Iran. Moller-Maersk\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s CEO, Soren Skou, says it will withdraw because of the threat of sanctions from America on any company which maintains links with the Iranians. Skou told Reuters: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153With the sanctions the Americans are to impose, you can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t do business in Iran if you also have business in the U.S., and we have that on a large scale. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know the exact timing details, but I am certain that we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re also going to shut down (in Iran)\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Skou was speaking after Moller-Maersk reported an \u00e2\u20ac\u0153unsatisfactory\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd underlying loss of $239m in the last three months. It blamed the rising \u00e2\u20ac\u0153geopolitical risks\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and the threat of a trade war for driving down shipping rates. French president Emmanuel Macron has weighed in, calling on the European Union to protect companies who want to keep trading with Iran. Speaking at an EU summit in Sofia, Bulgaria, Macron said that France backed a proposal for the EC to protect and compensate European companies hit by US sanctions. Called \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcblocking sanctions\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, they could provide a way for Europe to keep the Iran deal alive. Asked about Total\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s threat to quit Iran, Macron told reporters that multinational companies must make their own decisions - but smaller companies needed protection to keep operating in Iran if they want to. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153International companies with interests in many countries make their own choices according to their own interests. They should continue to have this freedom.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd But what is important is that companies and especially medium-sized companies which are perhaps less exposed to other markets, American or others, can make this choice freely.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Brent is creeping higher, and has touched $76.62 per barrel. Oil\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s push to a new three and a half-year high threatens to keep inflation up, hitting households and eroding real wages: Oil is also getting a lift from new data showing that US inventories fell by 1.4 million barrels last week. That suggests stronger demand for crude stocks - which should push prices higher. Total\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s threat to quit its Iran gas project is significant because it shows that the whole Iranian nuclear deal could unravel. As well as withdrawing from the agreement this month, president Trump declared that companies worldwide must stop doing business with Iran or risk US fines or other punishment. If Total pulls out, other companies will be more reluctant to invest in Iran - a blow to President Hassan Rouhani\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hopes of attracting new investment. Rouhani travelled to Davos in 2014 in an attempt to encourage international firms to invest in Iran; he had hope to attract $200bn of energy infrastructure investments by 2021. Sanam Vakil, associate fellow at Chatham House, said Total\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s announcement was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a bad sign, adding: The EU can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t compel or really protect the private sector. Bjarne Schieldrop, an oil analyst at SEB, told the Financial Times that it undermines Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s efforts to keep the Iran nuclear deal alive: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Total\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s action . . . backs up the idea that no one sees an easy solution here and that there is little expectation of US leniency,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Whatever the politicians in Europe are saying, the private companies are just pulling out and folding the cards.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. The oil price is heading towards $80 per barrel for the first time since 2014, as Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision to impose sanctions on Iran continues to reverberate through the financial markets. French energy giant Total announced it would withdraw from a Iranian gas deal before the end of the year, unless it gets a waiver. In a statement last night, Total explained: Total will not continue the SP11 (South Pars 11) project and will have to unwind all related operations before 4 November 2018, unless Total is granted a specific project waiver by US authorities with the support of the French and European authorities. This looks like a blow to Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hopes of keeping its current economic ties with Iran intact, following America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s withdrawal from the Iranian nuclear deal earlier this month. The SP11 agreement was signed last July, making Total the first major Western energy company to invest in the Islamic Republic since sanctions were lifted in 2016. Now, though, Total is worried that it would be sanctioned by the US authorities if it kept dealing with Iran. The potential penalties from Washington simply look unpalatable. The news sent Brent crude jumping to $79.47, a three and a half-year high. This puts $80 in traders\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 sights - and leaving motorists facing higher prices at the pumps. Mihir Kapadia, CEO and founder of Sun Global Investments, agrees that geopolitical tensions are driving energy prices higher, with unrest is building in Venezuela ahead of this weekend\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s presidential elections. Kapadia explains: Venezuela\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s situation grows increasingly worrying and the expected drop in production from Iran means that prices are expected to reach four-year highs once again. There are still concerns as to how increasing oil prices will affect the U.S. and global economy, and with tensions in the Middle East also growing, the next few months is likely to see the market become highly volatile.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Also coming up today: Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bookmakers are reeling from the news that the maximum stake on their fixed-odds betting terminals (FOBTs) must be cut from \u00c2\u00a3100 to \u00c2\u00a32, in an attempt to tackle the social damage caused by gambling. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also a busy morning in the City, with estate agent Foxtons warning that the London property market remains \u00e2\u20ac\u0153very challenging\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, Ocado landing a partnership with US retailer Kroger, and Mothercare announcing the return of once-sacked CEO Mark Newton-Jones. Holiday operator Thomas Cook and Royal Mail are also updating the market. The agenda: 1.30pm BST: US weekly jobless figures 5pm BST: Bank of England chief economist Andy Haldane speaks in London",

Africa is seen as particularly vulnerable after decades of underinvestment that has left many countries with seemingly little option but to accept the terms laid down by the tech giants. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Tech companies like to project a modern, progressive image to the world.

If bond market vigilantes want to send a message, they will have to throw a proper tantrum: 2.39% probably doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t even register on the populists\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 radar.",

Now just 100 points away, with momentum on its side and the pound looking more fragile than it has for a while, 8000 is a very reasonable target.</p> <p>The inverse relationship that exists between the pound and the FTSE thanks to a large percentage of FTSE firms earning revenue outside of the UK, is expected to help the FTSE break higher into unchartered territory towards 8000, sooner rather than later. After weeks of softer than forecast UK economic data, most recently a fall in factory output to the lowest level in two years, plus Brexit uncertainties and a BoE that is happy to sit on the side-lines, key factors are aligned for a soft pound and another push higher by the FTSE.</p> <p>With the harsh weather conditions well behind us, the outlook for the economy is looking up, according to the BoE, making an August rate hike once again a possibility. Should investors start to believe that the August hike is well and truly back on the table, the pound could start to pick up off year to date lows, making it harder for the FTSE to reach 8000. With this in mind, the FTSE\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s final move higher to 8000 needs to be in the bag sooner rather than later to guarantee a hit, otherwise a stronger pound is likely to prevent that psychological level being struck this summer. </p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5b043ae8e4b0738b88745de0\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-05-22T15:46:29.439Z\">4.46pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">FTSE 100 hits new closing high</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s leading share index has closed at a new record, but it is off the intra-day highs it recorded earlier in the afternoon.</p> <p>The FTSE 100 finished up 0.23% at 7877.45 having early climbed to a new all time peak of 7903.50. </p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5b0435a3e4b05aef3eee8748\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-05-22T15:23:07.796Z\">4.23pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Chinese plans to cut import tariffs on US cars has helped support markets. Joshua Mahony, market analyst at IG, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p> European markets are pushing upwards amid improving US-Chinese trade talks, and a weakening pound. The pound has been suffering in late trade, coming off the back of a CBI report that showed UK manufacturing output to be growing at the slowest rate in two-years. With manufacturing failing to gather momentum, there is a fear that we will see the focus of UK economic weakness shift from construction in Q1 to manufacturing in Q2....</p> <p>Improving US-Chinese relations continue to help improve risk sentiment as the week progresses, with news that China has pledged to reduce levies on automakers and car parts helping the likes of General Electric gain ground. While car makers welcomed news that China will cut tariffs on both imported cars (15% from 25%) and car parts (6% from average of 10%), these still remain comparatively high and are unlikely to alter the status quo of firms basing production in China to avoid such levies. China remains the largest car producing nation in the world, and this token gesture is unlikely to really make any dent in that dynamic.</p> <p> While the benefits from this reduction in Chinese levies are questionable, the decision to let ZTE off the hook for brazenly defying US sanctions on Iran and North Korea is a big boost for China given they employed 80,000 workers.

One: the performance of Brent Crude. The black stuff re-crossed $80 per barrel on Tuesday as supply concerns relating to Venezuela and Iran continued to heighten. However, BP and Shell were resistant to this rise, instead falling 1.2% and 0.6% respectively. If the FTSE is to keep rising, then its oil colossi need to get on board. </p> <p>Two: how sterling reacts to the week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s data. The inflation reading on Wednesday and the 2<sup>nd</sup> estimate Q1 GDP figure on Friday are both potential lightning rods for a pound-rebound, dependant on whether or not they beat the expected stagnation.

Mihir Kapadia, chief executive of Sun Global Investments, said: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The prospect of further Iran sanctions coupled with the disputed election results in Venezuela have helped to firm oil prices. President Trump and the White House have made clear that any new Iran deal would require the country to stop enriching all uranium and halt support for militant groups in the region. Iran\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s government has rejected these demands, increasing the chance that the US could impose severe economic sanctions on the country. Sanctions would reduce oil supply. The possibility of a drastic fall in Iran\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s output has helped to support oil prices in recent months. </p> <p>Oil prices were also pushed higher by the disputed election in Venezuela. The US has promptly responded with sanctions that seek to greatly restrict investment in debts issued by the Venezuelan government or Venezuelan agencies, although the US did not ban the purchase of oil itself.

So within a few months (if Labour wins power), the Bank of England could be given a new remit to target unemployment as well as inflation.</p> <p><em>Q: Is the Bank of England prepared for a change in your remit?</em></p> <p>Carney says he believes the Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s remit should indeed be reviewed every five to eight years.

                "bodyText":"Further optimism that a trade war between the US and China could be averted has helped lift European markets, despite a drag from Wall Street. Apart from the FTSE 100 reaching a new peak, other major markets also ended higher, even in Italy despite continuing concerns about the plans of its new coalition. As for the US, there were more signs of strength in the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy with a new manufacturing survey. Dave Madden of CMC Markets said: The US Richmond manufacturing index soared to 16 in May from -3 in April. Economists were expecting a reading of 9. The solid manufacturing report underlines the strength of the US economy. Some traders predict the Federal Reserve will raise rates three more times in 2018, and economic announcements like this reinforce their beliefs. The final scores in Europe showed: The FTSE 100 finished up 0.23% or 18.28 points at 7877.45 Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax rose 0.71% to13,169.92 France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac climbed 0.05% to 5640.10 Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB added 0.54% to 23,216.57 Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ibex ended up 0.72% at 10,138.8 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 37 points or 0.15%. On that note, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time to close for the day. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be back tomorrow. More on a possible UK interest rate rise this year, following the select committee appearance of Bank of England policymakers this morning. Andrew Wilson at Goldman Sachs Asset Management, said: Comments concerning monetary policy largely echo this month\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Monetary Policy Meeting. We still see scope for one rate hike this year, most likely in the fourth quarter and we think the pace of UK monetary tightening thereafter will be gradual given uncertainties around determinants of recent activity softness. We also suspect policymakers will await further clarity from macro data before providing further guidance on the timing of any future rate hikes. Inconclusive Brexit negotiations, and uncertainty around when the inflation impact from referendum-related currency depreciation will fade, create additional challenges for the BoE. If the FTSE 100 is to reach 8000 for the first time, it might need to be soon, says Fiona Cincotta, senior market analyst at City Index, before the Bank of England decides to raise interest rates: A weaker pound, a further easing of tensions between US and China and stronger commodity prices encouraged the FTSE to continue its steady rise towards its 8000 target. Now just 100 points away, with momentum on its side and the pound looking more fragile than it has for a while, 8000 is a very reasonable target. The inverse relationship that exists between the pound and the FTSE thanks to a large percentage of FTSE firms earning revenue outside of the UK, is expected to help the FTSE break higher into unchartered territory towards 8000, sooner rather than later. After weeks of softer than forecast UK economic data, most recently a fall in factory output to the lowest level in two years, plus Brexit uncertainties and a BoE that is happy to sit on the side-lines, key factors are aligned for a soft pound and another push higher by the FTSE. With the harsh weather conditions well behind us, the outlook for the economy is looking up, according to the BoE, making an August rate hike once again a possibility. Should investors start to believe that the August hike is well and truly back on the table, the pound could start to pick up off year to date lows, making it harder for the FTSE to reach 8000. With this in mind, the FTSE\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s final move higher to 8000 needs to be in the bag sooner rather than later to guarantee a hit, otherwise a stronger pound is likely to prevent that psychological level being struck this summer. The UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s leading share index has closed at a new record, but it is off the intra-day highs it recorded earlier in the afternoon. The FTSE 100 finished up 0.23% at 7877.45 having early climbed to a new all time peak of 7903.50. Chinese plans to cut import tariffs on US cars has helped support markets. Joshua Mahony, market analyst at IG, said: European markets are pushing upwards amid improving US-Chinese trade talks, and a weakening pound. The pound has been suffering in late trade, coming off the back of a CBI report that showed UK manufacturing output to be growing at the slowest rate in two-years. With manufacturing failing to gather momentum, there is a fear that we will see the focus of UK economic weakness shift from construction in Q1 to manufacturing in Q2.... Improving US-Chinese relations continue to help improve risk sentiment as the week progresses, with news that China has pledged to reduce levies on automakers and car parts helping the likes of General Electric gain ground. While car makers welcomed news that China will cut tariffs on both imported cars (15% from 25%) and car parts (6% from average of 10%), these still remain comparatively high and are unlikely to alter the status quo of firms basing production in China to avoid such levies. China remains the largest car producing nation in the world, and this token gesture is unlikely to really make any dent in that dynamic. While the benefits from this reduction in Chinese levies are questionable, the decision to let ZTE off the hook for brazenly defying US sanctions on Iran and North Korea is a big boost for China given they employed 80,000 workers. While on face value the Chinese seem to be getting more from this deal, todays deal at least helps reinstate demand for US listed firms Qualcomm and Dolby, from whom ZTE buy many of their processing chips. The FTSE 100 continues to set new records, briefly breaking through the 7900 barrier for the first time as the close of the trading day approaches. More bad news for retail workers: Tesco is shutting its clothing and homewares website Tesco Direct in a surprise move that puts 500 jobs at risk. Staff were briefed on Tuesday afternoon about the decision to close the loss-making website which was the supermarket giant\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s attempt to take on Amazon. Tesco said it had conducted a detailed review of the operation but could not come up with a plan that would make the business, which sells thousands of products ranging from toys, to clothing and electrical appliances, profitable. As a result the retailer said approximately 500 staff were at risk of redundancy. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This decision has been a very difficult one to make, but it is an essential step towards establishing a more sustainable non-food offer and growing our business for the future,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Charles Wilson who is the new boss of Tesco\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s UK chain. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We want to offer our customers the ability to buy groceries and non-food products in one place and that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s why we are focusing our investment into one online platform.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Our full report is here: Wall Street has now slipped into negative territory but that has not stopped the FTSE 100 from hitting new heights. The UK index is now up 0.45% at a new intra-day peak of 7896, helped by the pound losing most of its earlier gains. Against the dollar sterling is now up just 0.08% at $1.3435. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said: The fact cable\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s gains more than halved as the day went on freed the UK index up to shake off its early reticence, the FTSE adding around 25 points in value. That sent it above 7890 for the first time in its history, in the process making the mythic 8000 mark closer to becoming a reality. Whether or not the FTSE can actually reach that landmark level this week may be down to a couple of factors. One: the performance of Brent Crude. The black stuff re-crossed $80 per barrel on Tuesday as supply concerns relating to Venezuela and Iran continued to heighten. However, BP and Shell were resistant to this rise, instead falling 1.2% and 0.6% respectively. If the FTSE is to keep rising, then its oil colossi need to get on board. Two: how sterling reacts to the week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s data. The inflation reading on Wednesday and the 2nd estimate Q1 GDP figure on Friday are both potential lightning rods for a pound-rebound, dependant on whether or not they beat the expected stagnation. If they don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t, and cable hits a fresh 2018 low, then the FTSE may be in for a boost. Oil is on the rise again with Brent crude back above the $80 a barrel level it breached last week. It is currently up 1.17% at $80.15 on renewed concerns about falling supplies from struggling Venezuela, as well as Iran after Donald Trump pulled out of the nuclear agreement. Mihir Kapadia, chief executive of Sun Global Investments, said: The prospect of further Iran sanctions coupled with the disputed election results in Venezuela have helped to firm oil prices. President Trump and the White House have made clear that any new Iran deal would require the country to stop enriching all uranium and halt support for militant groups in the region. Iran\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s government has rejected these demands, increasing the chance that the US could impose severe economic sanctions on the country. Sanctions would reduce oil supply. The possibility of a drastic fall in Iran\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s output has helped to support oil prices in recent months. Oil prices were also pushed higher by the disputed election in Venezuela. The US has promptly responded with sanctions that seek to greatly restrict investment in debts issued by the Venezuelan government or Venezuelan agencies, although the US did not ban the purchase of oil itself. Analysts will be watching closely to see how the situation develops. Hopes for a positive outcome from the US-China trade talks, US markets have edged higher in early trading. With technology stocks benefiting from the prospect that the two countries can avoid a damaging trade war, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is up 11 points or 0.04% while the S&amp;P 500 opened 0.2% higher and the Nasdaq Composite was 0.36% better. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our story on the Bank of England committee hearing: British households are more than \u00c2\u00a3900 worse off following the vote to leave the European Union, according to the governor of the Bank of England. Comparing forecasts made by Threadneedle Street before the referendum, prepared on the basis of a remain vote, Mark Carney told MPs that household incomes were now significantly lower than expected. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Real household incomes are about \u00c2\u00a3900 per household lower than we forecast in May of 2016, which is a lot of money,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said. Speaking in front of the Treasury select committee of MPs, Carney also said the economy was 2% smaller than forecast before the EU referendum, despite the strength of the global economy and an emergency rate cut from the Bank after the Brexit vote. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a reasonable difference\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to forecasts for the economy made in May 2016, he added. Although admitting it was difficult to say with certainty that Brexit was the sole reason for lower household incomes, the Bank governor suggested the referendum outcome played a significant role. Previous analysis by economists has put the potential cost for each British household of voting to leave the EU at \u00c2\u00a3600 a year. The full report is here: The recent poor performance of shares in Marks &amp; Spencer mean the venerable retailer is in danger of falling out of the FTSE 100 when the latest index changes are announced next week. It looks just about safe at the moment, despite a near 3% decline in its shares today, but the reaction to this week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s results could be crucial. Helal Miah, investment research analyst at The Share Centre, said: Whilst investors will be hoping that the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s full year results, due to be released to the market tomorrow, will provide a similar boost to that rival Next received recently, the harsh reality is that the retail environment continues to hugely weigh on this well-known and respected retailer. M&amp;S is likely to find itself amongst the relegation places as a result of weak figures in its all-important food business released to the market earlier this year. Whilst there have been some encouraging signs that the new management team on the clothing side is having some impact, competitive pressure from rivals and relatively weak consumer sentiment has left sales growth uninspiring. Its full year results could ultimately decide its fate, at least in regards to its future in the FTSE 100. Ironically one of the candidates to replace M&amp;S if it did drop out is Ocado following the recent surge in its shares after its big US contract win. G4S and Severn Trent are among the others who could lose their place in the top flight index, while FTSE 250 constituents Weir and GVC are knocking on the door. Sterling moved higher during the Bank of England testimony, helped by what was seen as a hawkish tone from MPC policymaker Gertjan Vlieghe and a softening of the dollar ahead of this week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Federal Reserve minutes. But the rally did not last long amid renewed signs of a weak UK economy which casts some doubt on the pace of further interest rate rises. So the FTSE 100, whose overseas earners benefit from a slide in sterling, is heading for new heights. It has already hit a new all time peak of 7887 and even though it has fallen back to 7879, up 0.26%, that would still mark a new record close if it holds on to its gains. While Mark Carney was speaking to MPs, the UK economy received two pieces of bad news. Marks &amp; Spencer, the high street chain, has announced it is closing more than 100 stores by 2022, It has identified 14 stores that will close in the next year, affecting more than 600 staff, as the company tries to tackle falling profits and growing competition from online retailers. Secondly, UK factory orders have weakened this month to their lowest level since November 2016. The CBI reported that weak domestic demand hurt British manufacturers, while export orders held up better. The campaign for a second Brexit vote have seized on Mark Carney\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s comments: Ruth Lea, economic adviser at Arbuthnot Banking Group (who is optimistic about Brexit), isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t impressed by Carney\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s calculation: The Evening Standard is splashing on Carney\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s comments: Perhaps the editor, a prominent Remain campaigner two years ago, feels his warnings of economic pain if people voted for Brexit are coming true.... Liberal Democrat MP Tom Brake tweets: The Bank of England governor gave MPs a clear reminder of the cost of the 2016 EU referendum today, by warning that households are \u00c2\u00a3900 worse off today than expected. During his testimony to the Treasury Committee, Mark Carney explained that the UK economy is currently 1% smaller than expected two years ago. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s despite the world economy, and particularly the eurozone, growing faster than forecast since then. According to Carney, if you adjust for the stronger global economy and the UK government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fiscal easing, the UK is actually around 1.75% smaller, perhaps even 2%, than you might expected today. That has a real impact on families and individuals across the country. As Carney puts it: If you map it onto household incomes, real household incomes are about \u00c2\u00a3900 lower than we forecast, which is a lot of money. Some of this loss can clearly be ascribed to Brexit. Business investment has been up to 4% weaker than forecast -- as firms have been hit by uncertainty over Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s future trading relationships. Households have suffered by the drop in real incomes (which turned negative last year), due to the plunge in sterling after the referendum. The weaker pound drove up inflation, meaning salaries and pensions didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t go as far in the shops. As Carney puts it: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153There are Brexit effects that come through\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd But, the governor did also cite Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ongoing productivity problems - partly due to weak investment, but also due to a series of wider issues that can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be pinned on the Brexit vote. In conclusion, Carney warned: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153In the short term, over the last year and a half, there has been an impact relative to what we would have expected, even with some pretty good tailwinds on the back of this economy.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd John Mann MP asks Mark Carney a series of mischievous and piercing questions. Mann gets Carney to confirm that he is still planning to leave the Bank of England in June 2019. He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s confident that the government can \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcmultitask\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 and choose a successor despite the pressure of Brexit. But Mann points out that there are rumours of a general election this autumn. So within a few months (if Labour wins power), the Bank of England could be given a new remit to target unemployment as well as inflation. Q: Is the Bank of England prepared for a change in your remit? Carney says he believes the Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s remit should indeed be reviewed every five to eight years. Whatever remit parliament give us, we will implement. The current remit is \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcabsolutely fit for purpose\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, Carney insists. Mann suggests that it might be better to make any remit changed before, rather than after, a new governor is appointed. That could be an argument for Carney staying on longer at the Bank. Mann then swerves to a different issue: Q: What impact has Simon Cowell had on the UK economy? Mann explains that Cowell (of the X-Factor and Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Got Talent) has driven a change in behaviour - more people are staying in on Saturday nights rather than going out. Carney says the Bank has beefed up its expertise in behavioural economics in recent years, to track these trends. He suggests social media and the internet is probably a bigger factor, though: Q: Britain has become a world leader in wind power. So given the importance of green energy, shouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t the Bank be taking a bigger role in driving the economic case? Carney agrees that this is a hugely important issue - citing Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcworld leadership\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 in, for example, using artificial intelligence to drive new power grids. This is too long-term to influence the Monetary Policy Committee...but it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s certainly an important issue for the Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Financial Policy Committee, who are looking at whether firms are well-prepared for changes. Carney says the UK has taken a global lead in \u00e2\u20ac\u0153better climate disclosure\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd - encouraging companies to report how climate change will affect them. He says the top six banks, asset managers, major insurers have signed up - there are now $90 trillion of assets behind the initiative. The backdrop to this question, though, is that activist investor Christopher Hohn has written to the BoE, demanding stricter rules on how banks deal with the risks of climate change. Hohn argues that UK banks are exposed to a wide range of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153serious climate-related risks\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd through their loan books, but investors aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t being given enough information. More here. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the end of the session. Deputy governor Dave Ramsden confirms Mark Carney\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s earlier estimate that UK households are \u00c2\u00a3900 worse off today than forecast in May 2016, before the Brexit vote. Q: There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a lot of debate about whether the Brexit transition period should be extended. What\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s your view, governor? I watch the debate with interest, Mark Carney blocks smartly with a smile. Q: Is the current transition period long enough? It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s what\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been agreed by the political leaders, Carney replies smoothly. Q: You wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have any objection to the transition period being extended? I think some could have an objection to me answering that question, the governor grins. Q: Surveys show that Brexit uncertainty among businesses has fallen recently. Do you think it remains high, and is it really falling? Carney agrees that there has been a small improvement in business confidence about Brexit since Britain and Europe agreed a transition deal in March, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153as you would hope\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. The decisive issue, though, will be whether a final agreement is reached later this year. Gertjan Vlieghe also denies that QE has fuelled Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s housing market. He points out that many countries have used quantitative easing to stimulate their economies since the financial crisis - but Britain is the only one to have seen such as house price boom. [Bank policymakers recently published a paper on the consequence of QE - arguing that it had actually reduced wealth inequality.] Q: Hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t QE solidified intergenerational inequality, and made it even harder for Generation Rent to buy a home? How can we unwind that problem? Deputy governor Dave Ramsden says it is an important issue...but not one that is particularly within the Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s remit to solve. Ramsden (previously chief economic adviser to HM Treasury) points out that supply-side constraints have driven house prices up for decades. Tackling housing affordability is ultimately an issue for the government, Ramsden, insists, as they can change land use and the tax system. Q: Has the Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s quantitative easing programme failed, by driving up asset prices when the Bank is meant to be targeting consumer price inflation? QE is the process by which the Bank buys government debt from commercial banks, to encourage them to buy other assets. Those assets (commercial bonds, shares, commodities) tend to be owned by wealthier people. Carney, though, denies that QE was a blunder. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The policy has worked\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, he says, pointing out that unemployment (arguably the biggest cause of inequality) has fallen steadily in recent years. The Brexit dividend? Q: Do you accept that Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s extremely low interest rates mean there is no incentive for businesses to invest capital? No, Carney replies firmly. He doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t accept that swathes of \u00e2\u20ac\u02dczombie firms\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 are being propped up across the UK by extra-low interest rates, making it hard for better firms to compete. The number of such companies has fallen in recent years, he insists, as poor performing companies are driven out of the economy. Instead, Brexit uncertainty has been hurting business investment - as firms decide to sit on the sidelines until the future becomes clearer. Back in parliament, Michael Saunders has been reminded that he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been outvoted no fewer than five times at the Bank of England when he has pushed, in vain, for interest rates. Q: Why were you outvoted so many times? Well, mathematically, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s because there were more votes to leave interest rates unchanged, says Saunders patiently. Saunders thinks borrowing costs should have risen faster, to reflect the strong UK labour market. With unemployment at its lowest rate since the early 1970s, wages should be rising (not that we can see much sign of it yet!), so the Bank should be alert for inflationary pressures building. The Treasury has welcome the news that UK borrowing fell last month. A Treasury spokesperson says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Borrowing is at the lowest level for a decade, which shows our balanced approach is working. We are backing public services, keeping taxes low, and investing \u00c2\u00a331 billion more in infrastructure and skills as we build an economy that is fit for the future.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Breaking away from parliament.... Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s public finances were stronger than expected last month. The UK borrowed \u00c2\u00a36.2bn in April, down from \u00c2\u00a37.3bn a year ago. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a better start to the new financial year than expected. In another boost, the total deficit for the last financial year was \u00c2\u00a32bn lower than expected. John Hawksworth, chief economist at PwC, explains: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153There was more good news for the Chancellor on the public finances today, with estimated public borrowing in 2017/18 revised down by just over \u00c2\u00a32 billion relative to initial estimates published last month. This reflects a combination of stronger tax receipts and lower government spending. Carney adds that the economic activity lost under the snow last winter won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be clawed back - which is why the Bank was cautious about raising interest rates this month. Q: Why does the Bank of England think the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcBeast from the East\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 hurt growth in the last quarter, while the Office for National Statistics says snow didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have an effect? Mark Carney says the ONS\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s data was based on a questionnaire sent to businesses - \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcvery few\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 people answered the question, he claims. The Bank, though, sent its regional agents out to actually talk to firms around the country. They reported that the snow had a negative effect. Q: Do you believe the Bank should give more \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcexplicit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 guidance for the future path of interest rates, as Gertjan Vlieghe argued this morning? Deputy governor Dave Ramsden is sceptical that this is a good idea. He thinks it could be \u00e2\u20ac\u02dclost in translation\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, and mistaken for a promise for how interest rates would change. MPC member Michael Saunders agrees - he tells MPs there is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153no way\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd the Bank could give an unconditional forecast for the path of interest rates. But, Saunders thinks there is value in giving an estimate for the neutral rate of interest (R*, for economists in the room) - the rate at which the economy is growing at its long-term trend rate, while inflation remains stable. Governor Carney says the MPC have discussed the issue, and a majority of members were opposed to giving more explicit guidance. Vlieghe has now been joined by the boss, governor Mark Carney, along with deputy governor Sir Dave Ramsden and fellow external policymaker Michael Saunders. As predicted, Carney is being asked to justify the Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision to leave interest rate on hold in May, despite hinting at a rise in February. Governor Carney says that Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s households and businesses understand the Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s position, that interest rates will rise at a limited and gradual rate. They have got that message. On the May decision, Carney says he doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t believe that the UK economy is as weak as suggested by the GDP figures for the first quarter of this year (growth of just 0.1%). There were \u00e2\u20ac\u0153temporary, idiosyncratic factors that hit growth in the first quarter\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, the governor explains. So he felt it was best to leave interest rates on hold until more data comes in. NEWSFLASH: Bank of England policymaker Gertjan Vlieghe has predicted that interest rates could rise up to six times in the next three years, sending the pound jumping. Vlieghe makes the forecast in his written evidence to the Treasury committee, which has just been released. He predicts there will be one or two 0.25% increases per year, over the next 36 months. His forecast is a little more hawkish than the Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s own central forecast. Vlieghe says: My current forecast for growth and inflation is consistent with a gradually rising path of interest rates. My own central projection will require one or two quarter point rate increases per year over the three-year forecast period. That path would bring us closer to the neutral policy rate, which I continue to think is likely to be well below the neutral rate that prevailed before the recession. Six quarter-point increases would take UK interest rates up to 2% by 2021, from 0.5% today. This has sent the pound up almost half a cent. Vlieghe adde that there is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153significant uncertainty\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in this forecast, partly because he doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know how the UK economy will evolve in the years ahead (especially given the uncertainty created by Brexit). He adds: My central forecast for policy rates is slightly above the conditioning path of rates derived from market yields in the May Inflation Report forecast, which assumes just under three quarter point rate increases over the three-year forecast period. Gertjan Vlieghe has also suggested that the Bank of England could give clearer guidance on interest rate policy. He tells MPs that he has suggested that policymakers give more \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcexplicit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 forecasts for how they think borrowing costs will change in the future. He concedes, though, that this could create a risk - investors could \u00e2\u20ac\u0153underestimate the degree of uncertainty\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd if central banks become too precise in their communication of the projected future path of interest rates. The US Federal Reserve has a similar policy already - its policymakers create a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcdot chart\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 each quarter suggesting how many interest rate changes they expect. The Treasury committee is now asking about the Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s communications. Why did the Bank hint in February that interest rates would rise faster than previously expected, only to leave them on hold in May?. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a difference between knowing that the future is uncertain, and not knowing what\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s going on, Vlieghe insists. As data comes in, the Bank adjusts its view for the future path of interest rates. Asked about Brexit, Gertjan Vlieghe says that there was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153much less of a response than we thought\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in the immediate aftermath of the referendum in 2016. But there is now a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153clear effect\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, he adds, citing the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcdampening effect\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 of Brexit on investment. The Treasury Committee is underway, starting with Gertjan Vlieghe - who is taking up a second three-year term on the Monetary Policy Committee. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s being streamed live here. Vlieghe cites the pick-up in the global economy, and the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcdampening effect\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 of the Brexit vote on UK growth, as the two big themes of his first three years Vleighe says he is broadly in line with the Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s central forecast - and predicts that UK interest rates will rise very gradually over the next few years. Financial newswire RANsquawk point out that things could be worse for Carney - at least one critic won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be there today (JRM has moved to parliament\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Exiting the EU Committee\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd). I suspect that Mark Carney would happily forego today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s inquisition at parliament. He won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t welcome being quizzed about his \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcforward guidance\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 -- the hints about an interest rate rise that didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t materialise this week. He could do without another debate on Brexit risks too. And he would certainly rather avoid being asked whether he agrees with Ben Broadbent that the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy is entering a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcclimacteric\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, or \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcmenopausal\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, phase. Communication is a key weapon for today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s central bankers. But perhaps Carney should ponder whether \u00e2\u20ac\u0153less is more\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd when he speaks to financial markets. As Bloomberg puts it: After a bruising month that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s seen his own signals on interest rates questioned and one of his deputies forced to apologize for calling the economy menopausal, communication is once again a hot topic for the Bank of England governor. Carney, who arrived at the BOE in 2013 with forward guidance as his signature policy, will come under more scrutiny this week when he faces a grilling from U.K. lawmakers. He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll also give speeches in London and Stockholm. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Some people would say the safest thing for the Bank of England to do right now is to go back to being mystical,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Clea Bourne, a senior lecturer and financial communications specialist at Goldsmiths, University of London. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Mark Carney is in the spotlight this morning as MPs quiz the Bank of England governor about the state of the UK economy, and his latest u-turn on interest rates. The Treasury Committee will question Carney, deputy governor Dave Ramsden, and policymakers Michael Saunders and Gertjan Vlieghe, about this month\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s quarterly inflation report. They\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be asked to explain why the Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Monetary Policy Committee left UK borrowing costs unchanged this month at just 0.5%, having previously dropped hints that a rate rise was coming. That decision saw Carney labelled, again, as an \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcunreliable boyfriend\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 for making promises and never sticking to them. But the governor has a defence. He can point to the sharp slowdown in UK growth this year - GDP rose by just 0.1% in January-March. But with unemployment at a 43-year low, and employment at a record high, is the economy really that weak? The quartet can also expect some questions about Brexit, as concern builds about Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s likely trading relationships with the EU after 2019. Sterling is looking edgy ahead of the hearing, having dropped below $1.34 yesterday to its lowest level this year. The pound could rally if Carney and colleagues sound confident that rates will rise in the next few months. Michael Hewson of CMC Markets explains what investors will be looking for: Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Treasury Select Committee testimony of Messrs Carney, Ramsden, Saunders and Vlieghe are also likely to be important benchmarks as to policymakers thinking with respect to the timing of such a move and in particular David Ramsden and Gertjan Vlieghe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s thinking on it. There won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be any surprises around Michael Saunders view giving he voted to raise rates last month, and Mark Carney\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s view tends to change as often as the weather forecast, but Ramsden\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s views are likely to be key given that he suggested in a February interview that rates would have to rise more quickly given recent increases in wages. Against that backdrop it was a bit of a surprise that the Bank of England then proceeded to revise their assessment for wages lower for the rest of this year, so his views on why the central bank has become less bullish on wages are likely to be important, as are Vlieghe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s. Unfortunately, deputy governor Ben Broadbent is not on the panel, so he won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be called to account for last week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s gaffe (using the word \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcmenopause\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 when explaining how Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy was past its peak). The Treasury Committee will kick off with a session with Gertjan Vlieghe, who is being reappointed for a second term at the MPC. Also coming up today..... We get public finance figures for April, which will probably show that Britain borrowed around \u00c2\u00a37bn to balance the books last month. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also a healthcheck on UK manufacturing from the CBI. European markets are expected to be subdued, after Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE 100 hit a record high yesterday. In the City, bike and car parts chain Halfords, publisher Bloomsbury and building society Nationwide are releasing results (more on that shortly). Plus, oil giant Shell is holding its AGM. Shareholders will be pushing the company to set tougher carbon reduction targets to help tackle global warming. The agenda 9.30am BST: UK public finances for April 10am BST: Treasury committee hearing with Bank of England governor Mark Carney 11am BST: CBI industrial trends survey of UK factories",

The fall in the value of the pound following the Brexit vote has pushed up the cost of sourcing goods abroad. The impending exit from the EU and lower value of sterling have also acted to push up wages in some areas as it has been more difficult to find skilled workers who have traditionally come from mainland Europe, such as van drivers. The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/apr/13/how-much-is-an-hour-worth-the-war-over-the-minimum-wage\">rise in the legal minimum wage</a> and imposition of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/nils-pratley-on-finance/2018/jan/25/ministers-should-listen-employers-apprenticeship-levy\">apprenticeship levy</a> have also pushed up costs, as has a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/nov/04/hammond-under-pressure-to-axe-business-rates-rise\">rise in business rates</a> this year. While some businesses have seen a cut, and many small stores were protected, those in the south, particularly in London, have seen major rate rises. About 1,400 shops, pubs, restaurants and hotels received an average rise of almost \u00c2\u00a350,000 according to property adviser Altus Group.</p> <h2>Consumption fatigue</h2> <p>After years of filling their wardrobes and homes with material possessions, Brits appear to have reached \u00e2\u20ac\u0153peak stuff\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Young people are now more likely to be renters rather than buyers, meaning they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve no yearning to fill a bottom drawer with household goods they may have to lug between short-term lets. Barclaycard data for last year reveals a 10% increase in spending on entertainment and an 11.4% rise in spending on telecoms, which of course doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t include all those direct debits paying for long-term phone contracts. Entertainment, pubs and restaurant spending was all up in double-digit percentages last year, according to Barclaycard, but women\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s clothing spending was down. The latest data from Visa indicates that spending on household goods and clothing continues to fall, while restaurants, hotels, pubs and bars are still on the up.</p> <h2>High-street decline</h2> <p>Retailers are currently closing stores at a faster rate than during the recession, but despite the underlying issues being well rehearsed, no coherent plan has emerged to tackle high-street decline. Some 50,000 stores are deemed surplus to requirements and MPs have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/may/10/mps-to-investigate-ways-of-reviving-online-hit-high-streets-inquiry-shopping\">recently launched a fresh inquiry</a>, with the goal of drawing up a vision of what high streets and town centres could look like by 2030.

Last week Marks &amp; Spencer confirmed plans <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/may/22/marks-spencer-close-stores\">to close 100 of its traditional high-street stores by 2022 as sales move online</a>. M&amp;S\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s predicament typifies that of large chains with long histories: stores opened on once-thriving high streets are now surrounded by discount stores and fast-food outlets.

                "bodyText":"In promoting his 10-year tax plan, Malcolm Turnbull suggested people want governments to undertake \u00e2\u20ac\u0153long term planning\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. However, a new research paper out this week from the IMF highlights how economies could be set for a major shake-up in the future and how sticking with the belief that better wages for workers comes from reducing company tax in order to spur capital investment is a rather wishful proposition. Economics research papers generally are not known for their optimism, but the IMF paper titled \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Should We Fear the Robot Revolution? (The Correct Answer is Yes)\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd fairly hits you between the eyes with its pessimism. This research goes very much to the heart of primary political debate in this country about jobs, equality and the role of government. Sign up to receive the latest Australian opinion pieces every weekday When Malcolm Turnbull took over the prime ministership he loved to talk about how it was the most exciting time to be alive \u00e2\u20ac\u201c innovation was on the rise, agility was all the go! But for many workers it is a rather worrying time. In the past decade since the global financial crisis real wages have stalled, underemployment has risen, wage growth has plummeted, businesses have sought to move away from enterprise bargaining, and the growth areas have been mostly in lower-paid services sectors such as social care. And underneath all that is the feeling \u00e2\u20ac\u201c perhaps overstated \u00e2\u20ac\u201c that we are soon in danger of being replaced by robots. The IMF paper on the topic notes that there are essentially two camps on this issue \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the first is optimistic and believes that, as in the past, greater automation will see some jobs lost, but the demand for many jobs \u00e2\u20ac\u201c especially those \u00e2\u20ac\u0153that place a premium on creativity, flexibility, and abstract reasoning\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u201c will grow and overall the economy is better off. The other side of the coin are those who note these are not your grandparents\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 robots we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re talking about. These are robots that make use of AI in order to do work previously believed to be non-automatable precisely because it was seen as creative, flexible, or needing abstract reasoning. The paper considered a range of scenarios \u00e2\u20ac\u201c from the more traditional one where robots replace only low skilled work to where robots are able to replicate a range of work and then a final one where robots \u00e2\u20ac\u0153can do anything\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. And the results are not good for workers. Essentially the shift sees national income move from labour to capital \u00e2\u20ac\u201c as the returns from investing in robots to do work previously done by people increase. They note that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the most common arguments for technology optimism do not stand up to scrutiny\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Even in scenarios that fit with the more optimistic view of automation, the paper concludes that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153automation is very good for growth and very bad for equality\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. The authors suggest that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153in scenarios where the traditional technology disappears and robots take over the automatable sector, the economy either ascends to a virtuous circle of ongoing endogenous growth or descends into a death spiral of perpetual contraction. Unfortunately, the odds strongly favor the death spiral\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s never good to read a report with \u00e2\u20ac\u0153economic growth\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and \u00e2\u20ac\u0153death spiral\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd being used together. And one reason to fear the future is the past. Another report from the IMF this week looked at why some places in the US have had improved labour participation while elsewhere it has plummeted. It found that once you accounted for age, the overwhelming reason was automation: Automation and offshoring may have permanently displaced some workers, even if their effects on the economy as a whole were beneficial, through the creation of job opportunities in other sectors or productivity gains\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s that rather awful nexus \u00e2\u20ac\u201c things that improve overall economic growth and productivity invariably come at the expense of specific groups of people, and the gains which flow through to everyone can take a very long time to eventuate.

It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s why basing your economic policy on \u00e2\u20ac\u0153long-term\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd gains can easily fool you into pursuing something of little worth. And why in a period where we have seen strong employment growth, but flat household income, talk of cutting company taxes to increase capital investment is not a formula that is going to bring much joy. Even the treasury\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s own research suggests the company tax cuts will cause real wages only to rise in the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153long term,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd at least 10 years after they have been introduced \u00e2\u20ac\u201c at which point we may well wonder what jobs will be around to garner that growth.

Similarly they note the proposal for a universal basic income has some merit but the problem is paying for it in a world where income is shifting from labour to capital. They note that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153capital taxation is becoming more and more difficult with globalization and the increasing capital mobility\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. And it is also made more difficult when our government is following the lead of others to reduce the level of taxation that would be paid by those companies in the first place in order to encourage the investment that are causing so much worry for workers. It has long been assumed such policies would work out better for everyone in the end; the research this week shows that that has not be true in the past and is not likely to be so in the future. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Greg Jericho is a Guardian Australia columnist",

The men, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2001/nov/05/11\" title=\"\">Richer Sounds</a> founder Julian Richer and Marks &amp; Spencer boss Steve Rowe, are debating ways to reinvigorate M&amp;S, which, in a dramatic admission, said last week that it had become \u00e2\u20ac\u0153too corporate\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and lost touch with its shoppers.</p> <p>\u00e2\u20ac\u0153I wanted us to meet outside the office so we could talk without distractions and we have very intense discussions,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd explains Richer. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m an ideas man. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m all about the people.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd</p> <p>The entrepreneur has been drafted in by M&amp;S chairman <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/may/05/m-and-s-archie-norman-chairman-marks-spencer\" title=\"\">Archie Norman</a> to assist with a major restructuring that involves \u00e2\u20ac\u0153fracturing\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd a dysfunctional business culture in which decisions are made by committee, accountability is blurred and customers are abandoning its shops.</p> <p>Richer successfully assisted Norman with the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/1999/nov/10/9\" title=\"\">turnaround of no-frills grocer Asda</a> in the 1990s and at M&amp;S is acting as an \u00e2\u20ac\u0153independent adviser on culture change\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. This time around it is Rowe, not Norman, heeding Richer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s counsel, and they are unlikely bedfellows.</p> <p>Richer, with his long hair and sideline as the drummer in funk band Ten Millennia, is lauded for the success of his Richer Sounds chain, which he founded in 1978 at the age of 19. Rowe, by comparison, is an M&amp;S lifer who supports Millwall. But the men appear to have built a rapport; after a recent <em>t\u00c3\u00aate-\u00c3\u00a0-t\u00c3\u00aate</em> Richer persuaded Rowe to abandon his driver and hire a bike to pedal across the capital together to visit a store.</p> <p>\u00e2\u20ac\u0153I think we have connected very well,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd says Richer. In fact Rowe, after a punishing week in which M&amp;S reported a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/may/23/marks-and-spencer-reports-sharp-drop-in-annual-profits\" title=\"\">collapse in pretax profits</a> linked to its large store-closure plan, pitched up on Thursday morning, along with a handful of other M&amp;S directors, to attend a lecture on Richer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new book, <a href=\"https://www.penguin.co.uk/books/1115429/the-ethical-capitalist-how-to-make-business-work-better-for-society/\" title=\"\"><em>The Ethical Capitalist,</em></a> in a Salvation Army hall in the West End.</p> <p>Profits might be going backwards at M&amp;S but Richer is the first to admit his hi-fi and TV empire is a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153minnow\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd alongside the might of the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest fashion retailer, with just 53 stores to M&amp;S\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 1,035. Last year, Richer Sounds rang up sales of \u00c2\u00a3187m while M&amp;S recorded \u00c2\u00a310.7bn. But M&amp;S is in decline: its clothing market share, for example, has almost halved from a peak of 13.5% in 1997 to 7.6%.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>It's akin to having a oil well in your back garden</p> <footer> <cite>Julian Richer on staff suggestion schemes</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>By comparison Richer Sounds has kept the mighty Amazon at bay and regularly comes top \u00e2\u20ac\u201c including this year \u00e2\u20ac\u201c in the annual retail poll by consumer group Which?. It is fair to say M&amp;S would like to sprinkle some of that stardust on its shop floor. At the end of Richer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s talk, Rowe said a few words, confessing that, after a meeting with \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Jools\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I feel like I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve had 17,000 volts put through me.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd</p> <p>When Norman took the M&amp;S chair last year he certainly electrified the boardroom. He forced Rowe, who had already been running the business for a year, to kick the tyres \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and, judging by last week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s investor update, the company failed its MOT spectacularly. Serious faults include a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153top heavy\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd head-office culture, a clunky website and a food business that needs a complete overhaul.</p> <p>\u00e2\u20ac\u0153Archie gave me a pass and I turned up at the Pudsey store at the crack of dawn,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd says Richer of his experience at Asda.

                "bodyText":"When they meet it is discreetly, in a small windowless room at the back of a Mayfair cafe in London. But it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not a clandestine affair. The men, Richer Sounds founder Julian Richer and Marks &amp; Spencer boss Steve Rowe, are debating ways to reinvigorate M&amp;S, which, in a dramatic admission, said last week that it had become \u00e2\u20ac\u0153too corporate\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and lost touch with its shoppers. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I wanted us to meet outside the office so we could talk without distractions and we have very intense discussions,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd explains Richer. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m an ideas man. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m all about the people.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The entrepreneur has been drafted in by M&amp;S chairman Archie Norman to assist with a major restructuring that involves \u00e2\u20ac\u0153fracturing\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd a dysfunctional business culture in which decisions are made by committee, accountability is blurred and customers are abandoning its shops. Richer successfully assisted Norman with the turnaround of no-frills grocer Asda in the 1990s and at M&amp;S is acting as an \u00e2\u20ac\u0153independent adviser on culture change\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. This time around it is Rowe, not Norman, heeding Richer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s counsel, and they are unlikely bedfellows. Richer, with his long hair and sideline as the drummer in funk band Ten Millennia, is lauded for the success of his Richer Sounds chain, which he founded in 1978 at the age of 19. Rowe, by comparison, is an M&amp;S lifer who supports Millwall. But the men appear to have built a rapport; after a recent t\u00c3\u00aate-\u00c3\u00a0-t\u00c3\u00aate Richer persuaded Rowe to abandon his driver and hire a bike to pedal across the capital together to visit a store. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I think we have connected very well,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd says Richer. In fact Rowe, after a punishing week in which M&amp;S reported a collapse in pretax profits linked to its large store-closure plan, pitched up on Thursday morning, along with a handful of other M&amp;S directors, to attend a lecture on Richer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new book, The Ethical Capitalist, in a Salvation Army hall in the West End. Profits might be going backwards at M&amp;S but Richer is the first to admit his hi-fi and TV empire is a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153minnow\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd alongside the might of the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest fashion retailer, with just 53 stores to M&amp;S\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 1,035. Last year, Richer Sounds rang up sales of \u00c2\u00a3187m while M&amp;S recorded \u00c2\u00a310.7bn. But M&amp;S is in decline: its clothing market share, for example, has almost halved from a peak of 13.5% in 1997 to 7.6%. By comparison Richer Sounds has kept the mighty Amazon at bay and regularly comes top \u00e2\u20ac\u201c including this year \u00e2\u20ac\u201c in the annual retail poll by consumer group Which?. It is fair to say M&amp;S would like to sprinkle some of that stardust on its shop floor. At the end of Richer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s talk, Rowe said a few words, confessing that, after a meeting with \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Jools\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I feel like I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve had 17,000 volts put through me.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd When Norman took the M&amp;S chair last year he certainly electrified the boardroom. He forced Rowe, who had already been running the business for a year, to kick the tyres \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and, judging by last week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s investor update, the company failed its MOT spectacularly. Serious faults include a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153top heavy\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd head-office culture, a clunky website and a food business that needs a complete overhaul. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Archie gave me a pass and I turned up at the Pudsey store at the crack of dawn,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd says Richer of his experience at Asda. He would spend a day a week for the next two-and-a-half years at the grocer, sending Norman regular reports. Now he has an M&amp;S pass. Some of Richer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s culture-change ideas are simple, such as a suggestion scheme for staff. He introduced one at Asda and recently at M&amp;S. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u0153not very sexy\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, he admits, but they empower staff and the ideas they generate, he says, are \u00e2\u20ac\u0153akin to having a oil well in your back garden\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. The Yorkshire-based entrepreneur has plenty of big ideas too. Among his new pet projects is funding a new non-profit organisation, Taxwatch, where journalists and tax professionals will work together to expose abuse of the tax system by multinationals and individuals in a bid to galvanise public opinion. Given the entrepreneur is worth an estimated \u00c2\u00a3160m, one might expect his loyalties to be elsewhere, but he says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m outraged by the status quo.

Most of the damage, he said, was Brexit-related. The result is that the economy is \u00c2\u00a340bn smaller than it would have been without <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%23Brexit\" title=\"\">Brexit</a>; it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s possible to show that this amounts to a \u00c2\u00a315bn loss of tax revenue, or \u00c2\u00a3300m a week.</p> <p>Liberal Democrat leader Vince&#xa0;Cable was appalled by this confirmation of all his worst fears. Labour MP and arch-Remainer Chuka Umunna was equally indignant that the experts had been proved right. He tweeted: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Brexit is already costing every person in this country hundreds of pounds in lower income, and we haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t even left&#xa0;yet.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd</p> <p>The public, on the other hand, appeared to be nonplussed. This is partly because the loss is a notional one, based on economic forecasts that the Treasury and Bank of England have become notorious for getting wrong over the last 10 years.</p> <p>More importantly, the Brexit vote was born of several factors unrelated to economics, such as reclaiming power from the European court of justice, or ending EU rules that block attempts to control the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s borders.</p> <p>This is an unfortunate situation, because what Carney has to say is important. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s true, as the Brexiters say, that much of the loss to households flows from a one-off inflationary reaction to the lower pound, which pushed the cost of imported goods higher. Yet a cliff-edge Brexit featuring only a basic trade deal \u00e2\u20ac\u201c <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/may/22/hard-brexit-tories-pressure-may-customs-union\" title=\"\"> something that remains a possibility</a> \u00e2\u20ac\u201c could trigger another fall in the pound, ushering in a second dose of import-led inflation.</p> <p>Carney made this warning explicit in a speech last week that revealed the Bank is prepared to withdraw its plans for raising interest rates if this&#xa0;happens. Inflation, he said, had cut household spending power and accounted for around a third of the \u00c2\u00a3900 loss. The remaining two-thirds was due to lost productivity \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and that was largely due to a collapse in&#xa0;investment.</p> <p>Figures from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development documenting foreign direct investment show a 90% collapse in flows to the UK in 2017 compared with the previous year. Granted, the previous year was characterised by a strong recovery from a miserable 2014 and 2015. Nevertheless, a 90% fall in funds coming to the UK shows how fragile Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s reputation among corporate investors has become, and how positive sentiment can evaporate almost overnight.</p> <p>Large domestic companies are of the same mind. They are the main losers from the Brexit vote and the costly <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/may/23/brexiters-customs-model-could-cost-20bn-for-uk-business\" title=\"\">trade and customs arrangements</a> it could usher in. They are the most averse to making investment decisions until the situation is clearer. And even then, if it becomes obvious that a hard Brexit is the most likely result, with a customs deal no better than Canada\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s, they might ditch their investment plans altogether.</p> <p>This scenario is possible, and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s right that Carney makes the cost explicit to the public.
