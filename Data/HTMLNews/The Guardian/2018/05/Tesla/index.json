                "bodyText":"With Wall Street still suffering on concerns about the prospect of a trade war between the US and China, European markets have ended the day lower. Talks between Chinese and US representatives began in the first of two days of meetings, but both sides have been lowering expectations that there will be a positive outcome. So investors have been shying away from shares, with the final scores in Europe showing: The FTSE 100 finished down 40.51 points or 0.54% at 7502.69 Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax dropped 0.88% to 12,690.15 France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac closed 0.5% lower at 5501.66 Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB fell 0.83% to 24,064.46 Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ibex ended 0.5% lower at 10,038.8 In Greece, the Athens market lost 2.18% to 839.34 On Wall Street the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 280 points or 1.17%. On that note, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time to close for the day. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be back tomorrow. On the market fall, Joshua Mahony at IG says: Global stocks are on the slide in the wake of a weak US open today, with trade fears and a strengthening dollar weighing on sentiment. ...Continued fears over the pathway of trade negotiations with China are sure to be playing into investor fears, and it is certainly a worry that we are seeing such unconvincing trade in the US despite a largely encouraging earnings season. [President] Trump will be boosted by the new of a massive narrowing of the US trade deficit, with the President likely to go reinvigorated into negotiations with the likes of China. With the head of the Brazilian steel association admitting that the industry will simply have to go along with US quotas, the bigger hurdles of China and the EU represent significantly bigger hurdles to overcome for Mr Trump. With US exports now standing at the highest level since records began, there is no doubt that the US economic picture is improving and that is being reflected in a stronger dollar. The latest US monthly jobs figures are out on Friday, and there could be a recovery from the weak (103,000) number seen in March: Markets continue to suffer on worries about the potential for a trade war between the US and China. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, says: Despite a lack of news surrounding the ongoing takes between the US and China, the various aggressions reported last night \u00e2\u20ac\u201c including news that China has stopped by soybeans from the US, with the latter potentially set to impose restrictions on certain Chinese telecommunication companies selling equipment in America \u00e2\u20ac\u201c have reignited fears of a trade war. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s clear that investors aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t confident about the outcome of the day\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s delegation get-together. The Dow Jones plunged more than 250 points after the bell, diving below 23700 for the first time in a month. Granted the Dow is also dealing with a fairly hawkish Fed statement from Wednesday night, one that kept up the dollar\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hopes of 3 (or even 4) more rate hikes in 2018. With little else to go on, the European indices took their cue from the US losses. The CAC slipped 0.3%, while the DAX dropped 0.6%, the latter abandoning the 12800, 3 month highs struck on Wednesday. As for the FTSE, the UK index shed 50 points, shying away from 7550 to return to 7500 for the umpteenth time this week. Two surveys of the US service sector have come to different conclusions about the state of this part of the economy. The ISM non-manufacturing PMI dropped from 58.8 in March to 56.8 in April, below expectations of a level of 58.1. The employment index dropped from 56.6 to 53.6, the lowest since April last year. But earlier the Markit service sector PMI rose from 54 in March to 54.6 in April, slightly better than the initial reading of 54.4. Even so, any reading over 50 shows expansion so these figures are unlikely to alter the future course of US interest rates. China can withstand a trade war longer than the US, says Wendy Cutler, Asia Society Policy Institute vice president and former acting deputy U.S. trade representative. She was speaking to CNBC: Worries about trade tensions as the US and Chinese delegations meet in the wake of Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tariffs have seen US markets open lower. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 170 points or 0.7% while the S&amp;P 500 opened down 0.29% and the Nasdaq Composite off 0.51%. Among the fallers is Tesla, down 7.5% after the bizarre post-results analysts call held by Elon Musk. Could Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s actions on trade and tariffs see a repeat of the 1930s slump? A group of experts certainty think it could happen: Over a thousand economists have written to Donald Trump warning his \u00e2\u20ac\u0153economic protectionism\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and tough rhetoric on trade threatens to repeat the mistakes the US made in the 1930s, mistakes that plunged the world into the Great Depression. The 1,414 economists, including 14 Nobel prize winners, sent the letter on Thursday amid an escalating row over trade between the US and the European Union. Trump has imposed tariffs on steel and aluminium imports but has granted temporary reprieves to the EU, Australia and other countries. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153In 1930, 1,028 economists urged Congress to reject the protectionist Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd the authors write, citing a trade act that many economists argue was one of the triggers for the Great Depression. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Today, Americans face a host of new protectionist activity, including threats to withdraw from trade agreements, misguided calls for new tariffs in response to trade imbalances, and the imposition of tariffs on washing machines, solar components, and even steel and aluminum used by US manufacturers. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Congress did not take economists\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 advice in 1930, and Americans across the country paid the price. The undersigned economists and teachers of economics strongly urge you not to repeat that mistake. Much has changed since 1930 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c for example, trade is now significantly more important to our economy \u00e2\u20ac\u201c but the fundamental economic principles as explained at the time have not.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The full story is here: With immaculate timing, as the US and Chinese delegations meet, the Commerce Department has released the latest international trade figures. Overall the trade gap narrowed in March from $57.7bn in the previous month to $48.9bn. This was better than the expected deficit of $50bn, helped by exports increasing to a record high following a surge in deliveries of commercial aircraft and, yes, soybeans. As for the deficit with China, the March figure fell from $29.26bn to $25.88bn. BUT: the year to date figure for the trade gap with China is up sharply, from $78.8bn to $91bn. By sending so many senior officials to China, the Trump administration may actually have lowered the chances of a breakthrough. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s because the delegation don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t really agree with each other about trade, making it harder to reach an agreement with Beijing. For example, commerce secretary Wilbur Ross has blamed \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcevil practices\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 by China for the trade gap with America, and vocally backed Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tariffs. But Larry Kudlow, the newish head of Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economic council, has previously warned that tariffs are effectively tax rises and will hurt US companies (this was before he joined the White House). Such differences of opinion won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t make negotiations with China run any smooth. As Maggie Gage, head of Washington Research at Credit Suisse, put it on Bloomberg TV: One of the key hurdles that will determine success versus non-success at these talks is whether the US team can all stay on message together. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade talks come a month after the US and China both ratcheted up the tensions, by imposing tariffs on $50bn of each other\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s goods. The White House announced a list of 1,333 Chinese imports to be subject to punitive tariffs of 25%; China retaliated with a list of 100+ American products, including soya beans, cars and aircraft. So what is America looking to achieve at today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s talks? On the trade gap, the Trump administration want China to reduce its trade surplus with the US by around $100bn (it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s $375bn today). Unless US consumers start consuming less, that means opening up more Chinese markets to American imports. On intellectual property, the US Trade Representative\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Office claims that American firms are forced to hand over key technology secrets in return for access to Chinese markets -- something Beijing denies. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also the currency issue - Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bugbear that Beijing has been unfairly weakening the yuan to help Chinese firm sell goods abroad. So far, America has resisted labelling China a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dccurrency manipulator\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 (something which would trigger fresh measures). But it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s on the table, if negotiations get nowhere.... The EC has predicted that Britain and Italy will share the wooden spoon in the 2018 growth race, while Ireland will power ahead: Bonus mark to anyone who spots the mistake with the Irish flag..... Rather awkwardly for our purposes, there appears to be a news blackout on the US-China trade talks! Bloomberg says: China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest news outlets have been ordered to refrain from reporting any material beyond official press releases related to trade talks in Beijing with the U.S., according to people familiar with the matter. The Communist Party\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s propaganda department has told news websites to strictly use statements released by the official Xinhua News Agency, without any extra interpretation, according to the people, who asked not to be named as they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re not authorized to speak on the matter. Chinese foreign ministry spokeswomen Hua Chunying says Beijing hopes to make progress with America - but only if there is mutual respect. Hua told reporters that: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The outcome should be mutually beneficial and win-win.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The official Xinhua news agency, usually a good gauge of the Chinese government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s views, has also taken a firm line by warning that China could cope with a trade war. In an editorial, it says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153China will inevitably suffer losses, but China has the political advantage of a centralised and unified leadership and support of a massive domestic market.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd A former trade advisor to president Obama has warned that Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s delegation probably won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t come back from Beijing with a big deal. Michael Camunez, CEO of consultancy Monarch Global Strategies, says (via CNN): \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t expect any grand bargains being struck....There is no clear strategy that can be discerned.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The European Commission has fired a warning towards the US government not to plunge the world into a trade war. In its latest economic assessment, just released, the EC warns that there are \u00e2\u20ac\u0153increased risks on the horizon\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. It singles out the threat of trade protectionism, calling it an \u00e2\u20ac\u0153unambiguously negative risk\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to the global economic outlook Pierre Moscovici, commissioner for Economic and Financial Affairs, warns that a trade war could derail Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s recovery: Europe continues to enjoy robust growth, which has helped drive unemployment to a ten-year low. Investment is rising and public finances are improving, with the deficit in the euro area set to drop to just 0.7% of GDP this year. The biggest risk to this rosy outlook is protectionism, which must not become the new normal: that would only hurt those of our citizens we most need to protect.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Newsflash: inflation across the eurozone has fallen unexpectedly. The consumer prices index rose by just 1.2% in the year to April, down from 1.3% a month earlier. Core inflation, which strips out volatile items, slid to just 0.7% from 1%. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s welcome news for households, but a real headache for the European Central Bank as it ponders whether to extend its bond-buying stimulus programme beyond September. Back in the UK, we have fresh evidence that the economy has lost momentum. Data firm Markit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s monthly measure of service sector activity has risen, to 52.8 in April from March\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 51.7. Although that shows faster growth, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s still one of the weakest readings in the last two years. It appears that sales, investment and hiring have all been hit by economic uncertainty (Brexit and trade war fears could both be blamed). Global stock markets are subdued as investors watch for developments in Beijing. The main European indices are almost all in the red, after a cautious session in Asia which saw Hong Kong\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Hang Seng shed 1.3%. Traders are concerned that a breakdown in negotiations between the US and China could further inflame the situation, potentially leading to further retaliatory action. Jameel Ahmad, global head of currency strategy &amp; Market Research at FXTM, explains: The trade talks carry the potential to negatively impact global stocks as a result of reduced risk appetite, and could also result in reduced purchasing momentum for emerging market currencies. China appears to have raised the stakes ahead of these trade talks, by stopping buying US soybeans. That news could send a shiver through America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s agriculture industry, as it has been the biggest supplier of soybeans to the Chinese market. Bloomberg has the details: The world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest oilseed processor just confirmed one of the soybean market\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest fears: China has essentially stopped buying U.S. supplies amid the brewing trade war. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Whatever they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re buying is non-U.S.,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Bunge Ltd. Chief Executive Officer Soren Schroder said in a telephone interview Wednesday. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153They\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re buying beans in Canada, in Brazil, mostly Brazil, but very deliberately not buying anything from the U.S.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd In a move that caught many in U.S. agriculture by surprise, China last month announced planned tariffs on American shipments of soybeans. As the market waited for the measure to take effect, there was some hope among traders and shippers alike that relations between the nations could ease in the meantime and the trade flow would continue. But that doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t seem to be the case, at least for now, according to Bunge. China is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153braced for surprises\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd at today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade talks, says the Financial Times, especially as Donald Trump has sent seven top officials along. The FT has also picked up on Beijing\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s refusal to be forced into concessions: For senior Chinese officials and their policy advisers, the arrival of what they see as a large and unwieldy US delegation is just the latest twist in three months\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 of diplomatic exchanges that they have found to be both confusing and insulting. They are also bracing themselves for surprises from Mr Trump, who has previously issued threatening tweets and statements in the midst of delicate Sino-US negotiations. Last month, after the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s two largest economies threatened to impose punitive tariffs on $50bn worth of each other\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s exports, Mr Trump said he would consider targeting an additional $100bn worth of Chinese exports to the US. The Chinese then closed ranks, saying they would not negotiate in the face of such threats. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bottom line is that the US will not get anything through blackmail,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said L\u00c3\u00bc Xiang, an American affairs expert at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153China is waiting to see what [requests] the US will put on the table. But if they pull out a gun and point it at us, then they can finish their tea and leave.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd America is likely to air a series of complaints over China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade practices today, including allegations of intellectual property theft and unfair state subsidies Reuters explains: A breakthrough deal to fundamentally change China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economic policies is viewed as highly unlikely during the two-day visit, though a package of short-term Chinese measures could delay a U.S. decision to impose tariffs on around $50 billion worth of Chinese exports. The discussions, led by U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Chinese Vice Premier Liu He, are expected to cover a wide range of U.S. complaints about China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade practices, from allegations of forced technology transfers to state subsidies for technology development. Treasury secretary Stephen Mnuchin was in a cheerful mood, telling Reuters he was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Thrilled to be here. Thank you,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd as he arrived at his hotel in Beijing. And we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re off.... Financial markets around the globe will be watching the trade talks in Beijing closely, says Lee Wild, head of equity strategy at interactive investor: It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade rather than interest rates or valuations that are troubling markets right now. US officials have flown into Beijing to try and deescalate a trade spat with China, but these talks won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be easy. This is the issue that markets are super sensitive about currently, and which was responsible in part for the first-quarter crash, so it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s unsurprising to see investors take some money off the table.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. After months of threats and tit-for-tat tariffs, America and China are actually going to sit down and talk about trade. A delegation of top US officials has landed in Beijing today for two days of negotiations. The group includes Treasury secretary Steven Mnuchin, economic advisor Larry Kudlow and US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer. They\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll face off against senior Chinese officials, led by vice-premier Liu He. The hope is that the two sides can calm the recent tensions that have already seen steep tariffs slapped on each other\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s exports, in what could prove to be the opening shots in a damaging trade war. President Donald Trump has already raised the stakes, by tweeting that America is pushing for a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dclevel playing field\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. However, a breakthrough is far from guaranteed, with China already hinting that it won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be bullied by America. Our correspondent in Beijing, Lily Kuo, explains: The China Daily said China will \u00e2\u20ac\u0153stand up to the US\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd if necessary while Global Times says it hopes the two sides can begin resolving trade disputes. So, it could be a lively couple of days. Also coming up today: On the economics front, a new healthcheck on Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s service sector may show that activity accelerated in April after a weak March. A weak reading, though, would put the final nail in the coffin of an interest rate rise next week. New inflation data from the eurozone will feed into the debate on whether the European Central Bank should rein in its stimulus programme. Plus, there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new jobs, trade and service sector data from America. The agenda: 9.30am BST: UK service sector PMI report for April 10am BST: Eurozone CPI inflation figures for April 1.30pm BST: US trade gap figures for March 1.30pm BST: US weekly jobless claims figures 3pm: US service sector PMI, and factory orders",
