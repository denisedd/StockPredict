                "bodyText":"A late PS: America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock market did indeed end the day at fresh record levels. Having burst through 25,000 at the open, the Dow Jones industrial average finished at 25,075, up 152 points. Now, as James Mackintosh of the Wall Street Journal points out, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s only a number... He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s right about the Dow being imperfectly designed too -- it only contains 30 companies, so can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t properly represent the US economy. Right, time for a recap. Global stock markets have romped to fresh all-time highs today as 2018 begins where 2017 left off - with shares rising across the world. A renewed burst of investor confidence swept America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dow Jones industrial average over the 25,000 point mark for the first time - meaning it has gained around 25% in the last 12 months. Traders drove the Dow up after payroll figures showed that American companies hired 250,000 workers last month - the best reading since March. It suggests that tomorrow\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s US jobs report (the non-farm payroll) figures could be better than expected. Jacob Deppe, Head of Trading at online trading platform, Infinox, reckons the Dow could hit 26,000 points soon: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153With the Dow Jones hitting 25,000 for the first time there seems no end in sight to a stock market rally spurred on by much stronger than expected jobs data for December, offering yet further evidence of the strength of the US economy. Most analysts had expected 190,000 jobs to have been created in the month but 250,000 jobs blew that number apart. Little wonder the Dow Jones soared to a new all time record high soon after. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Markets will expect a big number from official Non-Farm Payrolls data tomorrow, anything much less than 250,000 will be considered a disappointment. The rally gave president Trump an excuse not to think about Michael Wolff\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new book; he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s just claimed that the Dow could go a lot higher yet.... Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE 100 also scaled new peaks, closing at a new all-time high. Other European stock markets also had a strong day, with the Stoxx 600 index up almost 1%. Shares jumped as new data showed that eurozone companies were growing at the fastest rate since 2011. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s service sector also beat expectations, although there are still signs that Brexit uncertainty is hitting investment. The rally began in Japan, where stocks jumped to their highest levels in 26 years as trading resumed after the New Year break. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s probably all for today (although I may pop back later with the close of Wall Street....) According to US reporters, Donald Trump has set the Dow Jones a new target - 30,000 points. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE 250 index has hit a new closing high (again) too. The index, which contains smaller companies than the FTSE 100, gained 0.37% today to close at 20,820 points. Shares in Debenhams ended the day down almost 15%, at 30.34p. That lowers its market capitalisation to just \u00c2\u00a3370m, from \u00c2\u00a3435m yesterday (according to my calculations anyway). The news that sales since Christmas had been disappointing obviously worried the City. Healthcare chain NMC Health was the best-performing member of the FTSE 100 today, helping to push it to new heights. But Marks &amp; Spencer dragged the index back, and was the worst-performing member (blame Debenham\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s profit warning). Boom! Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE 100 has hit a new record closing high, at 7,695.88 points. The blue-chip index gained 24 points today, sending it over the previous record close - set on the final day of trading last year. At one stage, the Footsie poked its nose over over 7,700 points. The rally was led by energy stocks, miners, technology stocks and financial firms. Consumer companies lagged behind, though, following Debenham\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s unexpected profit warning this morning. There are just 10 minutes of the trading day left in Europe, and Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE 100 is on track to hit a new closing high..... US president Donald Trump has welcomed today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock market rally - along with a non-too subtle attempt to take some of the credit: Chipmaker Intel is bucking the trend, though, plunging by over 4.5% this morning. That follows the discovery of a very serious security vulnerability in its processors, which could expose many millions of people to cybercriminals. My colleague Sam Gibbs explains: The flaws, named Meltdown and Spectre, were discovered by security researchers at Google\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Project Zero in conjunction with academic and industry researchersfrom several countries. Combined they affect virtually every modern computer, including smartphones, tablets and PCs from all vendors and running almost any operating system. Meltdown is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153probably one of the worst CPU bugs ever found\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, said Daniel Gruss, one of the researchers at Graz University of Technology who discovered the flaw. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Sam\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s latest story: The Dow is continuing to hit new heights, and is now up 173 points or 0.7% at 25,097. Wall Street titans Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan are the biggest risers, both up around 2%, followed by American Express and IBM. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Associated Press\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s take on today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Wall Street action: The Dow Jones industrial average traded above 25,000 points for the first time, blasting through another 1,000-point milestone. The Dow\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s latest breakthrough came in early trading Thursday and just five weeks after closing above 24,000 points for the first time. Technology companies and banks had some of the biggest gains in early trading. Wells Fargo rose 1.9 percent and Microsoft rose 0.7 percent. The Standard &amp; Poor\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 500 index rose 9 points, or 0.3 percent, to 2,722. The Dow Jones industrials increased 118 points, or 0.5 percent, to 25,037. The Nasdaq climbed 16 points, or 0.2 percent, to 7,081. Update: Get out the Dow 25k hats! The Dow Jones industrial average has just risen through the 25,000 point mark for the first time ever, as it keeps hitting new highs. The bull market has swept shares upwards in the last year or so - 12 months ago, the Dow was below 20k. Boom! America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock market has hit a new alltime high at the start of trading. Although the weather is pretty awful in New York, with temperatures below freezing, the mood on Wall Street is positively fizzling. The Dow Jones industrial average has jumped by 67 points at the open, a gain of 0.27%, to 24,990 points for the first time ever. Traders are impressed by today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ADP jobs report, showing the strongest employment growth since March. Paul Ashworth of Capital Economics is also impressed by today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s US jobs report. He writes: That 250,000 ADP gain, up from 185,000 in November, was probably skewed upwards by the recent strength of the official non-farm payrolls figures, however, which are used as one of the inputs. Nevertheless, after the earlier disruption caused by the hurricanes, the labour market clearly ended 2017 with some considerable momentum. Looking at the ADP details, the gains were broad-based, with the manufacturing sector adding 9,000 jobs and construction adding 16,000. Within the services sector, the 72,000 gain in professional &amp; business services was particularly encouraging, since jobs in that sector tend to be relatively well paid. Job creation is great, but where is the wage growth, analysts at Danske Bank wonder..... America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s labor market got a pre-Christmas boost, according to Mark Zandi, chief economist of Moody\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Analytics, (which helps produce the ADP jobs report). Zandi says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The job market ended the year strongly,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Robust Christmas sales prompted retailers and delivery services to add to their payrolls. The tight labor market will get even tighter, raising the specter that it will overheat.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd NEWSFLASH: America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s private sector created many more jobs than expected last month, in the latest sign that the US economy is robust. US companies hired 250,000 new workers in December, according to payroll firm ADP. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the biggest monthly increase since March, Economists had only expected an increase of 190,000; this suggests that tomorrow\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s non-farm payroll report (the main US employment gauge) could be strong. Service sector companies provided the bulk of the new jobs; including 72,000 new \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcprofessional and business\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 roles. Cyprus has begun the year on an optimistic note, reports my colleague Helena Smith. Cyprus\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 statistics service announced that unemployment dropped by an unprecedented 15% last month reinforcing evidence that the euro zone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s most easterly member state is en route to making a remarkable economic recovery following the island\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s near financial meltdown in 2013. 35,771 people were registered as unemployed in December, the lowest rates since December 2011, according to Cystat. The drop was attributed squarely to the construction sector which is rebounding with the recovery. Unemployment in the midst of crisis reached an all-time high of 53,204 in February 2014. In his New Year address, president Nicos Anastasiades described 2017 as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a year of stability and development\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd saying\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I have no doubt that each and every one of us reasonably feel that hope is rising in our country.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The leader, who is currently making the first ever visit to Saudi Arabia by a Cypriot head of state, has pledged to make sound fiscal policy a priority if he is re-elected in upcoming presidential elections. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s lunchtime! Now, for the average worker this means a quick scamper to the canteen, sandwich shop or supermarket (unless you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re organised enough to bring your own provisions). But for Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s top bosses, it means something quite different. They\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve now earned the average UK annual wage since the start of 201 -- ie, in just two and a half working days. My colleague Rupert Neate explains: The chief executives of FTSE 100 companies are paid a median average of \u00c2\u00a33.45m a year, which works out at 120 times the \u00c2\u00a328,758 collected by full-time UK workers on average. On an hourly basis the bosses will have earned more in less than three working days than the average employee will pick up this year, leading campaigners to dub the day \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Fat Cat Thursday\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Frances O\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Grady, the TUC general secretary, said it was outrageous that bosses were picking up \u00e2\u20ac\u0153salaries that look like telephone numbers\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd while workers were \u00e2\u20ac\u0153suffering the longest pay squeeze since Napoleonic times\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. More here: German supermarket chain Aldi had a rather better Christmas than poor old Debenhams. Strong demand for treats like mince pies, glitzy gammon joints and Irish cream liqueur helped Aldi to grow its total sales by 15% over the Christmas period. This means Aldi probably achieved \u00c2\u00a310bn of sales in the UK last year, for the first time. Martin Lane, Managing Editor of money.co.uk, says Aldi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s reputation for low prices and bargains means it is thriving in the current economic climate: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153As a nation of shoppers, we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re looking after the pound in our pocket more and more, and with their \u00e2\u20ac\u0153specially selected\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd premium items Aldi is offering the same package as the other big 4 retailers but without the expensive price tag. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Aldi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Specialbuys and Super 6 offers continue to make headlines and get customers through their doors and over the festive season their competitive Christmas veg prices made them a huge contender. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Aldi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ever-increasing popularity suggests there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no sign of a slowdown for the discount giant.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Debenhams shares are still being thumped by investors. They\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re currently down 16% at just under 30p, down from 35.56p last night. That has knocked Debenham\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s market capitalisation down from \u00c2\u00a3435m to just \u00c2\u00a3365m - which makes Debs quite a minor player. In comparison, Marks &amp; Spencer is worth \u00c2\u00a35.2bn, and Next is valued at over \u00c2\u00a37bn. WH Smiths, the newsagent, has a market cap of \u00c2\u00a32.5bn while Sports Direct\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s is \u00c2\u00a32.1bn. But Debenham\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s plight is best illustrated with a comparison to Fever-Tree, a company founded less than 14 years ago to produce high-end tonic water and other soft drinks. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s now valued at almost \u00c2\u00a32.6bn! David Madden of CMC Markets: Debenhams had a disappointing Christmas period and the retailer has issued a profit warning. The retailer cited a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcvolatile and competitive\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 market for the drop in sales. Debenhams now predicts that full-year profits will be within the range of \u00c2\u00a355 million to \u00c2\u00a365 million, which is a considerable decline on the previous forecast of \u00c2\u00a383 million. The stock has been in decline for over five years, and if this trend continues it could target 20p. Laith Khalaf, senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown: \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcStrong growth for its digital offering has failed to save Debenhams from a miserable end to the year. Customers turned out for Christmas, but refused to put their hands in their pockets in the lead up to the festive period, or indeed the Boxing Day sales. Debenhams has been forced to cut prices to persuade shoppers to part with their cash, and as a result margins have been squeezed, profits have been significantly downgraded, and the share price has taken a massive hit. Lee Wild, head of equity strategy at interactive investor: Turns out Next may have given retail sector investors a false sense of security yesterday. Debenhams brought things down to earth with a bump, warning that the fourth quarter of 2017 was bookended by weak trade and that heavy discounting has damaged margins. Getting back to Debenhams.... CEO Sergio Bucher has been speaking to reporters following this morning\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s profits warning. Bucher says that Debenhams will speed up its cost-cutting plans - although it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not planning to close stores (on top of the 10 already earmarked for closure) Bucher says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153There will be some jobs that will go - we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be creating jobs as well. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s what happens when you reorganise teams.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd In other news, consumer credit growth in the UK has slowed - perhaps a sign that people are cutting back their spending. Annual credit growth slowed to 8.5% in the three months to November, new Bank of England figures show, down from 9.3% in the quarter to October. The pick-up in service sector growth in December suggests that Britain has shrugged off its \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcsoft patch\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 early last year, says Kallum Pickering of Berenberg bank. But, he still thinks it would have done better without the looming exit from the EU: The UK economy probably expanded by 1.8% yoy in 2017. While this is below the 2% annual average for the post-Lehman period, it is probably at, or even a little above, what the UK can manage on trend outside of the EU. To be fair, relative to the market\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s very depressed growth expectations for 2017 following the Brexit vote in 2016, the UK did much better than expected last year. That is, however, not to say that Brexit did not hurt. Growth in the US and the Eurozone, the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s major trading partners, accelerated to well above the average of recent years. The uncertainty from Brexit prevented the UK from fully enjoying the tailwind from the synchronised global upswing. Without Brexit, the UK economy would have expanded by at least 2.5% last year. Breaking: Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s service sector picked up pace in December, suggesting the economy is holding up well. The UK services PMI, produced by data firm Markit, has jumped to 54.2 for last month, from 53.8 in November. Any reading over 50 shows growth, and this is the second-highest score since last April. Companies reported that business activity growth picked up last month; however, new work and employment numbers rose at a slower pace. Overall, the PMI survey indicates that the UK grew at a pretty steady pace at the end of last year.... However, there are also signs that Brexit uncertainty is deterring some clients from spending money, undermining Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s longer-term prospects, Markit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Chris Williamson explains: Digging into the details behind the resilient strength signalled by the headline numbers, the survey data reveal an economy that is beset with uncertainty about the outlook, which is in turn dampening business spending and investment. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Trends in hiring and business investment in fixed assets such as offices are showing signs of deteriorating, as is expenditure on IT, computing and other business services as worries about Brexit result in delayed spending decisions. Rising price pressures are meanwhile also hurting consumer- facing companies in particular. Nearly time to discover how Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s service sector fared last month... Breaking: Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s companies have posted their strongest growth since 2011. The eurozone composite PMI, which measures activity across the region, jumped to 58.1 in December, up from November\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 57.5. The service sector PMI rose to 56.6, up from 56.2 a month earlier. Companies reported that new orders strengthened last month, with manufacturers seeing the steepest increase in new business since 2000. This encouraged them to keep hiring more staff. Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit says the eurozone gathered momentum at the end of last year: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153A stellar end to 2017 for the eurozone rounded off the best year for over a decade, continuing to confound widely-held fears that rising political uncertainty would curb economic growth. At 56.4, the average PMI reading for 2017 was the highest annual trend since 2006. Manufacturing is enjoying its best growth spell since data were first collected over two decades ago while the service sector closed off its best year since 2007. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The survey data are consistent with the quarterly rate of GDP growth accelerating to an impressive 0.8% in Q4, with no sign of momentum being lost as we move into 2018. New work is flowing to companies at a rate not seen for a decade and backlogs of uncompleted work are rising sharply. Hiring is consequently at a 17-year high as firms look to boost capacity to meet rising workloads. Optimism about the outlook also turned higher in December. Debenhams\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 profit warning has spooked other UK retailers too. Marks &amp; Spencer are down 2.7%, the worst performer on the FTSE 100, on fears that its Christmas may have been less sparkling than hoped. Dixons Carphone have dipped too. Connor Campbell of Spreadex says Debenham is in a tough fight: After Wednesday saw Next provide its retail peers with some post-Christmas optimism, Debenhams gave the sector a reality check this Thursday as it became the first casualty of 2018. A 2.6% drop in like-for-like sales following a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcvolatile and competitive\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 festive period forced the firm to issue a profit warning, with the ailing high street staple forecasting its full year figures to come in somewhere between of \u00c2\u00a355m to \u00c2\u00a365m, way off the \u00c2\u00a383m expected by analysts. Inevitably this caused a wave of investors to jump ship, the stock plunging 20% to sub-28p \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Debenhams now faces an uphill battle to avoid becoming the next BHS. Retail analyst Steve Dresser reckons Debenhams has only itself to blame, for overpricing its Christmas gift offerings... OUCH! Shares in Debenhams have plunged by 20% at the start of trading, following its shock profits warning. They tumbled from 35.6p to as low as 28p, as traders punish the company for slashing its profit forecasts this morning. Debenhams is the first UK retailer to suffer the ignominy of a post-Christmas profits warning this year, as retail analyst Nick Bubb explains: We said yesterday that there was no sign so far of anybody having to bring forward their scheduled Christmas trading announcements from next week\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6but poor old Debenhams has stepped up to the plate today, to warn that weak gross margins (-150 bps) and a poor Sale last week have hit the bottom-line. Full-year profits (to end August) are likely to be down to \u00c2\u00a355m-65m, versus a modest consensus forecast of about \u00c2\u00a383m, despite finding an extra \u00c2\u00a310m of cost savings... Sergio Bucher, the new CEO of Debenhams, wails: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The market has been challenging and particularly promotional in some of our key seasonal categories and we have responded in order to remain competitive for our customers, which has impacted our profit performance\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Newsflash: Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE 100 has hit a fresh record high at the start of trading. The blue-chip index rose by 27 points to 7,698 points, just over the previous record set on the final trading session of 2017. That follows the rally in Japan this morning, and last night\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s record close on Wall Street. High street retailer Debenhams has sent a shiver through the City this morning, reports my colleague Angela Monaghan: Debenhams has issued a surprise profits warning after a disappointing festive season and a failure to entice shoppers despite heavy discounting in the post- Christmas sales period. The department store chain struck a gloomy tone as it brought forward by a week its Christmas trading update to warn the current UK trading environment was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153volatile and highly competitive with weaker demand in some more discretionary areas\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Debenhams said profits for the full year were now likely to be in the range of \u00c2\u00a355m to \u00c2\u00a365m, sharply below the \u00c2\u00a383m expected by the City. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We took tactical promotional action to improve our performance which resulted in a stronger 6 week Christmas period against tough comparatives... However, the first week of post-Christmas sale was below expectations despite further markdown investment, particularly in the highly seasonal gift category,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd the retailer said. Like-for-like sales in the UK - which strip out the impact of sales at stores open for less than a year - fell 2.6% in the 17 weeks to 30 December. Like-for-like sales overall were down 1.8%. Sergio Bucher, chief executive of the retailer, said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The market has been challenging and particularly promotional in some of our key seasonal categories and we have responded in order to remain competitive for our customers, which has impacted our profit performance. Just in: London was the worst-performing part of the UK property sector last year, according to the Nationwide building society. The average house price in the capital fell by 0.5% during 2017, Nationwide reports, while the UK average rose by 2.6%. Robert Gardner, Nationwide\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Chief Economist, says mounting pressure on household incomes held house price growth back (good news if you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re tying to get onto the housing ladder). Gardner adds: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The significant disparity in house prices across the UK has been a recurring theme in recent years. In this respect, 2017 saw the beginnings of a shift, as rates of house price growth in the south of England moderated towards those prevailing in the rest of the country. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153London saw a particularly marked slowdown, with prices falling in annual terms for the first time in eight years, albeit by a modest 0.5%. London ended the year the weakest performing region for the first time since 2004. But despite this slowdown, the average London house still costs over \u00c2\u00a3470k -- or more than double the national average.... Investors \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcflocked\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 to the Japanese stock market today to buy shares, says Japan Today, driven by expectations that the markets will rally in 2018. It reports: The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average ended up 741.39 points, or 3.26%, from Friday at 23,506.33, its highest close since Jan 7, 1992. The broader Topix index of all First Section issues on the Tokyo Stock Exchange finished 46.26 points, or 2.55%, higher at 1,863.82. Tokyo markets were closed from Monday to Wednesday for the New Year holidays. The Nikkei posted the largest daily gain since November 2016 as every industry category on the main section gained ground, led by oil and coal product, securities and electric appliance issues. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. World stock markets have started the new year in good heart, on hopes that economic growth will be robust this year. Over in Tokyo, Japan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock market has surged by over 3% to close at its highest level in 26 years, on the first trading day of the year. Energy and financials stocks led the rally. Traders were in good spirits after the US stock markets closed at (yet another) record high last night, showing that the bull market still has legs. Optimism was also boosted by new data showing that Japan and China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s service sectors both performed well in December, with growth accelerating. Jasper Lawler of London Capital Group says: Japanese stocks returned from holiday trading with a bang. The Topix index struck a 26 year, tracking the optimism that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s seen Wall Street close at record highs in the past two trading sessions. The energy sector was leading the charge in Asia after oil prices climbed again. At the same time activity in Japan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s manufacturing sector rose to a 4 year high according to survey data. Later this morning we get service sector reports from the UK and the eurozone, which will probably confirm that Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy ended 2017 strongly. We also get a fresh healthcheck on Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s property market, with new house price figures from Nationwide and the latest mortgage approvals numbers. Plus, we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be tracking the UK retail sector, as high street retailer Debenhams has just released a profits warning! That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a blow, a day after Next surprised the City with decent-looking results yesterday. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the agenda: 7am GMT: Nationwide house price survey for December 9am GMT: Eurozone service sector PMI for December 9.30am GMT: UK service sector PMI for December 9.30am GMT: UK mortgage approvals and consumer credit data 1.30pm GMT: US initial jobless figures",

Cutbacks are the order of the day.

John Lewis is doing well although, like Next, all the improvement is online, not in its stores.</p> <p>Soon, even more high streets outside the big cities and successful market towns will have a ghostly pallor.</p> <p>At the root of the problem is the decline in disposable incomes. With inflation at around 3% and wage rises averaging 2.2%, households are struggling to maintain their standard of living. In a post-EU referendum economy, with uncertainty forcing companies to delay investment, average wages don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t look like rising strongly any time soon.</p> <p>There was more bad news in the latest Bank of England study of consumer lending. A survey of high street banks found they were planning to severely restrict the generosity displayed in recent years that has pushed unsecured lending up by around 10% a year.</p> <p>Credit-card balances will be cut back and the length of interest-free periods will be reduced. Cheap loans will be limited to only the safest borrowers.</p> <p>This move is a response to concerns that the major banks had begun to lend recklessly, repeating the mistakes that led to the 2008 banking crash.</p> <p>There can be no doubt that some harsh words are welcome from the financial regulator decrying bonus-chasing bankers offering loans to every Tom, Jane and Harriet.</p> <p>However, they are not so welcome if you are a shop owner or worker who depends on consumers maintaining their shopping habits.</p> <p>MPs have largely ignored the subject of healthy town centres, leaving the problem to local authorities. Maybe if more of them shopped in their constituencies, they might notice the changes going on.</p> <p>It is possible that after another tough year, and some more shop closures, they might want the government to start thinking about giving the worst-affected towns a fresh start.</p> <h2>Even if bonds fall, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hard to see an end to this era of cheap credit</h2> <p>There are some economic laws that reassert themselves, and some that are victims of changing times. The likely path of borrowing costs \u00e2\u20ac\u201c that they rise in good times and fall in bad \u00e2\u20ac\u201c is one such law that has failed to conform to previous trends.</p> <p>For 30 years now, interest rates have been falling, making it cheaper and cheaper to borrow money. This trend has continued during booms and busts on global stock markets, to which the debt markets were previously tied. The 2008 crash accelerated the decline in rates, but it was already well under way.</p> <p>Today, central banks charge commercial lenders an almost zero rate of interest, allowing mortgage lenders to push loan rates down to historic lows. Even the five increases in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/dec/13/interest-rate-rise-federal-reserve-janet-yellen-final-act\" title=\"\">US Federal Reserve\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s base rates</a> since 2015 have done nothing to alter the downward trend. US lenders, keen to win business, have squeezed their margins rather than pass on the higher cost of borrowing from the Fed.</p> <p>But there are several <a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/bill-gross-signals-bond-bear-091147747.html\" title=\"\">debt-market gurus</a> who think the latest signals from the European Central Bank and the central banks of Japan and China could mark an end to this era of cheap credit.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/mar/16/bond-market-crashes-and-market-contagion\" title=\"\">The price of buying bonds</a>, which is the market\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s way of packaging up the debt issued by governments and companies \u00e2\u20ac\u201c state and corporate borrowing, in other words \u00e2\u20ac\u201c is falling. The interest rate \u00e2\u20ac\u201c referred to as the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153yield\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u201c on bonds rises as the price falls, and last week the yield on a 10-year US government bond jumped to nearly 2.6%, its highest level for almost a year.</p> <p>If, as is being signalled, the central banks of China, Japan and the eurozone start cutting back on their purchases of bonds, then, the argument runs, overall demand will fall and so will the price: and such borrowing will become more expensive.</p> <p>But even if central banks end their role as major bond purchasers, there is still plenty of demand. The world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s financial system is awash with money looking for a home. Bonds remain a popular choice \u00e2\u20ac\u201c cushioning any potential fall in price and rise in yield.</p> <h2>Big brains of business enjoy curling up with a good book</h2> <p>On both sides of the Atlantic, book clubs have strong associations with entertainment stars: Oprah Winfrey in the US, for example, and Richard and Judy in the UK. But now there is a new genre of literary cheerleader: the corporate&#xa0;bibliophile.</p> <p>Mark Zuckerberg and Bill Gates <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/jan/12/davos-bill-gates-mark-zuckerberg-what-to-read\" title=\"\">both publish reading lists</a> and encourage readers to follow suit. Among the titles recommended by both tycoons are Yuval Noah Harari\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s <em>Sapiens</em> and <em>The Better Angels of Our Nature</em> by Steven Pinker. The Gates and Zuckerberg lists have won approval from cultural peers, including the managing director of Waterstones, but there has been justified criticism of the apparent gender imbalance in their reading. Books by men appear to outweigh those by women.</p> <p>Hopefully, the Facebook and Microsoft founders will adjust their bedtime reading piles accordingly. That aside, it is surely a good thing that two of the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s most powerful corporate figures are advocating the attainment of written wisdom. Their peers should take note. Literally.</p>",
                "bodyText":"Life is tough for high street retailers and likely to get worse in 2018. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the clear message following a difficult Christmas for most shopping chains and signals from the banks that they aim to bring a three-year bonanza of cheap consumer credit to an end, or at least severely restrict its further growth. Supermarkets were among the survivors as shoppers chose to spend a few extra pounds on food to cope with inflation. But that meant cutbacks elsewhere. Clothing, shoes and furniture joined a list of items shoppers decided they could do without \u00e2\u20ac\u201c or, if they needed them, they went online for a cheap deal. Next was among the retailers to enjoy a degree of expansion after it was rescued by healthy online sales. Marks &amp; Spencer struggled to make any headway after its failure to entice customers to its website. If the health of the high street depends on anyone, it is the big discounters like Aldi and Lidl in the supermarket wars and B&amp;M, which is the Primark of food shops, selling household brands such as Kellogg\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s and Walkers at knock-down prices. But few high streets can survive with just discount shops to add to a smattering of charity outlets, bookies and pawnbrokers. Most towns vie with their neighbours to have at least one department store on their high street or, failing that, some national chains. Not so long ago, when Debenhams seemed like it would be turning up in almost every corner of the country with a new store, this dream appeared to be coming true. John Lewis was another department store that was talked about as a candidate for aiding urban renewal in the unlikeliest of places. The rapid expansion of chains such as New Look, TK Maxx and, more recently, jeweller Pandora has helped keep many smaller centres from looking down at heel. Sadly, Debenhams had a disastrous Christmas, as did House of Fraser, and both have ditched any expansion plans left over from the 2015 boom times. Cutbacks are the order of the day. M&amp;S is already closing stores, mostly in towns that shoppers have long since started driving past. New Look has seen sales fall, while profits at TK Maxx and Pandora are down.

In a post-EU referendum economy, with uncertainty forcing companies to delay investment, average wages don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t look like rising strongly any time soon. There was more bad news in the latest Bank of England study of consumer lending. A survey of high street banks found they were planning to severely restrict the generosity displayed in recent years that has pushed unsecured lending up by around 10% a year. Credit-card balances will be cut back and the length of interest-free periods will be reduced. Cheap loans will be limited to only the safest borrowers. This move is a response to concerns that the major banks had begun to lend recklessly, repeating the mistakes that led to the 2008 banking crash. There can be no doubt that some harsh words are welcome from the financial regulator decrying bonus-chasing bankers offering loans to every Tom, Jane and Harriet. However, they are not so welcome if you are a shop owner or worker who depends on consumers maintaining their shopping habits. MPs have largely ignored the subject of healthy town centres, leaving the problem to local authorities. Maybe if more of them shopped in their constituencies, they might notice the changes going on. It is possible that after another tough year, and some more shop closures, they might want the government to start thinking about giving the worst-affected towns a fresh start. Even if bonds fall, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hard to see an end to this era of cheap credit There are some economic laws that reassert themselves, and some that are victims of changing times. The likely path of borrowing costs \u00e2\u20ac\u201c that they rise in good times and fall in bad \u00e2\u20ac\u201c is one such law that has failed to conform to previous trends. For 30 years now, interest rates have been falling, making it cheaper and cheaper to borrow money. This trend has continued during booms and busts on global stock markets, to which the debt markets were previously tied. The 2008 crash accelerated the decline in rates, but it was already well under way. Today, central banks charge commercial lenders an almost zero rate of interest, allowing mortgage lenders to push loan rates down to historic lows. Even the five increases in the US Federal Reserve\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s base rates since 2015 have done nothing to alter the downward trend. US lenders, keen to win business, have squeezed their margins rather than pass on the higher cost of borrowing from the Fed. But there are several debt-market gurus who think the latest signals from the European Central Bank and the central banks of Japan and China could mark an end to this era of cheap credit. The price of buying bonds, which is the market\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s way of packaging up the debt issued by governments and companies \u00e2\u20ac\u201c state and corporate borrowing, in other words \u00e2\u20ac\u201c is falling. The interest rate \u00e2\u20ac\u201c referred to as the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153yield\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u201c on bonds rises as the price falls, and last week the yield on a 10-year US government bond jumped to nearly 2.6%, its highest level for almost a year. If, as is being signalled, the central banks of China, Japan and the eurozone start cutting back on their purchases of bonds, then, the argument runs, overall demand will fall and so will the price: and such borrowing will become more expensive. But even if central banks end their role as major bond purchasers, there is still plenty of demand. The world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s financial system is awash with money looking for a home. Bonds remain a popular choice \u00e2\u20ac\u201c cushioning any potential fall in price and rise in yield. Big brains of business enjoy curling up with a good book On both sides of the Atlantic, book clubs have strong associations with entertainment stars: Oprah Winfrey in the US, for example, and Richard and Judy in the UK. But now there is a new genre of literary cheerleader: the corporate bibliophile. Mark Zuckerberg and Bill Gates both publish reading lists and encourage readers to follow suit. Among the titles recommended by both tycoons are Yuval Noah Harari\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Sapiens and The Better Angels of Our Nature by Steven Pinker. The Gates and Zuckerberg lists have won approval from cultural peers, including the managing director of Waterstones, but there has been justified criticism of the apparent gender imbalance in their reading. Books by men appear to outweigh those by women. Hopefully, the Facebook and Microsoft founders will adjust their bedtime reading piles accordingly. That aside, it is surely a good thing that two of the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s most powerful corporate figures are advocating the attainment of written wisdom. Their peers should take note.

The US currency has been under pressure on worries that the Trump tax cuts would increase the already hefty US national debt. And the dollar has become less attractive as other central banks begin edging up interest rates and gradually removing their long standing stimulus programmes.</p> <p>And despite a resolution to the government shutdown, the problem has only been postponed until early next month. Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at IG, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Renewed dollar weakness is the revival of yet another familiar friend from 2017. Post-shutdown euphoria has been replaced by a weary acceptance that we will probably have to do this all over again in just over two weeks. Why buy the greenback, when so many other economies can show solid growth without the government disruption so prevalent in the US at the moment?</p> </blockquote> <p>So with the stronger pound, the FTSE 100 came off its best levels.

Uncertainty about possible Eurozone reform, Italian elections and the success of the German coalition negotiations clearly take a backseat to improved economic factors.</p> <p>Over the past few months, consumer confidence improved most notably because of a much more positive view on the general economic situation, modest improvements in assessments of the financial situation and increased amounts of current and expected major purchases. This indicates that optimism and stronger consumption are going hand in hand, spurring the household consumption component of GDP growth. While unemployment expectations have become slightly less favourable over the last months of 2017, this is actually at odds with businesses indicating that hiring expectations remain very high.</p> <p>With such a favourable outlook, it could well be that the record for consumer confidence could be breached a few more times in 2018.

                "bodyText":"Time for a quick recap of the main events from the first day of Davos: Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau has challenged business leaders and politicians to end gender inequality and tackle unacceptable and systemic sexual harassment. You can watch a clip here. Trudeau also announced that the ten members of the trans-pacific partnership have agreed to extend their agreement. Oxfam\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Winnie Byanyima has also hailed campaigners against sexual harrassment, saying they have helped people worldwide. Davos also heard that parents need to teach their sons not to hit women, rather than simply how to hit baseballs. India\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Narendra Modi has warned that globalisation is under threat, and also cited climate change and terrorism as key threats to the global economy. The mood at Davos has been optimistic, although bank bosses have warned against complacency. An MIT economics professor has predicted that Facebook will barely exist in 20 years. Australian actor Cate Blanchett has criticised politicians for pandering to anti-refugee sentiment, instead of helping the millions of people displaced worldwide. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s probably all for tonight. Thanks for reading and commenting. GW A positive start following news that the US government shutdown had been resolved, for the moment at least, soon faded, leaving European markets a mixed bag by the close. Sterling rose above $1.40 to a new post-Brexit vote high, partly due to hopes that a successful trade deal can be negotiated, but also thanks to continuing weakness in the dollar. The US currency has been under pressure on worries that the Trump tax cuts would increase the already hefty US national debt. And the dollar has become less attractive as other central banks begin edging up interest rates and gradually removing their long standing stimulus programmes. And despite a resolution to the government shutdown, the problem has only been postponed until early next month. Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at IG, said: Renewed dollar weakness is the revival of yet another familiar friend from 2017. Post-shutdown euphoria has been replaced by a weary acceptance that we will probably have to do this all over again in just over two weeks. Why buy the greenback, when so many other economies can show solid growth without the government disruption so prevalent in the US at the moment? So with the stronger pound, the FTSE 100 came off its best levels. But Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax hovered around record levels, following upbeat consumer confidence figures and signs that a coalition government could be moving closer. In the US, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fluctuated between positive and negative, but Nasdaq was lifted by the positive Netflix update. The final scores in Europe showed: The FTSE 100 finished up 16.39 points or 0.21% at 7731.83 Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax rose 0.71% to 13,559.60 France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac closed down 0.12% at 5535.26 Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB fell 0.22% to 23,836.60 Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ibex ended up 0.24% at 10,609.5 In Greece, the Athens market added 1.62% to 872.00 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 28 points or 0.11%. NF Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a video clip of Justin Trudeau laying down the law on sexual harassment: Justin Trudeau\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s speech has caused quite a stir, with its trenchant criticism of greedy, uncaring businesses and gender inequality. Adam Parsons of the BBC thinks it was a punchy speech: John Stackhouse of Royal Bank of Canada says Trudeau is shaking up the idea of what \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcDavos Man\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 acts like: Ian Bremmer says Trudeau showed how gender equality is an important economic issue: But Jamie Drummond of campaigning group One isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t convinced Trudeau will deliver: Justin Trudeau also made an important point about trade. He tells Davos that Canada is trying to convince U.S. President Donald Trump that the NAFTA trade agreement was in the interest of the United States as well as other countries. Trudeau says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re working very hard to make sure that our neighbour to the south recognizes how good NAFTA is and that it has benefited not just our economy but his economy and the world economy,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Justin Trudeau moves onto another vital issue - campaigns such as #MeToo and Time\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Up. The Canadian PM declares: These movements show us we must have a critical discussion on women\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rights, equality and the power dynamics of gender. Sexual harassment in business and in government is a systemic problem and it is unacceptable. As leaders, we must recognise and act to truly show that time is up. Justin Trudeau now urges business chiefs at Davos to help fight inequality by hiring, promoting and retaining more women. Getting more women into the workforce isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t just the right thing to do, or the nice thing to do, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the smart thing to do, he tells the World Economic Forum, Studies show it can provide a significant economic boost. Firms need to address gender pay, and he warns that many firms aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t doing as well as they think. Just paying men and women the same doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t go far enough, unless you also tackle the barriers faced by female workers. Women do more part-time work, and more unpaid work than men. Parental leave and childcare policies must be reexamined, Trudeau tells WEF. Firms should implement policies to improve gender balance. He also reminds us that he introduced Canada\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s first gender-balanced cabinet, and the performance of those female ministers has proved the naysayers wrong. Justin Trudeau has warned that businesses and politicians are failing to help their workers and citizens in today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u0153rapidly changing world\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. People have been taken advantage of, losing their jobs, the Canadian PM warns: Governments and corporations, we haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t done enough to address this. He also blasts corporate greed, saying: Too many corporations have single-mindedly put the pursuit of profit ahead of the well-being of workers. The gap between the rich and the poor is staggering, Trudeau points out, adding All the while, companies avoid taxes and boast record profits with one hand while slashing benefits with the other. Our priority must be the people who are struggling the most, and who will never get to Davos, Trudeau says. And he warns that if we operate on the basis of business as usual, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the system will break down and we will all fail.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau is now speaking to Davos. He begins by thanking the seven all-female co-chairs for organising this year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s WEF. He then makes an important announcement: The 10 remaining members of the Trans-Pacific Partnership have concluded a new agreement that will maintain their alliance. The agreement reached today in Tokyo is the right deal, Trudeau insists. It will create growth, prosperity, and middle class jobs in Canada today and for generations. This is significant, as Donald Trump pulled the US out of the TPP. In an hour\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time, Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau will give a special address to the World Economic Forum. As a liberal, feminist leader, Trudeau is a Davos favourite. But that shouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t mean he gets a free pass. Jamie Drummond, executive director of the development group One, says that Trudeau isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t actually delivering on pledges to make the world a better place. As Drummond puts it: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s so exasperating that prime minister Justin Trudeau will make another great speech today while the facts point in a shocking direction. Smart aid rates under Trudeau are lower than under his conservative predecessor Stephen Harper, the money he loudly promised would be new to fight aids, TB and malaria was in fact not new, and his feminist foreign policy is not backed by new funds. This can and must change now. Not in 2020, or some vague theoretical far-off point after the next election. Drummond urges WEF delegates to put Trudeau under pressure to deliver. This week in Davos he must be asked when and by specifically how much he will increase funding for girls education and women\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economic empowerment; and please, he must do it this year. If we want him be a great leader on these issues, we must withhold praise until we see the quality of his action not just his delightful adverbs. Trust Trudeau - but verify. And if Davos doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t pressure leaders like Trudeau to be the best they can be, or hold them accountable, this gathering is a self-defeating backslapping waste of time the world doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd As we reported this morning, Drummond is threatening not to come back to Davos unless this annual shindig starts delivering the goods. The Greek prime minister Alexis Tsipras is among the world leaders who have lined up to get to Davos, reports Helena Smith from Athens: Tsipras, who arrived only hours after Athens wrapped up a third bailout compliance review \u00e2\u20ac\u201c edging ever closer to ending dependence on international bailout loans when the programme expires this summer - is meeting investors also gathered in Davos. The leftist\u00e2\u20ac\u201cled government, in an about\u00e2\u20ac\u201cturn of its previous antagonism, is now keen to attract foreign capital as it prepares the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s return to capital markets. This afternoon\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meeting is much in the vein of luring investors to fund projects in Greece with an eye to slashing unemployment \u00e2\u20ac\u201c at 21% still the highest in the EU and by far the nation\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest social ill. Monday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s eurogroup meeting saw euro area finance ministers agreeing to disburse \u00e2\u201a\u00ac6.7bn to the debt -stricken nation in two instalments. The first chunk of \u00e2\u201a\u00ac5.7bn will be released in February, once outstanding reforms are implemented, to cover debt servicing needs, arrears and creation of a cash buffer that will support Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s return to markets. Talks on debt relief are expected to begin soon \u00e2\u20ac\u201c along with a fourth compliance review which included 88 creditor-mandates reforms being taken by June. Sounding a note of optimism, EU Financial Affairs Commissioner Pierre Moscovici said the single currency bloc should prepare for \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a successful conclusion, which means Greece being back as a normal member of the eurozone and the final signal \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the end of the Greek crisis.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd After the better than expected German consumer confidence figures, there is more positive news from Europe. Eurozone consumer confidence rose from 0.5 points in December to 1.3 points in January, according to the European Commission. This was well above forecasts of a figure of 0.6. In the wide European Union, confidence jumped 1 point to 0.4 points. ING economist Bert Colijn said: With inflation still low, job growth surprising on the upside, house prices increasing and growth forecasts adjusted upwards, there is a lot to like for consumers and that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s evident. The current mood among consumers is nothing short of ecstatic and current levels of confidence are generally associated with further acceleration in household consumption growth. Uncertainty about possible Eurozone reform, Italian elections and the success of the German coalition negotiations clearly take a backseat to improved economic factors. Over the past few months, consumer confidence improved most notably because of a much more positive view on the general economic situation, modest improvements in assessments of the financial situation and increased amounts of current and expected major purchases. This indicates that optimism and stronger consumption are going hand in hand, spurring the household consumption component of GDP growth. While unemployment expectations have become slightly less favourable over the last months of 2017, this is actually at odds with businesses indicating that hiring expectations remain very high. With such a favourable outlook, it could well be that the record for consumer confidence could be breached a few more times in 2018. This, in turn, confirms the rosy short-term picture for Eurozone growth. NF Dacher Keltner, Professor of Psychology from the University of California, is also on the sexual harassment panel alongside Winnie Byanyima. He says: Men tend to take more risks, they tend to be a lot more aggressive, and they tend to sexualise thing. So if you give a man power, those default tendencies will be expressed. Women tend to be more collaborative, co-operative, empathetic. You give them power, studies show it will amplify those pro-social tendencies. Lisa Sherman, President and Chief Executive Officer of the Advertising Council, says parents can do more to help boys treat women with respect. You teach your son how to hit a baseball, how to hit a jump shot, how to hit the net. But we should really be talking to them about who not to hit, and why. Peggy Johnson, executive Vice-President for Business Development at Microsoft, says the younger generation are helping to force change. She explains that her daughter recently started her career, and told her that \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcwhen there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s an inappropriate joke at work, I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t laugh\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. I thought back and thought, when I was her age I always laughed, says Johnson. My daughter said to me that she\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d learned not to laugh at these jokes from me, but she actually learned it from me in my 50s, not my 20s. Winnie Byanyima, the executive director of Oxfam International, is speaking powerfully about sexual exploitation against women around the globe. All the women in the world should be grateful to American women for taking a stand, and saying \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Me Too\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, Byanyima says, referring to the campaign that spread around the globe after the Harvey Weinstein scandal. It has brought new attention to a problem that is deep. Women in the developing world are at the bottom of the supply chain of big business. Oxfam hears stories of their lives, Byanyima explains, such as hotel housekeepers. All of them told us that they had faced sexual harassment or knew someone who had faced sexual harassment. It goes on with impunity. Domestic workers globally suffer abuse, she continues, and some of them are like slaves in the homes where they work. Only a few countries have ratified a new convention for domestic workers. It is not an accident that women are abused sexually at work or at home. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s due to the social norms that are there to justify their economic exploitation. That is why it is so important to tackle economic inequality, as this will also help tackle violence against women. Byanyima says there are three ways to tackle this problem: Remove all the laws that discriminate against women in the economy Tackle the social norms that justify sexual exploitation. Businesses have an important role to play here - they can use their factories, supply chains, advertising. Unilever are doing it, so others can too. Bring women into every level of decision-making and leadership, so they can drive change. In the wake of the resolution to the US government shutdown, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was initially expected to open higher. But when trading began the Dow dipped 27 points or 0.1%, with investors moving on to worry about the impact of Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s move to impose steep import tariffs, including possible retaliation. South Korea and China both protested at the duties on washing machines and solar panels. The S&amp;P 500 however edged up 0.03% and the Nasdaq composite climbed 0.23%. The uncertainty has taken some of the shine off European shares, with the FTSE 100 now up just 0.11% and France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac virtually unchanged. Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax is now up 0.76%, off its best levels. NF David Autor, Ford Professor of Economics at MIT, has predicted that today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s giant tech companies - such as Facebook - will suffer the face of previous dominant companies. He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s on a panel asking \u00e2\u20ac\u02dccan we live with monopolies\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. Autor explains that we currently live in an environment of \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcwinner takes most\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 markets, where having a small edge over your competitor gives you a massive advantage. So firms like Amazon and Facebook are growing organically (people are on Facebook because their friends are on Facebook), but that doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t mean that this growth is healthy. Or sustainable, in the long run. We did have these monopolies in the past, Autor points out, citing the US railroads, and AT&amp;T which was broken up by regulators. Also, companies which appear indomitable can fade pretty fast, he says - and then makes a bold prediction: I would guess that Facebook will be almost non-existent 20 years from now. Autor is also critical of the US model where employees are not treated as stakeholders (unlike shareholders). This situation has created a level of inequality that has led to political upheaval, he says. Elsewhere in Davos, the head of the Red Cross has warned that fresh humanitarian crises could break out this year. Peter Maurer, president of the International Committee of the Red Cross, says there are a lot of fragile situations that could develop into \u00e2\u20ac\u0153full-fledged\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd conflicts (as we saw with the Rohingya crisis in 2017). Maurer says there are plenty of places on the brink of war, violence and disruption. He cites Southern Philippines (which is under martial law), Myanmar, Afghanistan, the Middle East, and large parts of Africa as places where the Red Cross sees fragility - but \u00e2\u20ac\u0153we don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know which one will blow up in our face\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. So what can Davos do about it? Top business leaders have the skills and resources to help businesses in those fragile areas, and help them tipping into conflict. Maurer also warns that humanitarian organisations need more money: In 2018 we face a big gap between the needs of people and the capacity of the international system as a whole to respond. The gap can only be bridged by more and better finance. Ultimately, Blanchett says, we must remember we are all citizens, and stand up for what we believe in. Cate Blanchett is close to tears, as she talks about one refugee family she met in Jordan. They had fled conflict with five of their children, being shot at by all sides. Eventually, the father had to choose between carrying his suitcases and carrying his children (he chose the children). No-one should be put in that position, she says. Q: Aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t politicians taking a hard line on refugees because they are reacting to the concerns of their populations? Cate Blanchett argues that they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re actually reacting to populist media and the news cycle. We are at a fork in the road, she says. We try to teach our children to be compassionate, to be tolerant, to accept diversity, to share. But all the structures that are around them are not doing the same, so it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s quite a schizophrenic world they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re living in. And taking a swing at populist politicians, she says she don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t understand how turning people in a boat back became an election winner. Australian actor Cate Blanchett is talking about the refugee crisis now (yesterday she was handed a WEF award for her work on this issue). She explains how she went backpacking through Europe in her youth, which opened her eyes to economic inequality. I was staying in youth hostels that were more like Turkish prisons, She explains, seeing people who didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have anywhere else to go Q: There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been a lot of criticism of Australia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s policy to refugees.... Blanchett says she was \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcbewildered\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 to see the generous, openhearted, multi-cultural Australia she grew up in \u00e2\u20ac\u0153flouting the UN humans rights convention\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd I was very distressed that Australia was reverting back to practices that made us a fortress again. This drove Blanchett to become a goodwill ambassador to UNHCR I think it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shameful. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s so much misinformation about refugees. They are forced to flee, and then they are vilified in the media. Blanchett says the misinformation about refugees is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153very distressing\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, and doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t connect with the actual people she has met. There are 65 million displaced people in the world, 22 million are refugees, half are women and children. But just 1% have been resettled in advanced developed economies. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the developing world that is shouldering the deep burden of refugees. She cites the Lebanon, where a quarter of the population are now refugees. Blanchett also criticises the way refugees are reported in the media: People are told this narrative that these people, who have so much to offer, are going to be a burden on us or become a terrorist threat. Q: But have some people in developing economies been encouraged to travel to countries such as Germany, because they hoped to be given asylum? Should we not talk about it, Blanchett replies rhetorically. The problem is not going to go away. These are not terrorists. These are innocent people, who want to return home. She\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also calling for more burden-sharing between countries, to help address the refugee crisis. The problem with all this optimism at Davos is that business leaders, economists and politicians have a nasty habit of missing impending disaster. WEF veterans point out that the mood is often particularly upbeat shortly before a crisis. Barclays CEO Jes Staley summed it up this morning, on the financial crisis session when he said Davos feels \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a little bit like 2006 when we were all talking whether we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve solved the riddle of economic crises.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The Carlyle Group David Rubenstein agreed, saying: Generally, when people are happy and confident, something wrong happens. Back with the UK public finances, and a Treasury spokesperson said: We have made great progress in reducing the deficit by three quarters since 2010, but government debt is still far too high. Our balanced approach to government spending is getting debt falling, while investing in key public services and keeping taxes low. And the Office for Budget Responsibility said: It appears that the underlying improvement in borrowing so far this year is a little faster than would be consistent with our November forecast. NF Christoph Franz, the chairman of Roche, agrees that spirits are high at Davos this year - and with good reason. Speaking to CNBC, Frans argues that \u00e2\u20ac\u02dchealthy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 economic growth is boosting optimism among top execs. Basically, I have been here for more than ten years, I share your perspective, there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a very positive mood right now among business leaders here in Davos, and I think the reason is, we see a growth perspective in, not only some specific countries, but on a global scale, and the growth is achieving numbers which we have seen only before 2007. So, the economy is taking up, and for the time being, it is growth which has been created by a lot of investment. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s manufacturers continue to be optimistic about business prospects and exports, but are increasingly worried about skills shortages. The CBI\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s latest industrial trends survey for the three months to January showed 27% of firms were more optimistic about the general business situation that three months ago, while 14% were less optimistic. The balance of +13% is up from -11% in the previous quarter. Growth in manufacturing output and domestic and export orders all picked up, compared with the previous three-month period, although the monthly order book figure showed a fall from +17 in December to +14 in January. And the number of firms saying a lack of skilled labour was likely to limit output over the next three months was the highest for more than four decades. Rain Newton-Smith, CBI chief economist, said: It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s good to see manufacturing going from strength-to-strength with growth up and the buoyant global economy boosting export orders. But the past depreciation in Sterling continues to leave its mark on firms\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 costs and margins. With expectations for factory gate price inflation at their highest in 30 years, the pressure on consumer prices looks set to persist. Capacity pressures are ramping up and skill shortages are a big concern, underlining the importance of establishing a future immigration system that provides companies with access to talent and labour. The building blocks of a new system that meets economic needs and public concerns must start with scrapping the net migration target, which has never been fit-for-purpose. NF Yup. Modi wraps up his speech by identifying three priorities: The world economy must be more inclusive Policymakers must remain committed to a rules-based world order Reforming the major institutions of the world, connected to politics, the economy and securtry He talks about the Indian soldiers who died in world wars in the 20th century, to help create \u00e2\u20ac\u0153peace and humanity\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. India can be a humanising and harmonising force in an uncertain world, Modi promises, citing Indian prayers and poetry which advocates a free and peaceful world. Together we can create a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcheaven of future\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, he promises, in a somewhat gushing conclusion. Alas, he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not taking any questions. On climate change, Modi says India is making big progress towards hitting its goals for renewable energy. Modi says India will achieve strong growth over the next few years. Kenneth Roth of Human Rights Watch suggests Modi isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t living up to the glowing ideals he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s preaching today: (remember, Modi was once banned from visiting the US following claims he had supported Hindu extremists during Hindu-Muslim riots. He was later cleared by the Indian Supreme Court). Modi is now encouraging businesses to invest in India, citing the hundreds of laws and regulations which have been stripped out to make te economy more competitive. Instead of red tape, we offer you a red carpet, he jokes. Democracy isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t just a political system, says Modi - it is a life view and a lifestyle. He cites India\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s proud democracy and diversity, declaring: For a society with diverse religions, cultures, languages, attires and cuisines, democracy is not just a political system but a way of living: Thirdly, the world is threatened by the rising attacks on globalisation, says Modi. We must accept that globalisation is slowly losing its lustre, he says. And he pits some of the blame on the institutions created after world war 2, such as the United Nations. Do the structures and action plans of these organisations match the aspirations and dreams of mankind, Modi asks rhetorically. Then he takes aim at protectionism, saying: Forces of protectionism are raising their heads against globalisation. They want to reverse its flow. The world risks new tariff and non-tariff barriers, he continues, cautioning that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153bilateral and multilateral trade negotiations have come to a kind of standstill\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. The second major threat is terrorism, Modi continues. He says there is an artificial distinction between \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcgood and bad\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 terrorism, and a worrying radicalism of young people. The world has moved from needs-based to greed-based consumption, says Modi seriously. This does not live up to the ideals of Gandhi, or the teaching of Buddha. Modi cites climate change as a major threat. Glaciers are melting, islands are disappearing under the sea, and in Davos we have the worst snow in 20 years, he says. And he criticises the leaders of advanced economies for not showing more solidarity Everyone talks about reducing climate emissions, but there are very few countries who back their words with their resources to help developing countries to adopt appropriate technology. Very few of them come forward to help. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s some instant reaction to Modi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s call for co-operation to build a better future, rather than descending into isolationism. Narendra Modi now turns to the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153fractures\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in the global economy, citing unemployment, inequality, lack of opportunities. Some important questions come to mind, which require answers, he says. Is our global order widening these fault lines, increasing these differences, and giving preference to isolationism over harmony and conflict over co-operation, he asks, adding: What paths can we follow, to eliminate rifts and differences. How can we realise the dream of a beautiful shared future. Modi is speaking in Hindi, incidentally, so the audience are getting a realtime translation. Today, data is the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest asset, Modi declares. We are accumulating mountains and mountains of data, he continues. There is now a race to control data, because it is believes that whoever is able to control the data can dominate the world. Narendra Modi takes the stage, to another round of applause. He begins with a history lesson. The last time an Indian PM was at Davos was in 1997, when H. D. Deve Gowda visited. Back then, India\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s GDP was $400bn - it is now six times larger. WEF\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s theme in 1997 was \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcbuilding the networked society\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. Today, it is not just a networked society. We are living in the world of big data, artificial intelligence and robots. Back in 1997, Modi continues the eurozone didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t exist, the Asian financial crisis wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t expected, and there was no sign that Brexit might happen. Very few people had heard of Osama Bin Laden, and Harry Potter was also an unknown name. Back then, Google didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t exist, a web search for Amazon would bring up a river or jungle, and tweeting was done by birds, Modi declares. Davos\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s founder, Klaus Schwab, is introducing Narendra Modi now. Globally we are moving to a multipolar, and multi-conceptual world, says Schwab. In a seemingly fractured world, India presents a bright image of optimism, he adds. It also presents an investment opportunity (something that business leaders at Davos will be interested in) There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a buzz on the floor of the World Economic Forum as India\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s prime minister Narendra Modi prepares to give the opening speech. Modi is a big draw - the main hall is filling up fast with delegates keen to hear his words. The speech should be streamed live here: Nariman Behravesh, chief economist at IHS Markit says the mood at Davos is very different this year than in 2017. He tells us: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It is a lot more optimistic and the optimism is broad based. Last year the Americans were upbeat but the Europeans were gloomy. A year ago the feeling was that politics was going to overwhelm economics but the opposite has happened. An improving economy may make populism less compelling\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Behravesh says that Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s arrival in the White House a year ago led to an increase in business confidence. Corporate America was not keen on Barack Obama, he says. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Business finally got a president it thought was business friendly and the reduction in regulation has been received well.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Business also likes the package of tax cuts Trump finally pushed through Congress at the end of 2017 and which are weighted in favour of the well off and corporations. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Our estimate is that the tax cuts will add 0.3 percentage points to growth in 2018, 2019 and 2020\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Behravesh says. There are two risks, he adds. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The US and global economy may be running too hot. We think unemployment in the US will go as low as 3.5%, which is well below estimates of full employment. The question is how soon wage inflation and price inflation picks up. If inflation surprises on the upside we could see the Federal Reserve and other central banks step on the brakes a lot harder. The stock market could take a hit and that would be bad.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The other risk is that Trump starts making good on his protectionist threats. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153So far his bark has been worse then his bite, Behravesh says. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153But I think China is going to come under a lot of pressure from the US this year. The US is very unhappy about the China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s unwillingness to toe the line on intellectual property.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Over in Germany, consumer confidence remains strong. The ZEW institute economic sentiment index came in at 20.4 points in January, up from 17.4 the previous month and better than the forecasts of a reading of 17.8. And this came amid uncertainty over the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s political future and before the weekend\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s agreement to take another step towards a coalition government. The index remains slightly below the long-term average of 23.7 points, but it is still a positive outcome. Meanwhile the current conditions index rose from 89.3 points o 95.2. ZEW president professor Achim Wambach said: The latest survey results reveal an optimistic outlook for the German economy in the first six months of 2018. With 95.2 out of 100 points, this is the most positive assessment of the current economic situation since the introduction of the survey in December 1991. Private consumption, which was the most important driver of economic growth in 2017, is likely to continue to stimulate growth in the coming six months according to the survey participants. The assessment of the global economic environment in Europe and the USA is also much more favourable than it was at the end of 2017. NF Despite the warnings from Davos, investors are pushing markets higher again this morning. There is renewed confidence following the IMF raising its growth forecasts on Monday (albeit not for the UK), as well as relief that the US government shutdown has been resolved, at least for another couple of weeks. Meanwhile there were no surprises from the Bank of Japan, which recently unnerved markets by reducing its monthly bond buying programme by $10bn. This time it left monetary policy unchanged. So the FTSE 100 is up 0.31%, France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac has climbed 0.11% and Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax is 0.86% better and at new highs. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said: It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s taken a while for the DAX to join in with the all-time high hitting performances of the FTSE and the Dow Jones seen in 2018. However, with German coalition talks steadily moving along, a stop-gap deal to end the US government shutdown, and a subsequent pullback from the euro against the dollar, the bourse seems ready to bulge, shooting up by 130 points to tease a 13600 record peak. In the US the Dow Jones Industrial Average, which jumped 142 points or 0.55% after the news of the impasse over the government shutdown had been resolved, is expected to open 84 points higher. Fiona Cincotta at City Index said: The FTSE bounced on the open this morning, following a record session in the US overnight. The Dow surged over 140 points, whilst the S&amp;P and the Nasdaq tagged on 0.8% and 1% respectively, all hitting unchartered territory. The rally took place after the Democrats and the Republicans passed the funding bill to end the US government shut down, 72 hours after it started. NF Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s budget deficit came in much better than expected, giving a boost to chancellor Philip Hammond. Thanks to an unusually large credit from the European Union and the strongest VAT receipts on record, public sector net borrowing fell from \u00c2\u00a38.25bn in November to \u00c2\u00a32.6bn last month. This was well below analyst forecasts of a figure of around \u00c2\u00a35bn. There was a \u00c2\u00a31.2bn credit from the EU related to the region\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s smaller than expected overall budget and improved economic performance. With the UK economy holding up despite Brexit vote fears, VAT receipts rose by an annual 4.8% to a record \u00c2\u00a312.3bn. Total public borrowing since last April is now \u00c2\u00a350bn, 12% less than in the same period in 2016 and leaving Hammond on track to meet his full year target of \u00c2\u00a349.9bn by the end of March. NF More highlights from the Davos talk about financial risks: Anne Richards, chief executive of M&amp;G Investments, fears that a devastating IT crash could cause the next financial crisis. She tells an audience in Davos that policymakers risk ignoring the threat posed by investors\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 reliance on technology, and the damage that could be caused if key systems go down. Richards says she doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t buy the argument that a geopolitical crisis will bring the bull market crashing down. After all, markets handle geopolitical events all the time. Instead, she fears that the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153systemic risk\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd posed by new technology, and the cloud, could provoke an event that changes the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153animal spirits\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in the markets today. Richards warns: We all have businesses that are absolutely reliant on a very small number of people who provide the pipes that we put our business though. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a technology thing out there that we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re all somewhat blind to. It would be interesting to think how markets would react if none of us could trade for one, or two or three days\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd David Rubenstein, co-executive chairman of The Carlyle Group, is also on the panel. He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s more worried about political threats - predicting that if there is a geopolitical crisis, markets will be hurt and firms will pull back from capital investment. This year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s World Economic Forum is being led by an all-female group of co-chairs. They\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re giving a press conference now: Erna Solberg, prime minister of Norway, is speaking now - calling for a new crackdown on illegal finance and corruption. Solberg says this is fuelling terrorism and security threats, and making it harder for emerging economies to develop their economies. She suggests a MeToo campaign to fight corruption is needed: We need to see who is taking money, who is bribing others, and show that this is unacceptable in all our societies. Solberg\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s other priority is gender equality -- she warns that women are still treated unfairly in many economies. The barriers to women\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s participation [in the labour market] is still large in many societies - it doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t make sense economically or politically. Can Emmanuel Macron really succeed where his predecessors failed, and reform the French economy? Tidjane Thiam, the boss of Credit Suisse, says the answer is a resounding yes. Speaking on a panel about \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcglobal markets in a fractured world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, Thaim says Macron\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s programme of labour market reforms would have led to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153certain electoral defeat\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd 20 years ago - not last year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s triumph against Marine Le Pen. As Thiam puts it: Macron only got elected because the French public, the French nation, decided to change. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s how it works in a democracy. Political scientist Ian Bremmer agrees that market sentiment and political reality have got out of whack.... The usual high security measures are in place in Davos this morning. Armed guards prevent any non-delegates getting into WEF; even if you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re accredited, you have to negotiate airport-style security before you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re actually allowed in. The snowdrifts have also provided a new reason to ban protests in Davos this week. Davos officials say \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the extremely tight space situation due to the enormous amount of new snow\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t leave any space for a rally.... UBS\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chairman, Axel Weber, has warned that sentiment in the market is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153too buoyant\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Speaking on CNBC this morning, Weber said there was a worrying gap between investor optimism and the actual state of the economy. Investors are taking risks, but I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re getting adequate compensation for those risks. At some time, if it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s got to stop it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s got to stop. He added that the markets could be in a more difficult position by the time of Davos 2019.... Justin Trudeau says he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be batting for middle-class Canadians in Davos this week. His speech this afternoon is also expected to cover corporate responsibility and the role of women in a changing world. Davos regular Jamie Drummond says he may not come back, unless this year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meeting makes real progress towards tackling inequality. Drummond is the executive director of the development group One, which he co-founded with the rock star Bono. In a blog, Drummond said he had been stung by the accusation that he had spent so long hobnobbing with the 1% that he was becoming a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Davos man.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u0153A feminist activist, and someone I deeply respect, recently commented that I was at risk of becoming that awful thing: \u00e2\u20ac\u02dca Davos Man\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. Definitions vary but this phrase generally refers to a male who goes to places like Davos and inhabits an elite, unaccountable bubble while determining the fates of those without access to it. The comment cut deep. It forced me to question any complicity I might have in a system I have tried so hard to change. So I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m putting my inner Davos Man on notice, and making this commitment: this will be my last World Economic Forum unless this one helps deliver on three crucial areas in the fight against extreme poverty and gender inequality. Those areas are the global education emergency; women\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economic empowerment; and ambitious financing to back Africa\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s huge youth boom.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Philip Jennings, head of the global union UNI, has been one of the strongest voices for labour at Davos for many a year but 2018 will be his last meeting before retiring in the summer. Speaking to the Guardian, Jennings said the current business model built on the principle of shareholder value was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153not fit for purpose\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and that the opportunity provided by the financial crisis of a decade ago to build a more inclusive economy has been squandered. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Donald Trump is Mr Shareholder value\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, Jennings said, adding: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153He is exhibit A of the fractured world\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Jennings said a test for the business leaders in Davos talking about the problems of global inequality was whether they recognised trade unions and collective bargaining at their firms. And he predicted a backlash against three of the new titans of the global economy: Amazon, Facebook and Google. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153These companies were once seen as angelic, seen as our saviours\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, Jennings said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153But the big three has such market influence and power that the world has to wake up and start thinking about the need for anti-trust action. One of the fractures in the global economy is the power of the new monopolies and the danger it represents\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. The huge snowfalls in Davos recently mean the ski resort is now facing a Level 5 avalanche risk - the highest rating. Some homes have reportedly been evacuated, due to fears that the snow is too unstable. There has already been big delays getting up the mountain (someone I met last night spent six hours crawling here from Zurich), leading to plenty of chuntering among delegates. Davos has had an early wake-up call. PR chief Richard Edelman\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s annual trust index shows that Americans have become much less trusting of politicians, business chiefs and the media over the last year. He says: No country saw steeper declines than the United States, with a 37-point aggregate drop in trust across all institutions. At the opposite end of the spectrum, China experienced a 27-point gain, more than any other country. The survey shows that people are more worried about the rise of disinformation -- and finding it hard to separate truth from \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcfake news\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 So, genuine voices of expertise are now regaining credibility. Edelman explains: Journalists have risen 12 points, and CEOs recorded a seven-percentage point gain, since 2017. Good morning from Davos! World leaders, business chiefs, trade unions, the heads of charities and NGOs, celebrities and the media are gathering in this small ski resort to discuss the state of the world, and how to improve it. This year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s WEF is taking place amid the biggest snowfalls in many years. This is already leading to inequality on the streets of Davos: workers are furiously shovelling drifts aside and driving snowploughs as the global elite queue bumper-to-bumper to reach the WEF congress centre and the exclusive hotels and converted shops where events are taking place. Last night, Pope Francis set the mood by issuing a stern warning not to remain silent in the face of economic inequality and injustice. In a message read to the Davos attendees, the Pope warned not to allow people to be used as cogs in a machine and then chucked aside. He declared: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153New actors are emerging, as well as new economic competition and regional trade agreements. Even the most recent technologies are transforming economic models and the globalized world itself, which, conditioned by private interests and an ambition for profit at all costs, seem to favour further fragmentation and individualism, rather than to facilitate approaches that are more inclusive,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Even Sir Elton John weighed in, describing inequality in the world today as \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcdisgraceful\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 (as we covered in last night\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s blog). Two world leaders will address Davos today, with different priorities. Narendra Modi, who gives the opening speech, is the first Indian prime minister to visit WEF in 20 years. He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s on a big push to attract more business to his country, billing India as a key growth engine for the global economy. India have sent a large delegation to Davos this year - many of whom found themselves caught up in the transport chaos yesterday. Canada\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Justin Trudeau is expected to pitch at business leaders. But his speech, this afternoon, may also cover weightier issues such as women\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s empowerment. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s loads of other stuff coming up too, including debates on the financial markets, capitalism, and sexual harassment. The agenda: 9.30am Davos (8.30am GMT): Opening press conference by the Davos co-chairs 9.45am Davos (8.45am GMT): Debate: Are we heading for a new financial crisis? 11.15am Davos (10.15am GMT): Indian PM Narendra Modi gives the opening plenary speech 2pm Davos (1pm GMT): Actor Cate Blanchett speaks about the global refugee crisis 3pm Davos (2pm GMT): Bollywood actor Shah Rukh Khan talks about women\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s empowerment in India. 3.30pm Davos (2.30pm GMT): Debate on gender, power and sexual harassment 5pm Davos (4pm GMT): Debate on capitalism: 5.30pm Davos (4.30pm GMT): Canadian PM Justin Trudeau gives a special address",

When someone says a good exchange rate is good, that is targeting exchange rate. That goes back to years ago before the [recent] terms of agreement were agreed.</p> \n  <p><em>Q:Why did you chooses September to end QE?

What level of concern was there today about a possible change in US policy [after US dollar comments]</em></p> \n  <p>Yes there was concern. It was broader than simply the exchange rate, but about broader state of international relations right now. If this leads to an unwarranted tightening of monetary policy we would have to think about our monetary policy strategy.</p> \n  <p>On communications, you see same thing in other jurisdictions. All the communiations since Dec have in common three characteristics. All based on commitment to objective of inflation target. None questioned the sequence whereby interest rates will stay at current levels well past end of asset buying programme. Well past was emphasised.</p> \n  <p><em>Q: Some commentators factoring in an interest rate rise this year? At its current level does euro reflect fundamentals?</em></p> \n  <p>Based on today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s data I see very few chances at all that interest rates can be raised this year. On euro, we should ask is it produced by strength of economy, or by statements, or by monetary policy elsewhere. </p> \n  <p><em>Q: Another question on the G30 membership, could it compromise ECB?</em></p> \n  <p>Draghi repeats his previous answer, but adds ombudsman said there was no evidence the meeting influenced ECB, and ECB must have contacts with other financial participants.</p> \n  <p><em>Q: Will differences of views within ECB deepen on exit strategy? At March meeting, will you give restatement of forward guidance.</em></p> \n  <p>I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think the differences are as substantive as they were on other occasions. Some are a little more confident, if they live where inflation is rising. But there are not deep existential differences.</p> \n  <p>But there may be differences on when to say certain things, when to move forward. Markets have expectations on path, but also on dates, timelines. </p> \n  <p>In March we will assess how things stand at that point in time.</p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5a69d9b0e4b00f225a1c7a86\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-01-25T15:06:10.845Z\">3.06pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">ECB: Draghi press conference</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Away from Davis briefly and back with the ECB, and president Mario Draghi said at his press conference that domestic price pressures remained muted, inflation has yet to show a convincing upward trend.</p> \n  <p>He said the recent foreign exchange volatility is a source of uncertainty. An ample degree of monetary stimulus is necessary.</p> \n  <p>On the economy, he said there could be positive growth surprise in the near term. But there were downside risks remain relating to global factors, forex.</p> \n  <p>More on inflation: he said it was expected to rise gradually over the medium term, supported by our measures, rising wage growth etc</p> \n  <p>He then repeats his usual call to governments to do more: To reap the ull benefits from monetary policy measures, other policy areas must contribute. Structural reform in euro area countries needs to be stepped up . On fiscal policies, the case is strengthened for rebuilding fiscal buffers, especially in in countries where debt remains high. Strengthening EMU remains a priority.</p> \n  <p>Now for questions:</p> \n  <p><em>Q: What will have to happen for the exchange rate to be a problem for the inflation target? And you said in December you would revisit guidance [on the bond buying programme] early this year?</em></p> \n  <p>Draghi says there is confusion about the guidance comment, there was no difference between what was said at the December meeting and what Draghi said at the press conference. All that was said was there would have to be discussions about the need to have a discussion in the early part of the year. That discussion hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t really started. We went through the events since October to now, trying to assess whether something has changed. There was not much of a change except the strengthening of the economy a little more than expected. By and large the risk to growth is balanced.</p> \n  <p>We can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t declare victory. Price pressures are muted. Underlying inflation is showing little signs of upward movement. So we simply restated policy.</p> \n  <p>He said the commitment to the inflation target remained firmer than ever. Monetary policy will remain accommodative.</p> \n  <p>On exchange rates he said there were three reasons for volatility. The improvement in the economy, the heightened market sensitivity to perceived changes in our communication. Finally the use of language in discussion exchange rate developments that doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t reflect the terms of reference that have been agreed in October in Washington [an agreement between governments on exchange rate policy]</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a263a300171d6e4db1e16a9fb5d2f56b0fed19e9\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a263a300171d6e4db1e16a9fb5d2f56b0fed19e9/27_0_750_450/500.jpg\" alt=\"newdraghi25\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Draghi at the press conference</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: ECB</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n  <p><em>Q:Dollar weakness is what you were probably referring to. It must not be helpful to hear a lower dollar is something [US officials] like. Are we heading to currency war scenario. Also, could you envisage ending QE programme in September.</em></p> \n  <p>We don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t target exchange rates, they are important for growth and price stability. </p> \n  <p>Movements justified by strength of economy are a fact of natiure. Are there other movements caused by use of language, not parts of terms agreed. Whether that has an effect on our inflation path...inflation is our main concern. Too early to assess whether pass through has already taken place, and what will be extent.</p> \n  <p>Some are questioning the extent of pass through, but large exchange rate movements are bound to have an effect. In Washington - ministers and governments recognised excessive volatily or disorderly movements in exchange rates could have adverse effects. [They agreed] we will refrain from competitive devaluations and will not target exchange rates for competitive purposes.</p> \n  <p>On second question, we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have any discussion today, but we never stop the programme abruptly.</p> \n  <p><em>Q: Will you give up you membership of the G30, after ombudsman letter?</em></p> \n  <p>We received the letter from the ombudsman, we will respond in time. There is a procedure. We will assess the letter and the comments and respond.</p> \n  <p><em>Q: German pay negotiations. Could there be broad pay increases across eurozone economy following Germany?</em></p> \n  <p>We observe from a monetary policy angle, where we consider wage growth as a convincing sign of future inflation convergence to our objective. Whether it spreads, depends on conditions of labour market. Tight conditions in Germany, not so in other countries.</p> \n  <p><em>Q: Are there financial stability risks from long term accommodative policy? </em></p> \n  <p>Vice president Vitor Constancio answers. No one can talk about asset price bubbles in euro area. We have overstretched valuations in some places for commercial real estate, high yield corporate bonds but nothing else.... We see prices in market are close to fair value. Same is true of housing prices. Fundamental values are in line with fundamental. Prices of houses increasing by 4%, between 2000 and 2006 they were up 7%. So no general situation of overvaluation in residential properties.</p> \n  <p>Some countries have also taken macroprudential policies to combat excesses.</p> \n  <p>The effect on banks of negative rates, taking into account all our policies, they have been favourable to their profitability which is still low but increasing.

In Asia overnight it hit $1.4328, and although it has eased back from that, it is still up 0.11% so far today at $1.4255.</p> \n  <p>It is partly the expectation of an earlier than expected UK rate rise, given the recent strong data including Wednesday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s employment and wages figures. But of course there is also the weak dollar, hit recently by the expectation that Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tax cuts would raise the already hefty US deficit. More immediately Treasury secretary Steven Mnuchin told Davos the US wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t worried about a flagging greenback. Kit Juckes at Societe Generale said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Steven Mnuchin (US Treasury Secretary) went to Davos and said that a weaker dollar \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcis good for us as it relates to trade and opportunities\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. He also pointed out that that he isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t concerned by where it is in the short term and that in the longer term, its strength is a reflection of the strength of the US economy. In other words, he said very little really, but he said it under snow-plastered slopes and he was speaking to a market where dollar bulls have been under the cosh. A few more capitulated.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Against the euro the pound is pretty flat, down just 0.01% at \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.1473 ahead of the latest European Central Bank meeting. But the euro is up against the dollar, 0.11% better at $1.2421.</p> \n  <p>The strength of the euro presents a problem for ECB president Mario Draghi. If he appears too bulllish at hinting at an end to the bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s QE programme, the euro will appreciate even further. And that would keep a lid on inflation which is already below the bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s target. Equally, he cannot ignore the improving European economy. Michael Hewson at CMC Markets explains:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>With headline inflation remaining well below its 2% target rate at 1.4% and an economy that continues to show decent levels of economic activity the ECB is faced with having to navigate the minefield of guiding markets over the tightrope of communicating a credible timeline for stimulus reduction and interest rate policy, while trying to move CPI back to target against the difficulty of a rising currency. </p> \n   <p>Since the beginning of 2017 the euro has risen 18% against the US dollar and could well rise even further given yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s remarks by US Treasury Secretary Mnuchin.<strong> </strong></p> \n   <p>Last week ECB vice president Vitor Constancio along with Austria\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ewald Nowotny expressed concern about recent exchange rate movements. These concerns are likely to have increased in recent days which will make today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s press conference by ECB President Mario Draghi much more interesting. He can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t very well ignore the improving outlook but if he comes across as too bullish the euro could well be well on the way to the 1.3000 level by the end of this quarter.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Naeem Aslam, chief market analyst at Think Markets, said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Draghi would have to adopt a delicate approach and seek a strategy which stops the euro from firming further. The only way out of this situation for him would be to emphasize that the process of the rate hikes is not within sight yet. The market is expecting a rate hike in 2019 from the ECB, Draghi would have to pull a rabbit out of hat in order to convince the market that rate hike isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t on the agenda and market participants are getting ahead of themselves.</p> \n   <p>We do think that overly dovish statement by the European central bank is priced in the euro to some extent. If Draghi fails to convince the market or if he doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t sound as dovish as the market is expecting, we think that the euro can take off from here. I think the risk to the downside for the euro are limited, it is the upside move which would be more exciting. </p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p><strong>NF</strong></p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2018-01-25T09:35:55.305Z\">at 9.35am GMT</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5a699fbae4b0473d0bc1006d\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-01-25T09:14:06.963Z\">9.14am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6b01f8328d4d3d09f9d57f014effee666cffec85\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6b01f8328d4d3d09f9d57f014effee666cffec85/0_0_3500_2518/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Swiss police officers on the roof of the Davos Congress Hotel this morning.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"719\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Swiss police officers on the roof of the Davos Congress Hotel this morning.</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Denis Balibouse/Reuters</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5a699c38e4b00f225a1c77eb\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-01-25T08:59:11.454Z\">8.59am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Theresa May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Conservative Party has confirmed she will hold social media giants to account in Davos:</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/CCHQPress/status/956450450433339392\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Today, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/theresa_may?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@theresa_may</a> will put pressure on social media companies to stop providing a platform for terror, extremism and child abuse.

                "bodyText":"A late PS, from the Associated Press\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Pan Pylas on the moment Trump arrived at the World Economic Forum. One way to get President Donald Trump to stop and talk at the World Economic Forum: wield a book about him. On his way into the World Economic Forum, Trump stopped and talked for about ten seconds to one delegate who was brandishing a copy of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153God and Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd by Stephen E. Strang. He then proceeded to hold the book aloft in his left hand. Trump is the first U.S. president to attend the World Economic Forum since Bill Clinton back in 2000. Trump is holding a series of meetings and is due to deliver a speech on Friday in which he will argue that what is good for the U.S. economy is beneficial for the global economy. And finally, readers will be keen to know that Donald Trump is probably tucked up in bed. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the final dispatch: Motorcade arrived at the Intercontinental at 9:23. Pool did not see POTUS get out. He will sleep here tonight. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s all from us until tomorrow! Thanks for reading and commenting. GW Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s some colour from Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s dinner with business leaders, from the White House press pack: President Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s eyes narrowed, as he looked a bit tired by the jetlag and long trip. But he seemed to enjoy the camaraderie with businessmen, joking with them about their success and lofty responsibilities, and nodding in agreement as they spoke about their large manufacturing capacity and thousands of US-based employees. Among the topics discussed: Kanye West\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s role in designing Adidas shoes, Mack Trucks made by Volvo, Nestl\u00c3\u00a9\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s non-chocolate business portfolio. Among Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s asides: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153When he says he works for Siemens, he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the president of Siemens!...Wow, that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s big!....Good luck with the G.E. purchase.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Trump spoke about the thriving American economy \u00e2\u20ac\u201c crediting his tax policies, deregulation and his role as a cheerleader for American business. Soros then claims the bitcoin price will be propped by up by dictators, who use it to \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcbuild their nest eggs abroad\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Q: As a former currency trader (who beat the Bank of England on Black Wednesday) what do you think of cryptocurrencies? Bitcoin is not a currency, Soros replies. A currency is supposed to be a stable store of value, and a currency that can fluctuate 25% in a day can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be used to pay wages It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a speculation, based on a misunderstanding. Soros suggest the EU should help Africa\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy develop, if it wants to address the migration crisis. Onto questions. Q: What should be done to tackle the technology giants? It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a very complicated issue, Soros replies. It requires the full-time attention of those who formulate and enforce new laws. I put my faith in them, especially commissioner Vestigar who has done so much to enforce the laws - and made an award against Google. Q: If you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t like social media companies, why do you buy shares in them? calls out a diner from the back of the room. Soros doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t reply (I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m not sure he heard). Instead he takes a question about migration, saying he cares about refugees because he was one himself; he came to Britain and was better treated than refugees arriving in Europe today. Another punchy quote from Soros: On Europe, Soros suggests that a multi-speed, multi-track approach would be more successful. This would allow Britain to rejoin the EU in the future without having to commit to joining the euro, explained Soros (who hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t given up hope that Brexit won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t happen). George Soros then turns his guns at the technology sector. In a blistering attack, he accuses social media companies of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153deliberately engineering addiction\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, which is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153particularly harmful\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd for adolescents. He accuses them of inducing customers to give up their autonomy too. Soros says there are similarities between internet platforms and gambling platforms - pointing out that casinos have developed techniques to hook customers so they keep gambling even when they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve run out of money. But... while tech giants may think they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re masters of the universe, they are actually just slaves to preserving their dominant position Soros continues. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s only a matter of time before the monopoly of the US IT giants is broken, he declares: Davos is a good place to announce that their days are numbered. Regulation and taxation will be their undoing. I see Trump as a purely temporary phenomenon which will disappear in 2020, or earlier, Soros says - winning a laugh from his audience as they tuck into their chicken, potatoes and spinach. Soros adds that he expects a Democratic landslide in 2018. America must recognise the reality that North Korea has become a nuclear power, Soros continues. There is no military action that can prevent what has already happened. The only sensible strategy is to accept reality\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6.and come to terms with North Koreas as a nuclear power. That means working with China to find a solution. Soros says that the survival of our whole civilisation is at stake, due to the rise of Kim Jong Un in North Korea and Donald Trump in the United States. They both seem to be willing to risk a nuclear war to keep themselves in power. At another dinner in Davos, billionaire businessman-turned-philanthopist George Soros is giving his views on the state of the world. He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s warning that open societies are in crisis, with various forms of dictatorship on the rise - such as Vladimir Putin\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Russia. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153In the United States, President Trump would like to establish a mafia state, but can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, Soros continues, because America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s institutions, constitution and its \u00e2\u20ac\u0153vibrant civil society\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t allow it. If you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re just tuning in, here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our news story about the prospect of Donald Trump visiting the UK later this year: UK government officials have been updating the British press about Theresa May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meeting with Donald Trump this afternoon, shortly after he arrived at WEF (and brought it to a standstill). Mark Knoller, CBS News White House Correspondent, has details of Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s dinner with European business chiefs: Donald Trump is now sitting down for diner with the bosses of some of Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest companies. Mark Tucker, the chairman of HSBC, and Punit Renjen, the chief executive of Deloitte, are flying the flag for Britain - according to this guest list from the White House press pack: President Donald J. Trump Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, Department of State Secretary Kirstjen Nielson, Department of Homeland Security General H.R. McMaster, National Security Advisor Gary Cohn, Director of the National Economic Council Kasper Rorsted, Adidas (Apparel)\u00e2\u20ac\u201dGermany Joe Kaeser, Siemens AG (Tech)\u00e2\u20ac\u201dGermany Heinrich Hiesinger, Thyssenkrupp AG (Industrials)\u00e2\u20ac\u201dGermany Eldar Saetre, Statoil ASA (Energy)\u00e2\u20ac\u201dNorway Mark Schneider, Nestle SA (Food and Beverage)\u00e2\u20ac\u201dSwitzerland Vas Narasimhan, Novartis AG (Pharmaceutical)\u00e2\u20ac\u201dSwitzerland Mark Tucker, HSBC (Financial Services)\u00e2\u20ac\u201dUK Patrick Pouyanne, Total SA (Energy)\u00e2\u20ac\u201dFrance Carlos Brito, Anheuser-Busch InBev NV (Food and Beverage)\u00e2\u20ac\u201dBelgium Rajeev Suri, Nokia Corporation (Technology)\u00e2\u20ac\u201dFinland Punit Renjen, Deloitte (Consulting)\u00e2\u20ac\u201dUK Martian Lundstedt, AB Volvo (Auto)\u00e2\u20ac\u201dSweden Werner Baumann, Bayer AG (Pharmaceutical)\u00e2\u20ac\u201dGermany Bill McDermott, SAP SE (Technology)\u00e2\u20ac\u201dGermany Ulrich Spiesshofer, ABB Ltd (Manufacturing)\u00e2\u20ac\u201dSwitzerland \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 This list was amended on 26 January 2018 to correct inaccurate details provided by the White House press office. The spelling of Carlos Brito\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s first name was corrected from Carols, and the location of Anheuser-Busch InBev NV\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s headquarters has been corrected from the Netherlands to Belgium. President Trump is likely to face protests if and when his visit to the UK takes place, even if it is just a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153working visit\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. For a start, Liberal Democrat deputy leader Jo Swinson pulled no punches, saying: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Trump is a dangerous, misogynistic racist and is deserving of the protests he will undoubtedly face. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153If and when he comes to the UK the Liberal Democrats will be at front and centre of the protests.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The White House says Theresa May and Donald Trump discussed plans for a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153working visit\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to London. That may mean that it won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be a full-blown state visit. A working visit would mean less pomp and ceremony (and probably not a visit to see the Queen). Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the official statement (which includes that all-important nod to the Special Relationship). President Donald J. Trump met today with Prime Minister Theresa May of the United Kingdom. The President and Prime Minister discussed joint efforts to ensure the enduring defeat of ISIS and other jihadist terrorist organizations in Syria and Iraq. They discussed the importance of confronting Iran\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s destructive behavior across the Middle East and fundamental flaws in the Iran nuclear deal. The leaders committed to expanded trade between the United States and the United Kingdom, as well as how the two countries can work together to ensure all nations engage in fair and reciprocal trade practices. The two leaders also discussed plans for a working visit to London in the coming months and affirmed the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153special relationship\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd between the two countries is stronger than ever. Donald Trump emerged from his meetings a little while ago, and briefly chatted with delegates who hadn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t been driven away by security. He said his first day at Davos had been \u00e2\u20ac\u0153really good\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and \u00e2\u20ac\u0153very successful\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, before calling it a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153very great day\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the key quote (with thanks to the White House press corp) \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I think the real message is we want great prosperity and we want great peace and I think that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the message. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been going really well. A lot of people are coming back to the United States. We are seeing tremendous investment and today has been a very exciting day. Very great day and great for our country. Thank you very much.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s more details: Q: Is America great? Trump: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s great\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Q: Is everybody else great? \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Everyone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s great,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Trump said, turning his head toward the questioner as he walked through the convention hallway. Donald Trump may be in the spotlight in Davos today, but it was Wednesday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s comments by US Treasury secretary Steven Mnuchin about the dollar which caused ructions at the European Central Bank. Mnuchin said that a weaker dollar was good for American trade, and ECB president Mario Draghi suggested this was not in the spirit of an agreement between governments made in October in Washington. Draghi said: Ministers and governments recognised excessive volatily or disorderly movements in exchange rates could have adverse effects. [They agreed to] refrain from competitive devaluations and not target exchange rates for competitive purposes. He said the current exchange rate volatility was partly due to\u00e2\u20ac\ufffdthe use of language in discussing exchange rate developments that doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t reflect the terms of reference that have been agreed.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Mnuchin\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s comments yesterday sent an already weak dollar still lower. Marco Valli, chief European economist at UniCredit Bank, said: [The ECB] remains fairly relaxed about the effects of a stronger euro, but bluntly criticised the recent foreign exchange messages from the US administration, seen as violating the long-standing international commitment to avoid competitive devaluation. And of course Donald Trump has tweeted about his meeting with Theresa May: Theresa May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meeting with Donald Trump at Davos took place shortly after she gave a special address to the World Economic Forum (highlights start here) May focused on the opportunities and threats of new technology, and Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s efforts to equip its economy for the challenges ahead. Paul Sheard, chief global economist at S&amp;P Global Ratings, tells us that she missed a trick by not also talking about Brexit, and UK-US relations. Prime Minister May made a strong pitch for the UK to be seen as a global leader in AI and regulation-friendly innovation, but \u00e2\u20ac\ufffdI thought her not spending some time laying out the UK government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s latest thinking on Brexit - particularly what it aspires for the all-important future relationship - was a bit of a missed opportunity. We don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know what details still need to be finalised, so it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s possible that officials can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t actually get Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s visit nailed down. One possible hitch might be the certainty of large protests against the US president from British citizens appalled by his view on climate change, accusations of sexual harassment, the Muslim ban, his America First policies - to name just four. Trump is reportedly rather worried about facing major protests - something he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been spared in Davos, due to its ultra-tight security net. Bloomberg reported this week that the US president had asked May to make sure he got a good reception. In one phone conversation during 2017, Trump complained to May over the criticism he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d been getting in British newspapers. Amid warnings that Trump would face protests in the streets when he arrived, he told the prime minister he would not be coming to the U.K. until she could promise him a warm welcome. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s official. Barring a few details, US president Donald Trump will visit the United Kingdom later this year. May and Trump asked their respective officials to work on \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcfinalising the details\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 of a trip, at the end of their bilateral meeting here in the World Economic Forum. A Downing Street spokesman says that: The PM and President concluded by asking officials to work together on finalising the details of a visit by the President to the UK later this year.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no word on when it might happen, though. Downing Street also say that the two leaders discussed Brexit, Iran, terrorism, and worries that jobs could lost at Bombardier\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s factory in Northern Ireland due to the trade dispute with Boeing. The spokesman says: The two leaders began by discussing Bombardier, with the PM reiterating the importance of the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s jobs in Northern Ireland. The PM and the President discussed Iran, and the need to work together to combat the destabilising activity which it is conducting in the region, including ballistic missile development, and continuing efforts to ensure Iran does not develop nuclear weapons. They also agreed on the importance of continuing to stand side-by-side in the fight against Daesh in Syria and elsewhere. The Prime Minister updated the President on the good progress which had been made in the Brexit negotiations so far. The two leaders reiterated their desire for a strong trading relationship post-Brexit, which would be in the interests of both countries. NEWSFLASH: Theresa May and Donald Trump have asked officials to work on \u00e2\u20ac\u0153finalising the details of a visit by the President to the UK later this year\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, Downing Street said. More to follow. Swiss campaign group CAMPAX have hung a Trump protest banner on a mountain at Sargans - about 50 kilometres from Davos. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a photo of the Davos meeting room which Donald Trump and his delegation swept into, a couple of hours ago: There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s still a huge crowd at the bottom of the stairs; I think there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s only one way out.... During his meeting with Benjamin Netanyahu, president Trump suggested that aid would be withheld from the Palestinians if they didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t show respect. He said \u00e2\u20ac\u0153they disrespected our great Vice President\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd (Last November, Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t meet Mike Pence during his visit to the Middle East). Trump said (via the White House pool report): \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The money is on the table. And the money was never off the table. [Yesterday, it was reported that former US secretary of state John Kerry had advised Abbas not to give in to Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s demands] Israeli president Benjamin Netanyahu has returned from his meeting with Trump. He says it was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153excellent\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the White House pool report on the Trump-May meeting: President Trump and PM May sat beside one another in a WEF conference room with aides on each side. Among them on US side: Gary Cohn, HR McMaster, Tillerson, Sarah Sanders. Highlights: Trump \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Its a false rumor\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd that there is tension in the US-UK relationship. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re on the same wavelength in I think every respect\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The two are \u00e2\u20ac\u0153liking each other a lot\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and \u00e2\u20ac\u0153joined at the hip\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd when it comes to the military. He looked at her and said there was nothing that would happen where the US would not be there for Britain. May also reaffirmed the special relationship. When asked about a state visit, May said it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s being discussed now. Trump seconded that. No answers to shouted questions about the far right video retweet [back in November, Trump retweeted several anti-Muslim videos] Donald Trump has also talked about the prospect of a trade deal with the UK, but only in very general terms. Trade between the US and the UK is going to increase \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcmany times\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, Trump said during his meeting with May, adding: The discussions...that will be taking place are going to lead to tremendous increase in trade between our countries, which is great for both in terms of jobs. Q: But what about a state visit to Britain? May and Trump say they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll talk about that during their meeting at Davos. Several people have come down the stairs where Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meetings are taking place. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve spied IMF chief Christine Lagarde, Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier, and Labour\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shadow chancellor John McDonnell. That doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t mean they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve all been meeting the US president - there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s more than one room up there. Q: How large an effect does your communication have on exchange rate? When I said communication I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t mean ECB communication but other people\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s communication. We don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t target exchange rate. When someone says a good exchange rate is good, that is targeting exchange rate. That goes back to years ago before the [recent] terms of agreement were agreed. Q:Why did you chooses September to end QE? Commodities are priced in dollars and could effect inflation data. When we recalibrated programme last October we had a discussion whether it should be six or nine months, and how much. So after that we came out with this educated outcome. In defining our objective we have different definitions, including underlying inflation which excludes energy etc. We target headline inflation, but we look at evidence from other definitions. Q: Oil price has risen significantly since December, could that cancel out strong euro. Yes, although it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not easy to understand exactly the timing of these compensations. That doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t imply we accept a certain level of exchange rate as a good or bad thing. And with that it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s over. Q: how do you feel about ECB communications this year including from individual members, could it be improved. What level of concern was there today about a possible change in US policy [after US dollar comments] Yes there was concern. It was broader than simply the exchange rate, but about broader state of international relations right now. If this leads to an unwarranted tightening of monetary policy we would have to think about our monetary policy strategy. On communications, you see same thing in other jurisdictions. All the communiations since Dec have in common three characteristics. All based on commitment to objective of inflation target. None questioned the sequence whereby interest rates will stay at current levels well past end of asset buying programme. Well past was emphasised. Q: Some commentators factoring in an interest rate rise this year? At its current level does euro reflect fundamentals? Based on today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s data I see very few chances at all that interest rates can be raised this year. On euro, we should ask is it produced by strength of economy, or by statements, or by monetary policy elsewhere. Q: Another question on the G30 membership, could it compromise ECB? Draghi repeats his previous answer, but adds ombudsman said there was no evidence the meeting influenced ECB, and ECB must have contacts with other financial participants. Q: Will differences of views within ECB deepen on exit strategy? At March meeting, will you give restatement of forward guidance. I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think the differences are as substantive as they were on other occasions. Some are a little more confident, if they live where inflation is rising. But there are not deep existential differences. But there may be differences on when to say certain things, when to move forward. Markets have expectations on path, but also on dates, timelines. In March we will assess how things stand at that point in time. Away from Davis briefly and back with the ECB, and president Mario Draghi said at his press conference that domestic price pressures remained muted, inflation has yet to show a convincing upward trend. He said the recent foreign exchange volatility is a source of uncertainty. An ample degree of monetary stimulus is necessary. On the economy, he said there could be positive growth surprise in the near term. But there were downside risks remain relating to global factors, forex. More on inflation: he said it was expected to rise gradually over the medium term, supported by our measures, rising wage growth etc He then repeats his usual call to governments to do more: To reap the ull benefits from monetary policy measures, other policy areas must contribute. Structural reform in euro area countries needs to be stepped up . On fiscal policies, the case is strengthened for rebuilding fiscal buffers, especially in in countries where debt remains high. Strengthening EMU remains a priority. Now for questions: Q: What will have to happen for the exchange rate to be a problem for the inflation target? And you said in December you would revisit guidance [on the bond buying programme] early this year? Draghi says there is confusion about the guidance comment, there was no difference between what was said at the December meeting and what Draghi said at the press conference. All that was said was there would have to be discussions about the need to have a discussion in the early part of the year. That discussion hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t really started. We went through the events since October to now, trying to assess whether something has changed. There was not much of a change except the strengthening of the economy a little more than expected. By and large the risk to growth is balanced. We can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t declare victory. Price pressures are muted. Underlying inflation is showing little signs of upward movement. So we simply restated policy. He said the commitment to the inflation target remained firmer than ever. Monetary policy will remain accommodative. On exchange rates he said there were three reasons for volatility. The improvement in the economy, the heightened market sensitivity to perceived changes in our communication. Finally the use of language in discussion exchange rate developments that doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t reflect the terms of reference that have been agreed in October in Washington [an agreement between governments on exchange rate policy] Q:Dollar weakness is what you were probably referring to. It must not be helpful to hear a lower dollar is something [US officials] like. Are we heading to currency war scenario. Also, could you envisage ending QE programme in September. We don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t target exchange rates, they are important for growth and price stability. Movements justified by strength of economy are a fact of natiure. Are there other movements caused by use of language, not parts of terms agreed. Whether that has an effect on our inflation path...inflation is our main concern. Too early to assess whether pass through has already taken place, and what will be extent. Some are questioning the extent of pass through, but large exchange rate movements are bound to have an effect. In Washington - ministers and governments recognised excessive volatily or disorderly movements in exchange rates could have adverse effects. [They agreed] we will refrain from competitive devaluations and will not target exchange rates for competitive purposes. On second question, we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have any discussion today, but we never stop the programme abruptly. Q: Will you give up you membership of the G30, after ombudsman letter? We received the letter from the ombudsman, we will respond in time. There is a procedure. We will assess the letter and the comments and respond. Q: German pay negotiations. Could there be broad pay increases across eurozone economy following Germany? We observe from a monetary policy angle, where we consider wage growth as a convincing sign of future inflation convergence to our objective. Whether it spreads, depends on conditions of labour market. Tight conditions in Germany, not so in other countries. Q: Are there financial stability risks from long term accommodative policy? Vice president Vitor Constancio answers. No one can talk about asset price bubbles in euro area. We have overstretched valuations in some places for commercial real estate, high yield corporate bonds but nothing else.... We see prices in market are close to fair value. Same is true of housing prices. Fundamental values are in line with fundamental. Prices of houses increasing by 4%, between 2000 and 2006 they were up 7%. So no general situation of overvaluation in residential properties. Some countries have also taken macroprudential policies to combat excesses. The effect on banks of negative rates, taking into account all our policies, they have been favourable to their profitability which is still low but increasing. So negative rates have been absorbed by banking sector. Draghi talks about fiscal buffers. Interest rates will at some point stop being so low. At that point all governments will want to have policy space, so budget consideration now when the time is good is favourable. NF We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve now got video footage of Theresa May and Donald Trump meeting. Trump says he and May have a mutual feeling of \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcliking each other a lot\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. He says there have been a false rumour out there, which he wants to rebut. He tells May: We have great respect for everything you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re doing, and we love your country. We think it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s truly good. Trump says that the US and the UK are working on economic development, trade and military issues. We are very much joined at the hip when it comes to the military Theresa May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meeting with Trump is over - she\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s departed the scene without speaking to the press. Next up.... Israel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s president Benjamin Netanyahu. He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s gone up the stairs with a small group, presumably to meet Trump. Curiously, Theresa May and a few advisors came down from the Trump meeting.....vanished into another room...reappeared and then went back up again. OK, it looks like Trump and May have been holding their meeting - and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s nearly over.... White House reporters are travelling with Trump - here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s one of the latest pooled reports: Pool arrived at 2:40 at the conference center after brief motorcade through town that includes some small souvenir shops, ski shops, restaurants. There were some JP Morgan flags posted on the route as well. The smattering of onlookers included a few waving American flags and some young kids in ski helmets. A few more photos of Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s arrival: I managed a short video clip of Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s arrival: President Trump and his entourage then move up the stairs, to a constant clicking of cameras. One delegate welcomes him to Switzerland. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Thank you very much. Great country.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Trump replies. He then continues up another flight of stairs, to an area where most delegates (and journalists) aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t allowed. A security guard is now posted there to prevent any intruders. Trump arrives to his audience; reporters shout out a few questions. Asked what his message is to Davos, he replies \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Peace and prosperity\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. There are a few laughs. Here he comes...... The entire World Economic Forum has gone into a weird semi-lockdown. Half the delegates are crowding around, in a hush, waiting for Trump. The rest are milling around in the corridors and lounges, or getting on with business. Curiously, most delegates are waiting in silence..... President Trump is about to arrive at the World Economic Forum. People are crowding around the security cordon and flocking on the balcony , desperate for a glimpse. Theresa May ends her speech by calling on the World Economic Forum to work together to solve the problems she identified. The UK has a proud history of stepping up and delivering progress that can deliver for all, she says: Let\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s renew our commitment to collaboration - and set ourselves on a path to benefit all our people. Now, and for generations to come. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s it. No questions. Theresa May says technology companies employ some of the brightest minds in the world - they should be able to design a system where unacceptable content is deleted automatically. No-one wants to be known as a a platform for terrorism, or the best place for child pornography, she points out. She says there are three key priorities: Considering whether new regulations are needed for these tech platforms Investors must think about the social impact of the firms they invest in. Working on the ethical implications of Artificial Intelligence Theresa May is now challenging social media companies to do more to protect users - especially children. We want Britain to be a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153World leader in innovation-friendly regulation\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd she says (not the catchiest slogan). That means being the safest place in the world to be online, while also being a great place to run a digital business. Technology companies must \u00e2\u20ac\u0153step up to their responsibilities\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, the PM says sternly. Companies simply cannot stand by while their platforms are used to facilitate child abuse, modern slavery, or the spreading of terrorist and extremist content. Theresa May singles out Uber as an example of the potential,and problems, created by technology. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s an innovative company, but it has also got things wrong - with safety issues and concerns about its treatment of workers The solution isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t to shut them down, but to improve the system so companies work better. Employment law must protect workers and give businesses the flexibility it needs, says the PM - it can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t just be a one-way street. Maybe 2/3 full was an overstatement.... May is pitching to businesses here, saying the government is raising Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s digital skills for the 21st century. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re also at the forefront of low-carbon technologies, she declares. And on artificial intelligence, we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re only at the beginning of what AI can achieve, says May. Those of you up here in Davos mustn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t forget the plight of those who face losing their job after 20 years, says May. We must channel the power of business and government together to harness technology, and make it a force for good, May continues - to address people\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s concerns. I understand the power of business as a force for good. Free markets drive risk-taking that have delivered the great advances of our time. But I also believe in the power of government, she adds. Our new business strategy will make Britain one of the best place in the world to start and run a business, she pledges. Turning to technology, Theresa May says the internet can deliver $2.2 trillion worth of GDP to developing countries. And just last week, a drone saved two boys from drowning off Australia by carrying a float to them. Medical tests show that technology can reduce breast cancer cases by a third. But people are worried about the malevolent impact of technology, she says. Britain will continue to be an advocate of free trade after Brexit, May insists. And she challenges Davos delegates to live up to their commitments, in three ways: The commitments on steel must be implemented. Aid donors must match the UK and help developing countries The World Trade Organisation must do more to keep pace with the global economy - she singles out the service sector, and e-commerce Theresa May begins by saying that last year, she warned that the benefits of free trade weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t being shared fairly, and this risked undermining the global world order. One year on, there are grounds for optimism. Global growth is strengthening. The populism of the far left and far right has not made the progress some predicted, and in the UK, unemployment is at a 40-year low and government and business are working together well. Klaus Schwab, the founder of the World Economic Forum, is introducing Theresa May now. The room is roughly two-thirds full - respectable, not as much as for president Macron last night. Schwab says many Davos attendees were impressed last year, by May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s passionate plea to address global slavery. That work continues this year, he says. Cowbells are ringing across the Davos congress centre (yes, really), to tell delegates that Theresa May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s speech starts soon. The hall is filling up well, but it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not packed out yet. One delegate tells me she\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hoping to hear some clarity on Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s future after Brexit. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a lot of uncertainty right now\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. At the CBI\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s lunch in Davos, Philip Hammond insisted that Britain would leave the EU on 31st March 2019. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a statement of political reality, the chancellor insists. Hammond said Britain should go for something more ambitious than previous deals with the EU. An off-the-shelf Norway or Canada agreement won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t work. Unusually for trade talks, we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re starting from a point where we are already deeply interconnected with highly aligned regulatory systems and close co-operation on defence and security. Should go for something much more ambitious than anything that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s previously been agreed. Former UK cabinet minister and New Labour architect Peter Mandelson was also at the lunch, and pointed out that French president Emmanuel Macron had hosted 140 CEOs at Versailles the other day. Mandelson warned: For France, Brexit is a gift that keeps on giving. Hammond hit back, though, saying you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d get more top CEOs in London on an average day (probably not all meeting a world leader, though!). The European Central Bank has left interest rates unchanged and repeated that its bond buying programme will run until September or beyond if necessary. The ECB added it could increase the programme from its current \u00e2\u201a\u00ac30bn a month if circumstances change: If the outlook becomes less favourable, or if financial conditions become inconsistent with further progress towards a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation, the Governing Council stands ready to increase the asset purchase programme (APP) in terms of size and/or duration. On rates it said they would be kept at present levels \u00e2\u20ac\u0153for an extended period of time, and well past the horizon of the net asset purchases.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Of course the detail will come in president Mario Draghi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s press conference this afternoon, when analysts will be looking for more on the future of the QE programme and when rates might rise. But Draghi must be tempted to keep his cards close to his chest, and avoid anything which could push the euro higher when inflation is still below the bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s target. NF Donald Trump and his team are staying at the Intercontinental Hotel in Davos. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a sensible move from a security point of view; the Intercontinental is at the edge of Davos, rather than slap bang next to the conference centre like the Belvedere (scene of many parties and meeting). It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also up a steep hill, so easier to prevent protests . The White House press pack report that they saw onlookers snapping pictures of the Trump convoy, but no demos on the route. Hello... Business Insider\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Paul Colgan has spotted some anti-Trump protesters outside the conference halls. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s very tight security all around the Davos area, making it hard for demonstrators to travel up the mountain and exercise their democratic rights. You\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d almost think the global elite didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to know what people really think of them.... Chancellor Philip Hammond is cracking some jokes at the CBI\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s lunch with British business chiefs - including one at Theresa May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s expense. He reminds his audience that it was a walk in the mountain air that inspired the prime minister to call a general election last year*. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m discouraging her from taking any strolls, Hammond grins. * - (wiping out her majority) Boris Johnson once said that he was put off from visiting parts of New York by the very real risk of meeting Donald Trump. Well in Davos, you also run the very real risk of running into Piers Morgan. The UK journalist and TV personality has done well, though, securing an exclusive sit-down interview with the US president. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s due to air on Sunday night, with clips released on Friday morning. Davos delegates without a swanky lunch invite (or the time to go) are being fed individual jars of pasta dishes. And it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s great fun to watch the global elite scrambling to over each other whenever the waiting staff emerge with a new tray of goodies. Your humble correspondent finally gets a pot, balances it on his iPad - and is promptly mistaken for a waiter by a fellow delegate who tries to nab it off me. Maybe it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time for a career change... Trump has touched down in Switzerland, but there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no sign of him in the Congress Hall yet. Ireland\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s leader, Leo Varadkar, is in Davos -- and refusing to accept that Apple got an unfairly good tax deal from the Irish government. In 2016, the EC ruled that Apple had received \u00e2\u201a\u00ac13bn of state aid. Last November, it referred Ireland to the European Court of Justice because Dublin hadn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t started reclaiming the cash. According to Varadkar, this process will start soon.....but he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not rolling over in the ECJ. Speaking of the CBI, UK retail sales have grown modestly in January so far, according to its latest distributive trades survey, but at a slower pace than anticipated. The survey showed a balance of +12 for January, down from +20 in December. Sales for the time of year were the weakest compared to the norm for more than four years, said the CBI. Orders to suppliers also fell, and looking ahead retailers expect similar growth in sales volumes while orders are forecast to be flat. Anna Leach, CBI head of economic intelligence, said: Retailers have seen fairly modest sales growth this month overall, but it is online retailers who have set the pace during the January sales. Household spending will remain under pressure this year from higher inflation and low wage growth, which will continue to weigh on sales growth in the retail sector. NF British business chiefs and media leaders have headed to a lunchtime event with chancellor Philip Hammond, hosted by the CBI. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a traditional part of the Davos week for the UK delegation, but this year it could be a little frostier than usual. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s because CBI chief Caroline Fairbairn declared last week that Britain must remain in the customs union after Brexit. I imagine the Treasury weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t best pleased by this intervention (unless we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve outsourced Brexit negotiations to the CBI...a safer bet than using Carillion, anyway). But we understand that Hammond won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t use his speech to rebut Fairbairn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s call, and will cover other issues.... My colleague Larry Elliott\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s there, so we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll have more details soon.... Theresa May has given an interview to Bloomberg. She spoke about the revelations about sexual harassment at a charity dinner in London, saying: I was frankly appalled when I read the report of this Presidents Club event. I thought that that sort of attitude of the objectification of women was something that was in the past. Sadly, what that event showed is that there is still a lot more work for us to do. That chimes with Malala Yousafzai\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s comments this morning. Our Politics Live blog has more details: We hear that Theresa May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meeting with Donald Trump will take place shortly after her speech (which starts at 2pm, or 1pm GMT). It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s likely to focus on foreign affairs issues like Syria and North Korea. Theresa May has now ended her private meeting (perhaps a roundtable?) and swept the WEF congress hall in a gaggle of aides. Down the stairs at pace, she\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s quickly into another secure section of this rabbit-warren of a building. Disappointingly she didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t stop for questions - a camera had been lined up, just in case. Still, we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll hear from her in a couple of hours. Chancellor Philip Hammond has told the Davos panel on financial risks that Europe will lose out if the City suffers after Brexit. New York and Singapore would benefit from new business, he says, not European cities. The idea that you can recreate London\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s financial centre anywhere else is a fantasy. Hammond also says that financial services are very important to the UK side, and \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the centre of our negotiating strategy\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Those who say the financial sector will not be part of a deal have not been looking at the numbers, he says. We have a trade deficit of \u00c2\u00a3100bn with Europe, and a surplus in services of \u00c2\u00a340bn, Hammond explains, adding: The only deal that can be done is one that can be fair to both parties One that included trade and not services would not be fair to the UK. Theresa May and her entourage have just swept through the Davos congress centre, into a private meeting room. Alas media are certainly not allowed in to listen. Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s treasury secretary, Stephen Mnuchin is also on the panel on the future of finance. Yesterday, Mnuchin sent the dollar tumbling by saying a weak currency is good for exports. Today, he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s very relaxed about the whole issue, saying: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153In the short term where the dollar is is not a concern of mine. It is not something I spend a lot of time thinking about.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Mnuchin also denies that America is trying to launch a trade war, insisting that the US doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want less trade it wants \u00e2\u20ac\u0153fair trade\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. The big debate on financial stability is also underway. Christine Lagarde, managing director of the IMF, says trade is one of the factors leading to stronger growth. When asked about the risks of a trade war, she says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Who would want to do anything that would lead to weaker growth? Al Gore, former US vice-president, has suggested that Donald Trump can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t disrupt the battle against climate change - especially if he isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t reelected in 2020. Speaking on a panel here in Davos, Gore says there is strong momentum to fight climate change. Several governors of our largest states, hundreds of cities, and thousands of US businesses are now ensuring that the US will not just meet, but exceed, the commitments it made in the Paris Agreement. Gore explains that America can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t legally leave the Paris Agreement (to act to limit rising global temperatures) until after the next presidential election. And if there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a new president (at which point Al Gore offers a silent prayer), they could give 30 days notice and America would be back in the agreement. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the good news. The bad news, Gore says, is that the maximum action that is political feasible falls far short of the minimum of what is needed to battle climate change. So, we need to move the boundary of what politicians can do. You can watch the panel live, here. Back in the UK, and mortgage approvals by Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s banks fell to their lowest level since April 2013 in December, according to trade association UK Finance. Banks approved 36,115 mortgages for housebuying, down from 39,007 in November and 19% lower than a year ago. Annual growth in consumer credit slipped from 0.8% to 0.7%. And this could give the Bank of England a problem: NF Newsflash: Theresa May has met with South Africa\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s deputy president, Cyril Ramaphosa.....and there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not a fondue dish in sight either. Theresa May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s former press chief has caused a stir this morning, accusing the PM of spending last year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Davos \u00e2\u20ac\u0153sitting in a hotel eating fondue\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd rather than meeting fellow world leaders and business chiefs. Writing in The Times, Katy Perrior claims the PM struggled to schmooze at the 2017 World Economic Forum, and even turned up with the wrong sort of footwear (her new \u00c2\u00a3120 snowboots should work better this time). Perrior claiming business leaders were frozen out by May: \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcElsewhere they get personal audiences with President Macron in France and Malcolm Turnbull in Australia but not so much as a digestive biscuit from the PM. \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcDoes she have any idea how frustrating that is for them? Other world leaders are on a charm offensive, desperate to woo major businesses to their shores. \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcAs we count down to post-Brexit Britain, she would do well to spend less time enjoying the fondue and more time meeting and greeting.\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 More here. Personally, I was disappointed not to see May meeting business chiefs and academics at Oxford University\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s excellent Davos cheese and port party last night (maybe I left too early #bestbehaviour ) Perrior also claims May turned down the chance to meet Alibaba\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Jack Ma last year. He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s still at Davos, so there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s still time to make amends, prime minister... Kristin Lemkau, JP Morgan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chief marketing officer, sums up Davos so far: Sterling continues to go from strength to strength. In Asia overnight it hit $1.4328, and although it has eased back from that, it is still up 0.11% so far today at $1.4255. It is partly the expectation of an earlier than expected UK rate rise, given the recent strong data including Wednesday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s employment and wages figures. But of course there is also the weak dollar, hit recently by the expectation that Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tax cuts would raise the already hefty US deficit. More immediately Treasury secretary Steven Mnuchin told Davos the US wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t worried about a flagging greenback. Kit Juckes at Societe Generale said: Steven Mnuchin (US Treasury Secretary) went to Davos and said that a weaker dollar \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcis good for us as it relates to trade and opportunities\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. He also pointed out that that he isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t concerned by where it is in the short term and that in the longer term, its strength is a reflection of the strength of the US economy. In other words, he said very little really, but he said it under snow-plastered slopes and he was speaking to a market where dollar bulls have been under the cosh. A few more capitulated. Against the euro the pound is pretty flat, down just 0.01% at \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.1473 ahead of the latest European Central Bank meeting. But the euro is up against the dollar, 0.11% better at $1.2421. The strength of the euro presents a problem for ECB president Mario Draghi. If he appears too bulllish at hinting at an end to the bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s QE programme, the euro will appreciate even further. And that would keep a lid on inflation which is already below the bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s target. Equally, he cannot ignore the improving European economy. Michael Hewson at CMC Markets explains: With headline inflation remaining well below its 2% target rate at 1.4% and an economy that continues to show decent levels of economic activity the ECB is faced with having to navigate the minefield of guiding markets over the tightrope of communicating a credible timeline for stimulus reduction and interest rate policy, while trying to move CPI back to target against the difficulty of a rising currency. Since the beginning of 2017 the euro has risen 18% against the US dollar and could well rise even further given yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s remarks by US Treasury Secretary Mnuchin. Last week ECB vice president Vitor Constancio along with Austria\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ewald Nowotny expressed concern about recent exchange rate movements. These concerns are likely to have increased in recent days which will make today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s press conference by ECB President Mario Draghi much more interesting. He can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t very well ignore the improving outlook but if he comes across as too bullish the euro could well be well on the way to the 1.3000 level by the end of this quarter. Naeem Aslam, chief market analyst at Think Markets, said: Draghi would have to adopt a delicate approach and seek a strategy which stops the euro from firming further. The only way out of this situation for him would be to emphasize that the process of the rate hikes is not within sight yet. The market is expecting a rate hike in 2019 from the ECB, Draghi would have to pull a rabbit out of hat in order to convince the market that rate hike isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t on the agenda and market participants are getting ahead of themselves. We do think that overly dovish statement by the European central bank is priced in the euro to some extent. If Draghi fails to convince the market or if he doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t sound as dovish as the market is expecting, we think that the euro can take off from here. I think the risk to the downside for the euro are limited, it is the upside move which would be more exciting. NF Theresa May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Conservative Party has confirmed she will hold social media giants to account in Davos: Bruce Carnegie-Brown, chairman of Lloyd\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s, says that companies are taking out more insurance against cyber attacks. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It is the fastest growing part of our business\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, Carnegie-Brown says, adding: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Companies are certainly becoming more concerned about the risks.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Lloyd\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s has 30% of the global market, Carnegie-Brown says, with 85% of the business coming from US firms. The insurance market is changing, he says. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153People are more concerned about cyber attack than a fire when it comes to the potential impact on their business.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Carnegie-Brown says he has been floating the idea in Davos that governments might use part of their aid budgets to insure poor developing countries against the cost of natural disasters. Lloyd\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s will pay out almost $5b to the US states affected by the three hurricanes last year but says the world as a whole is under-insured. Malala also warns that world leaders need to invest more in education, to help future generations. Malala Yousafzai, the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s youngest Nobel Prize winner, is speaking at Davos right now, about the importance of giving girls equal rights to education. She\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s explaining that education can play a key role in improving giving the message of equality. So what\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s your message to Trump on the issue of gender equality, asks Miriam Elder of Buzzfeed. Yousafzai says: I get so disappointed to see that people in these high positions openly talk against women, do not accept women as equals, they harass woman. It is just shocking to think that is is happening I hope that women stand up and speak out against it. I hope that people who are involved in such shameful things think about their own daughters, their own mothers, their own close female relations, and just imagine for a second, could they let it happen to them? I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think they would accept that. Malala, who was shot by the Taliban in 2012 after campaigning for girls education, says women must \u00e2\u20ac\u0153raise up their voice\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, and reach the ears and minds of those who still hold views which we hoped didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t exist any more Just in: chancellor Philip Hammond says he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u0153very happy\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd with the strength of sterling, which has hit its highest level since the Brexit vote. Foreign exchange rates are a big story at Davos, after America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Treasury secretary Stephen Mnuchin seemed to hint that Washington liked a weaker dollar Some of President\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s top officials are briefing the press again this morning. Commerce secretary Wilbur Ross is in combative mood, denying that America is protectionist - even though it just slapped new tariffs on washing machines and solar panels from Asia. Ross also says that America is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153more interested\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in bilateral trade deals than multilateral ones - which doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t bode very well for the ongoing NAFTA negotiations. John McDonnell, Labour\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shadow chancellor, is also in Davos, and bringing a warning for the global elite: McDonnell will be telling top business people and world leaders that they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re dangerously insulated from the problems outside WEF\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s security cordon and swanky parties: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Many of those attending the World Economic Forum have been patting themselves on the back as international growth figures have begun to pick up. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153But they should be worried. In the real world, outside the Davos bubble of Alpine restaurants and chalets, the global economic system they have built isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t working for billions of people. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153And just as Davos faces the risk of an avalanche this week, growth for a few risks a political and social avalanche unless there is fundamental change to our rigged economic system. Philip Hammond, the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chancellor of the Exchequer, is also at Davos. He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been giving his views about artificial intelligence at a Microsoft breakfast, saying: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We are at the point where computers move from being dumb and fast to being smart and fast.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Hammond says AI is going to be disruptive and managing the process is the key to it being accepted, warning: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153To many it will seem to be a big threat to their prosperity and livelihoods\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Losers would include members of the middle class but it was important to embrace the new technology rather than resist it. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Let\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not create a generation of 21st Century Luddites who feel the only chance of survival is to resist change.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Hammond said AI would affect the jobs market, would disrupt business models and had ethical dimensions including privacy and the way new technology could be used in wars. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The choice is simple: do we look inward or outward, look to the future or cleave to the past?\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Here are some photos of Donald Trump setting off to Davos last night: Good morning from Davos. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s another big day at the World Economic Forum, with Theresa May giving a keynote speech this afternoon \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and meeting Donald Trump on the sidelines. The UK PM is expected to put technology giants under pressure to clean up their act and tackle extreme content. She\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll say: Investors can make a big difference here by ensuring trust and safety issues are being properly considered. And I urge them to do so. These companies simply cannot stand by while their platforms are used to facilitate child abuse, modern slavery or the spreading of terrorist and extremist content.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Her meeting with Trump will be a chance to talk trade after Brexit, discuss terrorism, and perhaps patch up that Special Relationship after the row over the US embassy. As Beth Rigby from Sky News puts it: The two leaders are expected to focus on areas where there is common ground in international affairs: North Korea, as well as eradicating Islamic State in Syria and northern Iraq. They might touch on Iran. But the thornier issue of Russian aggression in Europe is less likely to be raised as the Prime Minister seeks to soothe relations and not stoke further tensions. President Trump set off for Davos last night - part of the biggest US delegation ever. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be hearing more from his team this morning. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also masses of other events, covering gender equality, financial stability, tax avoidance and climate change.

Neil Wilson, senior market analyst at ETX Capital, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>US 10s [ten year bond yields] just hit 2.71%, while German bund yields are also on the march higher with the 5-year turning positive for the first time since 2015.

At this stage in the cycle it makes sense for yields to be climbing but breakout beyond the 30-year trend line does signal the bond bears are here at last. A spike to 3% in the 10-year now looks very possible and a bond market rout could spook the market. </p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5a6ee940e4b0d3de59ee3fc6\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-01-29T09:31:34.690Z\">9.31am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s central bank says it will keep a prudent and neutral monetary policy, but admits the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy still has problems, including high debt levels and the risks of an asset bubble.</p> <p>It added in its latest bulletin that it had the right conditions to keep the renminbi basically stable, and said a two way fluctuation in yuan rates would become the norm.<br></p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2018-01-29T09:39:40.371Z\">at 9.39am GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5a6ede6ae4b0530bd3483689\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-01-29T08:48:58.343Z\">8.48am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Julian Dunkerton, the co-founder of Superdry, is nearly \u00c2\u00a318m richer after selling part of his stake in the fashion retailer.</p> <p>Dunkerton, which is now the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s product and brand director, sold one million shares at the end of last week at \u00c2\u00a317.80 each.

ING foreign exchange strategist Viraj Patel says:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>In an action-packed week for global markets, the main event will be President Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s State of the Union address (Tueday 2100 ET) \u00e2\u20ac\u201c which is set to outline the administration\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 2018 policy agenda ahead of the pivotal November midterms. With US trade policy in particular focus, the burning question for investors is which type of Donald Trump will turn up: Dr Jekyll or Mr Hyde?</p> <p>While the former manifestation may have appealed to the international elite at Davos, we would not be entirely surprised to see the more fiery characteristics of the President surface back on home soil in Washington. Indeed, with President Trump fighting low approval ratings, fresh allegations that he wanted to fire Special Counsel Robert Mueller last year and with little policy progress to show (beyond the Tax Bill) \u00e2\u20ac\u201c there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s every chance that the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcAmerica First\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 policy talk has a protectionist sting in the tail this week. As such, we expect global risk sentiment to remain on red alert ahead of the speech \u00e2\u20ac\u201c with outside risks that USD/JPY could fall to the 107.00 level on a more contentious Trump State of the Union address.</p> <p>As for the dollar\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s broader trajectory, it will now be very difficult for Washington to put the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcweak dollar\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 genie back in the bottle. The damage is already done \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and with structural factors \u00e2\u20ac\u201c such as a late US economic cycle, relative US asset valuations and the twin current account and fiscal deficits \u00e2\u20ac\u201c all supporting a weaker dollar trend, the naturally tendency will be for the greenback to fall over the course of 2018. Add a US political and policy uncertainty premium into the mix \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and the dollar\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decline could transpire quicker than what we had initially expected.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5a6ecfdfe4b0d3de59ee3f4f\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-01-29T07:40:57.568Z\">7.40am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The weaker pound and euro are expected to give some support to stock markets when they open.:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/IGSquawk/status/957863725611929600\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">European Opening Calls:<a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/FTSE?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#FTSE</a> 7678 +0.16%<a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/DAX?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#DAX</a> 13378 +0.28%<a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/CAC?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#CAC</a> 5546 +0.31%<a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/MIB?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#MIB</a> 23899 +0.17%<a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/IBEX?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#IBEX</a> 10631 +0.34%</p>&mdash; IGSquawk (@IGSquawk) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/IGSquawk/status/957863725611929600?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">January 29, 2018</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5a6ec8bbe4b03d22f608b5cd\" class=\"block is-summary\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-01-29T07:38:51.845Z\">7.38am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Agenda: Currencies in focus as dollar strengthens</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business.</strong></p> <p>The dollar has been under pressure for some time now, and is set for its worst start to a year for around 30 years.

                "bodyText":"With the dollar recovering from its recent weakness, and continuing uncertainty over Brexit, the pound has come under pressure today and is currently 0.63% lower at $1.4080. Meanwhile bonds prices are falling and yields rising, as central banks increasingly look to move away from their low interest rate and QE programmes which have supported markets for several years now. German and US yields in particular have move sharply higher. In the US, the Federal Reserve\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s preferred measure of inflation - the PCE index - was in line with expections, up from 0.1% in November to 0.2% last month. But the savings rate fell to a more than 12 year low. Elsewhere the European Union has warned Donald Trump it is ready to retaliate on trade if the US tries to crack down on imports. And cryptocurrencies were back in the spotlight on concerns about a crackdown in Japan after hackers stole $400m from the Coincheck exchange. Finally, accountancy firm KPMG is to be investigated by the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Financial Reporting Council over its role in the collapse of construction group Carillion. On that note, it is time to close for the day. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be back tomorrow. With the recovery in the dollar, a decline in bond prices and a busy week ahead, US markets have slipped back from their record levels. As well as the Federal Reserve\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s latest interest rate setting meeting, there is the State of the Union address and a host of results from the likes of Apple, Alphabet, Facebook, Microsoft and Amazon. Apple is already weighing on the markets, following reports it would make half the number of planned iPhone Xs this quarter. So the Dow Jones Industrial Average has dropped 37 points or 0.15%, the S&amp;P 500 lost 0.26% and the Nasdaq Composite fell 0.32%. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our full report on the EU\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s warning to Donald Trump over trade. Daniel Boffey writes: Brussels has warned that it stands ready to retaliate and potentially open up a transatlantic trade war if the US delivers on apparent threats to restrict European imports. The US president, Donald Trump, claimed in an interview with ITV broadcast on Sunday that the EU had been \u00e2\u20ac\u0153very unfair\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd on American exporters, and that it would \u00e2\u20ac\u0153morph into something very big\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd that would \u00e2\u20ac\u0153turn out to be very much to [the EU\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s] detriment\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Washington is currently examining the case for protecting US economic interests on national security grounds, including the imposition of import tariffs on aluminium and steel. Responding to Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s comments, a spokesman for the European commission told reporters in Brussels that the EU was ready to hit back if its importers were made to suffer. The spokesman said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153For us trade policy is not a zero sum game. It is not about winners and losers. We here in the European Union believe that trade can and should be win-win. The full report is here: The latest set of US inflation figures have risen in December in line with forecasts. The personal consumption expenditures price index - it may be a mouthful but it is the Federal Reserve\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s preferred measure of inflation - climbed from 0.1% in November to 0.2% last month. On an annual basis it rose 1.5%, the same as in November. It is still below the Fed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 2% target. Meanwhile consumer spending increased by 0.4% last month, again in line with expectations. The November figure was revised upwards from an initial reading of 0.6% to 0.8%. Personal income rose 0.4%, up from 0.3% in November, while wages increased by 0.5%. The savings rate fell to 2.4% from 2.5% in November, the lowest level since September 2005. Stock markets are pretty steady at the moment, but will that last if bond yields continue to climb? On the weak pound, financial analyst Connor Campbell at Spreadex said: With little else to focus on investors turned their attention to Theresa May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s most recent bout of Tory turbulence, much to the pound\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s displeasure. The Prime Minister is dealing with the umpteenth swell of dissent over the state of her leadership, while at the same time having to try and quash the latest beef between her warring ministers, this round sparked by leaked Whatsapp messages from climate change minister Claire Perry calling Brexit voters \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcswivel-eyed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. Add onto that the Lords constitution committee labelling the EU withdrawal bill as \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcfundamentally flawed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 just one day before the legislation is set to be debated, alongside a warning from EU leaders that the UK is \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcnot ready\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 to secure a divorce deal, and there was plenty for the previously soaring pound to fret about. The pound continues to slip back against the dollar, and is now down 0.66% at $1.4074. Against the euro, sterling is down 0.32% at \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.1352. As well as the dollar\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s recovery, the pound is being hit by renewed Brexit uncertainty, after the continuing splits in the Conservative party and the prime minister\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s perceived weakness. President Trump said at Davos on Friday that he wanted free and fair trade, comments which did little to assuage fears of a possible trade war. Especially since they followed the imposition of tariffs on washing machines and solar panels from China and South Korea. Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK, said: President Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s speech on Friday did nothing to increase [concerns about a trade war], but neither did they assuage them. His comments that the US wanted free but \u00e2\u20ac\u0153fair\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd trade suggested that he would not be shy in confronting what he considered unfair trade practices, potentially putting him on a collision course with China, as well as the European Union. And here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a response from Europe: On a lighter note: Is this the end of the battle for the sunbed? Thomas Cook is offering holidaymakers the chance to pre-book sun loungers, eliminating the need for the dawn dash to the pool to bag one with a towel. For \u00e2\u201a\u00ac25, customers will be able to book a specific sun lounger for their entire holiday. The Anglo-German company says it is the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s first package holiday firm to offer this service, which it is trialling at three hotels in Lanzarote, Gran Canaria and Fuerteventura from the end of February. Customers will receive an email six days before departure asking if they would like to choose their sunbed in advance. They will be able to choose their preferred spot on a pool plan featuring a compass to help them work out what time of the day areas will be in the sun or shade. Read more here: The FTSE 100 is currently managing to stay in positive territory, just. But European markets have slipped back after a bright early start. The UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s leading index is up 0.13% while Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax has dipped 0.23% and France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac is down 0.07%. On Wall Street the Dow Jones Industrial Average is expected to open some 37 points lower, but Joshua Mahony, market analyst at IG, reckons US markets could generally be a better bet than European bourses. He said: The FTSE 100 [is] gaining ground thanks to a weaker pound and a strengthening price of copper. Rising copper prices have helped boost the commodity-heavy FTSE 100, with Anglo American, Glencore, Rio Tinto, and Antofagasta helping drive the index into the green. After last week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s losses, UK traders will hope that this will represent the beginning of a resurgence for the FTSE, yet with the dollar devaluation likely to drive the pound higher yet, it makes more sense to be long US markets over their European counterparts. Today sees a somewhat serene start to what is likely to be a fairly frantic week, with the second half providing a whole host of top tier economic data points to drive market sentiment. Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s state of the union address tomorrow sees the market focus shift back to US economic prospects, and with the potential for a raft of infrastructure projects around the corner, there is another good reason to be long US stocks. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the Reuters report on the earlier Chinese central bank comments: China will consider including shadow banking, property financing and internet financing in its macro-prudential assessment (MPA), central bank vice governor Yi Gang wrote on Monday, according to China Finance, a publication under the People\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Bank of China. The world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s second-biggest economy still has problems and hidden dangers as the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s debt levels are still high while asset bubble risks have not yet been fully contained, Yi wrote. The central bank will maintain prudent and neutral monetary policy while seeking to increase flexibility and effectiveness of liquidity management, Yi said. China has conditions to keep the yuan basically stable, Yi said, adding that the regulator will look to increase the yuan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s exchange rate flexibility. Back in the volatile world of cryptocurrencies, bitcoin is down 3.5% at $11,284 on fears of a further crackdown by regulators, this time in Japan. This follows news that one exchange, Coincheck, would refund around $400m to customers after hackers stole holdings in NEM, the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tenth biggest cryptocurrency. NEM is currently down around 8%. Fiona Cincotta at City Index said: This incident highlights one of the biggest concerns towards crypto currencies, namely security. The Japanese government have ordered Coincheck to beef up its security to prevent a repeat incident, as more authorities are clamping down on the virtual currency. Given the headline grabbing numbers, this hack is unlikely to disappear into headline history fast. Japan is one of the largest markets for cryptocurrency trading, accounting for around 30% -40% of global traded volume last month. Should this hack seriously dent confidence in virtual currencies, Bitcoin could see the selloff extended. Bond prices are coming under pressure on the growing signs that central banks are moving away from their low interest rate and QE programmes. With the US economy growing at 2.6% in the final quarter and the Bank of Japan governor saying inflation was close to reaching its target, US Treasury bonds fell and the yield [or interest rate] rose. In Europe comments over the weekend from Klass Knot, head of the Dutch central bank, that the ECB should clarify how it will end its asset purchases have also hit the bond market. Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s yield on its five year bonds has risen to 0.004%, the first time it has been in positive territory for more than three years. French and Dutch bond yields have climbed to their highest levels since July. Neil Wilson, senior market analyst at ETX Capital, said: US 10s [ten year bond yields] just hit 2.71%, while German bund yields are also on the march higher with the 5-year turning positive for the first time since 2015. It does look like this is capitulation time for bond bulls as yields are entering breakout mode, which will have important consequences for equity valuations. At this stage in the cycle it makes sense for yields to be climbing but breakout beyond the 30-year trend line does signal the bond bears are here at last. A spike to 3% in the 10-year now looks very possible and a bond market rout could spook the market. China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s central bank says it will keep a prudent and neutral monetary policy, but admits the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy still has problems, including high debt levels and the risks of an asset bubble. It added in its latest bulletin that it had the right conditions to keep the renminbi basically stable, and said a two way fluctuation in yuan rates would become the norm. Julian Dunkerton, the co-founder of Superdry, is nearly \u00c2\u00a318m richer after selling part of his stake in the fashion retailer. Dunkerton, which is now the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s product and brand director, sold one million shares at the end of last week at \u00c2\u00a317.80 each. That amounts to 1.23% of the company and still leaves him with more than 25%, making him its largest shareholder. Superdry shares have surged 20% over the past year but an update earlier this month saw them slip back after it revealed a 28% fall in half year profits. More on the collapse of construction group Carillion. Julia Kollewe reports: Accountancy firm KPMG is to be investigated by the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Financial Reporting Council over its role in the collapse of Carillion. The business secretary, Greg Clark, welcomed the investigation, which the accounting watchdog said followed inquiries made since Carillion\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shock profit warning in July. The FRC said it would conduct the investigation, which will cover 2014 to 2016, and additional audit work carried out during 2017, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153 as quickly and thoroughly as possible\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Carillion went into compulsory liquidation two weeks ago with debts of \u00c2\u00a31.3bn, a pension deficit of nearly \u00c2\u00a31bn and a host of unfinished public contracts. The full story is here: The move comes ahead of a select committee hearing tomorrow with the FRC, the Insolvency Service and Carillion pension trustees. MPs have already accused the Pensions Regulator of failing to act while Carillion racked up debts to pay dividends and executive bonuses, as the business built up a pension deficit that reached nearly \u00c2\u00a31bn by the time it collapsed this month. As expected, most European markets have opened in positive territory - just about - helped by the weakness of the pound and euro against the dollar. A weaker currency gives a boost to exporters, with the FTSE 100 in particular packed with overseas earners. The UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s leading index is up 0.14%, also benefiting from positive performances by mining groups after a 1% rise in the copper price. But drinks group Diageo, one of those which might be expected to benefit from a weaker pound, is down nearly 1% after a downgrade by analysts at RBC. Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax and France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac have climbed 0.1%, Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB is up 0.17% but Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ibex has dipped 0.2%. Despite the prospect of further US interest rate rises this year, ING Bank believes the dollar weakness is likely to continue (notwithstanding today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s move higher.) Apart from the US inflation data later and the two day Federal Reserve meeting which starts tomorrow, there is another big event which could have a major impact on the curreny. ING foreign exchange strategist Viraj Patel says: In an action-packed week for global markets, the main event will be President Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s State of the Union address (Tueday 2100 ET) \u00e2\u20ac\u201c which is set to outline the administration\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 2018 policy agenda ahead of the pivotal November midterms. With US trade policy in particular focus, the burning question for investors is which type of Donald Trump will turn up: Dr Jekyll or Mr Hyde? While the former manifestation may have appealed to the international elite at Davos, we would not be entirely surprised to see the more fiery characteristics of the President surface back on home soil in Washington. Indeed, with President Trump fighting low approval ratings, fresh allegations that he wanted to fire Special Counsel Robert Mueller last year and with little policy progress to show (beyond the Tax Bill) \u00e2\u20ac\u201c there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s every chance that the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcAmerica First\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 policy talk has a protectionist sting in the tail this week. As such, we expect global risk sentiment to remain on red alert ahead of the speech \u00e2\u20ac\u201c with outside risks that USD/JPY could fall to the 107.00 level on a more contentious Trump State of the Union address. As for the dollar\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s broader trajectory, it will now be very difficult for Washington to put the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcweak dollar\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 genie back in the bottle. The damage is already done \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and with structural factors \u00e2\u20ac\u201c such as a late US economic cycle, relative US asset valuations and the twin current account and fiscal deficits \u00e2\u20ac\u201c all supporting a weaker dollar trend, the naturally tendency will be for the greenback to fall over the course of 2018. Add a US political and policy uncertainty premium into the mix \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and the dollar\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decline could transpire quicker than what we had initially expected. The weaker pound and euro are expected to give some support to stock markets when they open.: Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. The dollar has been under pressure for some time now, and is set for its worst start to a year for around 30 years. Conversely US stock markets are making their best start for the same period, partly due to that very dollar weakness. Concerns that President Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tax reforms will add to the already hefty US deficit have undermined sentiment for the US currency, as has the prospect of a trade war which picked up pace last week as the US slapped tariffs on washing machines and solar panels from China and South Korea. Contrasting comments at Davos did not help. Treasury secretary Steve Mnuchin said he didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t mind a weak dollar, then Trump said virtually the opposite a day or so later. But the weakness in the dollar looks like it might be starting to attract some bargain hunters, with the currency regaining a little ground in Asia and edging higher in Europe. And although the Federal Reserve is expected to make no move on interest rates at this week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meeting - the swansong for Janet Yellen as Fed chair - further rises are expected this year. Later today come some US inflation figures which are likely to influence whether the dollar can hold onto its gains. Jasper Lawler at London Capital Group said: Investors will now look ahead to the release of US PCE [personal consumption expenditure] figures, the Fed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s preferred measure of inflation. Month on month inflation is expected to have increased 0.2% in December, from 0.1%. Meanwhile, on a annualised basis a constant reading of 1.5% is forecast. Given the ongoing concerns at the Fed over the sluggish inflation in the US, a higher reading this afternoon, could help cement the dollar\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bounce. At the moment the dollar\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s recovery has left the pound 0.28% lower at $1.4128 while against the euro sterling has dipped 0.1% to \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.1376. As well as being affected by the dollar\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s recovery, the pound is being undermined by renewed Brexit concerns, with peers saying the EU withdrawal bill needs to be withdrawn and the prime minister under growing pressure amid calls for the chancellor to be sacked. The US PCE figures are due at 1.30pm GMT, which is the main item on the economic agenda.",
