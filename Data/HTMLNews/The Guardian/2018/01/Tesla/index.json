                "body":"<p>It\u2019s beginning to look a lot like Christmas for US retailers, but not if you\u2019re a woman working for one. Company sales reports are coming in and so far they indicate the holiday season was a big success. At the same time evidence is emerging that the radical reordering of the retail landscape is hitting women hard, and there may be worse to come. </p> <p>The retail sector has been the biggest loser of jobs for the last two years in a row in the US, as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/mar/26/us-retail-stores-market-macys-sears\">thousands of stores closed</a> as shoppers moved online. It remains one of the US\u2019s largest employers, providing 15.8m jobs, but the reordering of the retail landscape is having a profound impact on the nature of its workforce.</p> <p>Between November 2016 and November 2017, the sector fired 129,000 women (the largest loss for any industrial sector for either sex) while men gained 109,000 positions, according to an analysis by the Institute for Women\u2019s Policy Research (IWPR). In the whole labour force women gained 985,000 jobs over the year, while men gained 1.08m jobs.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/aug/16/retail-industry-cashier-jobs-technology-unemployment\">End of the checkout line: the looming crisis for American cashiers</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Retail remains a \u201chugely important\u201d employer for women, said Heidi Hartmann, IWPR president, especially as a provider of part-time jobs for women who are looking to balance work with family obligations. \u201cWomen are very dependent on the nearby shopping center and retail outlets especially as they get back into the work market.\u201d But the shift in how Americans shop \u2013 and in what they are buying \u2013 is having a profound effect.</p> <p>Major retailers shut shops across the US last year. A record 6,700 stores shut in 2017, according to Fung Global Retail &amp; Technology, a retail thinktank. Macy\u2019s alone closed 68 stores and shed 10,000 jobs. Drugstore chain Walgreens closed 600 locations.</p> <p>New jobs are being created in shipping, handling, back office and warehousing but traditional retail is being hollowed out with the loss of checkout and sales assistant jobs. \u201cThere are still jobs being created in retail but they are jobs with different skill sets,\u201d said Andrew Challenger, vice-president of outplacement experts Challenger, Gray and Christmas. But despite those gains \u201cthere is real job loss going on and we may not see those jobs coming back. In many cases these jobs are being lost in places where retailers are the largest employers in the area.\u201d</p> <p>Challenger described the losses as one of the most dramatic changes in the jobs market the US had witnessed since manufacturing was rocked by outsourcing and automation.<br></p> <p>Hartmann said there were some similarities with the hollowing out of manufacturing. \u201cWomen lost jobs in manufacturing first. They had the easiest jobs to ship abroad \u2013 clothing, textiles \u2013 and the men had the jobs that did eventually get shipped abroad but were more difficult to move, like cars, with big transportation costs.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"3855b07b391a602c9f3d3ad0fe7ffb9708b67ae7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3855b07b391a602c9f3d3ad0fe7ffb9708b67ae7/0_0_4930_3287/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Job losses in the retail sector have been compared to the hollowing out of manufacturing due to outsourcing and automation.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Job losses in the retail sector have been compared to the hollowing out of manufacturing due to outsourcing and automation.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Daniel Leal-Olivas/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>She pointed out that women are still the majority recipients of the trade assistance adjustment act \u2013 benefits that are given to US workers for retraining if they lose their employment because of international trade.</p> <p>But she said other factors were also at play.

                "bodyText":"It\u2019s beginning to look a lot like Christmas for US retailers, but not if you\u2019re a woman working for one. Company sales reports are coming in and so far they indicate the holiday season was a big success. At the same time evidence is emerging that the radical reordering of the retail landscape is hitting women hard, and there may be worse to come. The retail sector has been the biggest loser of jobs for the last two years in a row in the US, as thousands of stores closed as shoppers moved online. It remains one of the US\u2019s largest employers, providing 15.8m jobs, but the reordering of the retail landscape is having a profound impact on the nature of its workforce. Between November 2016 and November 2017, the sector fired 129,000 women (the largest loss for any industrial sector for either sex) while men gained 109,000 positions, according to an analysis by the Institute for Women\u2019s Policy Research (IWPR). In the whole labour force women gained 985,000 jobs over the year, while men gained 1.08m jobs. Retail remains a \u201chugely important\u201d employer for women, said Heidi Hartmann, IWPR president, especially as a provider of part-time jobs for women who are looking to balance work with family obligations. \u201cWomen are very dependent on the nearby shopping center and retail outlets especially as they get back into the work market.\u201d But the shift in how Americans shop \u2013 and in what they are buying \u2013 is having a profound effect. Major retailers shut shops across the US last year. A record 6,700 stores shut in 2017, according to Fung Global Retail &amp; Technology, a retail thinktank. Macy\u2019s alone closed 68 stores and shed 10,000 jobs. Drugstore chain Walgreens closed 600 locations. New jobs are being created in shipping, handling, back office and warehousing but traditional retail is being hollowed out with the loss of checkout and sales assistant jobs. \u201cThere are still jobs being created in retail but they are jobs with different skill sets,\u201d said Andrew Challenger, vice-president of outplacement experts Challenger, Gray and Christmas. But despite those gains \u201cthere is real job loss going on and we may not see those jobs coming back. In many cases these jobs are being lost in places where retailers are the largest employers in the area.\u201d Challenger described the losses as one of the most dramatic changes in the jobs market the US had witnessed since manufacturing was rocked by outsourcing and automation. Hartmann said there were some similarities with the hollowing out of manufacturing. \u201cWomen lost jobs in manufacturing first. They had the easiest jobs to ship abroad \u2013 clothing, textiles \u2013 and the men had the jobs that did eventually get shipped abroad but were more difficult to move, like cars, with big transportation costs.\u201d She pointed out that women are still the majority recipients of the trade assistance adjustment act \u2013 benefits that are given to US workers for retraining if they lose their employment because of international trade. But she said other factors were also at play. The recovery of \u201cconsumer durable\u201d sales \u2013 which are sales of big ticket items such as cars and home appliances \u2013 have bounced back and men hold more of the retail jobs in those sectors. \u201cWhen you have a long, slow recovery most people have put off renewing their washing machine, their fridge, their car and now they are feeling that they can start those purchases again. And it seems like they want to see those goods at the store. And those stores offer services, taking away old appliances, installing the new one. Less of those orders are being done online. And there have always been more men in those sectors,\u201d she said. The Amazon effect too is hurting women more than men. Alongside store closures in non-durable goods \u2013 food and clothing for example \u2013 retailers are experimenting with ways to remove checkout positions, jobs where women dominate. The numbers now are \u201cnoisy\u201d; the new shape of retail is still in flux and positions created by online retailing are not always categorized as retail in the government jobs figures. But the trend so far looks worrying for women. \u201cIt\u2019s a stunning thing to show women have lost more than 100,000 jobs over the year and men have gained almost as many. It does look like coal in the stocking for Christmas for many women workers,\u201d said Hartmann. \u2022 Follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk, or sign up to the daily Business Today email here.",

                "bodyText":"State-of the-art electric taxis that London\u2019s transport authorities hope will replace diesel black cabs have yet to enter service on the streets of the capital \u2013 because the meter does not work. Only one zero-emission taxi has so far been licensed in the capital with none yet to carry a paying passenger \u2013 two weeks after rules came into force banning any other new black cabs. From the start of 2018 London has only permitted zero-emission capable vehicles to join its fleet of 23,000 cabs. The only approved model so far is the London Electric Vehicle Company\u2019s TX eCity. However, no electric TXs are yet in commercial operation, despite lavish praise for the new taxi from test drivers and great hopes invested in its potential to reduce air pollution. Several hundred of the British-built vehicles have been ordered, according to the Coventry-based, Chinese-owned manufacturer. However, the taxis will not be delivered to drivers for several weeks while the meter glitch is resolved with LEVC\u2019s supplier. The electric vehicle gives out a regular pulse to tell how far it has travelled. A spokesman said: \u201cThe signal from the vehicles and the meters are not lining up and we are working on a solution to fix that issue. We\u2019re working to get an appropriate converter to get the vehicles licensed by [Transport for London] and over to customers.\u201d Take-up of the TX eCity has proved slow. Drivers have called on the government and TfL to make it more attractive to buy the taxi, which costs about \u00a310,000 more than diesel models, although running costs are substantially lower. Concerns over sufficient charging points, as well as a tax change that means an extra \u00a31,550 excise duty is paid by early adopters, are seen as a deterrent. Steve McNamara, general secretary of the Licensed Taxi Drivers\u2019 Association, said the TX is \u201ca fantastic vehicle. It is state of the art. We\u2019d have gone from a 1950s Ford Anglia to a Tesla overnight with this. And we could be leading the charge in persuading the rest of London to be electric, clean and green.\u201d However, he added: \u201cAt the moment people are very hesitant. We\u2019ve got to pay \u00a312k more for a vehicle that we don\u2019t know the reliability or durability of, at a time when the market is being squeezed by that company [Uber].\u201d The taxi costs \u00a355,600, after a \u00a37,500 electric vehicle grant, or can be leased for five years at \u00a3177 a week, around \u00a310 more than diesel models \u2013 although LEVC says that drivers would save up to \u00a3100 per week on fuel. A luxury car tax introduced in 2017 means buyers face a \u00a3310 annual increase in road tax for five years. Although the chancellor has since granted taxis an exemption, it will only take effect for purchases made from April 2019. McNamara added: \u201cThe lack of charging infrastructure is a concern. There are still nowhere near the number of rapid charge points that we need in central London.\u201d The back-up of a petrol engine extends the taxi\u2019s range to 377 miles, more than diesel, but drivers may not be able to complete a shift and return journey home on the battery\u2019s 80 mile range without a recharge.
