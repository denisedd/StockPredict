The department store saw its share price fall 20% after it announced a steep drop in December sales. Marks &amp; Spencer will tell all this week, but a better than expected performance \u00e2\u20ac\u201c which is possible following improved reviews for its women\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s clothing \u00e2\u20ac\u201c won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t disguise a shop empire in decline. M&amp;S bosses are still planning to close 30 stores, among them prominent outlets in Portsmouth, Slough, Warrington, Wokingham and Worksop.</p> <p>This trend poses a huge problem for town councils and the government, and yet there remains a head-in-the-sand attitude that could condemn hundreds of towns to a long slow death.</p> <p>If profit margins \u00e2\u20ac\u201c or profits of any kind \u00e2\u20ac\u201c are in jeopardy, then the value of commercial town centre land becomes a fraction of what it once was. So rents will need to come down, and business rates \u00e2\u20ac\u201c which account for \u00c2\u00a327bn of government income \u00e2\u20ac\u201c will have to fall.</p> <p>Former prime minister David Cameron acknowledged the danger when he commissioned the Portas review of Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s high streets in 2011. Mary Portas, known as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/2011/dec/11/observer-profile-mary-portas\" title=\"\">the queen of shops</a> following her popular retail-makeover TV programmes, was deeply concerned that some 25,000 stores had closed since the turn of the century.</p> <p>At the time she said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Many [high streets] are sickly, others are on the critical list and some now are dead. They have reached a crisis point. Unless urgent action is taken much of Britain will lose, irretrievably, something that is fundamental to our&#xa0;society.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd</p> <p>But the Portas review and the recommendations that it spawned were based on an approach that deemed shops to be the heart of a town. Bring back the shops with a mixture of tax cuts and a spruced-up environment, went the argument, and the town should be saved.</p> <p>Town councillors, landlords and HMRC tax collectors would be thrilled if that were true. The hundreds of millions of pounds spent tarting up dilapidated shops and watering hanging baskets wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have been wasted.</p> <p>Unfortunately, a town\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s success is really based on something else: jobs, access to amenities and transport links.</p> <p>Contrast Newbury and Coventry. Newbury spent millions giving its high street a facelift and tackling parking problems. The aim was to keep shoppers from heading to nearby Reading and Swindon (or, more likely, the brand-tastic retail phenomenon that is Bicester Village).</p> <p>Yet the town thrives more because of its transport links to London than the council\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s spending, however much the townspeople appreciate the sensitive upgrade. As with so many commuter towns, a reliable train service is the key to prosperity; the shops follow.</p> <p>Coventry has done things the right way around. It saw that its newly thriving university presented the city with an opportunity. Rather than have students based on a campus near the outskirts, it invited expansion on the city\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s central square, knocking down its own worn-out buildings to make way for new university towers. Students are a shock to any town not used to them, but they bring employment and spending that generates private-sector investment, including revamped shops \u00e2\u20ac\u201c saving council cash.</p> <p>Bradford has pinned its hopes on the new Westfield Broadway shopping centre, when the magnificent arcades in Leeds town centre are only a stone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s throw away. Other councils have borrowed vast sums to spend on ageing retail parks in the forlorn hope that they can maintain or even increase their value.</p> <p>Andrew Carter, from the thinktank Centre for Cities, said when the Broadway opened that shopping could not save any city, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153even those cities which have a really thriving, bustling retail offer like Manchester, Leeds or&#xa0;London\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd.</p> <p>Retailing is not the draw that councillors believe it to be. Employment, cinemas, parks, libraries and swimming pools are a better bet. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s these things that draw people in \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and then they go to shop, says Carter.</p> <p>An attractive town or city needs to invite people with safe streets (those that demote cars and accommodate cycle lanes) and offer space for the things people want \u00e2\u20ac\u201c cultural events, markets or new parks. This is only possible when the value of land declines, making it available for a wider range of activities. It shouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t need cities to be destroyed, like Detroit, for them to reinvent themselves. Yet that might be how it happens.</p>",

Next was one of the first fashion retailers to reveal that its festive cheer had all been online, where sales rose 13.6%. Its high-street stores suffered a 6.1% slump. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a trend seen by all the major retail chains in recent years that appears to be accelerating \u00e2\u20ac\u201c especially when \u00e2\u20ac\u0153smart speakers\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd such as the Amazon Echo were among the must-have presents under the tree. The Echo and its rival Google Home can be purchased in major stores, but it is almost counterintuitive to buy a gadget from a shop when that gadget is designed to help consumers avoid buying any goods or services from a bricks-and-mortar business. Debenhams was among the worst-hit chains. The department store saw its share price fall 20% after it announced a steep drop in December sales. Marks &amp; Spencer will tell all this week, but a better than expected performance \u00e2\u20ac\u201c which is possible following improved reviews for its women\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s clothing \u00e2\u20ac\u201c won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t disguise a shop empire in decline. M&amp;S bosses are still planning to close 30 stores, among them prominent outlets in Portsmouth, Slough, Warrington, Wokingham and Worksop. This trend poses a huge problem for town councils and the government, and yet there remains a head-in-the-sand attitude that could condemn hundreds of towns to a long slow death. If profit margins \u00e2\u20ac\u201c or profits of any kind \u00e2\u20ac\u201c are in jeopardy, then the value of commercial town centre land becomes a fraction of what it once was. So rents will need to come down, and business rates \u00e2\u20ac\u201c which account for \u00c2\u00a327bn of government income \u00e2\u20ac\u201c will have to fall. Former prime minister David Cameron acknowledged the danger when he commissioned the Portas review of Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s high streets in 2011. Mary Portas, known as the queen of shops following her popular retail-makeover TV programmes, was deeply concerned that some 25,000 stores had closed since the turn of the century. At the time she said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Many [high streets] are sickly, others are on the critical list and some now are dead. They have reached a crisis point. Unless urgent action is taken much of Britain will lose, irretrievably, something that is fundamental to our society.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd But the Portas review and the recommendations that it spawned were based on an approach that deemed shops to be the heart of a town. Bring back the shops with a mixture of tax cuts and a spruced-up environment, went the argument, and the town should be saved. Town councillors, landlords and HMRC tax collectors would be thrilled if that were true. The hundreds of millions of pounds spent tarting up dilapidated shops and watering hanging baskets wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have been wasted. Unfortunately, a town\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s success is really based on something else: jobs, access to amenities and transport links. Contrast Newbury and Coventry. Newbury spent millions giving its high street a facelift and tackling parking problems. The aim was to keep shoppers from heading to nearby Reading and Swindon (or, more likely, the brand-tastic retail phenomenon that is Bicester Village). Yet the town thrives more because of its transport links to London than the council\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s spending, however much the townspeople appreciate the sensitive upgrade. As with so many commuter towns, a reliable train service is the key to prosperity; the shops follow. Coventry has done things the right way around. It saw that its newly thriving university presented the city with an opportunity. Rather than have students based on a campus near the outskirts, it invited expansion on the city\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s central square, knocking down its own worn-out buildings to make way for new university towers. Students are a shock to any town not used to them, but they bring employment and spending that generates private-sector investment, including revamped shops \u00e2\u20ac\u201c saving council cash. Bradford has pinned its hopes on the new Westfield Broadway shopping centre, when the magnificent arcades in Leeds town centre are only a stone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s throw away. Other councils have borrowed vast sums to spend on ageing retail parks in the forlorn hope that they can maintain or even increase their value. Andrew Carter, from the thinktank Centre for Cities, said when the Broadway opened that shopping could not save any city, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153even those cities which have a really thriving, bustling retail offer like Manchester, Leeds or London\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Retailing is not the draw that councillors believe it to be. Employment, cinemas, parks, libraries and swimming pools are a better bet. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s these things that draw people in \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and then they go to shop, says Carter. An attractive town or city needs to invite people with safe streets (those that demote cars and accommodate cycle lanes) and offer space for the things people want \u00e2\u20ac\u201c cultural events, markets or new parks. This is only possible when the value of land declines, making it available for a wider range of activities. It shouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t need cities to be destroyed, like Detroit, for them to reinvent themselves. Yet that might be how it happens.",

                "bodyText":"It is China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s web giant and has a string of high-profile investments spanning Snapchat, Spotify, Tesla and Hollywood film and TV. It is a sprawling corporate giant that has recently overtaken Facebook to become the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fifth most valuable listed company \u00e2\u20ac\u201c but few, in the west at least, will have heard of Tencent, even though it is worth half a trillion dollars and rising. China is the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s most populous digital market and the protection afforded by state censorship through the so-called great firewall \u00e2\u20ac\u201c which has meant no competition from Facebook, Google, Twitter and Netflix \u00e2\u20ac\u201c has helped Tencent flourish since it launched nearly two decades ago in Shenzhen. But in the last year the shares have been supercharged \u00e2\u20ac\u201c climbing from less than HK$200 (\u00c2\u00a318) at the beginning of 2017 to HK$442 now \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and the value of the company has soared. There are three cornerstones of Tencent\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s business \u00e2\u20ac\u201c its messaging app WeChat; the biggest mobile gaming franchises in the world; and an ecosystem built around its 1 billion users that apes many of the services offered by the Silicon Valley firms that do not operate in China. The company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Netflix-style Tencent Video service \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the biggest in China with exclusive content including NFL games and HBO series such as Game of Thrones \u00e2\u20ac\u201c more than doubled in size in the last year, attracting more than 40 million paying subscribers. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153They have a relationship of mutual benefit with the Chinese state,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd says Jamie McEwan, an analyst at Enders. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153They have been allowed to grow and massively diversify their businesses without the level of scrutiny or competition you might see in western countries.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Late last year, Tencent became the first Chinese firm to pass the $500bn stock market valuation mark, supplanting Facebook as the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fifth biggest firm, a bittersweet moment for company co-founder Ma Huateng, 46, also known as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Pony\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Ma. In 2014, Tencent had been on the brink of buying What\u00e2\u20ac\u2122sApp, which would have made it a global power player overnight. The company was close to a deal when talks had to be delayed so that Ma could undergo back surgery. A panicked Mark Zuckerberg got wind of the move and swooped, tabling an enormous $19bn rival bid \u00e2\u20ac\u201c by far Facebook\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest deal and more than twice the offer made by Tencent \u00e2\u20ac\u201c to see off the threat. Thwarted but undeterred, late last year Ma took a 12% holding in Snapchat (he had made a small investment in 2013) in a busy year that also included buying 5% of Elon Musk\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s electric car firm Tesla and swapping minority stakes in its music streaming business with Spotify. Tencent Music, which dwarfs efforts by Apple and Spotify in China, is expected to make a $10bn stock market listing this year. Tencent also cranked up its domination of mobile gaming, handing over $8.6bn for the Finnish company Supercell, maker of two of the biggest games in the world, Clash of Clans and Clash Royale. It also owns the Los Angeles game-maker Riot, behind the huge League of Legends franchise, and has stakes in Gears of War maker Epic and Activision Blizzard, home to Call of Duty, World of Warcraft and Candy Crush Saga. Tencent also owns the most profitable game in the world, Honour of Kings, which makes about $1bn a quarter and has 200 million monthly players. It has proved so addictive in games-mad China that the government warned Tencent in an article in the state-owned People\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Daily last year saying it was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153poison\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153drug\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd that harms kids. The risk of a government crackdown on one (or more) of Tencent\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s golden geese \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the company relies on gaming for more than 40% of total revenues \u00e2\u20ac\u201c spurred jittery investors to wipe almost $18bn off its stock market value. Tencent swiftly introduced one-hour time limits for under-12s and two hours for 12- to 18-year-olds. Analysts estimate that Tencent digital services are used by more than two-thirds of the Chinese population. Chinese users collectively spend 1.7bn hours a day on the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s apps.

The WeChat eco-system is so broad it is almost like rolling most of the apps on a typical western user\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s mobile phone into one. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It is compared to What\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s App or Facebook messenger but it is not really,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd says Xiaofeng Wang, a Singapore-based analyst with Forrester. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It has payment systems, smart city offerings such as the ability to schedule appointments at a bank, a doctor, pay traffic fines or make visa applications and e-commerce.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Tencent\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ambition to be an essential part of digital daily life means it holds a dizzyingly diverse range of interests including in Didi, China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s answer to Uber, the nation\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s second biggest e-tailer JD.com and Hike, a messaging service popular in India.

Klaus Schwab, the founder and executive chairman of the WEF, gave a thinly veiled warning to Trump at his pre-meeting press conference, arguing \u00e2\u20ac\u0153no individual alone can solve the issues on the global agenda\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. He said the world was at an inflection point where there was a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153real danger of a collapse of our global systems\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. That may be no bad thing for Trump, who has shown little love for global institutions. His keynote address just before the close of the meeting on Friday will be unmissable. The booming world economy Almost 10 years on from the financial crisis, and the global economy has got its mojo back. The International Monetary Fund will deliver its latest world economic outlook update on Monday from Davos, where there are sure to be questions about the sustainability of the current upswing. The IMF\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s managing director, Christine Lagarde, will deliver the update and speak on several other panels throughout the week. The prospect of rising inflation and the removal of economic stimulus by central banks will be sure to feature prominently, while the theme of the conference \u00e2\u20ac\u201c creating a shared future \u00e2\u20ac\u201c will raise the issues of wealth and growing income inequality. The rise of the robots The increasing use of artificial intelligence, robotics and the automation of jobs has been a repeating theme at Davos, and this year is no different. The impact of AI will be one of the forum\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s major events, with a one-to-one interview to be held between Schwab and the chief executive of Google, Sundar Pichai. The \u00e2\u20ac\u0153fourth industrial revolution\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd will be a key theme once more, with a focus on how the loss of millions of jobs could undermine social cohesion. The way states respond to governing and taxing technologies and borderless business will be high on the agenda. Brexit sideshow Although unlikely to be a major theme at Davos this year, the annual summit will present UK ministers with an opportunity to rub shoulders with European leaders just before they pile into more substantive talks on trade later this year. Theresa May and Philip Hammond will be in attendance, while representatives from all 28 EU member states will also be heading to Davos, including the head of the European commission, Jean-Claude Juncker, and the French president Emmanuel Macron. Labour\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, will be making his first visit to Davos, planning to use the event as an opportunity to explain why the rules of the global economy need rewriting. May, on the other hand, will be expected to explain how Britain still matters on the global stage as it quits the EU. Climate-change risks to the fore Trump moved quickly to pull the US out of the Paris climate accords in one of his first acts as president last year. At Davos, where the environment is always among the most important issues up for debate, this won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have gone down well. The former US vice-president Al Gore is attending and will speak on several panels, including one about how extreme weather events are proving more devastating and expensive. The WEF\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s global risks perception survey, released last week, cited climate change-related issues as the top problems facing the world, while it also issued a thinly veiled warning to the US president that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153nation-state unilateralism\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd will make it harder to combat change and ecological damage. Harvey Weinstein fallout comes into focus In the wake of the Harvey Weinstein sex abuse scandal, gender equality and issues such as bullying and harassment in the workplace will be in sharp focus at Davos this year. Business leaders have often talked about encouraging diversity in the past, although are also accused of having made very little headway. Women will only account for 21% of all of the participants this year. At least three sessions will directly tackle the problems facing women at work, including one with the Microsoft executive Peggy Johnson and Canadian minister for the status of women, Maryam Monsef, titled \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Gender, power and stemming sexual harassment\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Helping the developing world More than a third of participants come from developing or emerging economies, while the Indian prime minister, Narendra Modi, will address the opening plenary. Humanitarian crises are on the agenda, with the displacement of hundreds of thousands of Rohingya refugees out of Myanmar likely to feature prominently, as the forum considers the outlook for 2018. The actor Cate Blanchett, who alongside Elton John has won a prize designated for artists who best represent the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153spirit of Davos\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, will speak to raise awareness about the refugee crisis. Malala Yousafzai, the Pakistani student who fights for education and women\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rights, will also speak about the importance of education and equal opportunities.",

The US currency has been under pressure on worries that the Trump tax cuts would increase the already hefty US national debt. And the dollar has become less attractive as other central banks begin edging up interest rates and gradually removing their long standing stimulus programmes.</p> <p>And despite a resolution to the government shutdown, the problem has only been postponed until early next month. Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at IG, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Renewed dollar weakness is the revival of yet another familiar friend from 2017. Post-shutdown euphoria has been replaced by a weary acceptance that we will probably have to do this all over again in just over two weeks. Why buy the greenback, when so many other economies can show solid growth without the government disruption so prevalent in the US at the moment?</p> </blockquote> <p>So with the stronger pound, the FTSE 100 came off its best levels.

Uncertainty about possible Eurozone reform, Italian elections and the success of the German coalition negotiations clearly take a backseat to improved economic factors.</p> <p>Over the past few months, consumer confidence improved most notably because of a much more positive view on the general economic situation, modest improvements in assessments of the financial situation and increased amounts of current and expected major purchases. This indicates that optimism and stronger consumption are going hand in hand, spurring the household consumption component of GDP growth. While unemployment expectations have become slightly less favourable over the last months of 2017, this is actually at odds with businesses indicating that hiring expectations remain very high.</p> <p>With such a favourable outlook, it could well be that the record for consumer confidence could be breached a few more times in 2018.

                "bodyText":"Time for a quick recap of the main events from the first day of Davos: Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau has challenged business leaders and politicians to end gender inequality and tackle unacceptable and systemic sexual harassment. You can watch a clip here. Trudeau also announced that the ten members of the trans-pacific partnership have agreed to extend their agreement. Oxfam\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Winnie Byanyima has also hailed campaigners against sexual harrassment, saying they have helped people worldwide. Davos also heard that parents need to teach their sons not to hit women, rather than simply how to hit baseballs. India\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Narendra Modi has warned that globalisation is under threat, and also cited climate change and terrorism as key threats to the global economy. The mood at Davos has been optimistic, although bank bosses have warned against complacency. An MIT economics professor has predicted that Facebook will barely exist in 20 years. Australian actor Cate Blanchett has criticised politicians for pandering to anti-refugee sentiment, instead of helping the millions of people displaced worldwide. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s probably all for tonight. Thanks for reading and commenting. GW A positive start following news that the US government shutdown had been resolved, for the moment at least, soon faded, leaving European markets a mixed bag by the close. Sterling rose above $1.40 to a new post-Brexit vote high, partly due to hopes that a successful trade deal can be negotiated, but also thanks to continuing weakness in the dollar. The US currency has been under pressure on worries that the Trump tax cuts would increase the already hefty US national debt. And the dollar has become less attractive as other central banks begin edging up interest rates and gradually removing their long standing stimulus programmes. And despite a resolution to the government shutdown, the problem has only been postponed until early next month. Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at IG, said: Renewed dollar weakness is the revival of yet another familiar friend from 2017. Post-shutdown euphoria has been replaced by a weary acceptance that we will probably have to do this all over again in just over two weeks. Why buy the greenback, when so many other economies can show solid growth without the government disruption so prevalent in the US at the moment? So with the stronger pound, the FTSE 100 came off its best levels. But Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax hovered around record levels, following upbeat consumer confidence figures and signs that a coalition government could be moving closer. In the US, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fluctuated between positive and negative, but Nasdaq was lifted by the positive Netflix update. The final scores in Europe showed: The FTSE 100 finished up 16.39 points or 0.21% at 7731.83 Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax rose 0.71% to 13,559.60 France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac closed down 0.12% at 5535.26 Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB fell 0.22% to 23,836.60 Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ibex ended up 0.24% at 10,609.5 In Greece, the Athens market added 1.62% to 872.00 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 28 points or 0.11%. NF Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a video clip of Justin Trudeau laying down the law on sexual harassment: Justin Trudeau\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s speech has caused quite a stir, with its trenchant criticism of greedy, uncaring businesses and gender inequality. Adam Parsons of the BBC thinks it was a punchy speech: John Stackhouse of Royal Bank of Canada says Trudeau is shaking up the idea of what \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcDavos Man\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 acts like: Ian Bremmer says Trudeau showed how gender equality is an important economic issue: But Jamie Drummond of campaigning group One isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t convinced Trudeau will deliver: Justin Trudeau also made an important point about trade. He tells Davos that Canada is trying to convince U.S. President Donald Trump that the NAFTA trade agreement was in the interest of the United States as well as other countries. Trudeau says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re working very hard to make sure that our neighbour to the south recognizes how good NAFTA is and that it has benefited not just our economy but his economy and the world economy,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Justin Trudeau moves onto another vital issue - campaigns such as #MeToo and Time\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Up. The Canadian PM declares: These movements show us we must have a critical discussion on women\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rights, equality and the power dynamics of gender. Sexual harassment in business and in government is a systemic problem and it is unacceptable. As leaders, we must recognise and act to truly show that time is up. Justin Trudeau now urges business chiefs at Davos to help fight inequality by hiring, promoting and retaining more women. Getting more women into the workforce isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t just the right thing to do, or the nice thing to do, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the smart thing to do, he tells the World Economic Forum, Studies show it can provide a significant economic boost. Firms need to address gender pay, and he warns that many firms aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t doing as well as they think. Just paying men and women the same doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t go far enough, unless you also tackle the barriers faced by female workers. Women do more part-time work, and more unpaid work than men. Parental leave and childcare policies must be reexamined, Trudeau tells WEF. Firms should implement policies to improve gender balance. He also reminds us that he introduced Canada\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s first gender-balanced cabinet, and the performance of those female ministers has proved the naysayers wrong. Justin Trudeau has warned that businesses and politicians are failing to help their workers and citizens in today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u0153rapidly changing world\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. People have been taken advantage of, losing their jobs, the Canadian PM warns: Governments and corporations, we haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t done enough to address this. He also blasts corporate greed, saying: Too many corporations have single-mindedly put the pursuit of profit ahead of the well-being of workers. The gap between the rich and the poor is staggering, Trudeau points out, adding All the while, companies avoid taxes and boast record profits with one hand while slashing benefits with the other. Our priority must be the people who are struggling the most, and who will never get to Davos, Trudeau says. And he warns that if we operate on the basis of business as usual, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the system will break down and we will all fail.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau is now speaking to Davos. He begins by thanking the seven all-female co-chairs for organising this year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s WEF. He then makes an important announcement: The 10 remaining members of the Trans-Pacific Partnership have concluded a new agreement that will maintain their alliance. The agreement reached today in Tokyo is the right deal, Trudeau insists. It will create growth, prosperity, and middle class jobs in Canada today and for generations. This is significant, as Donald Trump pulled the US out of the TPP. In an hour\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time, Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau will give a special address to the World Economic Forum. As a liberal, feminist leader, Trudeau is a Davos favourite. But that shouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t mean he gets a free pass. Jamie Drummond, executive director of the development group One, says that Trudeau isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t actually delivering on pledges to make the world a better place. As Drummond puts it: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s so exasperating that prime minister Justin Trudeau will make another great speech today while the facts point in a shocking direction. Smart aid rates under Trudeau are lower than under his conservative predecessor Stephen Harper, the money he loudly promised would be new to fight aids, TB and malaria was in fact not new, and his feminist foreign policy is not backed by new funds. This can and must change now. Not in 2020, or some vague theoretical far-off point after the next election. Drummond urges WEF delegates to put Trudeau under pressure to deliver. This week in Davos he must be asked when and by specifically how much he will increase funding for girls education and women\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economic empowerment; and please, he must do it this year. If we want him be a great leader on these issues, we must withhold praise until we see the quality of his action not just his delightful adverbs. Trust Trudeau - but verify. And if Davos doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t pressure leaders like Trudeau to be the best they can be, or hold them accountable, this gathering is a self-defeating backslapping waste of time the world doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd As we reported this morning, Drummond is threatening not to come back to Davos unless this annual shindig starts delivering the goods. The Greek prime minister Alexis Tsipras is among the world leaders who have lined up to get to Davos, reports Helena Smith from Athens: Tsipras, who arrived only hours after Athens wrapped up a third bailout compliance review \u00e2\u20ac\u201c edging ever closer to ending dependence on international bailout loans when the programme expires this summer - is meeting investors also gathered in Davos. The leftist\u00e2\u20ac\u201cled government, in an about\u00e2\u20ac\u201cturn of its previous antagonism, is now keen to attract foreign capital as it prepares the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s return to capital markets. This afternoon\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meeting is much in the vein of luring investors to fund projects in Greece with an eye to slashing unemployment \u00e2\u20ac\u201c at 21% still the highest in the EU and by far the nation\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest social ill. Monday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s eurogroup meeting saw euro area finance ministers agreeing to disburse \u00e2\u201a\u00ac6.7bn to the debt -stricken nation in two instalments. The first chunk of \u00e2\u201a\u00ac5.7bn will be released in February, once outstanding reforms are implemented, to cover debt servicing needs, arrears and creation of a cash buffer that will support Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s return to markets. Talks on debt relief are expected to begin soon \u00e2\u20ac\u201c along with a fourth compliance review which included 88 creditor-mandates reforms being taken by June. Sounding a note of optimism, EU Financial Affairs Commissioner Pierre Moscovici said the single currency bloc should prepare for \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a successful conclusion, which means Greece being back as a normal member of the eurozone and the final signal \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the end of the Greek crisis.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd After the better than expected German consumer confidence figures, there is more positive news from Europe. Eurozone consumer confidence rose from 0.5 points in December to 1.3 points in January, according to the European Commission. This was well above forecasts of a figure of 0.6. In the wide European Union, confidence jumped 1 point to 0.4 points. ING economist Bert Colijn said: With inflation still low, job growth surprising on the upside, house prices increasing and growth forecasts adjusted upwards, there is a lot to like for consumers and that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s evident. The current mood among consumers is nothing short of ecstatic and current levels of confidence are generally associated with further acceleration in household consumption growth. Uncertainty about possible Eurozone reform, Italian elections and the success of the German coalition negotiations clearly take a backseat to improved economic factors. Over the past few months, consumer confidence improved most notably because of a much more positive view on the general economic situation, modest improvements in assessments of the financial situation and increased amounts of current and expected major purchases. This indicates that optimism and stronger consumption are going hand in hand, spurring the household consumption component of GDP growth. While unemployment expectations have become slightly less favourable over the last months of 2017, this is actually at odds with businesses indicating that hiring expectations remain very high. With such a favourable outlook, it could well be that the record for consumer confidence could be breached a few more times in 2018. This, in turn, confirms the rosy short-term picture for Eurozone growth. NF Dacher Keltner, Professor of Psychology from the University of California, is also on the sexual harassment panel alongside Winnie Byanyima. He says: Men tend to take more risks, they tend to be a lot more aggressive, and they tend to sexualise thing. So if you give a man power, those default tendencies will be expressed. Women tend to be more collaborative, co-operative, empathetic. You give them power, studies show it will amplify those pro-social tendencies. Lisa Sherman, President and Chief Executive Officer of the Advertising Council, says parents can do more to help boys treat women with respect. You teach your son how to hit a baseball, how to hit a jump shot, how to hit the net. But we should really be talking to them about who not to hit, and why. Peggy Johnson, executive Vice-President for Business Development at Microsoft, says the younger generation are helping to force change. She explains that her daughter recently started her career, and told her that \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcwhen there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s an inappropriate joke at work, I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t laugh\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. I thought back and thought, when I was her age I always laughed, says Johnson. My daughter said to me that she\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d learned not to laugh at these jokes from me, but she actually learned it from me in my 50s, not my 20s. Winnie Byanyima, the executive director of Oxfam International, is speaking powerfully about sexual exploitation against women around the globe. All the women in the world should be grateful to American women for taking a stand, and saying \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Me Too\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, Byanyima says, referring to the campaign that spread around the globe after the Harvey Weinstein scandal. It has brought new attention to a problem that is deep. Women in the developing world are at the bottom of the supply chain of big business. Oxfam hears stories of their lives, Byanyima explains, such as hotel housekeepers. All of them told us that they had faced sexual harassment or knew someone who had faced sexual harassment. It goes on with impunity. Domestic workers globally suffer abuse, she continues, and some of them are like slaves in the homes where they work. Only a few countries have ratified a new convention for domestic workers. It is not an accident that women are abused sexually at work or at home. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s due to the social norms that are there to justify their economic exploitation. That is why it is so important to tackle economic inequality, as this will also help tackle violence against women. Byanyima says there are three ways to tackle this problem: Remove all the laws that discriminate against women in the economy Tackle the social norms that justify sexual exploitation. Businesses have an important role to play here - they can use their factories, supply chains, advertising. Unilever are doing it, so others can too. Bring women into every level of decision-making and leadership, so they can drive change. In the wake of the resolution to the US government shutdown, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was initially expected to open higher. But when trading began the Dow dipped 27 points or 0.1%, with investors moving on to worry about the impact of Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s move to impose steep import tariffs, including possible retaliation. South Korea and China both protested at the duties on washing machines and solar panels. The S&amp;P 500 however edged up 0.03% and the Nasdaq composite climbed 0.23%. The uncertainty has taken some of the shine off European shares, with the FTSE 100 now up just 0.11% and France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac virtually unchanged. Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax is now up 0.76%, off its best levels. NF David Autor, Ford Professor of Economics at MIT, has predicted that today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s giant tech companies - such as Facebook - will suffer the face of previous dominant companies. He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s on a panel asking \u00e2\u20ac\u02dccan we live with monopolies\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. Autor explains that we currently live in an environment of \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcwinner takes most\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 markets, where having a small edge over your competitor gives you a massive advantage. So firms like Amazon and Facebook are growing organically (people are on Facebook because their friends are on Facebook), but that doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t mean that this growth is healthy. Or sustainable, in the long run. We did have these monopolies in the past, Autor points out, citing the US railroads, and AT&amp;T which was broken up by regulators. Also, companies which appear indomitable can fade pretty fast, he says - and then makes a bold prediction: I would guess that Facebook will be almost non-existent 20 years from now. Autor is also critical of the US model where employees are not treated as stakeholders (unlike shareholders). This situation has created a level of inequality that has led to political upheaval, he says. Elsewhere in Davos, the head of the Red Cross has warned that fresh humanitarian crises could break out this year. Peter Maurer, president of the International Committee of the Red Cross, says there are a lot of fragile situations that could develop into \u00e2\u20ac\u0153full-fledged\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd conflicts (as we saw with the Rohingya crisis in 2017). Maurer says there are plenty of places on the brink of war, violence and disruption. He cites Southern Philippines (which is under martial law), Myanmar, Afghanistan, the Middle East, and large parts of Africa as places where the Red Cross sees fragility - but \u00e2\u20ac\u0153we don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know which one will blow up in our face\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. So what can Davos do about it? Top business leaders have the skills and resources to help businesses in those fragile areas, and help them tipping into conflict. Maurer also warns that humanitarian organisations need more money: In 2018 we face a big gap between the needs of people and the capacity of the international system as a whole to respond. The gap can only be bridged by more and better finance. Ultimately, Blanchett says, we must remember we are all citizens, and stand up for what we believe in. Cate Blanchett is close to tears, as she talks about one refugee family she met in Jordan. They had fled conflict with five of their children, being shot at by all sides. Eventually, the father had to choose between carrying his suitcases and carrying his children (he chose the children). No-one should be put in that position, she says. Q: Aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t politicians taking a hard line on refugees because they are reacting to the concerns of their populations? Cate Blanchett argues that they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re actually reacting to populist media and the news cycle. We are at a fork in the road, she says. We try to teach our children to be compassionate, to be tolerant, to accept diversity, to share. But all the structures that are around them are not doing the same, so it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s quite a schizophrenic world they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re living in. And taking a swing at populist politicians, she says she don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t understand how turning people in a boat back became an election winner. Australian actor Cate Blanchett is talking about the refugee crisis now (yesterday she was handed a WEF award for her work on this issue). She explains how she went backpacking through Europe in her youth, which opened her eyes to economic inequality. I was staying in youth hostels that were more like Turkish prisons, She explains, seeing people who didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have anywhere else to go Q: There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been a lot of criticism of Australia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s policy to refugees.... Blanchett says she was \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcbewildered\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 to see the generous, openhearted, multi-cultural Australia she grew up in \u00e2\u20ac\u0153flouting the UN humans rights convention\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd I was very distressed that Australia was reverting back to practices that made us a fortress again. This drove Blanchett to become a goodwill ambassador to UNHCR I think it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shameful. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s so much misinformation about refugees. They are forced to flee, and then they are vilified in the media. Blanchett says the misinformation about refugees is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153very distressing\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, and doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t connect with the actual people she has met. There are 65 million displaced people in the world, 22 million are refugees, half are women and children. But just 1% have been resettled in advanced developed economies. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the developing world that is shouldering the deep burden of refugees. She cites the Lebanon, where a quarter of the population are now refugees. Blanchett also criticises the way refugees are reported in the media: People are told this narrative that these people, who have so much to offer, are going to be a burden on us or become a terrorist threat. Q: But have some people in developing economies been encouraged to travel to countries such as Germany, because they hoped to be given asylum? Should we not talk about it, Blanchett replies rhetorically. The problem is not going to go away. These are not terrorists. These are innocent people, who want to return home. She\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also calling for more burden-sharing between countries, to help address the refugee crisis. The problem with all this optimism at Davos is that business leaders, economists and politicians have a nasty habit of missing impending disaster. WEF veterans point out that the mood is often particularly upbeat shortly before a crisis. Barclays CEO Jes Staley summed it up this morning, on the financial crisis session when he said Davos feels \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a little bit like 2006 when we were all talking whether we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve solved the riddle of economic crises.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The Carlyle Group David Rubenstein agreed, saying: Generally, when people are happy and confident, something wrong happens. Back with the UK public finances, and a Treasury spokesperson said: We have made great progress in reducing the deficit by three quarters since 2010, but government debt is still far too high. Our balanced approach to government spending is getting debt falling, while investing in key public services and keeping taxes low. And the Office for Budget Responsibility said: It appears that the underlying improvement in borrowing so far this year is a little faster than would be consistent with our November forecast. NF Christoph Franz, the chairman of Roche, agrees that spirits are high at Davos this year - and with good reason. Speaking to CNBC, Frans argues that \u00e2\u20ac\u02dchealthy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 economic growth is boosting optimism among top execs. Basically, I have been here for more than ten years, I share your perspective, there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a very positive mood right now among business leaders here in Davos, and I think the reason is, we see a growth perspective in, not only some specific countries, but on a global scale, and the growth is achieving numbers which we have seen only before 2007. So, the economy is taking up, and for the time being, it is growth which has been created by a lot of investment. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s manufacturers continue to be optimistic about business prospects and exports, but are increasingly worried about skills shortages. The CBI\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s latest industrial trends survey for the three months to January showed 27% of firms were more optimistic about the general business situation that three months ago, while 14% were less optimistic. The balance of +13% is up from -11% in the previous quarter. Growth in manufacturing output and domestic and export orders all picked up, compared with the previous three-month period, although the monthly order book figure showed a fall from +17 in December to +14 in January. And the number of firms saying a lack of skilled labour was likely to limit output over the next three months was the highest for more than four decades. Rain Newton-Smith, CBI chief economist, said: It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s good to see manufacturing going from strength-to-strength with growth up and the buoyant global economy boosting export orders. But the past depreciation in Sterling continues to leave its mark on firms\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 costs and margins. With expectations for factory gate price inflation at their highest in 30 years, the pressure on consumer prices looks set to persist. Capacity pressures are ramping up and skill shortages are a big concern, underlining the importance of establishing a future immigration system that provides companies with access to talent and labour. The building blocks of a new system that meets economic needs and public concerns must start with scrapping the net migration target, which has never been fit-for-purpose. NF Yup. Modi wraps up his speech by identifying three priorities: The world economy must be more inclusive Policymakers must remain committed to a rules-based world order Reforming the major institutions of the world, connected to politics, the economy and securtry He talks about the Indian soldiers who died in world wars in the 20th century, to help create \u00e2\u20ac\u0153peace and humanity\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. India can be a humanising and harmonising force in an uncertain world, Modi promises, citing Indian prayers and poetry which advocates a free and peaceful world. Together we can create a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcheaven of future\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, he promises, in a somewhat gushing conclusion. Alas, he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not taking any questions. On climate change, Modi says India is making big progress towards hitting its goals for renewable energy. Modi says India will achieve strong growth over the next few years. Kenneth Roth of Human Rights Watch suggests Modi isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t living up to the glowing ideals he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s preaching today: (remember, Modi was once banned from visiting the US following claims he had supported Hindu extremists during Hindu-Muslim riots. He was later cleared by the Indian Supreme Court). Modi is now encouraging businesses to invest in India, citing the hundreds of laws and regulations which have been stripped out to make te economy more competitive. Instead of red tape, we offer you a red carpet, he jokes. Democracy isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t just a political system, says Modi - it is a life view and a lifestyle. He cites India\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s proud democracy and diversity, declaring: For a society with diverse religions, cultures, languages, attires and cuisines, democracy is not just a political system but a way of living: Thirdly, the world is threatened by the rising attacks on globalisation, says Modi. We must accept that globalisation is slowly losing its lustre, he says. And he pits some of the blame on the institutions created after world war 2, such as the United Nations. Do the structures and action plans of these organisations match the aspirations and dreams of mankind, Modi asks rhetorically. Then he takes aim at protectionism, saying: Forces of protectionism are raising their heads against globalisation. They want to reverse its flow. The world risks new tariff and non-tariff barriers, he continues, cautioning that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153bilateral and multilateral trade negotiations have come to a kind of standstill\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. The second major threat is terrorism, Modi continues. He says there is an artificial distinction between \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcgood and bad\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 terrorism, and a worrying radicalism of young people. The world has moved from needs-based to greed-based consumption, says Modi seriously. This does not live up to the ideals of Gandhi, or the teaching of Buddha. Modi cites climate change as a major threat. Glaciers are melting, islands are disappearing under the sea, and in Davos we have the worst snow in 20 years, he says. And he criticises the leaders of advanced economies for not showing more solidarity Everyone talks about reducing climate emissions, but there are very few countries who back their words with their resources to help developing countries to adopt appropriate technology. Very few of them come forward to help. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s some instant reaction to Modi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s call for co-operation to build a better future, rather than descending into isolationism. Narendra Modi now turns to the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153fractures\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in the global economy, citing unemployment, inequality, lack of opportunities. Some important questions come to mind, which require answers, he says. Is our global order widening these fault lines, increasing these differences, and giving preference to isolationism over harmony and conflict over co-operation, he asks, adding: What paths can we follow, to eliminate rifts and differences. How can we realise the dream of a beautiful shared future. Modi is speaking in Hindi, incidentally, so the audience are getting a realtime translation. Today, data is the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest asset, Modi declares. We are accumulating mountains and mountains of data, he continues. There is now a race to control data, because it is believes that whoever is able to control the data can dominate the world. Narendra Modi takes the stage, to another round of applause. He begins with a history lesson. The last time an Indian PM was at Davos was in 1997, when H. D. Deve Gowda visited. Back then, India\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s GDP was $400bn - it is now six times larger. WEF\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s theme in 1997 was \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcbuilding the networked society\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. Today, it is not just a networked society. We are living in the world of big data, artificial intelligence and robots. Back in 1997, Modi continues the eurozone didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t exist, the Asian financial crisis wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t expected, and there was no sign that Brexit might happen. Very few people had heard of Osama Bin Laden, and Harry Potter was also an unknown name. Back then, Google didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t exist, a web search for Amazon would bring up a river or jungle, and tweeting was done by birds, Modi declares. Davos\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s founder, Klaus Schwab, is introducing Narendra Modi now. Globally we are moving to a multipolar, and multi-conceptual world, says Schwab. In a seemingly fractured world, India presents a bright image of optimism, he adds. It also presents an investment opportunity (something that business leaders at Davos will be interested in) There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a buzz on the floor of the World Economic Forum as India\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s prime minister Narendra Modi prepares to give the opening speech. Modi is a big draw - the main hall is filling up fast with delegates keen to hear his words. The speech should be streamed live here: Nariman Behravesh, chief economist at IHS Markit says the mood at Davos is very different this year than in 2017. He tells us: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It is a lot more optimistic and the optimism is broad based. Last year the Americans were upbeat but the Europeans were gloomy. A year ago the feeling was that politics was going to overwhelm economics but the opposite has happened. An improving economy may make populism less compelling\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Behravesh says that Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s arrival in the White House a year ago led to an increase in business confidence. Corporate America was not keen on Barack Obama, he says. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Business finally got a president it thought was business friendly and the reduction in regulation has been received well.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Business also likes the package of tax cuts Trump finally pushed through Congress at the end of 2017 and which are weighted in favour of the well off and corporations. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Our estimate is that the tax cuts will add 0.3 percentage points to growth in 2018, 2019 and 2020\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Behravesh says. There are two risks, he adds. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The US and global economy may be running too hot. We think unemployment in the US will go as low as 3.5%, which is well below estimates of full employment. The question is how soon wage inflation and price inflation picks up. If inflation surprises on the upside we could see the Federal Reserve and other central banks step on the brakes a lot harder. The stock market could take a hit and that would be bad.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The other risk is that Trump starts making good on his protectionist threats. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153So far his bark has been worse then his bite, Behravesh says. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153But I think China is going to come under a lot of pressure from the US this year. The US is very unhappy about the China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s unwillingness to toe the line on intellectual property.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Over in Germany, consumer confidence remains strong. The ZEW institute economic sentiment index came in at 20.4 points in January, up from 17.4 the previous month and better than the forecasts of a reading of 17.8. And this came amid uncertainty over the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s political future and before the weekend\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s agreement to take another step towards a coalition government. The index remains slightly below the long-term average of 23.7 points, but it is still a positive outcome. Meanwhile the current conditions index rose from 89.3 points o 95.2. ZEW president professor Achim Wambach said: The latest survey results reveal an optimistic outlook for the German economy in the first six months of 2018. With 95.2 out of 100 points, this is the most positive assessment of the current economic situation since the introduction of the survey in December 1991. Private consumption, which was the most important driver of economic growth in 2017, is likely to continue to stimulate growth in the coming six months according to the survey participants. The assessment of the global economic environment in Europe and the USA is also much more favourable than it was at the end of 2017. NF Despite the warnings from Davos, investors are pushing markets higher again this morning. There is renewed confidence following the IMF raising its growth forecasts on Monday (albeit not for the UK), as well as relief that the US government shutdown has been resolved, at least for another couple of weeks. Meanwhile there were no surprises from the Bank of Japan, which recently unnerved markets by reducing its monthly bond buying programme by $10bn. This time it left monetary policy unchanged. So the FTSE 100 is up 0.31%, France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac has climbed 0.11% and Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax is 0.86% better and at new highs. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said: It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s taken a while for the DAX to join in with the all-time high hitting performances of the FTSE and the Dow Jones seen in 2018. However, with German coalition talks steadily moving along, a stop-gap deal to end the US government shutdown, and a subsequent pullback from the euro against the dollar, the bourse seems ready to bulge, shooting up by 130 points to tease a 13600 record peak. In the US the Dow Jones Industrial Average, which jumped 142 points or 0.55% after the news of the impasse over the government shutdown had been resolved, is expected to open 84 points higher. Fiona Cincotta at City Index said: The FTSE bounced on the open this morning, following a record session in the US overnight. The Dow surged over 140 points, whilst the S&amp;P and the Nasdaq tagged on 0.8% and 1% respectively, all hitting unchartered territory. The rally took place after the Democrats and the Republicans passed the funding bill to end the US government shut down, 72 hours after it started. NF Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s budget deficit came in much better than expected, giving a boost to chancellor Philip Hammond. Thanks to an unusually large credit from the European Union and the strongest VAT receipts on record, public sector net borrowing fell from \u00c2\u00a38.25bn in November to \u00c2\u00a32.6bn last month. This was well below analyst forecasts of a figure of around \u00c2\u00a35bn. There was a \u00c2\u00a31.2bn credit from the EU related to the region\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s smaller than expected overall budget and improved economic performance. With the UK economy holding up despite Brexit vote fears, VAT receipts rose by an annual 4.8% to a record \u00c2\u00a312.3bn. Total public borrowing since last April is now \u00c2\u00a350bn, 12% less than in the same period in 2016 and leaving Hammond on track to meet his full year target of \u00c2\u00a349.9bn by the end of March. NF More highlights from the Davos talk about financial risks: Anne Richards, chief executive of M&amp;G Investments, fears that a devastating IT crash could cause the next financial crisis. She tells an audience in Davos that policymakers risk ignoring the threat posed by investors\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 reliance on technology, and the damage that could be caused if key systems go down. Richards says she doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t buy the argument that a geopolitical crisis will bring the bull market crashing down. After all, markets handle geopolitical events all the time. Instead, she fears that the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153systemic risk\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd posed by new technology, and the cloud, could provoke an event that changes the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153animal spirits\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in the markets today. Richards warns: We all have businesses that are absolutely reliant on a very small number of people who provide the pipes that we put our business though. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a technology thing out there that we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re all somewhat blind to. It would be interesting to think how markets would react if none of us could trade for one, or two or three days\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd David Rubenstein, co-executive chairman of The Carlyle Group, is also on the panel. He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s more worried about political threats - predicting that if there is a geopolitical crisis, markets will be hurt and firms will pull back from capital investment. This year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s World Economic Forum is being led by an all-female group of co-chairs. They\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re giving a press conference now: Erna Solberg, prime minister of Norway, is speaking now - calling for a new crackdown on illegal finance and corruption. Solberg says this is fuelling terrorism and security threats, and making it harder for emerging economies to develop their economies. She suggests a MeToo campaign to fight corruption is needed: We need to see who is taking money, who is bribing others, and show that this is unacceptable in all our societies. Solberg\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s other priority is gender equality -- she warns that women are still treated unfairly in many economies. The barriers to women\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s participation [in the labour market] is still large in many societies - it doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t make sense economically or politically. Can Emmanuel Macron really succeed where his predecessors failed, and reform the French economy? Tidjane Thiam, the boss of Credit Suisse, says the answer is a resounding yes. Speaking on a panel about \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcglobal markets in a fractured world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, Thaim says Macron\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s programme of labour market reforms would have led to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153certain electoral defeat\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd 20 years ago - not last year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s triumph against Marine Le Pen. As Thiam puts it: Macron only got elected because the French public, the French nation, decided to change. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s how it works in a democracy. Political scientist Ian Bremmer agrees that market sentiment and political reality have got out of whack.... The usual high security measures are in place in Davos this morning. Armed guards prevent any non-delegates getting into WEF; even if you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re accredited, you have to negotiate airport-style security before you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re actually allowed in. The snowdrifts have also provided a new reason to ban protests in Davos this week. Davos officials say \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the extremely tight space situation due to the enormous amount of new snow\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t leave any space for a rally.... UBS\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chairman, Axel Weber, has warned that sentiment in the market is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153too buoyant\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Speaking on CNBC this morning, Weber said there was a worrying gap between investor optimism and the actual state of the economy. Investors are taking risks, but I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re getting adequate compensation for those risks. At some time, if it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s got to stop it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s got to stop. He added that the markets could be in a more difficult position by the time of Davos 2019.... Justin Trudeau says he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be batting for middle-class Canadians in Davos this week. His speech this afternoon is also expected to cover corporate responsibility and the role of women in a changing world. Davos regular Jamie Drummond says he may not come back, unless this year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meeting makes real progress towards tackling inequality. Drummond is the executive director of the development group One, which he co-founded with the rock star Bono. In a blog, Drummond said he had been stung by the accusation that he had spent so long hobnobbing with the 1% that he was becoming a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Davos man.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u0153A feminist activist, and someone I deeply respect, recently commented that I was at risk of becoming that awful thing: \u00e2\u20ac\u02dca Davos Man\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. Definitions vary but this phrase generally refers to a male who goes to places like Davos and inhabits an elite, unaccountable bubble while determining the fates of those without access to it. The comment cut deep. It forced me to question any complicity I might have in a system I have tried so hard to change. So I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m putting my inner Davos Man on notice, and making this commitment: this will be my last World Economic Forum unless this one helps deliver on three crucial areas in the fight against extreme poverty and gender inequality. Those areas are the global education emergency; women\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economic empowerment; and ambitious financing to back Africa\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s huge youth boom.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Philip Jennings, head of the global union UNI, has been one of the strongest voices for labour at Davos for many a year but 2018 will be his last meeting before retiring in the summer. Speaking to the Guardian, Jennings said the current business model built on the principle of shareholder value was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153not fit for purpose\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and that the opportunity provided by the financial crisis of a decade ago to build a more inclusive economy has been squandered. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Donald Trump is Mr Shareholder value\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, Jennings said, adding: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153He is exhibit A of the fractured world\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Jennings said a test for the business leaders in Davos talking about the problems of global inequality was whether they recognised trade unions and collective bargaining at their firms. And he predicted a backlash against three of the new titans of the global economy: Amazon, Facebook and Google. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153These companies were once seen as angelic, seen as our saviours\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, Jennings said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153But the big three has such market influence and power that the world has to wake up and start thinking about the need for anti-trust action. One of the fractures in the global economy is the power of the new monopolies and the danger it represents\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. The huge snowfalls in Davos recently mean the ski resort is now facing a Level 5 avalanche risk - the highest rating. Some homes have reportedly been evacuated, due to fears that the snow is too unstable. There has already been big delays getting up the mountain (someone I met last night spent six hours crawling here from Zurich), leading to plenty of chuntering among delegates. Davos has had an early wake-up call. PR chief Richard Edelman\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s annual trust index shows that Americans have become much less trusting of politicians, business chiefs and the media over the last year. He says: No country saw steeper declines than the United States, with a 37-point aggregate drop in trust across all institutions. At the opposite end of the spectrum, China experienced a 27-point gain, more than any other country. The survey shows that people are more worried about the rise of disinformation -- and finding it hard to separate truth from \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcfake news\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 So, genuine voices of expertise are now regaining credibility. Edelman explains: Journalists have risen 12 points, and CEOs recorded a seven-percentage point gain, since 2017. Good morning from Davos! World leaders, business chiefs, trade unions, the heads of charities and NGOs, celebrities and the media are gathering in this small ski resort to discuss the state of the world, and how to improve it. This year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s WEF is taking place amid the biggest snowfalls in many years. This is already leading to inequality on the streets of Davos: workers are furiously shovelling drifts aside and driving snowploughs as the global elite queue bumper-to-bumper to reach the WEF congress centre and the exclusive hotels and converted shops where events are taking place. Last night, Pope Francis set the mood by issuing a stern warning not to remain silent in the face of economic inequality and injustice. In a message read to the Davos attendees, the Pope warned not to allow people to be used as cogs in a machine and then chucked aside. He declared: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153New actors are emerging, as well as new economic competition and regional trade agreements. Even the most recent technologies are transforming economic models and the globalized world itself, which, conditioned by private interests and an ambition for profit at all costs, seem to favour further fragmentation and individualism, rather than to facilitate approaches that are more inclusive,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Even Sir Elton John weighed in, describing inequality in the world today as \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcdisgraceful\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 (as we covered in last night\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s blog). Two world leaders will address Davos today, with different priorities. Narendra Modi, who gives the opening speech, is the first Indian prime minister to visit WEF in 20 years. He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s on a big push to attract more business to his country, billing India as a key growth engine for the global economy. India have sent a large delegation to Davos this year - many of whom found themselves caught up in the transport chaos yesterday. Canada\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Justin Trudeau is expected to pitch at business leaders. But his speech, this afternoon, may also cover weightier issues such as women\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s empowerment. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s loads of other stuff coming up too, including debates on the financial markets, capitalism, and sexual harassment. The agenda: 9.30am Davos (8.30am GMT): Opening press conference by the Davos co-chairs 9.45am Davos (8.45am GMT): Debate: Are we heading for a new financial crisis? 11.15am Davos (10.15am GMT): Indian PM Narendra Modi gives the opening plenary speech 2pm Davos (1pm GMT): Actor Cate Blanchett speaks about the global refugee crisis 3pm Davos (2pm GMT): Bollywood actor Shah Rukh Khan talks about women\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s empowerment in India. 3.30pm Davos (2.30pm GMT): Debate on gender, power and sexual harassment 5pm Davos (4pm GMT): Debate on capitalism: 5.30pm Davos (4.30pm GMT): Canadian PM Justin Trudeau gives a special address",

Sustainable development, health, human rights - these can never be renounced, and we have to spell them out and regulate them in a common manner.</p> <p>I hope private sector will come to our country to create jobs.. but I have to explain to people [globalisation] is good for them. Otherwise there will be nationalists, extremism. </p> <p>We need to establish a new global contract, unless everyone understands they have a part to play it won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t work.</p> <p>The new global contract has three duties: the right to invest, share and protect.</p> <p>[On investment} one area we are not doing enough in is education, we have 750m adults who do not have basic literacy skills, we have to invest in education, the education of girls in particular. If we don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t invest there will be not equality. It is important all the countries here commit to this [investment in education globally].</p> <p>The duty to share: there is a crisis of contemporary capitalism. It has become a capitalism of superstars, spreading of value added is not equitable. We have to establish mechanisms to share value added more equitably... We also need to speak about gender equality. In France we are launching initiatives [for more visibility], I welcome the commitments from Justin Trudeau.</p> <p>If we want to share value better, we need a more co-ordinated tax approach at a global level. There should not be a race to the bottom. We need a strategy that avoids the maximisation strategies of some companies. It is a moral issue.</p> <p>We need to renounce unbridled tax optimisation. Plus how can you have a tax on digital activities. We all want these big international companies in their country, but there is an unfair model [if they pay low taxes when national companies do].</p> <p>Disruption from digital businesses will destroy millions of jobs, and if those companies do not help finance retraining of people affected, how can I explain that [to those people]</p> <p>I am in favour of IMF being given mandate to survey whole financial system, especially those areas which escape regulation. Cryptocurrencies, shadow banking etc, are not being looked at by IMF, so we have to have a discussion.</p> <p>At what point are we going to stop innovation. To say artificial intelligence, this is a red line. We need to have a framework of international co-operation to promote technology, but also to decide principles which should be decided by government not private companies.</p> <p>Finally, protection, against terrorism, and financial protection. Need government and international co-operation for this. We need to have a discussion in G20, that there must be a monitoring of all those bodies which can promote social cohesion. </p> <p>In terms of climate protection, we have committed to many things but not up to the commitments. China has done an enormous amount of work here. India is also very important.</p> <p>But we now need to follow through and respect Paris agreement. Need a floor price for CO2, if not we won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be credible.</p> <p>China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new Silk Road has to be a green road.</p> <p>I hope by 2020 we will have an environmental pact which is legally binding.</p> <p>The private sector must also live up to its commitments.</p> <p>Finally it is the financial system which has to accompany this with green financing.

We need less arms and more brains. People have to be trained in an efficient way. We began to reform our education system, we need better access to university.</p> <p>We invest 5% of GDP in education, we will reform apprenticeships. We will invest \u00e2\u201a\u00ac15bn in education and retraining over five years.</p> <p>We will make innovation the centrepiece of the economy. Reform fiscal mechanisms, create a new \u00e2\u201a\u00ac10bn fund for disruptive technologies.</p> <p>The second pillar of this reform is investment and capital. We need more equity to finance risk and big innovations. We passed reforms to reallocate our savings in this direction. By decreasing corporate taxes, big reform on capital gain.</p> <p>We have reinforced France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s attractiveness.</p> <p>The third pillar is acceleration and flexibility. You need more flexible structures and rules to help different companies to change business model and readapt.</p> <p>The idea is to realign France on Germany and northern Europe. Rules much more adapted to business environment, that is a big change and it makes us much more competitive.</p> <p>Fourth pillar - make France a model in fight against climate change. That is a huge advantage in terms of attractiveness and competitiveness. Talent will come where it is good to live. We can create a lot of jobs with such a strategy. We passed reforms for this green strategy. Close coal fired power stations by 2021 (Applause).</p> <p>Fifth pillar of domestic strategy is cultural change. A preference for red tape cuts and cutting complexities. We simplify and streamline processes, and simplify bureaucracy. During last six months we reduced like crazy the number of regulations.</p> <p>We have to guarantee stability for people. We passed all these measures, voted these five year strategy on taxes. Visibility is the strategy and will not change, that is my commitment.</p> <p>It is also about risk. In France it was forbidden to fail, and forbidden to succeed. Now it should be more easy to fail, take risk, but allow people to come back and try something else. When you take risk, you need reward, and you need to reduce the cost of failure.</p> <p>France is a nation of entrepreneures, ao it was a mistake in France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s history.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5a68b72de4b0473d0bc0fb0a\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-01-24T16:48:48.361Z\">4.48pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>We have taken action but let us not be naive.

Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The pound went on a tear this Wednesday, rocketing higher against the euro and dollar to mark the currency\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s best session for more than a month.</p> <p>Cable shot up a remarkable 1.6% as the day progressed, clearing not only $1.41 but $1.42 in one fell swoop. Though the UK jobs report was decent, the highlight being another minor fall in unemployment, the thrust of cable\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s growth is coming from the dollar\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bruised and battered start to 2018.</p> <p>Despite ostensibly having the end of the US government shutdown to cheer about the dollar found little room for positivity this Wednesday, almost solely due to Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s appearance at the World Economic Forum in Davos. At a press conference Mnuchin argued that a weaker dollar was better for the US economy for trade reasons, a comment that was tantamount to kicking an already very sickly dog.</p> <p>Combine that lack of policy support with a weaker than forecast US flash services PMI and a disappointing existing home sales number and the greenback gave up the ghost as the bell rang on Wall Street, plunging to a variety of fresh lows as it matched its sharp decline against the pound with a 0.8% drop against the dollar and a 1% slide against the yen.</p> <p>Of course these currency movements had major ramifications for the global indices. The Dow Jones was overjoyed at the dollar\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s latest defeat, jumping 160 points to soar to a brand spanking new record peak of 26375. The European markets, on the other hand, shrank in the face of the pound and the euro.</p> <p>With sterling not only destroying the dollar but rising 0.8% against the euro the FTSE took the brunt of the blows, falling to a 3 week low after dropping 0.7%. The DAX and CAC, meanwhile, both slipped 0.3%, despite the euro\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 3 year high-hitting gains against the dollar being tempered by its losses against sterling.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5a68a09de4b01fba01150fac\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-01-24T15:07:48.477Z\">3.07pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>More US data, and a weak housing market report for December.</p> <p>Existing home sales fell by 3.6% last month to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.57m units, worse than the 2.2% decline which had been expected by analysts. The November figure was revised down from 5.81m to 5.7m units. The December fall came after three months of gains, and the National Association of Realtors attributed the decline to a shortage of houses at the lower end of the market.</p> <p>But for the year as a whole, sales rose 1.1% making it the best performance in eleven years. NAR chief economist Lawrence Yun said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Existing sales concluded the year on a softer note, but they were guided higher these last 12 months by a multi-year streak of exceptional job growth, which ignited buyer demand. At the same time, market conditions were far from perfect. New listings struggled to keep up with what was sold very quickly, and buying became less affordable in a large swath of the country.

Growth should therefore pick up again in coming months. </p> <p>Inflationary pressures meanwhile kicked higher, with January seeing the second-largest monthly increase in input costs since 2015. Higher oil prices were widely reported but, more generally, stronger demand is also helping companies push through price hikes. </p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/LiveSquawk/status/956176213852213248\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"ht\" dir=\"ltr\">US Markit Manufacturing PMI Jan P: 55.5 (est 55; prev 55.1)<br>-Services PMI Jan P: 53.3 (est 54.3; prev 53.7)<br>-Composite PMI Jan P: 53.8 (prev 54.1)<br> <a href=\"https://t.co/dmjPxWFSYy\">https://t.co/dmjPxWFSYy</a></p>&mdash; LiveSquawk (@LiveSquawk) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/LiveSquawk/status/956176213852213248?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">January 24, 2018</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p><strong>NF</strong></p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2018-01-24T15:08:17.849Z\">at 3.08pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5a6899c5e4b01fba01150f2f\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-01-24T14:40:41.243Z\">2.40pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Wall Street opens higher</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>US markets have hit new records in early trading, helped by reasonable results from a number of major companies and the continuing weakness of the dollar.</p> <p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average hit a high of 26,344, up more than 0.4%, while the S&amp;P 500 gained 0.25% and the Nasdaq Composite rose 0.19%.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/CNBCnow/status/956172883918839809\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Dow, S&amp;P and Nasdaq open at record highs <a href=\"https://t.co/ZR7PDycEio\">https://t.co/ZR7PDycEio</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/ffDSgpzl1z\">pic.twitter.com/ffDSgpzl1z</a></p>&mdash; CNBC Now (@CNBCnow) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/CNBCnow/status/956172883918839809?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">January 24, 2018</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p><strong>NF</strong></p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5a689514e4b01fba01150edb\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-01-24T14:40:16.972Z\">2.40pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>A quick look at the pound versus the dollar and the euro since the EU eferendum, courtesy of the Press Association, and it is quite a contrast:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/ian_a_jones/status/956166120976928769\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">A tale of two pounds.

Apart from the weak dollar, one of the reasons for the pound\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s strength at the moment is the prospect of further UK interest rate rises, hence a 0.7% gain against the euro to \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.1464. The stronger than expected employment and wage growth numbers only add to that expectation.</p> <p>Kallum Pickering, senior UK economist at Berenberg, says:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>While the Bank of England had initially responded to the risks to demand from the Brexit vote by easing its policy in August 2016, it became increasingly data dependent over the course of 2017, eventually hiking its main policy rate by 25bp in November \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the first hike in a decade.</p> <p>This came as a bit of a surprise for markets that seemed to be focusing more on downside risks to demand from Brexit than the signs of growing underlying inflationary pressure.</p> <p>According to market pricing, the BoE is set to hike the bank rate once again towards the end of the year. In our view, this seems still seems inconsistent with the BoE\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s data dependant approach and outlook for GDP and wage growth. Economic growth is likely to remain robust, partly helped by the strong global backdrop. Meanwhile, the BoE expects the unemployment rate to remain below its estimate of full employment (4.5% unemployment) throughout its forecast. It is becoming increasingly difficult for the BoE to justify its ultra-accommodative policy stance.</p> <p>We therefore look for two hikes in the Bank Rate in 2018, one in Q2 and one in Q4, followed by one in Q3 2019. Even with a modest continued tightening in which the Bank Rate increased to 1.25% by the end of 2019, UK monetary policy would remain highly accommodative. We will be paying close attention to the forward guidance at the February Inflation Report for signs the BoE is preparing markets for another rate hike soon.</p> </blockquote> <p>Daniel Vernazza, economist at UniCredit, is less hawkish on rates but admits today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s data could make a rise this year more likely:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We continue to expect the MPC will keep the stance of monetary policy on hold this year and only hike again once Brexit-related uncertainty is resolved, probably in 2Q19.</p> <p>However, today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s labour market release, together with the likelihood of a robust 4Q17 GDP report due to be published on Friday, stronger global growth, and some resolution of Brexit-related uncertainty, increases the risks that the MPC already delivers another 25bp hike later this year.</p> </blockquote> <p>Meanwhile here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our full story on the day\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s UK data:</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/jan/24/uk-employment-level-hits-joint-highest-since-1971\">UK employment level hits joint highest since 1971</a> </p> </aside>  <p><strong>NF</strong></p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2018-01-24T12:20:56.796Z\">at 12.20pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5a687646e4b04cea3dc7ab1b\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-01-24T12:08:05.318Z\">12.08pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>One of the attractions of Davos for the global elite is that they can squeeze in more meetings with fellow leader than in the average month.</p> <p>IMF chief Christine Lagarde has been showing the way; offering support to Lebanon over its refugee crisis and giving Portugal a thumbs-up too.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/Lagarde/status/956134151454896128\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Very please to meet in Davos with Portugal\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Prime Minister Antonio Costa and congratulated Finance Minister Mario Centeno on his election as President of Eurogroup.

However, vacancies are also at an all-time high, revealing difficulties for employers in some economic sectors, including those with a high proportion of migrant employees facing the challenges of Brexit.</p> <p>This reflects what employers who have engaged in our Brexit research say they are experiencing on the ground \u00e2\u20ac\u201c that they are losing some EU migrants and finding it more difficult to recruit both British and EU workers. The sectors with high vacancy rates include those with relatively high proportions of migrant employees, including from the EU.

Strong employment numbers were just the nudge the pound needed to get over $1.41, where it is just about holding at present.</p> <p>After showing signs of a slowdown, there was a strong bounce back in employment in December. Wage growth ex-bonuses rose by 2.4% compared to 2.3% in the quarter to October. Although below inflation at the present there are signs that tentatively rising wage growth will converge with falling inflation in the coming months. Sterling\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s recovery will only aid that process and is a reason to be more bullish on the UK economy and sterling. Generally speaking we are also seeing less chance of the cliff-edge exit with the tone of Brexit negotiations more constructive since December following the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s agreement to financial terms.</p> <p>But for all the chatter about Brexit and UK unemployment numbers, this is very much a soft dollar story. The dollar index has given up the 90 handle and we have the dollar below 110 against the yen for the first time since September and the euro has broken to a fresh three-year high.</p> <p>The pound is now well bid above its 50-, 100- and 200-day moving averages and with today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s blast above $1.41 seems set to consolidate above $1.40. There is not a huge amount of resistance on the upside for cable. The 50% retracement of the move from $1.71 to $1.19 is at $1.4590. Then we have the $1.4770 May 3rd 2016 high before the all-important $1.5000 level comes back into play. But these seem a long way off and depend entirely on dollar weakness to be sustained.</p> <p>For that we will look to Davos and what president Trump says with regards to trade. Concerns about trade wars \u00e2\u20ac\u201c put on the back burner last year as the administration battled with Obamacare and tax reform \u00e2\u20ac\u201c have resurfaced. Tariffs on washing machines and solar cells may only be the start, while there are ongoing worries about Nafta. Trade concerns are trumping the Trump tax policy as far as the dollar is concerned. And the focus on the dollar\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s slide seems to be dampening the mood generally in equity markets.</p> <p>Nevertheless, dollar softness may well be overdone and shorts could be squeezed when GDP figures for the fourth quarter are released, which are likely to confirm yet more acceleration in growth in the US and could see markets bet on a faster pace of tightening by the Fed than currently priced in.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>NF</strong></p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2018-01-24T10:49:29.092Z\">at 10.49am GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5a685ea7e4b04cea3dc7a9f5\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-01-24T10:30:30.358Z\">10.30am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Real wages are still being squeezed in the UK according to the latest data, with pay growth including bonuses steady at 2.5% and despite an increase from 2.3% to 2.4% when bonuses are excluded. Ben Brettell, senior economist at Hargreaves Lansdown, said:</p> <blockquote> <p>With pay growing at 2.5% [including bonuses] and inflation running at 3.0%, the squeeze on real wages continues for the ninth consecutive month. But with inflation seemingly set to fall back towards the 2% target, this looks like it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll come to an end in the next few months. We should remember, however, that the only true driver of real pay growth and rising living standards is productivity growth.

                "bodyText":"Some late news: Seven Latin American countries are to benefit from a new anti-malaria initiative unveiled in Davos by the philanthropist Bill Gates and the Inter-American development bank. The Regional Malaria Elimination Initiative is expected to deliver more than $180mn to fight the disease in Belize, Costa Rica, the Dominican Republic, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua and Panama. Money from the Gates Foundation, the IDB and the Carlos Slim totalling more than $80bn is expected to leverage in a further $100mn from the countries affected. Gates said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This collaboration will build on each of the partners\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 unique capabilities and expertise to cover financial and technical gaps in the region, demonstrating that we can eliminate malaria today using current tools. It will also help strengthen health systems in the region, positioning countries for success against other high-priority vector-borne diseases such as Zika, dengue and Chikungunya.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd More Macron reaction: I think the social contract has to involve all the stakeholders. We have to fight against strategy of free riding. A new global and shared framework should be based on co-operation and multilateralism..We have a tremendous responsibility.. The answer is partly here in this room. In a way our new frontier is our commitment. If we commit ourselves to make our current globalisation more fair..so we can converge and build a new globalisation. We have a question. Do we decide to do it or no? And this is now? (Applause as he ends) We are committed to fighting against terrorism. We need to continue to work with our partners at military and diplomatic levels... Sometimes we thought getting rid of a tyrant we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t like would get what we wanted... But we have to win the war against terrorism and create conditions for a durable peace...We need to provide a development and education policy. I think we have to reconnect with a framework which provides for the common good. Sustainable development, health, human rights - these can never be renounced, and we have to spell them out and regulate them in a common manner. I hope private sector will come to our country to create jobs.. but I have to explain to people [globalisation] is good for them. Otherwise there will be nationalists, extremism. We need to establish a new global contract, unless everyone understands they have a part to play it won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t work. The new global contract has three duties: the right to invest, share and protect. [On investment} one area we are not doing enough in is education, we have 750m adults who do not have basic literacy skills, we have to invest in education, the education of girls in particular. If we don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t invest there will be not equality. It is important all the countries here commit to this [investment in education globally]. The duty to share: there is a crisis of contemporary capitalism. It has become a capitalism of superstars, spreading of value added is not equitable. We have to establish mechanisms to share value added more equitably... We also need to speak about gender equality. In France we are launching initiatives [for more visibility], I welcome the commitments from Justin Trudeau. If we want to share value better, we need a more co-ordinated tax approach at a global level. There should not be a race to the bottom. We need a strategy that avoids the maximisation strategies of some companies. It is a moral issue. We need to renounce unbridled tax optimisation. Plus how can you have a tax on digital activities. We all want these big international companies in their country, but there is an unfair model [if they pay low taxes when national companies do]. Disruption from digital businesses will destroy millions of jobs, and if those companies do not help finance retraining of people affected, how can I explain that [to those people] I am in favour of IMF being given mandate to survey whole financial system, especially those areas which escape regulation. Cryptocurrencies, shadow banking etc, are not being looked at by IMF, so we have to have a discussion. At what point are we going to stop innovation. To say artificial intelligence, this is a red line. We need to have a framework of international co-operation to promote technology, but also to decide principles which should be decided by government not private companies. Finally, protection, against terrorism, and financial protection. Need government and international co-operation for this. We need to have a discussion in G20, that there must be a monitoring of all those bodies which can promote social cohesion. In terms of climate protection, we have committed to many things but not up to the commitments. China has done an enormous amount of work here. India is also very important. But we now need to follow through and respect Paris agreement. Need a floor price for CO2, if not we won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be credible. China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new Silk Road has to be a green road. I hope by 2020 we will have an environmental pact which is legally binding. The private sector must also live up to its commitments. Finally it is the financial system which has to accompany this with green financing. In EU and eurozone we need to have a way of having a green financial sector. Macron, who has been mostly been speaking in English, reverts to French. Europe should find a new ambition. Economic growth is not an end in itself. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve made a mistake saying things will get better because we have growth. The search for growth has sometimes made us forget what it takes to achieve it. Some people thought that if we had growth, all problems will be solved. Not the case, because this growth is less equitable. You cannot have a one stop solution. You have to co-ordinate positions. Everything is being fragmented. We have societies made up of nomads. There are more and more people who think getting out of globalisation is the right option. We have a major challenge, not just for governments. A lot of governments think you have to be more nationalist. States have often gone in wrong direction because we undermined internationalism. For many years we have been going in the wrong direction. In terms of trade we are moving back to strategies of non-co-operation, undoing what globalisation has been able to achieve. For climate change we have not be able to achieve what we have said we would achieve. And we haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t established an organisation at a world level which looks at artificial intelligence and automation. We allow private companies to control this. We have never had a multilateral approach to this. We are encouraging technological change..and we are in danger of living in a Darwinian world. My message is France is back. We will never have French success without European success. Angela Merkel expressed her vision and we worked very closely in that direction. The core strategy is: we have to fix some short term measures. But we have to also redesign a ten year strategy for Europe. Europe has a role to play vis a vis China and the US. If we want to avoid fragmentation of the world, we need a stronger Europe. We have to have a 10 year strategy to make Europe a green, scientific and political power. We need more ambition to have a more united Europe. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m not naive, we will not build something that ambition at 27. But we have to change our methodology, not wait for all the people round the table to go forward, Those who do not want to move forward should not block the most ambitious people in the room. This will make our eurozone much stronger, fairer. At the end of this year, we hope for a common strategy for ten years. First, its about human capital. Our world has changed. We need less arms and more brains. People have to be trained in an efficient way. We began to reform our education system, we need better access to university. We invest 5% of GDP in education, we will reform apprenticeships. We will invest \u00e2\u201a\u00ac15bn in education and retraining over five years. We will make innovation the centrepiece of the economy. Reform fiscal mechanisms, create a new \u00e2\u201a\u00ac10bn fund for disruptive technologies. The second pillar of this reform is investment and capital. We need more equity to finance risk and big innovations. We passed reforms to reallocate our savings in this direction. By decreasing corporate taxes, big reform on capital gain. We have reinforced France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s attractiveness. The third pillar is acceleration and flexibility. You need more flexible structures and rules to help different companies to change business model and readapt. The idea is to realign France on Germany and northern Europe. Rules much more adapted to business environment, that is a big change and it makes us much more competitive. Fourth pillar - make France a model in fight against climate change. That is a huge advantage in terms of attractiveness and competitiveness. Talent will come where it is good to live. We can create a lot of jobs with such a strategy. We passed reforms for this green strategy. Close coal fired power stations by 2021 (Applause). Fifth pillar of domestic strategy is cultural change. A preference for red tape cuts and cutting complexities. We simplify and streamline processes, and simplify bureaucracy. During last six months we reduced like crazy the number of regulations. We have to guarantee stability for people. We passed all these measures, voted these five year strategy on taxes. Visibility is the strategy and will not change, that is my commitment. It is also about risk. In France it was forbidden to fail, and forbidden to succeed. Now it should be more easy to fail, take risk, but allow people to come back and try something else. When you take risk, you need reward, and you need to reduce the cost of failure. France is a nation of entrepreneures, ao it was a mistake in France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s history. We have taken action but let us not be naive. Globalisation is going through a challenge. I came here to make a call for action, to all and every one of us. France has been affected by change and globalisation. A few months ago I had to fight with a nationalist party, since there was a lack of understanding about globalisation in my country. Why, we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t deliver, results were poor. Some people proposed getting out of globalisation as a solution. I have the responsibility to build a France that is prosperous and open, but also standing for those left behind. I have to make France more competitive to finance a fair system. Macron says we are talking about globalisation in a place cut off from the rest of the world by snow. It is hard here to believe in global warming, and you didnt invite anyone sceptical of global warming this year. Applause. A video clip has emerged of David Cameron, former UK PM, describing Brexit as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a mistake, not a disaster\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd: French president Emmanuel Macron is next up at Davos. Today is being billed as a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153moment of truth\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd by Greek government officials as prime minister Alexis Tsipras meets his Macedonian counterpart in Davos. A solution to the seemingly unsolvable dispute between Greece and the former Yugoslav republic of Macedonia could be solved in Davos. That, at least, is what both sides are hoping as Tsipras and his Macedonian counterpart Zoran Zaev meet this afternoon. The bilateral meeting takes the quest for a settlement a notch up the diplomatic scale and is being seen as possibly groundbreaking. The two Balkan neighbours have been at odds over the former republic\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s name for the past 25 years with Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 asserting that exclusive use of the nomenclature \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Macedonia\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd conceals territorial ambitions against its own eponymous region of Macedonia. Around 100,000 demonstrators protested over the issue in the northern Greek capital of Thessaloniki on Sunday. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It will be a moment of truth,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said a senior Greek official adding that it would allow Athens to see how far Skopje was willing to compromise on the issue. More on the pound\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s current buoyancy, and more to the point, the dollar\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decline. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said: The pound went on a tear this Wednesday, rocketing higher against the euro and dollar to mark the currency\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s best session for more than a month. Cable shot up a remarkable 1.6% as the day progressed, clearing not only $1.41 but $1.42 in one fell swoop. Though the UK jobs report was decent, the highlight being another minor fall in unemployment, the thrust of cable\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s growth is coming from the dollar\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bruised and battered start to 2018. Despite ostensibly having the end of the US government shutdown to cheer about the dollar found little room for positivity this Wednesday, almost solely due to Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s appearance at the World Economic Forum in Davos. At a press conference Mnuchin argued that a weaker dollar was better for the US economy for trade reasons, a comment that was tantamount to kicking an already very sickly dog. Combine that lack of policy support with a weaker than forecast US flash services PMI and a disappointing existing home sales number and the greenback gave up the ghost as the bell rang on Wall Street, plunging to a variety of fresh lows as it matched its sharp decline against the pound with a 0.8% drop against the dollar and a 1% slide against the yen. Of course these currency movements had major ramifications for the global indices. The Dow Jones was overjoyed at the dollar\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s latest defeat, jumping 160 points to soar to a brand spanking new record peak of 26375. The European markets, on the other hand, shrank in the face of the pound and the euro. With sterling not only destroying the dollar but rising 0.8% against the euro the FTSE took the brunt of the blows, falling to a 3 week low after dropping 0.7%. The DAX and CAC, meanwhile, both slipped 0.3%, despite the euro\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 3 year high-hitting gains against the dollar being tempered by its losses against sterling. More US data, and a weak housing market report for December. Existing home sales fell by 3.6% last month to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.57m units, worse than the 2.2% decline which had been expected by analysts. The November figure was revised down from 5.81m to 5.7m units. The December fall came after three months of gains, and the National Association of Realtors attributed the decline to a shortage of houses at the lower end of the market. But for the year as a whole, sales rose 1.1% making it the best performance in eleven years. NAR chief economist Lawrence Yun said: Existing sales concluded the year on a softer note, but they were guided higher these last 12 months by a multi-year streak of exceptional job growth, which ignited buyer demand. At the same time, market conditions were far from perfect. New listings struggled to keep up with what was sold very quickly, and buying became less affordable in a large swath of the country. These two factors ultimately muted what should have been a stronger sales pace. NF We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve had the initial January PMI numbers for January for the US, and unlike Europe it is manufacturing which is outperforming, rather than the service sector. The IHS Markit manufacturing PMI has climbed from 55.1 in December to 55.5, while the services PMI slipped from 53.7 to 53.3. The composite index edged down from 54.1 to 53.8. Despite the dips, all the indices were above 50, showing expansion rather than contraction. IHS Markit chief business economist Chris Williamson, said: January saw an encouraging start to the year for the US economy. Business activity across the manufacturing and service sectors continued to expand, driving further job gains as companies expanded capacity. Manufacturing is faring especially well, in part thanks to the weaker dollar, providing an important spur to the economy at the start of the year. Although the overall pace of economic growth signalled by the surveys waned to an eight-month low, the forward-looking indicators suggest the slowdown will prove transitory. In particular, business optimism about the year ahead improved markedly and inflows of new orders hit a five-month high. Growth should therefore pick up again in coming months. Inflationary pressures meanwhile kicked higher, with January seeing the second-largest monthly increase in input costs since 2015. Higher oil prices were widely reported but, more generally, stronger demand is also helping companies push through price hikes. NF US markets have hit new records in early trading, helped by reasonable results from a number of major companies and the continuing weakness of the dollar. The Dow Jones Industrial Average hit a high of 26,344, up more than 0.4%, while the S&amp;P 500 gained 0.25% and the Nasdaq Composite rose 0.19%. NF A quick look at the pound versus the dollar and the euro since the EU eferendum, courtesy of the Press Association, and it is quite a contrast: NF Returning to the dangers of populism, Angela Merkel warns of the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcpoisonous mix\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 created if people feel they are getting an unfair deal. She warns against descending into stereotypes, saying: When you say Americans are protectionist by nature, Germans are tight-fisted by nature, you are generalising. The next thing is Muslims are like this, Christians are like that. If you not respect each person\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s individuality, and already have your pre-conceived notion before you even talk to them, that is the very basis of populism. We want to have a good partnership with Britain in the future, Merkel continues. Access to the single market is contingent on the freedoms, including freedom of movement. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s in their hands how close they want the partnership to be. We are prepared to be open-minded about this partnership. Angela Merkel now turns to the digital revolution, warning of the social damage that it could cause. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not enough to just convince 20% or 30% of the population of the benefits of the digital age. Policymakers need to help people who will otherwise be left behind, she says. The chancellor repeats her earlier point that we must avoid making the mistakes of the 20th century again. The new digital economy creates good opportunities, Merkel says, but it also creates \u00e2\u20ac\u0153enormous confusion, and people feel left behind\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd We must create a true social market economy as we say in Germany in this digital age. Merkel ends with a request - keep your fingers crossed for us getting into government as soon as possible. Are you listening, Donald? Turning to Brexit, Angela Merkel says Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision to leave the European Union is regrettable. But on the upside, it has given Europe \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the courage to move forwards\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. She also name checks France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new(ish) leader, Emmanuel Macron, saying his victory last spring has given a new impetus to Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s reform drive. Merkel is making some important points about Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s role in the world: Angela Merkel warns that populism is on the rise, with a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153polarising state of affairs in many countries\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. The German chancellor cites the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153disruptive changes of technology\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, which is shaking up society and worrying people. There is also polarisation in Germany for the first time in decades, Merkel continues - following the eurozone crisis, and challenge of migration. Merkel reminds us that she is still holding talks to form a new government (with the social democratic party). But she\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s certain that Germany wants to make a contribution to solving the problems of the world. Shutting ourselves off from the rest of the world will not help she says, adding: Protectionism is not the proper answer. Next up: German chancellor Angela Merkel take the stage. She reminds delegates that 2018 marks the 100th anniversary of the end of the first world war. The political actors a century ago \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcsleepwalked\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 into a crisis, Merkel says. We must ask ourselves...have we learned the lessons of history, Merkel continued. And she suggests we have not, declaring: This generation born after the second world war will have to prove they have learned the lessons of history. That means remaining committed to multilateralism, working together to solve problems, Merkel continues. Taking questions, Italian PM Paulo Gentiloni says that the issue of migration had a big influence on the Brexit vote. Italy is sticking to its principles, though, he says - saving the lives of those who try to get to Europe, and refusing to close its ports to those who cross the sea. Gentiloni says: This is one of the more costly political decisions you can take in these times. but this is the Italian decision, full stop. And finally, Donald Trump speaks to Davos in two days time - what is your message to him. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Welcome to Davos\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, Gentiloni wisecracks. But he then makes a serious point - that there is a limit to how far any one country can push things within the current framework. Yes you can defend and protect your citizens, your workers, your companies, but we live in a framework of trade agreements, free trade, international rules, multilateral decisions, and we have to keep this system running. Turning to new technology, Gentiloni says that digital innovation is threatening the quantity and quality of available jobs. We must not give in to the idea of a world destined to be split between a cosmopolitan digital elite and an army of precarious and underpaid local workers. And on Europe, the Italian PM says that the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153perfect storm\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd caused by the Brexit vote, the economic crisis and unchecked migration is over. The EU now has an opportunity to relaunch itself. Gentiloni says firmly: These years are now behind our back. Those who have bet on a final crisis of the European Union have clearly lost. Italy is doing its bit to help with the migration crisis, Paulo Gentiloni says, saying that Italian investment is helping the African economy. The Italian PM then reminds his audience that Italy has an election in 40 days - he hopes that populist forces will not prevail [unfortunately for Gentiloni, his Democratic party is lagging in the polls]. Populism, Gentiloni says, frequently gives the wrong answers to the right questions. Politicians must not ignore the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcdeep causes\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 of discontent among their citizens, he says There are still unacceptably large parts of our populations who feel unsatisfied with their conditions and worried about the future. The damage caused by the great recession has still not been mended, Gentiloni continues. Economic growth is not reducing inequalities, but in many countries including Italy they are still widening, even if economic growth is there. They are reaching even more intolerable levels. Italian PM Paulo Gentiloni is on his feet - telling Davos that Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy is improving. Gentiloni says: In the last two years, our economy is back to growth, and now it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s picking up speed. One year ago, the IMF forecast that we would only grow by 0.7% in 2017. Actual growth in 2017, according to the IMF, was 1.6%. He adds: Exports rose by 9.7% between November 2016 and 2017. Employment is up by one million units, to a 40-year high. Gentiloni says his government is doing its best to improve the business conditions, reform the labour market, raise skills and cut bureaucracy. This reforming effort must continue, and will continue, while our public debt must decrease at a steady and sustainable pace. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a buzz in the main Davos congress hall, as delegates prepare to hear from Italian prime minister Paulo Gentiloni, and then German chancellor Angela Merkel. Jack Ma has also warned Davos that technology could trigger a third world war, unless leaders work together to mitigate its disruptive effects. He says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The first technology revolution caused the First World War and the second technology revolution caused the Second World War - and now we have the third. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153If there is a Third World War I think that should be a war against disease, pollution and poverty, not a war against ourselves. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153If we don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t align together , human beings are going to fight each other, because each technology revolution makes the world unbalanced.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Hopes of a showdown between Theresa May and Jean-Claude Juncker at Davos tomorrow have been dashed. The EC president has cancelled his visit after contracting stomach flu, so he won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be giving his scheduled speech tomorrow. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s another quote from Alibaba\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Jack Ma, urging policymakers not to trigger a trade war: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Globalization is a growing pain. It is so easy to launch a trade war but it is so difficult to stop a trade war and I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m scared and concerned.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Sterling is climbing higher again, now up more than 1% at $1.4152. Apart from the weak dollar, one of the reasons for the pound\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s strength at the moment is the prospect of further UK interest rate rises, hence a 0.7% gain against the euro to \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.1464. The stronger than expected employment and wage growth numbers only add to that expectation. Kallum Pickering, senior UK economist at Berenberg, says: While the Bank of England had initially responded to the risks to demand from the Brexit vote by easing its policy in August 2016, it became increasingly data dependent over the course of 2017, eventually hiking its main policy rate by 25bp in November \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the first hike in a decade. This came as a bit of a surprise for markets that seemed to be focusing more on downside risks to demand from Brexit than the signs of growing underlying inflationary pressure. According to market pricing, the BoE is set to hike the bank rate once again towards the end of the year. In our view, this seems still seems inconsistent with the BoE\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s data dependant approach and outlook for GDP and wage growth. Economic growth is likely to remain robust, partly helped by the strong global backdrop. Meanwhile, the BoE expects the unemployment rate to remain below its estimate of full employment (4.5% unemployment) throughout its forecast. It is becoming increasingly difficult for the BoE to justify its ultra-accommodative policy stance. We therefore look for two hikes in the Bank Rate in 2018, one in Q2 and one in Q4, followed by one in Q3 2019. Even with a modest continued tightening in which the Bank Rate increased to 1.25% by the end of 2019, UK monetary policy would remain highly accommodative. We will be paying close attention to the forward guidance at the February Inflation Report for signs the BoE is preparing markets for another rate hike soon. Daniel Vernazza, economist at UniCredit, is less hawkish on rates but admits today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s data could make a rise this year more likely: We continue to expect the MPC will keep the stance of monetary policy on hold this year and only hike again once Brexit-related uncertainty is resolved, probably in 2Q19. However, today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s labour market release, together with the likelihood of a robust 4Q17 GDP report due to be published on Friday, stronger global growth, and some resolution of Brexit-related uncertainty, increases the risks that the MPC already delivers another 25bp hike later this year. Meanwhile here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our full story on the day\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s UK data: NF One of the attractions of Davos for the global elite is that they can squeeze in more meetings with fellow leader than in the average month. IMF chief Christine Lagarde has been showing the way; offering support to Lebanon over its refugee crisis and giving Portugal a thumbs-up too. She even squeezed in a chat with cellist Yo-Yo Ma. E-commerce magnate Jack Ma has made a passionate plea to world leaders t Davos not to launch a trade war. Speaking on a panel, the head of China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Alibaba says trade should be a solution to the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s problems. If you used it as a weapon, young people and businesses will suffer most. Ma says: \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcThey will be killed, just like when you bomb somewhere\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. An important view, given the tensions between China and the US - and Wilbur Ross\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s comment about America \u00e2\u20ac\u02dccoming to the ramparts\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. Back in Davos, the World Economic Forum have launched a new \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Global Centre for Cybersecurity\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Based in Geneva, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meant to help build a safe and secure global cyberspace, and protect businesses and governments from online attacks. Interpol and BT are also involved. J\u00c3\u00bcrgen Stock, Secretary General of Interpol, says this partnership will address the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153global threat\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd of cybercrime. The pound has peaked at $1.4118 against the dollar, for the moment at least. But it is still up 0.7% so far today at $1.4097. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said: A green-gilled greenback and a half decent UK jobs report made for a very strong Wednesday for the pound. Kicking the currency while it was down, US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin claimed at a press conference in Davos that a weaker dollar is good for the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcas it relates to trade and opportunities\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. This turned an already bad morning worse for the greenback, with the currency falling 0.4% against the euro, where it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sunk to a fresh 3 and a bit year nadir, and 0.7% against both the yen and the pound. Sterling\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s gains against the dollar caused cable to flit about the $1.41 mark for the first time since the Brexit referendum result back in June 2016. The pound didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t stop there, however; it also rose 0.4% against the euro, lifting back to its best price in just shy of 7 weeks. The FTSE wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t best pleased with all this, dipping 0.2% as it continued to shed its early 2018 record-breaking momentum. The pound was aided by a UK jobs report that by and large didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t ruffle any feathers. Wage growth came in unchanged at 2.5%, and rose to from 2.3% to 2.4% excluding bonuses \u00e2\u20ac\u201c in terms of its relation to inflation, though real wages are still being squeezed there are signs that this should ease in the coming months \u00e2\u20ac\u201c while unemployment fell by 3000 to 1.44 million (the unemployment rate didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t actually change, remaining steady at 4.3%). NF Back with the UK data. From Simon French, chief economist at Panmure Gordon: Earlier, as well as the preliminary PMIs for France and Germany, there were also estimates for the eurozone as a whole. This showed the same pattern, with manufacturing slipping back in January and services rising. The eurozone manufacturing PMI dipped from 60.6 to 59.8 while services climbed from 56.6 to 57.6. The composite index rose from 58.1 to 58.6. Unicredit Bank economist Edoardo Campanella said: The eurozone starts 2018 with a bang, continuing to churn out solid economic figures. January\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Composite PMI hit a near 12-year high, rising to 58.6 from 58.1 and pointing to annualized GDP growth of almost 4%. Economic activity further accelerated in the services sector to the fastest pace since August 2007, while it slowed down in the manufacturing industry \u00e2\u20ac\u201c after having recorded an all-time high last December. NF The UK jobs data today shows the difficulties employers are having filling vacancies, especially those companies which use a large number of EU migrant workers, says theNational Institute of Economic and Social Research. Associate research director Dr Heather Rolfe said: UK labour market statistics released today show employment in the 3 months up to November 2017 is at a record high, driven by an increase in full time employment. However, vacancies are also at an all-time high, revealing difficulties for employers in some economic sectors, including those with a high proportion of migrant employees facing the challenges of Brexit. This reflects what employers who have engaged in our Brexit research say they are experiencing on the ground \u00e2\u20ac\u201c that they are losing some EU migrants and finding it more difficult to recruit both British and EU workers. The sectors with high vacancy rates include those with relatively high proportions of migrant employees, including from the EU. Accommodation and food services, where one in six workers are EU migrants is one such sector. The challenges of attracting and retaining workers are likely to increase with prolonged uncertainty about the terms of the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s departure from the EU. NF Neil Wilson, senior market analyst at ETX Capital, said: Sterling breached $1.41 to record another post-Brexit high as a renewed bout of dollar softness and some better-than-expected employment numbers fuelled bids. Strong employment numbers were just the nudge the pound needed to get over $1.41, where it is just about holding at present. After showing signs of a slowdown, there was a strong bounce back in employment in December. Wage growth ex-bonuses rose by 2.4% compared to 2.3% in the quarter to October. Although below inflation at the present there are signs that tentatively rising wage growth will converge with falling inflation in the coming months. Sterling\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s recovery will only aid that process and is a reason to be more bullish on the UK economy and sterling. Generally speaking we are also seeing less chance of the cliff-edge exit with the tone of Brexit negotiations more constructive since December following the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s agreement to financial terms. But for all the chatter about Brexit and UK unemployment numbers, this is very much a soft dollar story. The dollar index has given up the 90 handle and we have the dollar below 110 against the yen for the first time since September and the euro has broken to a fresh three-year high. The pound is now well bid above its 50-, 100- and 200-day moving averages and with today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s blast above $1.41 seems set to consolidate above $1.40. There is not a huge amount of resistance on the upside for cable. The 50% retracement of the move from $1.71 to $1.19 is at $1.4590. Then we have the $1.4770 May 3rd 2016 high before the all-important $1.5000 level comes back into play. But these seem a long way off and depend entirely on dollar weakness to be sustained. For that we will look to Davos and what president Trump says with regards to trade. Concerns about trade wars \u00e2\u20ac\u201c put on the back burner last year as the administration battled with Obamacare and tax reform \u00e2\u20ac\u201c have resurfaced. Tariffs on washing machines and solar cells may only be the start, while there are ongoing worries about Nafta. Trade concerns are trumping the Trump tax policy as far as the dollar is concerned. And the focus on the dollar\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s slide seems to be dampening the mood generally in equity markets. Nevertheless, dollar softness may well be overdone and shorts could be squeezed when GDP figures for the fourth quarter are released, which are likely to confirm yet more acceleration in growth in the US and could see markets bet on a faster pace of tightening by the Fed than currently priced in. NF Real wages are still being squeezed in the UK according to the latest data, with pay growth including bonuses steady at 2.5% and despite an increase from 2.3% to 2.4% when bonuses are excluded. Ben Brettell, senior economist at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: With pay growing at 2.5% [including bonuses] and inflation running at 3.0%, the squeeze on real wages continues for the ninth consecutive month. But with inflation seemingly set to fall back towards the 2% target, this looks like it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll come to an end in the next few months. We should remember, however, that the only true driver of real pay growth and rising living standards is productivity growth. This is something the UK has struggled with since the financial crisis, and as yet nobody seems to have solved the puzzle. Suren Thiru, head of economics at the British Chambers of Commerce, said: While it is encouraging that regular earnings growth picked up slightly, subdued economic conditions are likely to weigh on wage growth over the next year. As a consequence, pay growth is likely to remain stubbornly below price growth over the near term, dampening consumer spending, a key driver of UK GDP growth. NF The president of Brazil, Michael Temer, is speaking now -- encouraging business leaders to provide fresh investment. Jasper Lawler, head of research at London Capital Group, said: The relentless rise in sterling, which has seen it jump over 3% in the last 10 days is looking durable. The good news for the economy is that more people are working with rising wages despite any uncertainty associated with leaving the European Union. Lord Jim O\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Neil looks vindicated so far in his belief that strong domestic and global growth will overcome Brexit headwinds. Matthew Brittain, investment analyst at wealth manager Sanlam UK, said: The real worry [for the UK economy] is centred around the consumer where wages have been increasing at a lower rate than inflation (ie falling in \u00e2\u20ac\u0153real\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd terms). So another bright spot in this release is that weekly earnings ticked up from 2.3 to 2.4% versus a year ago, which is still lower than inflation (3%) but at least the gap is steadily being closed Since the data makes it slightly more likely that the Bank of England will increase interest rates later on in the year the immediate reaction is a rise in sterling to \u00c2\u00a31.41 with bonds and equities both under a little pressure. NF Sterling has climbed above $1.41 against the dollar after the better than expected UK unemployment and wages data. It is up 0.7%, a new peak since the Brexit vote but still below the $1.4878 level on the day of the referendum itself. Against the euro sterling is up 0.3% at \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.1416. The pound is benefitting from the signs of a stronger economy, and growing hopes that a Brexit deal can be reached. It is also being helped by the weakness of the dollar, which has fallen even more after the comments from US Treasury secretary Stephen Mnuchin at Davos. The US currency has been under pressure since the tax cuts announcement, with fears the reforms would push the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s huge deficit even higher. News of trade sanctions against South Korea and China have not helped, prompting fears of retaliation. Dennis de Jong, managing director of UFX.com, said: Sterling has bounced back in fine style, particularly against the dollar where it has climbed above $1.40 for the first time since the historic Brexit vote. Unemployment continues to fall, while there are signs that wages are finally growing, with employees willing to take more risks to ask for a pay rise, or even consider moving jobs. Although nothing has been decided yet, the general consensus is that the final version of Brexit could be softer than previously thought, which can only be good for the UK economy as a whole. NF Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s more details from former UK PM Tony Blair at Davos (speaking on Bloomberg TV) Asked whether there was any other way to avoid Brexit apart from having a second referendum, Blair said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153You could have a general election. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153If we do go through with Brexit - and I hope we don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t - it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s going to be a complete change and we will have to fashion a new future for the country.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd He said that when people have clarity on what the Brexit deal might look like - and he suspects it will be \u00e2\u20ac\u0153hotch potch\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd - \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I think it will be very difficult to persuade people that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s better than what we have now.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Q: What is he expecting from Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s speech on Friday? \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know what to expect. For me the issue is not responding to what Donald Trump has just said, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the reasons that brought him to power ... the cultural and economic alienation ... this is the root of the problem that needs to be addressed.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd UK employment rose unexpectedly in the three months to November, while wages rose by a higher than forecast 2.4%, excluding bonuses. The number of people in work rose by 102,000 in the quarter, said the Office for National Statistics, the biggest increase since the three months to July. Analysts had expected a fall of 13,000. The unemployment rate was steady at a four decade low of 4.3%. As for wages, the 2.4% figure was up from 2.3% in the three months to October and better than the forecasts of a flat reading. With inflation slipping back from 3.1% to 3% in November, the wage gap has edged lower. Total pay growth including bonuses was steady at 2.5%, as forecast. NF While the German and French leaders are at Davos, there is some reasonable data from both countries. The latest manufacturing PMIs for the two have come in below expectations but the service sector has outperformed. For France the preliminary manufacturing PMI for January came in at 58.1, down from 58.8. The services PMI rose from 59.1 to 59.3, with the composite PMI up from 59.6 to 59.7. In Germany the manufacturing index fell from 63.3 to 61.2, the services rose from 55.8 to 57 but the composite slipped from 58.9 to 58.8 NF The US dollar is sliding like an ill-prepared delegate on the streets of Davos, thanks to Stephen Mnuchin. The Treasury secretary\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s comment about not being worried about the weak dollar has sparked another wave of selling, sending the greenback to a fresh three-year low. Former chancellor George Osborne says the vote for Brexit was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153an alliance of the insulated and the insecure\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. In a discussion on the causes of Brexit and Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s victory Osborne said the insulated were elderly voters who owned their homes outright but were anxious about the pace of change while the insecure were \u00e2\u20ac\u0153on the margins of employment and looking for something to address their grievances.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd That was a classic good-cop/bad cop performance from Stephen Mnuchin and Wilbur Ross at Davos this morning. Mnuchin tried to calm concerns ahead of Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s visit, by insisting that America First wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t incompatible with working with other countries. But Ross was more combative, insisting that America had been treated badly by other nations in the past, and that Trump is simply levelling the score. Ross comments about \u00e2\u20ac\u0153US troops coming to the ramparts\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, and other countries talking about free trade but actually being protectionist, are a hint about how the US will behave behind the scenes at the World Economic Forum this week. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s some reaction: Final question -- will the US be reassuring delegates at Davos that it isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t creating a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcrace to the bottom\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 on tax? Stephen Mnuchin replies that he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s always been clear with fellow finance ministers that this isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s objective. This was about creating a comparable system for US companies to compete fairly, and we see that working. Q: What retaliations do you think China might take if the US imposes new tariffs? Every time you take a trade action, there is the possibility of the other side taking a trade action in retaliation, Wilbur Ross replies. To the degree that this happens, there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also a question about what the US would do next, Ross continues. Boom! Asked about the dangers of a trade war, US commerce secretary Wilbur Ross argues that it has been underway for some time. The difference is that the US troops are now coming to the ramparts. Stephen Mnuchin denies that there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a clash between America being \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcopen for business\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 and President Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economic goals. This is about an America First agenda, but America First does mean working with the rest of the world. President Trump is looking out for US workers and US interest, just as he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d expect other world leaders to do, Mnuchin adds. Q: How concerned are you about the weakness of the US dollar? The dollar is one of the most liquid markets. Where it is in the short term is not a concern at all, says Mnuchin. A weaker US dollar is good for trade, he continues. And in the long term, the strength of the US dollar is a sign of the strength of the US economy. Q: Have you any evidence that your tax reforms are boosting investment? The vote from the market is \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcpretty positive\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, Mnuchin replies. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve seen many companies come out and commit hundreds of millions of dollars, if not billions of dollars, he says - citing Apple as an example. We couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be happier. The response from US businesses has been even better than we expected. Q: How does the America First economic agenda match up to the World Economic Forum\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s goals? Our objective is to be here to interact with our counterparts. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s very important for the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest economy, Mnuchin replies. Commerce secretary Wilbur Ross weighs in too, repeating that some of America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trading partners are protectionist, even if they talk about free trade. We don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think that adhering to the rules is protectionist. We think in fact it is essential to having markets operate properly, to have people play by the rules. Q: Are you worried that China might cut its holdings of US government debt? Treasury secretary Mnuchin says that some of the reporting of this issue has been inaccurate. The market for US treasuries is \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcdeep\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, he adds. Q: Is there a bubble in the United States financial markets? Mnuchin says that forums like Davos are never very good at predicting markets. What we see in the US markets is a reaction to the economic changes we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve made, he suggests - but he doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to comment on other markets. As we look at US economic growth against the rest of the world, US economic growth looks very good - and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a good place to invest, he continues. Q: What do you think about Justin Trudeau\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s comments about NAFTA yesterday? We totally believe in full and free trade - anyone who wants to do it on a reciprocal basis are very welcome, Stephen Mnuchin replies. Q: What might you do next against China over protectionism? Wilbur Ross: There are a number of other actions pending. Reports have been drawn up for President Trump to consider (he references the aluminium market) There will be a very busy trade agenda in terms of those actions by the US, and there are the formal actions with relation to NAFTA, Ross adds. Commerce secretary Wilbur Ross speaks next, and rubbishes the idea that the US tax cuts are creating a new trade barrier This is a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153funny concept\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, Ross says: The US has been on an uncompetitive model before, but it is now on a very competitive one. Ross also touches on free trade -- and insists that any actions taken by America are in response to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153inappropriate behaviour\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd by America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trading partners. Many countries are very good at the rhetoric of free trade, but actually practice protectionism. Stephen Mnuchin, the US Treasury secretary, has just arrived at a packed-out press briefing here at Davos. He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s accompanied by Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross. Mnuchin begins by saying he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s thrilled to be at Davos, with the largest US delegation to WEF ever. Obviously tax reforms and tax cuts were a major part of what we achieved in Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s first year, Mnuchin says - which will bring \u00e2\u20ac\u0153literally trillions of dollars\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd back to the UK. We are committed to achieving a 3% growth target, Mnuchin continued. And that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not just good for the US, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s good for the world economy too. Mnuchin declares: We are open for business, and we look forward to being here through the week. Former UK prime minister Tony Blair is in town! He just spoke to Bloomberg TV about the need for \u00e2\u20ac\u0153progressive centerism\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. More on that later... The boss of Lloyds of London has warned that the focus on dry economic measures such as GDP has helped to create the backlash that led to Brexit. Speaking to CNBC at the World Economic Forum, Inga Beale said policymakers need to think differently about how they measure the economy. Beale explained: I do remember, when we were going through the campaigning around Brexit, in the UK, we, as businesses, were talking about GDP. Most of the members of the public don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t even know what that means, you know, they-, it doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t relate to them. And there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a definite feeling that they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re not being included, and they want to challenge the, you know, the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcas is\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, at the moment. They really want to go out and say, \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcI\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m not happy with this status quo. You\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re not hearing me. You\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re not respecting me. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m not included.\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 And when we talk about GDP, that doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t feel very inclusive for them. On Monday, the World Economic Forum did launch a new, more inclusive measure of economic performance that also tracked inequality and sustainability. Britain came just 21st. Sounds like Emmanuel Macron is only paying a flying visit.. Last night, around 2000 demonstrators in Zurich marched in protest at Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s visit to the World Economic Forum. Reuters reports that a small group even managed to demonstrate here in Davos: About 20 demonstrators broke through security to reach the Davos Congress Centre, holding banners and shouting \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Wipe out WEF\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd before they were peacefully disbanded by police. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Trump is just one of the other people we disagree with. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve been protesting every year now against the World Economic Forum and if Trump comes or not we don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t care. Trump is just, maybe he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s just the best symbol of this world,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd protester Alex Hedinger told Reuters TV in Davos. More here. Now this is interesting.... Treasury secretary Stephen Mnuchin is going to give a briefing at Davos in around 30 minutes. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meeting is billed \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We are open for business\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd - perhaps an attempt to calm worries over President Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s America First agenda.... Good morning. The second day of the World Economic is getting underway, with a strong European flavour. German chancellor Angela Merkel, French president Emmanuel Macron and Italian prime minister Paolo Gentiloni are all due on the Davos main stage today - a chance to set the agenda before Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s eagerly-awaited speech on Friday. But the Americans are already fighting for the spotlight. US Treasury secretary Stephen Mnuchin is in town, and speaking to the press this morning (we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll hopefully have more on that soon). Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s King Filipe, and the presidents of Brazil and Zimbabwe are also making appearances. Plus, Davos delegates will be discussing economic inequality (despite the obvious irony), slavery, and the opportunity and threats posed by technology. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s even a footballer in town. Manchester United\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Juan Mata will be pushing his Common Goal charitable fund, which encourages sports stars to donate some of their massive salaries to good causes. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s some of the events we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll try to cover: 10am Davos (9am GMT): IMF chief Christine Lagarde on \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Solving the Economic Generation Gap\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd 10.20am Davos (9.20am GMT): Special Address by Michel Temer, President of Brazil 11.15am Davos (10.15am GMT): Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s King Felipe VI speaks 12.30pm Davos (11.30am GMT): Session on \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcStabilizing the Mediterranean\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 with Italian PM Paolo Gentiloni and Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Alexis Tsipras 2pm Davos (1pm GMT): Zimbabwe President Emmerson Mnangagwa speaks 2.20pm Davos (1.20pm GMT): Special Address by Angela Merkel, Chancellor of Germany 3.30pm Davos (2.30pm GMT): Google Chief Executive Sundar Pichai on AI and technology\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s impact on society 4pm Davos (3pm GMT): A session on how to end slavery 5.30pm Davos (4.30pm GMT): Special Address by Emmanuel Macron, President of France 6pm Davos (5pm GMT): Manchester United\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Juan Mata talks about his Common Goal charitable work",

When someone says a good exchange rate is good, that is targeting exchange rate. That goes back to years ago before the [recent] terms of agreement were agreed.</p> \n  <p><em>Q:Why did you chooses September to end QE?

What level of concern was there today about a possible change in US policy [after US dollar comments]</em></p> \n  <p>Yes there was concern. It was broader than simply the exchange rate, but about broader state of international relations right now. If this leads to an unwarranted tightening of monetary policy we would have to think about our monetary policy strategy.</p> \n  <p>On communications, you see same thing in other jurisdictions. All the communiations since Dec have in common three characteristics. All based on commitment to objective of inflation target. None questioned the sequence whereby interest rates will stay at current levels well past end of asset buying programme. Well past was emphasised.</p> \n  <p><em>Q: Some commentators factoring in an interest rate rise this year? At its current level does euro reflect fundamentals?</em></p> \n  <p>Based on today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s data I see very few chances at all that interest rates can be raised this year. On euro, we should ask is it produced by strength of economy, or by statements, or by monetary policy elsewhere. </p> \n  <p><em>Q: Another question on the G30 membership, could it compromise ECB?</em></p> \n  <p>Draghi repeats his previous answer, but adds ombudsman said there was no evidence the meeting influenced ECB, and ECB must have contacts with other financial participants.</p> \n  <p><em>Q: Will differences of views within ECB deepen on exit strategy? At March meeting, will you give restatement of forward guidance.</em></p> \n  <p>I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think the differences are as substantive as they were on other occasions. Some are a little more confident, if they live where inflation is rising. But there are not deep existential differences.</p> \n  <p>But there may be differences on when to say certain things, when to move forward. Markets have expectations on path, but also on dates, timelines. </p> \n  <p>In March we will assess how things stand at that point in time.</p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5a69d9b0e4b00f225a1c7a86\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-01-25T15:06:10.845Z\">3.06pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">ECB: Draghi press conference</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Away from Davis briefly and back with the ECB, and president Mario Draghi said at his press conference that domestic price pressures remained muted, inflation has yet to show a convincing upward trend.</p> \n  <p>He said the recent foreign exchange volatility is a source of uncertainty. An ample degree of monetary stimulus is necessary.</p> \n  <p>On the economy, he said there could be positive growth surprise in the near term. But there were downside risks remain relating to global factors, forex.</p> \n  <p>More on inflation: he said it was expected to rise gradually over the medium term, supported by our measures, rising wage growth etc</p> \n  <p>He then repeats his usual call to governments to do more: To reap the ull benefits from monetary policy measures, other policy areas must contribute. Structural reform in euro area countries needs to be stepped up . On fiscal policies, the case is strengthened for rebuilding fiscal buffers, especially in in countries where debt remains high. Strengthening EMU remains a priority.</p> \n  <p>Now for questions:</p> \n  <p><em>Q: What will have to happen for the exchange rate to be a problem for the inflation target? And you said in December you would revisit guidance [on the bond buying programme] early this year?</em></p> \n  <p>Draghi says there is confusion about the guidance comment, there was no difference between what was said at the December meeting and what Draghi said at the press conference. All that was said was there would have to be discussions about the need to have a discussion in the early part of the year. That discussion hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t really started. We went through the events since October to now, trying to assess whether something has changed. There was not much of a change except the strengthening of the economy a little more than expected. By and large the risk to growth is balanced.</p> \n  <p>We can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t declare victory. Price pressures are muted. Underlying inflation is showing little signs of upward movement. So we simply restated policy.</p> \n  <p>He said the commitment to the inflation target remained firmer than ever. Monetary policy will remain accommodative.</p> \n  <p>On exchange rates he said there were three reasons for volatility. The improvement in the economy, the heightened market sensitivity to perceived changes in our communication. Finally the use of language in discussion exchange rate developments that doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t reflect the terms of reference that have been agreed in October in Washington [an agreement between governments on exchange rate policy]</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a263a300171d6e4db1e16a9fb5d2f56b0fed19e9\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a263a300171d6e4db1e16a9fb5d2f56b0fed19e9/27_0_750_450/500.jpg\" alt=\"newdraghi25\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Draghi at the press conference</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: ECB</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n  <p><em>Q:Dollar weakness is what you were probably referring to. It must not be helpful to hear a lower dollar is something [US officials] like. Are we heading to currency war scenario. Also, could you envisage ending QE programme in September.</em></p> \n  <p>We don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t target exchange rates, they are important for growth and price stability. </p> \n  <p>Movements justified by strength of economy are a fact of natiure. Are there other movements caused by use of language, not parts of terms agreed. Whether that has an effect on our inflation path...inflation is our main concern. Too early to assess whether pass through has already taken place, and what will be extent.</p> \n  <p>Some are questioning the extent of pass through, but large exchange rate movements are bound to have an effect. In Washington - ministers and governments recognised excessive volatily or disorderly movements in exchange rates could have adverse effects. [They agreed] we will refrain from competitive devaluations and will not target exchange rates for competitive purposes.</p> \n  <p>On second question, we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have any discussion today, but we never stop the programme abruptly.</p> \n  <p><em>Q: Will you give up you membership of the G30, after ombudsman letter?</em></p> \n  <p>We received the letter from the ombudsman, we will respond in time. There is a procedure. We will assess the letter and the comments and respond.</p> \n  <p><em>Q: German pay negotiations. Could there be broad pay increases across eurozone economy following Germany?</em></p> \n  <p>We observe from a monetary policy angle, where we consider wage growth as a convincing sign of future inflation convergence to our objective. Whether it spreads, depends on conditions of labour market. Tight conditions in Germany, not so in other countries.</p> \n  <p><em>Q: Are there financial stability risks from long term accommodative policy? </em></p> \n  <p>Vice president Vitor Constancio answers. No one can talk about asset price bubbles in euro area. We have overstretched valuations in some places for commercial real estate, high yield corporate bonds but nothing else.... We see prices in market are close to fair value. Same is true of housing prices. Fundamental values are in line with fundamental. Prices of houses increasing by 4%, between 2000 and 2006 they were up 7%. So no general situation of overvaluation in residential properties.</p> \n  <p>Some countries have also taken macroprudential policies to combat excesses.</p> \n  <p>The effect on banks of negative rates, taking into account all our policies, they have been favourable to their profitability which is still low but increasing.

In Asia overnight it hit $1.4328, and although it has eased back from that, it is still up 0.11% so far today at $1.4255.</p> \n  <p>It is partly the expectation of an earlier than expected UK rate rise, given the recent strong data including Wednesday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s employment and wages figures. But of course there is also the weak dollar, hit recently by the expectation that Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tax cuts would raise the already hefty US deficit. More immediately Treasury secretary Steven Mnuchin told Davos the US wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t worried about a flagging greenback. Kit Juckes at Societe Generale said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Steven Mnuchin (US Treasury Secretary) went to Davos and said that a weaker dollar \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcis good for us as it relates to trade and opportunities\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. He also pointed out that that he isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t concerned by where it is in the short term and that in the longer term, its strength is a reflection of the strength of the US economy. In other words, he said very little really, but he said it under snow-plastered slopes and he was speaking to a market where dollar bulls have been under the cosh. A few more capitulated.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Against the euro the pound is pretty flat, down just 0.01% at \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.1473 ahead of the latest European Central Bank meeting. But the euro is up against the dollar, 0.11% better at $1.2421.</p> \n  <p>The strength of the euro presents a problem for ECB president Mario Draghi. If he appears too bulllish at hinting at an end to the bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s QE programme, the euro will appreciate even further. And that would keep a lid on inflation which is already below the bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s target. Equally, he cannot ignore the improving European economy. Michael Hewson at CMC Markets explains:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>With headline inflation remaining well below its 2% target rate at 1.4% and an economy that continues to show decent levels of economic activity the ECB is faced with having to navigate the minefield of guiding markets over the tightrope of communicating a credible timeline for stimulus reduction and interest rate policy, while trying to move CPI back to target against the difficulty of a rising currency. </p> \n   <p>Since the beginning of 2017 the euro has risen 18% against the US dollar and could well rise even further given yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s remarks by US Treasury Secretary Mnuchin.<strong> </strong></p> \n   <p>Last week ECB vice president Vitor Constancio along with Austria\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ewald Nowotny expressed concern about recent exchange rate movements. These concerns are likely to have increased in recent days which will make today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s press conference by ECB President Mario Draghi much more interesting. He can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t very well ignore the improving outlook but if he comes across as too bullish the euro could well be well on the way to the 1.3000 level by the end of this quarter.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Naeem Aslam, chief market analyst at Think Markets, said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Draghi would have to adopt a delicate approach and seek a strategy which stops the euro from firming further. The only way out of this situation for him would be to emphasize that the process of the rate hikes is not within sight yet. The market is expecting a rate hike in 2019 from the ECB, Draghi would have to pull a rabbit out of hat in order to convince the market that rate hike isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t on the agenda and market participants are getting ahead of themselves.</p> \n   <p>We do think that overly dovish statement by the European central bank is priced in the euro to some extent. If Draghi fails to convince the market or if he doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t sound as dovish as the market is expecting, we think that the euro can take off from here. I think the risk to the downside for the euro are limited, it is the upside move which would be more exciting. </p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p><strong>NF</strong></p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2018-01-25T09:35:55.305Z\">at 9.35am GMT</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5a699fbae4b0473d0bc1006d\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-01-25T09:14:06.963Z\">9.14am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6b01f8328d4d3d09f9d57f014effee666cffec85\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6b01f8328d4d3d09f9d57f014effee666cffec85/0_0_3500_2518/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Swiss police officers on the roof of the Davos Congress Hotel this morning.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"719\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Swiss police officers on the roof of the Davos Congress Hotel this morning.</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Denis Balibouse/Reuters</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5a699c38e4b00f225a1c77eb\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-01-25T08:59:11.454Z\">8.59am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Theresa May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Conservative Party has confirmed she will hold social media giants to account in Davos:</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/CCHQPress/status/956450450433339392\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Today, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/theresa_may?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@theresa_may</a> will put pressure on social media companies to stop providing a platform for terror, extremism and child abuse.

                "bodyText":"A late PS, from the Associated Press\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Pan Pylas on the moment Trump arrived at the World Economic Forum. One way to get President Donald Trump to stop and talk at the World Economic Forum: wield a book about him. On his way into the World Economic Forum, Trump stopped and talked for about ten seconds to one delegate who was brandishing a copy of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153God and Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd by Stephen E. Strang. He then proceeded to hold the book aloft in his left hand. Trump is the first U.S. president to attend the World Economic Forum since Bill Clinton back in 2000. Trump is holding a series of meetings and is due to deliver a speech on Friday in which he will argue that what is good for the U.S. economy is beneficial for the global economy. And finally, readers will be keen to know that Donald Trump is probably tucked up in bed. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the final dispatch: Motorcade arrived at the Intercontinental at 9:23. Pool did not see POTUS get out. He will sleep here tonight. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s all from us until tomorrow! Thanks for reading and commenting. GW Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s some colour from Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s dinner with business leaders, from the White House press pack: President Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s eyes narrowed, as he looked a bit tired by the jetlag and long trip. But he seemed to enjoy the camaraderie with businessmen, joking with them about their success and lofty responsibilities, and nodding in agreement as they spoke about their large manufacturing capacity and thousands of US-based employees. Among the topics discussed: Kanye West\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s role in designing Adidas shoes, Mack Trucks made by Volvo, Nestl\u00c3\u00a9\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s non-chocolate business portfolio. Among Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s asides: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153When he says he works for Siemens, he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the president of Siemens!...Wow, that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s big!....Good luck with the G.E. purchase.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Trump spoke about the thriving American economy \u00e2\u20ac\u201c crediting his tax policies, deregulation and his role as a cheerleader for American business. Soros then claims the bitcoin price will be propped by up by dictators, who use it to \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcbuild their nest eggs abroad\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Q: As a former currency trader (who beat the Bank of England on Black Wednesday) what do you think of cryptocurrencies? Bitcoin is not a currency, Soros replies. A currency is supposed to be a stable store of value, and a currency that can fluctuate 25% in a day can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be used to pay wages It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a speculation, based on a misunderstanding. Soros suggest the EU should help Africa\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy develop, if it wants to address the migration crisis. Onto questions. Q: What should be done to tackle the technology giants? It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a very complicated issue, Soros replies. It requires the full-time attention of those who formulate and enforce new laws. I put my faith in them, especially commissioner Vestigar who has done so much to enforce the laws - and made an award against Google. Q: If you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t like social media companies, why do you buy shares in them? calls out a diner from the back of the room. Soros doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t reply (I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m not sure he heard). Instead he takes a question about migration, saying he cares about refugees because he was one himself; he came to Britain and was better treated than refugees arriving in Europe today. Another punchy quote from Soros: On Europe, Soros suggests that a multi-speed, multi-track approach would be more successful. This would allow Britain to rejoin the EU in the future without having to commit to joining the euro, explained Soros (who hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t given up hope that Brexit won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t happen). George Soros then turns his guns at the technology sector. In a blistering attack, he accuses social media companies of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153deliberately engineering addiction\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, which is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153particularly harmful\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd for adolescents. He accuses them of inducing customers to give up their autonomy too. Soros says there are similarities between internet platforms and gambling platforms - pointing out that casinos have developed techniques to hook customers so they keep gambling even when they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve run out of money. But... while tech giants may think they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re masters of the universe, they are actually just slaves to preserving their dominant position Soros continues. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s only a matter of time before the monopoly of the US IT giants is broken, he declares: Davos is a good place to announce that their days are numbered. Regulation and taxation will be their undoing. I see Trump as a purely temporary phenomenon which will disappear in 2020, or earlier, Soros says - winning a laugh from his audience as they tuck into their chicken, potatoes and spinach. Soros adds that he expects a Democratic landslide in 2018. America must recognise the reality that North Korea has become a nuclear power, Soros continues. There is no military action that can prevent what has already happened. The only sensible strategy is to accept reality\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6.and come to terms with North Koreas as a nuclear power. That means working with China to find a solution. Soros says that the survival of our whole civilisation is at stake, due to the rise of Kim Jong Un in North Korea and Donald Trump in the United States. They both seem to be willing to risk a nuclear war to keep themselves in power. At another dinner in Davos, billionaire businessman-turned-philanthopist George Soros is giving his views on the state of the world. He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s warning that open societies are in crisis, with various forms of dictatorship on the rise - such as Vladimir Putin\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Russia. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153In the United States, President Trump would like to establish a mafia state, but can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, Soros continues, because America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s institutions, constitution and its \u00e2\u20ac\u0153vibrant civil society\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t allow it. If you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re just tuning in, here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our news story about the prospect of Donald Trump visiting the UK later this year: UK government officials have been updating the British press about Theresa May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meeting with Donald Trump this afternoon, shortly after he arrived at WEF (and brought it to a standstill). Mark Knoller, CBS News White House Correspondent, has details of Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s dinner with European business chiefs: Donald Trump is now sitting down for diner with the bosses of some of Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest companies. Mark Tucker, the chairman of HSBC, and Punit Renjen, the chief executive of Deloitte, are flying the flag for Britain - according to this guest list from the White House press pack: President Donald J. Trump Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, Department of State Secretary Kirstjen Nielson, Department of Homeland Security General H.R. McMaster, National Security Advisor Gary Cohn, Director of the National Economic Council Kasper Rorsted, Adidas (Apparel)\u00e2\u20ac\u201dGermany Joe Kaeser, Siemens AG (Tech)\u00e2\u20ac\u201dGermany Heinrich Hiesinger, Thyssenkrupp AG (Industrials)\u00e2\u20ac\u201dGermany Eldar Saetre, Statoil ASA (Energy)\u00e2\u20ac\u201dNorway Mark Schneider, Nestle SA (Food and Beverage)\u00e2\u20ac\u201dSwitzerland Vas Narasimhan, Novartis AG (Pharmaceutical)\u00e2\u20ac\u201dSwitzerland Mark Tucker, HSBC (Financial Services)\u00e2\u20ac\u201dUK Patrick Pouyanne, Total SA (Energy)\u00e2\u20ac\u201dFrance Carlos Brito, Anheuser-Busch InBev NV (Food and Beverage)\u00e2\u20ac\u201dBelgium Rajeev Suri, Nokia Corporation (Technology)\u00e2\u20ac\u201dFinland Punit Renjen, Deloitte (Consulting)\u00e2\u20ac\u201dUK Martian Lundstedt, AB Volvo (Auto)\u00e2\u20ac\u201dSweden Werner Baumann, Bayer AG (Pharmaceutical)\u00e2\u20ac\u201dGermany Bill McDermott, SAP SE (Technology)\u00e2\u20ac\u201dGermany Ulrich Spiesshofer, ABB Ltd (Manufacturing)\u00e2\u20ac\u201dSwitzerland \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 This list was amended on 26 January 2018 to correct inaccurate details provided by the White House press office. The spelling of Carlos Brito\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s first name was corrected from Carols, and the location of Anheuser-Busch InBev NV\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s headquarters has been corrected from the Netherlands to Belgium. President Trump is likely to face protests if and when his visit to the UK takes place, even if it is just a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153working visit\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. For a start, Liberal Democrat deputy leader Jo Swinson pulled no punches, saying: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Trump is a dangerous, misogynistic racist and is deserving of the protests he will undoubtedly face. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153If and when he comes to the UK the Liberal Democrats will be at front and centre of the protests.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The White House says Theresa May and Donald Trump discussed plans for a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153working visit\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to London. That may mean that it won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be a full-blown state visit. A working visit would mean less pomp and ceremony (and probably not a visit to see the Queen). Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the official statement (which includes that all-important nod to the Special Relationship). President Donald J. Trump met today with Prime Minister Theresa May of the United Kingdom. The President and Prime Minister discussed joint efforts to ensure the enduring defeat of ISIS and other jihadist terrorist organizations in Syria and Iraq. They discussed the importance of confronting Iran\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s destructive behavior across the Middle East and fundamental flaws in the Iran nuclear deal. The leaders committed to expanded trade between the United States and the United Kingdom, as well as how the two countries can work together to ensure all nations engage in fair and reciprocal trade practices. The two leaders also discussed plans for a working visit to London in the coming months and affirmed the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153special relationship\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd between the two countries is stronger than ever. Donald Trump emerged from his meetings a little while ago, and briefly chatted with delegates who hadn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t been driven away by security. He said his first day at Davos had been \u00e2\u20ac\u0153really good\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and \u00e2\u20ac\u0153very successful\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, before calling it a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153very great day\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the key quote (with thanks to the White House press corp) \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I think the real message is we want great prosperity and we want great peace and I think that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the message. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been going really well. A lot of people are coming back to the United States. We are seeing tremendous investment and today has been a very exciting day. Very great day and great for our country. Thank you very much.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s more details: Q: Is America great? Trump: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s great\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Q: Is everybody else great? \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Everyone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s great,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Trump said, turning his head toward the questioner as he walked through the convention hallway. Donald Trump may be in the spotlight in Davos today, but it was Wednesday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s comments by US Treasury secretary Steven Mnuchin about the dollar which caused ructions at the European Central Bank. Mnuchin said that a weaker dollar was good for American trade, and ECB president Mario Draghi suggested this was not in the spirit of an agreement between governments made in October in Washington. Draghi said: Ministers and governments recognised excessive volatily or disorderly movements in exchange rates could have adverse effects. [They agreed to] refrain from competitive devaluations and not target exchange rates for competitive purposes. He said the current exchange rate volatility was partly due to\u00e2\u20ac\ufffdthe use of language in discussing exchange rate developments that doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t reflect the terms of reference that have been agreed.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Mnuchin\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s comments yesterday sent an already weak dollar still lower. Marco Valli, chief European economist at UniCredit Bank, said: [The ECB] remains fairly relaxed about the effects of a stronger euro, but bluntly criticised the recent foreign exchange messages from the US administration, seen as violating the long-standing international commitment to avoid competitive devaluation. And of course Donald Trump has tweeted about his meeting with Theresa May: Theresa May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meeting with Donald Trump at Davos took place shortly after she gave a special address to the World Economic Forum (highlights start here) May focused on the opportunities and threats of new technology, and Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s efforts to equip its economy for the challenges ahead. Paul Sheard, chief global economist at S&amp;P Global Ratings, tells us that she missed a trick by not also talking about Brexit, and UK-US relations. Prime Minister May made a strong pitch for the UK to be seen as a global leader in AI and regulation-friendly innovation, but \u00e2\u20ac\ufffdI thought her not spending some time laying out the UK government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s latest thinking on Brexit - particularly what it aspires for the all-important future relationship - was a bit of a missed opportunity. We don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know what details still need to be finalised, so it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s possible that officials can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t actually get Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s visit nailed down. One possible hitch might be the certainty of large protests against the US president from British citizens appalled by his view on climate change, accusations of sexual harassment, the Muslim ban, his America First policies - to name just four. Trump is reportedly rather worried about facing major protests - something he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been spared in Davos, due to its ultra-tight security net. Bloomberg reported this week that the US president had asked May to make sure he got a good reception. In one phone conversation during 2017, Trump complained to May over the criticism he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d been getting in British newspapers. Amid warnings that Trump would face protests in the streets when he arrived, he told the prime minister he would not be coming to the U.K. until she could promise him a warm welcome. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s official. Barring a few details, US president Donald Trump will visit the United Kingdom later this year. May and Trump asked their respective officials to work on \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcfinalising the details\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 of a trip, at the end of their bilateral meeting here in the World Economic Forum. A Downing Street spokesman says that: The PM and President concluded by asking officials to work together on finalising the details of a visit by the President to the UK later this year.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no word on when it might happen, though. Downing Street also say that the two leaders discussed Brexit, Iran, terrorism, and worries that jobs could lost at Bombardier\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s factory in Northern Ireland due to the trade dispute with Boeing. The spokesman says: The two leaders began by discussing Bombardier, with the PM reiterating the importance of the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s jobs in Northern Ireland. The PM and the President discussed Iran, and the need to work together to combat the destabilising activity which it is conducting in the region, including ballistic missile development, and continuing efforts to ensure Iran does not develop nuclear weapons. They also agreed on the importance of continuing to stand side-by-side in the fight against Daesh in Syria and elsewhere. The Prime Minister updated the President on the good progress which had been made in the Brexit negotiations so far. The two leaders reiterated their desire for a strong trading relationship post-Brexit, which would be in the interests of both countries. NEWSFLASH: Theresa May and Donald Trump have asked officials to work on \u00e2\u20ac\u0153finalising the details of a visit by the President to the UK later this year\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, Downing Street said. More to follow. Swiss campaign group CAMPAX have hung a Trump protest banner on a mountain at Sargans - about 50 kilometres from Davos. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a photo of the Davos meeting room which Donald Trump and his delegation swept into, a couple of hours ago: There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s still a huge crowd at the bottom of the stairs; I think there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s only one way out.... During his meeting with Benjamin Netanyahu, president Trump suggested that aid would be withheld from the Palestinians if they didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t show respect. He said \u00e2\u20ac\u0153they disrespected our great Vice President\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd (Last November, Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t meet Mike Pence during his visit to the Middle East). Trump said (via the White House pool report): \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The money is on the table. And the money was never off the table. [Yesterday, it was reported that former US secretary of state John Kerry had advised Abbas not to give in to Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s demands] Israeli president Benjamin Netanyahu has returned from his meeting with Trump. He says it was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153excellent\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the White House pool report on the Trump-May meeting: President Trump and PM May sat beside one another in a WEF conference room with aides on each side. Among them on US side: Gary Cohn, HR McMaster, Tillerson, Sarah Sanders. Highlights: Trump \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Its a false rumor\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd that there is tension in the US-UK relationship. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re on the same wavelength in I think every respect\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The two are \u00e2\u20ac\u0153liking each other a lot\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and \u00e2\u20ac\u0153joined at the hip\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd when it comes to the military. He looked at her and said there was nothing that would happen where the US would not be there for Britain. May also reaffirmed the special relationship. When asked about a state visit, May said it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s being discussed now. Trump seconded that. No answers to shouted questions about the far right video retweet [back in November, Trump retweeted several anti-Muslim videos] Donald Trump has also talked about the prospect of a trade deal with the UK, but only in very general terms. Trade between the US and the UK is going to increase \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcmany times\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, Trump said during his meeting with May, adding: The discussions...that will be taking place are going to lead to tremendous increase in trade between our countries, which is great for both in terms of jobs. Q: But what about a state visit to Britain? May and Trump say they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll talk about that during their meeting at Davos. Several people have come down the stairs where Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meetings are taking place. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve spied IMF chief Christine Lagarde, Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier, and Labour\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shadow chancellor John McDonnell. That doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t mean they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve all been meeting the US president - there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s more than one room up there. Q: How large an effect does your communication have on exchange rate? When I said communication I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t mean ECB communication but other people\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s communication. We don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t target exchange rate. When someone says a good exchange rate is good, that is targeting exchange rate. That goes back to years ago before the [recent] terms of agreement were agreed. Q:Why did you chooses September to end QE? Commodities are priced in dollars and could effect inflation data. When we recalibrated programme last October we had a discussion whether it should be six or nine months, and how much. So after that we came out with this educated outcome. In defining our objective we have different definitions, including underlying inflation which excludes energy etc. We target headline inflation, but we look at evidence from other definitions. Q: Oil price has risen significantly since December, could that cancel out strong euro. Yes, although it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not easy to understand exactly the timing of these compensations. That doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t imply we accept a certain level of exchange rate as a good or bad thing. And with that it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s over. Q: how do you feel about ECB communications this year including from individual members, could it be improved. What level of concern was there today about a possible change in US policy [after US dollar comments] Yes there was concern. It was broader than simply the exchange rate, but about broader state of international relations right now. If this leads to an unwarranted tightening of monetary policy we would have to think about our monetary policy strategy. On communications, you see same thing in other jurisdictions. All the communiations since Dec have in common three characteristics. All based on commitment to objective of inflation target. None questioned the sequence whereby interest rates will stay at current levels well past end of asset buying programme. Well past was emphasised. Q: Some commentators factoring in an interest rate rise this year? At its current level does euro reflect fundamentals? Based on today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s data I see very few chances at all that interest rates can be raised this year. On euro, we should ask is it produced by strength of economy, or by statements, or by monetary policy elsewhere. Q: Another question on the G30 membership, could it compromise ECB? Draghi repeats his previous answer, but adds ombudsman said there was no evidence the meeting influenced ECB, and ECB must have contacts with other financial participants. Q: Will differences of views within ECB deepen on exit strategy? At March meeting, will you give restatement of forward guidance. I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think the differences are as substantive as they were on other occasions. Some are a little more confident, if they live where inflation is rising. But there are not deep existential differences. But there may be differences on when to say certain things, when to move forward. Markets have expectations on path, but also on dates, timelines. In March we will assess how things stand at that point in time. Away from Davis briefly and back with the ECB, and president Mario Draghi said at his press conference that domestic price pressures remained muted, inflation has yet to show a convincing upward trend. He said the recent foreign exchange volatility is a source of uncertainty. An ample degree of monetary stimulus is necessary. On the economy, he said there could be positive growth surprise in the near term. But there were downside risks remain relating to global factors, forex. More on inflation: he said it was expected to rise gradually over the medium term, supported by our measures, rising wage growth etc He then repeats his usual call to governments to do more: To reap the ull benefits from monetary policy measures, other policy areas must contribute. Structural reform in euro area countries needs to be stepped up . On fiscal policies, the case is strengthened for rebuilding fiscal buffers, especially in in countries where debt remains high. Strengthening EMU remains a priority. Now for questions: Q: What will have to happen for the exchange rate to be a problem for the inflation target? And you said in December you would revisit guidance [on the bond buying programme] early this year? Draghi says there is confusion about the guidance comment, there was no difference between what was said at the December meeting and what Draghi said at the press conference. All that was said was there would have to be discussions about the need to have a discussion in the early part of the year. That discussion hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t really started. We went through the events since October to now, trying to assess whether something has changed. There was not much of a change except the strengthening of the economy a little more than expected. By and large the risk to growth is balanced. We can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t declare victory. Price pressures are muted. Underlying inflation is showing little signs of upward movement. So we simply restated policy. He said the commitment to the inflation target remained firmer than ever. Monetary policy will remain accommodative. On exchange rates he said there were three reasons for volatility. The improvement in the economy, the heightened market sensitivity to perceived changes in our communication. Finally the use of language in discussion exchange rate developments that doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t reflect the terms of reference that have been agreed in October in Washington [an agreement between governments on exchange rate policy] Q:Dollar weakness is what you were probably referring to. It must not be helpful to hear a lower dollar is something [US officials] like. Are we heading to currency war scenario. Also, could you envisage ending QE programme in September. We don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t target exchange rates, they are important for growth and price stability. Movements justified by strength of economy are a fact of natiure. Are there other movements caused by use of language, not parts of terms agreed. Whether that has an effect on our inflation path...inflation is our main concern. Too early to assess whether pass through has already taken place, and what will be extent. Some are questioning the extent of pass through, but large exchange rate movements are bound to have an effect. In Washington - ministers and governments recognised excessive volatily or disorderly movements in exchange rates could have adverse effects. [They agreed] we will refrain from competitive devaluations and will not target exchange rates for competitive purposes. On second question, we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have any discussion today, but we never stop the programme abruptly. Q: Will you give up you membership of the G30, after ombudsman letter? We received the letter from the ombudsman, we will respond in time. There is a procedure. We will assess the letter and the comments and respond. Q: German pay negotiations. Could there be broad pay increases across eurozone economy following Germany? We observe from a monetary policy angle, where we consider wage growth as a convincing sign of future inflation convergence to our objective. Whether it spreads, depends on conditions of labour market. Tight conditions in Germany, not so in other countries. Q: Are there financial stability risks from long term accommodative policy? Vice president Vitor Constancio answers. No one can talk about asset price bubbles in euro area. We have overstretched valuations in some places for commercial real estate, high yield corporate bonds but nothing else.... We see prices in market are close to fair value. Same is true of housing prices. Fundamental values are in line with fundamental. Prices of houses increasing by 4%, between 2000 and 2006 they were up 7%. So no general situation of overvaluation in residential properties. Some countries have also taken macroprudential policies to combat excesses. The effect on banks of negative rates, taking into account all our policies, they have been favourable to their profitability which is still low but increasing. So negative rates have been absorbed by banking sector. Draghi talks about fiscal buffers. Interest rates will at some point stop being so low. At that point all governments will want to have policy space, so budget consideration now when the time is good is favourable. NF We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve now got video footage of Theresa May and Donald Trump meeting. Trump says he and May have a mutual feeling of \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcliking each other a lot\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. He says there have been a false rumour out there, which he wants to rebut. He tells May: We have great respect for everything you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re doing, and we love your country. We think it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s truly good. Trump says that the US and the UK are working on economic development, trade and military issues. We are very much joined at the hip when it comes to the military Theresa May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meeting with Trump is over - she\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s departed the scene without speaking to the press. Next up.... Israel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s president Benjamin Netanyahu. He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s gone up the stairs with a small group, presumably to meet Trump. Curiously, Theresa May and a few advisors came down from the Trump meeting.....vanished into another room...reappeared and then went back up again. OK, it looks like Trump and May have been holding their meeting - and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s nearly over.... White House reporters are travelling with Trump - here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s one of the latest pooled reports: Pool arrived at 2:40 at the conference center after brief motorcade through town that includes some small souvenir shops, ski shops, restaurants. There were some JP Morgan flags posted on the route as well. The smattering of onlookers included a few waving American flags and some young kids in ski helmets. A few more photos of Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s arrival: I managed a short video clip of Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s arrival: President Trump and his entourage then move up the stairs, to a constant clicking of cameras. One delegate welcomes him to Switzerland. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Thank you very much. Great country.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Trump replies. He then continues up another flight of stairs, to an area where most delegates (and journalists) aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t allowed. A security guard is now posted there to prevent any intruders. Trump arrives to his audience; reporters shout out a few questions. Asked what his message is to Davos, he replies \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Peace and prosperity\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. There are a few laughs. Here he comes...... The entire World Economic Forum has gone into a weird semi-lockdown. Half the delegates are crowding around, in a hush, waiting for Trump. The rest are milling around in the corridors and lounges, or getting on with business. Curiously, most delegates are waiting in silence..... President Trump is about to arrive at the World Economic Forum. People are crowding around the security cordon and flocking on the balcony , desperate for a glimpse. Theresa May ends her speech by calling on the World Economic Forum to work together to solve the problems she identified. The UK has a proud history of stepping up and delivering progress that can deliver for all, she says: Let\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s renew our commitment to collaboration - and set ourselves on a path to benefit all our people. Now, and for generations to come. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s it. No questions. Theresa May says technology companies employ some of the brightest minds in the world - they should be able to design a system where unacceptable content is deleted automatically. No-one wants to be known as a a platform for terrorism, or the best place for child pornography, she points out. She says there are three key priorities: Considering whether new regulations are needed for these tech platforms Investors must think about the social impact of the firms they invest in. Working on the ethical implications of Artificial Intelligence Theresa May is now challenging social media companies to do more to protect users - especially children. We want Britain to be a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153World leader in innovation-friendly regulation\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd she says (not the catchiest slogan). That means being the safest place in the world to be online, while also being a great place to run a digital business. Technology companies must \u00e2\u20ac\u0153step up to their responsibilities\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, the PM says sternly. Companies simply cannot stand by while their platforms are used to facilitate child abuse, modern slavery, or the spreading of terrorist and extremist content. Theresa May singles out Uber as an example of the potential,and problems, created by technology. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s an innovative company, but it has also got things wrong - with safety issues and concerns about its treatment of workers The solution isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t to shut them down, but to improve the system so companies work better. Employment law must protect workers and give businesses the flexibility it needs, says the PM - it can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t just be a one-way street. Maybe 2/3 full was an overstatement.... May is pitching to businesses here, saying the government is raising Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s digital skills for the 21st century. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re also at the forefront of low-carbon technologies, she declares. And on artificial intelligence, we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re only at the beginning of what AI can achieve, says May. Those of you up here in Davos mustn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t forget the plight of those who face losing their job after 20 years, says May. We must channel the power of business and government together to harness technology, and make it a force for good, May continues - to address people\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s concerns. I understand the power of business as a force for good. Free markets drive risk-taking that have delivered the great advances of our time. But I also believe in the power of government, she adds. Our new business strategy will make Britain one of the best place in the world to start and run a business, she pledges. Turning to technology, Theresa May says the internet can deliver $2.2 trillion worth of GDP to developing countries. And just last week, a drone saved two boys from drowning off Australia by carrying a float to them. Medical tests show that technology can reduce breast cancer cases by a third. But people are worried about the malevolent impact of technology, she says. Britain will continue to be an advocate of free trade after Brexit, May insists. And she challenges Davos delegates to live up to their commitments, in three ways: The commitments on steel must be implemented. Aid donors must match the UK and help developing countries The World Trade Organisation must do more to keep pace with the global economy - she singles out the service sector, and e-commerce Theresa May begins by saying that last year, she warned that the benefits of free trade weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t being shared fairly, and this risked undermining the global world order. One year on, there are grounds for optimism. Global growth is strengthening. The populism of the far left and far right has not made the progress some predicted, and in the UK, unemployment is at a 40-year low and government and business are working together well. Klaus Schwab, the founder of the World Economic Forum, is introducing Theresa May now. The room is roughly two-thirds full - respectable, not as much as for president Macron last night. Schwab says many Davos attendees were impressed last year, by May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s passionate plea to address global slavery. That work continues this year, he says. Cowbells are ringing across the Davos congress centre (yes, really), to tell delegates that Theresa May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s speech starts soon. The hall is filling up well, but it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not packed out yet. One delegate tells me she\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hoping to hear some clarity on Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s future after Brexit. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a lot of uncertainty right now\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. At the CBI\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s lunch in Davos, Philip Hammond insisted that Britain would leave the EU on 31st March 2019. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a statement of political reality, the chancellor insists. Hammond said Britain should go for something more ambitious than previous deals with the EU. An off-the-shelf Norway or Canada agreement won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t work. Unusually for trade talks, we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re starting from a point where we are already deeply interconnected with highly aligned regulatory systems and close co-operation on defence and security. Should go for something much more ambitious than anything that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s previously been agreed. Former UK cabinet minister and New Labour architect Peter Mandelson was also at the lunch, and pointed out that French president Emmanuel Macron had hosted 140 CEOs at Versailles the other day. Mandelson warned: For France, Brexit is a gift that keeps on giving. Hammond hit back, though, saying you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d get more top CEOs in London on an average day (probably not all meeting a world leader, though!). The European Central Bank has left interest rates unchanged and repeated that its bond buying programme will run until September or beyond if necessary. The ECB added it could increase the programme from its current \u00e2\u201a\u00ac30bn a month if circumstances change: If the outlook becomes less favourable, or if financial conditions become inconsistent with further progress towards a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation, the Governing Council stands ready to increase the asset purchase programme (APP) in terms of size and/or duration. On rates it said they would be kept at present levels \u00e2\u20ac\u0153for an extended period of time, and well past the horizon of the net asset purchases.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Of course the detail will come in president Mario Draghi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s press conference this afternoon, when analysts will be looking for more on the future of the QE programme and when rates might rise. But Draghi must be tempted to keep his cards close to his chest, and avoid anything which could push the euro higher when inflation is still below the bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s target. NF Donald Trump and his team are staying at the Intercontinental Hotel in Davos. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a sensible move from a security point of view; the Intercontinental is at the edge of Davos, rather than slap bang next to the conference centre like the Belvedere (scene of many parties and meeting). It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also up a steep hill, so easier to prevent protests . The White House press pack report that they saw onlookers snapping pictures of the Trump convoy, but no demos on the route. Hello... Business Insider\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Paul Colgan has spotted some anti-Trump protesters outside the conference halls. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s very tight security all around the Davos area, making it hard for demonstrators to travel up the mountain and exercise their democratic rights. You\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d almost think the global elite didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to know what people really think of them.... Chancellor Philip Hammond is cracking some jokes at the CBI\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s lunch with British business chiefs - including one at Theresa May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s expense. He reminds his audience that it was a walk in the mountain air that inspired the prime minister to call a general election last year*. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m discouraging her from taking any strolls, Hammond grins. * - (wiping out her majority) Boris Johnson once said that he was put off from visiting parts of New York by the very real risk of meeting Donald Trump. Well in Davos, you also run the very real risk of running into Piers Morgan. The UK journalist and TV personality has done well, though, securing an exclusive sit-down interview with the US president. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s due to air on Sunday night, with clips released on Friday morning. Davos delegates without a swanky lunch invite (or the time to go) are being fed individual jars of pasta dishes. And it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s great fun to watch the global elite scrambling to over each other whenever the waiting staff emerge with a new tray of goodies. Your humble correspondent finally gets a pot, balances it on his iPad - and is promptly mistaken for a waiter by a fellow delegate who tries to nab it off me. Maybe it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time for a career change... Trump has touched down in Switzerland, but there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no sign of him in the Congress Hall yet. Ireland\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s leader, Leo Varadkar, is in Davos -- and refusing to accept that Apple got an unfairly good tax deal from the Irish government. In 2016, the EC ruled that Apple had received \u00e2\u201a\u00ac13bn of state aid. Last November, it referred Ireland to the European Court of Justice because Dublin hadn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t started reclaiming the cash. According to Varadkar, this process will start soon.....but he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not rolling over in the ECJ. Speaking of the CBI, UK retail sales have grown modestly in January so far, according to its latest distributive trades survey, but at a slower pace than anticipated. The survey showed a balance of +12 for January, down from +20 in December. Sales for the time of year were the weakest compared to the norm for more than four years, said the CBI. Orders to suppliers also fell, and looking ahead retailers expect similar growth in sales volumes while orders are forecast to be flat. Anna Leach, CBI head of economic intelligence, said: Retailers have seen fairly modest sales growth this month overall, but it is online retailers who have set the pace during the January sales. Household spending will remain under pressure this year from higher inflation and low wage growth, which will continue to weigh on sales growth in the retail sector. NF British business chiefs and media leaders have headed to a lunchtime event with chancellor Philip Hammond, hosted by the CBI. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a traditional part of the Davos week for the UK delegation, but this year it could be a little frostier than usual. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s because CBI chief Caroline Fairbairn declared last week that Britain must remain in the customs union after Brexit. I imagine the Treasury weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t best pleased by this intervention (unless we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve outsourced Brexit negotiations to the CBI...a safer bet than using Carillion, anyway). But we understand that Hammond won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t use his speech to rebut Fairbairn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s call, and will cover other issues.... My colleague Larry Elliott\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s there, so we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll have more details soon.... Theresa May has given an interview to Bloomberg. She spoke about the revelations about sexual harassment at a charity dinner in London, saying: I was frankly appalled when I read the report of this Presidents Club event. I thought that that sort of attitude of the objectification of women was something that was in the past. Sadly, what that event showed is that there is still a lot more work for us to do. That chimes with Malala Yousafzai\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s comments this morning. Our Politics Live blog has more details: We hear that Theresa May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meeting with Donald Trump will take place shortly after her speech (which starts at 2pm, or 1pm GMT). It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s likely to focus on foreign affairs issues like Syria and North Korea. Theresa May has now ended her private meeting (perhaps a roundtable?) and swept the WEF congress hall in a gaggle of aides. Down the stairs at pace, she\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s quickly into another secure section of this rabbit-warren of a building. Disappointingly she didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t stop for questions - a camera had been lined up, just in case. Still, we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll hear from her in a couple of hours. Chancellor Philip Hammond has told the Davos panel on financial risks that Europe will lose out if the City suffers after Brexit. New York and Singapore would benefit from new business, he says, not European cities. The idea that you can recreate London\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s financial centre anywhere else is a fantasy. Hammond also says that financial services are very important to the UK side, and \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the centre of our negotiating strategy\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Those who say the financial sector will not be part of a deal have not been looking at the numbers, he says. We have a trade deficit of \u00c2\u00a3100bn with Europe, and a surplus in services of \u00c2\u00a340bn, Hammond explains, adding: The only deal that can be done is one that can be fair to both parties One that included trade and not services would not be fair to the UK. Theresa May and her entourage have just swept through the Davos congress centre, into a private meeting room. Alas media are certainly not allowed in to listen. Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s treasury secretary, Stephen Mnuchin is also on the panel on the future of finance. Yesterday, Mnuchin sent the dollar tumbling by saying a weak currency is good for exports. Today, he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s very relaxed about the whole issue, saying: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153In the short term where the dollar is is not a concern of mine. It is not something I spend a lot of time thinking about.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Mnuchin also denies that America is trying to launch a trade war, insisting that the US doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want less trade it wants \u00e2\u20ac\u0153fair trade\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. The big debate on financial stability is also underway. Christine Lagarde, managing director of the IMF, says trade is one of the factors leading to stronger growth. When asked about the risks of a trade war, she says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Who would want to do anything that would lead to weaker growth? Al Gore, former US vice-president, has suggested that Donald Trump can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t disrupt the battle against climate change - especially if he isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t reelected in 2020. Speaking on a panel here in Davos, Gore says there is strong momentum to fight climate change. Several governors of our largest states, hundreds of cities, and thousands of US businesses are now ensuring that the US will not just meet, but exceed, the commitments it made in the Paris Agreement. Gore explains that America can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t legally leave the Paris Agreement (to act to limit rising global temperatures) until after the next presidential election. And if there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a new president (at which point Al Gore offers a silent prayer), they could give 30 days notice and America would be back in the agreement. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the good news. The bad news, Gore says, is that the maximum action that is political feasible falls far short of the minimum of what is needed to battle climate change. So, we need to move the boundary of what politicians can do. You can watch the panel live, here. Back in the UK, and mortgage approvals by Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s banks fell to their lowest level since April 2013 in December, according to trade association UK Finance. Banks approved 36,115 mortgages for housebuying, down from 39,007 in November and 19% lower than a year ago. Annual growth in consumer credit slipped from 0.8% to 0.7%. And this could give the Bank of England a problem: NF Newsflash: Theresa May has met with South Africa\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s deputy president, Cyril Ramaphosa.....and there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not a fondue dish in sight either. Theresa May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s former press chief has caused a stir this morning, accusing the PM of spending last year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Davos \u00e2\u20ac\u0153sitting in a hotel eating fondue\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd rather than meeting fellow world leaders and business chiefs. Writing in The Times, Katy Perrior claims the PM struggled to schmooze at the 2017 World Economic Forum, and even turned up with the wrong sort of footwear (her new \u00c2\u00a3120 snowboots should work better this time). Perrior claiming business leaders were frozen out by May: \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcElsewhere they get personal audiences with President Macron in France and Malcolm Turnbull in Australia but not so much as a digestive biscuit from the PM. \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcDoes she have any idea how frustrating that is for them? Other world leaders are on a charm offensive, desperate to woo major businesses to their shores. \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcAs we count down to post-Brexit Britain, she would do well to spend less time enjoying the fondue and more time meeting and greeting.\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 More here. Personally, I was disappointed not to see May meeting business chiefs and academics at Oxford University\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s excellent Davos cheese and port party last night (maybe I left too early #bestbehaviour ) Perrior also claims May turned down the chance to meet Alibaba\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Jack Ma last year. He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s still at Davos, so there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s still time to make amends, prime minister... Kristin Lemkau, JP Morgan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chief marketing officer, sums up Davos so far: Sterling continues to go from strength to strength. In Asia overnight it hit $1.4328, and although it has eased back from that, it is still up 0.11% so far today at $1.4255. It is partly the expectation of an earlier than expected UK rate rise, given the recent strong data including Wednesday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s employment and wages figures. But of course there is also the weak dollar, hit recently by the expectation that Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tax cuts would raise the already hefty US deficit. More immediately Treasury secretary Steven Mnuchin told Davos the US wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t worried about a flagging greenback. Kit Juckes at Societe Generale said: Steven Mnuchin (US Treasury Secretary) went to Davos and said that a weaker dollar \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcis good for us as it relates to trade and opportunities\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. He also pointed out that that he isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t concerned by where it is in the short term and that in the longer term, its strength is a reflection of the strength of the US economy. In other words, he said very little really, but he said it under snow-plastered slopes and he was speaking to a market where dollar bulls have been under the cosh. A few more capitulated. Against the euro the pound is pretty flat, down just 0.01% at \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.1473 ahead of the latest European Central Bank meeting. But the euro is up against the dollar, 0.11% better at $1.2421. The strength of the euro presents a problem for ECB president Mario Draghi. If he appears too bulllish at hinting at an end to the bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s QE programme, the euro will appreciate even further. And that would keep a lid on inflation which is already below the bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s target. Equally, he cannot ignore the improving European economy. Michael Hewson at CMC Markets explains: With headline inflation remaining well below its 2% target rate at 1.4% and an economy that continues to show decent levels of economic activity the ECB is faced with having to navigate the minefield of guiding markets over the tightrope of communicating a credible timeline for stimulus reduction and interest rate policy, while trying to move CPI back to target against the difficulty of a rising currency. Since the beginning of 2017 the euro has risen 18% against the US dollar and could well rise even further given yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s remarks by US Treasury Secretary Mnuchin. Last week ECB vice president Vitor Constancio along with Austria\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ewald Nowotny expressed concern about recent exchange rate movements. These concerns are likely to have increased in recent days which will make today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s press conference by ECB President Mario Draghi much more interesting. He can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t very well ignore the improving outlook but if he comes across as too bullish the euro could well be well on the way to the 1.3000 level by the end of this quarter. Naeem Aslam, chief market analyst at Think Markets, said: Draghi would have to adopt a delicate approach and seek a strategy which stops the euro from firming further. The only way out of this situation for him would be to emphasize that the process of the rate hikes is not within sight yet. The market is expecting a rate hike in 2019 from the ECB, Draghi would have to pull a rabbit out of hat in order to convince the market that rate hike isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t on the agenda and market participants are getting ahead of themselves. We do think that overly dovish statement by the European central bank is priced in the euro to some extent. If Draghi fails to convince the market or if he doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t sound as dovish as the market is expecting, we think that the euro can take off from here. I think the risk to the downside for the euro are limited, it is the upside move which would be more exciting. NF Theresa May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Conservative Party has confirmed she will hold social media giants to account in Davos: Bruce Carnegie-Brown, chairman of Lloyd\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s, says that companies are taking out more insurance against cyber attacks. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It is the fastest growing part of our business\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, Carnegie-Brown says, adding: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Companies are certainly becoming more concerned about the risks.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Lloyd\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s has 30% of the global market, Carnegie-Brown says, with 85% of the business coming from US firms. The insurance market is changing, he says. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153People are more concerned about cyber attack than a fire when it comes to the potential impact on their business.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Carnegie-Brown says he has been floating the idea in Davos that governments might use part of their aid budgets to insure poor developing countries against the cost of natural disasters. Lloyd\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s will pay out almost $5b to the US states affected by the three hurricanes last year but says the world as a whole is under-insured. Malala also warns that world leaders need to invest more in education, to help future generations. Malala Yousafzai, the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s youngest Nobel Prize winner, is speaking at Davos right now, about the importance of giving girls equal rights to education. She\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s explaining that education can play a key role in improving giving the message of equality. So what\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s your message to Trump on the issue of gender equality, asks Miriam Elder of Buzzfeed. Yousafzai says: I get so disappointed to see that people in these high positions openly talk against women, do not accept women as equals, they harass woman. It is just shocking to think that is is happening I hope that women stand up and speak out against it. I hope that people who are involved in such shameful things think about their own daughters, their own mothers, their own close female relations, and just imagine for a second, could they let it happen to them? I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think they would accept that. Malala, who was shot by the Taliban in 2012 after campaigning for girls education, says women must \u00e2\u20ac\u0153raise up their voice\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, and reach the ears and minds of those who still hold views which we hoped didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t exist any more Just in: chancellor Philip Hammond says he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u0153very happy\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd with the strength of sterling, which has hit its highest level since the Brexit vote. Foreign exchange rates are a big story at Davos, after America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Treasury secretary Stephen Mnuchin seemed to hint that Washington liked a weaker dollar Some of President\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s top officials are briefing the press again this morning. Commerce secretary Wilbur Ross is in combative mood, denying that America is protectionist - even though it just slapped new tariffs on washing machines and solar panels from Asia. Ross also says that America is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153more interested\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in bilateral trade deals than multilateral ones - which doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t bode very well for the ongoing NAFTA negotiations. John McDonnell, Labour\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shadow chancellor, is also in Davos, and bringing a warning for the global elite: McDonnell will be telling top business people and world leaders that they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re dangerously insulated from the problems outside WEF\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s security cordon and swanky parties: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Many of those attending the World Economic Forum have been patting themselves on the back as international growth figures have begun to pick up. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153But they should be worried. In the real world, outside the Davos bubble of Alpine restaurants and chalets, the global economic system they have built isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t working for billions of people. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153And just as Davos faces the risk of an avalanche this week, growth for a few risks a political and social avalanche unless there is fundamental change to our rigged economic system. Philip Hammond, the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chancellor of the Exchequer, is also at Davos. He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been giving his views about artificial intelligence at a Microsoft breakfast, saying: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We are at the point where computers move from being dumb and fast to being smart and fast.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Hammond says AI is going to be disruptive and managing the process is the key to it being accepted, warning: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153To many it will seem to be a big threat to their prosperity and livelihoods\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Losers would include members of the middle class but it was important to embrace the new technology rather than resist it. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Let\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not create a generation of 21st Century Luddites who feel the only chance of survival is to resist change.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Hammond said AI would affect the jobs market, would disrupt business models and had ethical dimensions including privacy and the way new technology could be used in wars. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The choice is simple: do we look inward or outward, look to the future or cleave to the past?\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Here are some photos of Donald Trump setting off to Davos last night: Good morning from Davos. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s another big day at the World Economic Forum, with Theresa May giving a keynote speech this afternoon \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and meeting Donald Trump on the sidelines. The UK PM is expected to put technology giants under pressure to clean up their act and tackle extreme content. She\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll say: Investors can make a big difference here by ensuring trust and safety issues are being properly considered. And I urge them to do so. These companies simply cannot stand by while their platforms are used to facilitate child abuse, modern slavery or the spreading of terrorist and extremist content.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Her meeting with Trump will be a chance to talk trade after Brexit, discuss terrorism, and perhaps patch up that Special Relationship after the row over the US embassy. As Beth Rigby from Sky News puts it: The two leaders are expected to focus on areas where there is common ground in international affairs: North Korea, as well as eradicating Islamic State in Syria and northern Iraq. They might touch on Iran. But the thornier issue of Russian aggression in Europe is less likely to be raised as the Prime Minister seeks to soothe relations and not stoke further tensions. President Trump set off for Davos last night - part of the biggest US delegation ever. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be hearing more from his team this morning. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also masses of other events, covering gender equality, financial stability, tax avoidance and climate change.
