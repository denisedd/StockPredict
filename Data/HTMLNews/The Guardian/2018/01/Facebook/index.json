                "body":"<p>Life is tough for high street retailers and likely to get worse in 2018. That\u2019s the clear message following <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/jan/09/cost-of-living-squeeze-dents-christmas-high-street-spending\" title=\"\">a difficult Christmas</a> for most shopping chains and signals from the banks that they aim to bring a three-year bonanza of cheap consumer credit to an end, or at least severely restrict its further growth.</p> <p>Supermarkets were among the survivors as shoppers chose to spend a few extra pounds on food to cope with inflation. But that meant cutbacks elsewhere.</p> <p>Clothing, shoes and furniture joined a list of items shoppers decided they could do without \u2013 or, if they needed them, they went online for a cheap deal.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/jan/09/uk-christmas-retail-winners-profits\" title=\"\">Next was among the retailers to enjoy a degree of expansion</a> after it was rescued by healthy online sales. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2018/jan/11/m-and-s-website-sales-marks-spencer\" title=\"\">Marks &amp; Spencer struggled</a> to make any headway after its failure to entice customers to its website.</p> <p>If the health of the high street depends on anyone, it is the big discounters like <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/jan/04/aldi-pay-rise-sales\" title=\"\">Aldi</a> and Lidl in the supermarket wars and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/jan/12/b-and-m-emerges-as-christmas-retail-winner\" title=\"\">B&amp;M</a>, which is the Primark of food shops, selling household brands such as Kellogg\u2019s and Walkers at knock-down prices.</p> <p>But few high streets can survive with just discount shops to add to a smattering of charity outlets, bookies and pawnbrokers.</p> <p>Most towns vie with their neighbours to have at least one department store on their high street or, failing that, some national chains.</p> <p>Not so long ago, when Debenhams seemed like it would be turning up in almost every corner of the country with a new store, this dream appeared to be coming true.</p> <p>John Lewis was another department store that was talked about as a candidate for aiding urban renewal in the unlikeliest of places.</p> <p>The rapid expansion of chains such as New Look, TK Maxx and, more recently, jeweller Pandora has helped keep many smaller centres from looking down at heel.</p> <p>Sadly, Debenhams had a disastrous Christmas, as did House of Fraser, and both have ditched any expansion plans left over from the 2015 boom times. Cutbacks are the order of the day. M&amp;S is already closing stores, mostly in towns that shoppers have long since started driving past.</p> <p>New Look has seen sales fall, while profits at TK Maxx and Pandora are down. John Lewis is doing well although, like Next, all the improvement is online, not in its stores.</p> <p>Soon, even more high streets outside the big cities and successful market towns will have a ghostly pallor.</p> <p>At the root of the problem is the decline in disposable incomes. With inflation at around 3% and wage rises averaging 2.2%, households are struggling to maintain their standard of living. In a post-EU referendum economy, with uncertainty forcing companies to delay investment, average wages don\u2019t look like rising strongly any time soon.</p> <p>There was more bad news in the latest Bank of England study of consumer lending. A survey of high street banks found they were planning to severely restrict the generosity displayed in recent years that has pushed unsecured lending up by around 10% a year.</p> <p>Credit-card balances will be cut back and the length of interest-free periods will be reduced. Cheap loans will be limited to only the safest borrowers.</p> <p>This move is a response to concerns that the major banks had begun to lend recklessly, repeating the mistakes that led to the 2008 banking crash.</p> <p>There can be no doubt that some harsh words are welcome from the financial regulator decrying bonus-chasing bankers offering loans to every Tom, Jane and Harriet.</p> <p>However, they are not so welcome if you are a shop owner or worker who depends on consumers maintaining their shopping habits.</p> <p>MPs have largely ignored the subject of healthy town centres, leaving the problem to local authorities. Maybe if more of them shopped in their constituencies, they might notice the changes going on.</p> <p>It is possible that after another tough year, and some more shop closures, they might want the government to start thinking about giving the worst-affected towns a fresh start.</p> <h2>Even if bonds fall, it\u2019s hard to see an end to this era of cheap credit</h2> <p>There are some economic laws that reassert themselves, and some that are victims of changing times. The likely path of borrowing costs \u2013 that they rise in good times and fall in bad \u2013 is one such law that has failed to conform to previous trends.</p> <p>For 30 years now, interest rates have been falling, making it cheaper and cheaper to borrow money. This trend has continued during booms and busts on global stock markets, to which the debt markets were previously tied.

                "bodyText":"Life is tough for high street retailers and likely to get worse in 2018. That\u2019s the clear message following a difficult Christmas for most shopping chains and signals from the banks that they aim to bring a three-year bonanza of cheap consumer credit to an end, or at least severely restrict its further growth. Supermarkets were among the survivors as shoppers chose to spend a few extra pounds on food to cope with inflation. But that meant cutbacks elsewhere. Clothing, shoes and furniture joined a list of items shoppers decided they could do without \u2013 or, if they needed them, they went online for a cheap deal. Next was among the retailers to enjoy a degree of expansion after it was rescued by healthy online sales. Marks &amp; Spencer struggled to make any headway after its failure to entice customers to its website. If the health of the high street depends on anyone, it is the big discounters like Aldi and Lidl in the supermarket wars and B&amp;M, which is the Primark of food shops, selling household brands such as Kellogg\u2019s and Walkers at knock-down prices. But few high streets can survive with just discount shops to add to a smattering of charity outlets, bookies and pawnbrokers. Most towns vie with their neighbours to have at least one department store on their high street or, failing that, some national chains. Not so long ago, when Debenhams seemed like it would be turning up in almost every corner of the country with a new store, this dream appeared to be coming true. John Lewis was another department store that was talked about as a candidate for aiding urban renewal in the unlikeliest of places. The rapid expansion of chains such as New Look, TK Maxx and, more recently, jeweller Pandora has helped keep many smaller centres from looking down at heel. Sadly, Debenhams had a disastrous Christmas, as did House of Fraser, and both have ditched any expansion plans left over from the 2015 boom times. Cutbacks are the order of the day. M&amp;S is already closing stores, mostly in towns that shoppers have long since started driving past. New Look has seen sales fall, while profits at TK Maxx and Pandora are down. John Lewis is doing well although, like Next, all the improvement is online, not in its stores. Soon, even more high streets outside the big cities and successful market towns will have a ghostly pallor. At the root of the problem is the decline in disposable incomes. With inflation at around 3% and wage rises averaging 2.2%, households are struggling to maintain their standard of living. In a post-EU referendum economy, with uncertainty forcing companies to delay investment, average wages don\u2019t look like rising strongly any time soon. There was more bad news in the latest Bank of England study of consumer lending. A survey of high street banks found they were planning to severely restrict the generosity displayed in recent years that has pushed unsecured lending up by around 10% a year. Credit-card balances will be cut back and the length of interest-free periods will be reduced. Cheap loans will be limited to only the safest borrowers. This move is a response to concerns that the major banks had begun to lend recklessly, repeating the mistakes that led to the 2008 banking crash. There can be no doubt that some harsh words are welcome from the financial regulator decrying bonus-chasing bankers offering loans to every Tom, Jane and Harriet. However, they are not so welcome if you are a shop owner or worker who depends on consumers maintaining their shopping habits. MPs have largely ignored the subject of healthy town centres, leaving the problem to local authorities. Maybe if more of them shopped in their constituencies, they might notice the changes going on. It is possible that after another tough year, and some more shop closures, they might want the government to start thinking about giving the worst-affected towns a fresh start. Even if bonds fall, it\u2019s hard to see an end to this era of cheap credit There are some economic laws that reassert themselves, and some that are victims of changing times. The likely path of borrowing costs \u2013 that they rise in good times and fall in bad \u2013 is one such law that has failed to conform to previous trends. For 30 years now, interest rates have been falling, making it cheaper and cheaper to borrow money. This trend has continued during booms and busts on global stock markets, to which the debt markets were previously tied. The 2008 crash accelerated the decline in rates, but it was already well under way. Today, central banks charge commercial lenders an almost zero rate of interest, allowing mortgage lenders to push loan rates down to historic lows. Even the five increases in the US Federal Reserve\u2019s base rates since 2015 have done nothing to alter the downward trend. US lenders, keen to win business, have squeezed their margins rather than pass on the higher cost of borrowing from the Fed. But there are several debt-market gurus who think the latest signals from the European Central Bank and the central banks of Japan and China could mark an end to this era of cheap credit. The price of buying bonds, which is the market\u2019s way of packaging up the debt issued by governments and companies \u2013 state and corporate borrowing, in other words \u2013 is falling. The interest rate \u2013 referred to as the \u201cyield\u201d \u2013 on bonds rises as the price falls, and last week the yield on a 10-year US government bond jumped to nearly 2.6%, its highest level for almost a year. If, as is being signalled, the central banks of China, Japan and the eurozone start cutting back on their purchases of bonds, then, the argument runs, overall demand will fall and so will the price: and such borrowing will become more expensive. But even if central banks end their role as major bond purchasers, there is still plenty of demand. The world\u2019s financial system is awash with money looking for a home. Bonds remain a popular choice \u2013 cushioning any potential fall in price and rise in yield. Big brains of business enjoy curling up with a good book On both sides of the Atlantic, book clubs have strong associations with entertainment stars: Oprah Winfrey in the US, for example, and Richard and Judy in the UK. But now there is a new genre of literary cheerleader: the corporate bibliophile. Mark Zuckerberg and Bill Gates both publish reading lists and encourage readers to follow suit. Among the titles recommended by both tycoons are Yuval Noah Harari\u2019s Sapiens and The Better Angels of Our Nature by Steven Pinker. The Gates and Zuckerberg lists have won approval from cultural peers, including the managing director of Waterstones, but there has been justified criticism of the apparent gender imbalance in their reading. Books by men appear to outweigh those by women. Hopefully, the Facebook and Microsoft founders will adjust their bedtime reading piles accordingly.

Christian Lanng, Tradeshift\u2019s co-founder and chief executive, said the conference would benefit from \u201cthe quality of conversations that happen throughout four days in a tiny mountain village with global leaders and innovators. \u201cI\u2019ve connected with brilliant minds as diverse as [Alibaba founder] Jack Ma, Kofi Anan, Richard Branson and Matt Damon from every industry and nation, and look forward to doing so again this year,\u201d he said. Next door to the church, removal men are moving chairs and driers from the der Fris\u00f6r hairdressing salon. Hub Culture, a social network and digital currency firm, has rented the salon for the last eight years and converted it into an event space complete with a temporary \u201cIce House\u201d structure on its roof. \u201cWe were the first to take over a building in Davos for WEF, but now loads of companies take over shops, the library even the church for the week,\u201d said Stan Stalnaker, the founder of Hub Culture. He has brought a team of 35 people to run his events, including five chefs trained by Michelin-starred chef Alain Ducasse. \u201cWe will be holding events from 7am to midnight every night,\u201d he said. How much this will all cost? \u201cAn awful lot,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it\u2019s not about the money. It\u2019s about what we plan and hope to achieve here \u2013 to help change the world.\u201d So many businesses are moving out of Davos that traffic stewards are required to move on delivery trucks and help pedestrians negotiate construction sites. Lingerie store Blue Lemon is empty bar a few naked mannequins. Salesforce, a Californian cloud computing company, is moving in to host events. An outdoor clothing store is being transformed into an office for management consultancy Accenture, a shoe shop is being used for HSBC events, and a knitting store will be used to promote India. Pizza joint and night club Remix will become \u201cCrypto HQ\u201d a venue promising \u201cimmersive talks, panels and engaging workshops with the world\u2019s most cutting-edge thought leaders and innovators\u201d. One of the few shops not taking the cash and moving out next week is Stauble, the local purveyor of Rolex and Patek Phillippe watches. Manager Isabel Steinmann said she was \u201cliving in hope\u201d of big spenders from the conference suddenly needing a new timepiece, or two. \u201cOur watches are just the type that WEF people would like, we stay hoping they will pop in.\u201d A team of 11 men from Coventry are turning Guyan &amp; Co estate agent into an event space for Wipro, an Indian IT company. \u201cIt\u2019s more interesting to be working here than building a stand in the NEC [exhibition centre in Birmingham], But boy is it expensive, our bar bill last night was \u20ac300 (\u00a3265) and we only had four beers,\u201d Barry Buxton of events production company Freeman, said. Freeman\u2019s foreman Rich Strutt said Wipro had spent a \u201cfrightening amount\u201d on hiring the store and fitting it out. \u201cThe rent for here is SFr320,000 (\u00a3240,000), the rent for our apartments is \u00a334,000 for 10 days \u2013 they are not luxury and we\u2019re two to a room,\u201d he said. \u201cAll in, it will cost [Wipro] more than \u00a31m \u2013 they are happy to spend a lot.\u201d Strutt said there was a lot of media attention on Davos, but he questioned its purpose. \u201cIt seems like just a good excuse for a lot of rich people to hang out and drink champagne. Bill Gates will be here talking about climate change having flown here in a private jet.\u201d Adam Twidell, chief executive of private jet booking service PrivateFly, said he expected there to be more than 1,700 private jet flights into or out of nearby airports \u2013 the highest number ever. A flight to Zurich from London costs about \u00a310,500, and a 40-minute helicopter ride to Davos costs another \u00a33,750. Facebook has gone one step further than rent a storefront, and built its own three-storey house to hold events hosted by founder Mark Zuckerberg. Facebook is renting the land from the Kirchner Museum. Dolores Mark, the museum\u2019s spokesperson, declined to say how much Facebook had paid, only that it was \u201ca lot\u201d. While the WEF event brings in \u20ac40m to the local economy, some residents complain that the growing size of the event is putting too much strain on resources. Reto Branschi, chief executive of tourism body Destination Davos, said: \u201cIt is difficult to have all the construction work, but on the other hand WEF gives us a huge media presence and economic impact. More than 80% of residents voted in favour of having the WEF in a poll last year.\u201d There is not a single available hotel room left in town, despite prices of up to five figures a night for rooms that cost a little more than \u20ac100 last week. Many locals have rented out their chalets and apartments for thousands. Trump\u2019s late decision to attend has prompted extra problems: \u201cThe US delegation rang this morning asking for more rooms,\u201d said Tina Heide, general manager of the Grandhotel Belvedere, the fanciest hotel in Davos. \u201cThey\u2019ll be lucky to find anything \u2026 They might be able to rent trailers in the car park.\u201d The hotel will be patrolled by some of the more than 5,000 Swiss troops drafted in to secure the town next week. \u201cSecurity is paramount,\u201d she said. \u201cBut so is our guests\u2019 comfort.\u201d To that end, the hotel has drafted in 200 extra chambermaids, waiters and cocktail waitresses who will have to share rooms. More than a dozen heads of state will be staying at the hotel, together with \u201ca lot of celebrities and other VVIPs,\u201d she said. The WEF has block-booked the hotel, allocating rooms and informing the hotel who is staying on a daily basis to ensure maximum security. \u201cHeads of state can be staying in a suite or a regular single room. They don\u2019t care as long as they get to stay here, as it is close to everything.\u201d \u2022 Sign up to the daily Business Today email here or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk.",

The US currency has been under pressure on worries that the Trump tax cuts would increase the already hefty US national debt. And the dollar has become less attractive as other central banks begin edging up interest rates and gradually removing their long standing stimulus programmes.</p> <p>And despite a resolution to the government shutdown, the problem has only been postponed until early next month. Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at IG, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Renewed dollar weakness is the revival of yet another familiar friend from 2017. Post-shutdown euphoria has been replaced by a weary acceptance that we will probably have to do this all over again in just over two weeks. Why buy the greenback, when so many other economies can show solid growth without the government disruption so prevalent in the US at the moment?</p> </blockquote> <p>So with the stronger pound, the FTSE 100 came off its best levels.

The current mood among consumers is nothing short of ecstatic and current levels of confidence are generally associated with further acceleration in household consumption growth. Uncertainty about possible Eurozone reform, Italian elections and the success of the German coalition negotiations clearly take a backseat to improved economic factors.</p> <p>Over the past few months, consumer confidence improved most notably because of a much more positive view on the general economic situation, modest improvements in assessments of the financial situation and increased amounts of current and expected major purchases. This indicates that optimism and stronger consumption are going hand in hand, spurring the household consumption component of GDP growth. While unemployment expectations have become slightly less favourable over the last months of 2017, this is actually at odds with businesses indicating that hiring expectations remain very high.</p> <p>With such a favourable outlook, it could well be that the record for consumer confidence could be breached a few more times in 2018.

                "bodyText":"Time for a quick recap of the main events from the first day of Davos: Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau has challenged business leaders and politicians to end gender inequality and tackle unacceptable and systemic sexual harassment. You can watch a clip here. Trudeau also announced that the ten members of the trans-pacific partnership have agreed to extend their agreement. Oxfam\u2019s Winnie Byanyima has also hailed campaigners against sexual harrassment, saying they have helped people worldwide. Davos also heard that parents need to teach their sons not to hit women, rather than simply how to hit baseballs. India\u2019s Narendra Modi has warned that globalisation is under threat, and also cited climate change and terrorism as key threats to the global economy. The mood at Davos has been optimistic, although bank bosses have warned against complacency. An MIT economics professor has predicted that Facebook will barely exist in 20 years. Australian actor Cate Blanchett has criticised politicians for pandering to anti-refugee sentiment, instead of helping the millions of people displaced worldwide. That\u2019s probably all for tonight. Thanks for reading and commenting. GW A positive start following news that the US government shutdown had been resolved, for the moment at least, soon faded, leaving European markets a mixed bag by the close. Sterling rose above $1.40 to a new post-Brexit vote high, partly due to hopes that a successful trade deal can be negotiated, but also thanks to continuing weakness in the dollar. The US currency has been under pressure on worries that the Trump tax cuts would increase the already hefty US national debt. And the dollar has become less attractive as other central banks begin edging up interest rates and gradually removing their long standing stimulus programmes. And despite a resolution to the government shutdown, the problem has only been postponed until early next month. Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at IG, said: Renewed dollar weakness is the revival of yet another familiar friend from 2017. Post-shutdown euphoria has been replaced by a weary acceptance that we will probably have to do this all over again in just over two weeks. Why buy the greenback, when so many other economies can show solid growth without the government disruption so prevalent in the US at the moment? So with the stronger pound, the FTSE 100 came off its best levels. But Germany\u2019s Dax hovered around record levels, following upbeat consumer confidence figures and signs that a coalition government could be moving closer. In the US, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fluctuated between positive and negative, but Nasdaq was lifted by the positive Netflix update. The final scores in Europe showed: The FTSE 100 finished up 16.39 points or 0.21% at 7731.83 Germany\u2019s Dax rose 0.71% to 13,559.60 France\u2019s Cac closed down 0.12% at 5535.26 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB fell 0.22% to 23,836.60 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended up 0.24% at 10,609.5 In Greece, the Athens market added 1.62% to 872.00 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 28 points or 0.11%. NF Here\u2019s a video clip of Justin Trudeau laying down the law on sexual harassment: Justin Trudeau\u2019s speech has caused quite a stir, with its trenchant criticism of greedy, uncaring businesses and gender inequality. Adam Parsons of the BBC thinks it was a punchy speech: John Stackhouse of Royal Bank of Canada says Trudeau is shaking up the idea of what \u2018Davos Man\u2019 acts like: Ian Bremmer says Trudeau showed how gender equality is an important economic issue: But Jamie Drummond of campaigning group One isn\u2019t convinced Trudeau will deliver: Justin Trudeau also made an important point about trade. He tells Davos that Canada is trying to convince U.S. President Donald Trump that the NAFTA trade agreement was in the interest of the United States as well as other countries. Trudeau says: \u201cWe\u2019re working very hard to make sure that our neighbour to the south recognizes how good NAFTA is and that it has benefited not just our economy but his economy and the world economy,\u201d Justin Trudeau moves onto another vital issue - campaigns such as #MeToo and Time\u2019s Up. The Canadian PM declares: These movements show us we must have a critical discussion on women\u2019s rights, equality and the power dynamics of gender. Sexual harassment in business and in government is a systemic problem and it is unacceptable. As leaders, we must recognise and act to truly show that time is up. Justin Trudeau now urges business chiefs at Davos to help fight inequality by hiring, promoting and retaining more women. Getting more women into the workforce isn\u2019t just the right thing to do, or the nice thing to do, it\u2019s the smart thing to do, he tells the World Economic Forum, Studies show it can provide a significant economic boost. Firms need to address gender pay, and he warns that many firms aren\u2019t doing as well as they think. Just paying men and women the same doesn\u2019t go far enough, unless you also tackle the barriers faced by female workers. Women do more part-time work, and more unpaid work than men. Parental leave and childcare policies must be reexamined, Trudeau tells WEF. Firms should implement policies to improve gender balance. He also reminds us that he introduced Canada\u2019s first gender-balanced cabinet, and the performance of those female ministers has proved the naysayers wrong. Justin Trudeau has warned that businesses and politicians are failing to help their workers and citizens in today\u2019s \u201crapidly changing world\u201d. People have been taken advantage of, losing their jobs, the Canadian PM warns: Governments and corporations, we haven\u2019t done enough to address this. He also blasts corporate greed, saying: Too many corporations have single-mindedly put the pursuit of profit ahead of the well-being of workers. The gap between the rich and the poor is staggering, Trudeau points out, adding All the while, companies avoid taxes and boast record profits with one hand while slashing benefits with the other. Our priority must be the people who are struggling the most, and who will never get to Davos, Trudeau says. And he warns that if we operate on the basis of business as usual, \u201cthe system will break down and we will all fail.\u201d Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau is now speaking to Davos. He begins by thanking the seven all-female co-chairs for organising this year\u2019s WEF. He then makes an important announcement: The 10 remaining members of the Trans-Pacific Partnership have concluded a new agreement that will maintain their alliance. The agreement reached today in Tokyo is the right deal, Trudeau insists. It will create growth, prosperity, and middle class jobs in Canada today and for generations. This is significant, as Donald Trump pulled the US out of the TPP. In an hour\u2019s time, Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau will give a special address to the World Economic Forum. As a liberal, feminist leader, Trudeau is a Davos favourite. But that shouldn\u2019t mean he gets a free pass. Jamie Drummond, executive director of the development group One, says that Trudeau isn\u2019t actually delivering on pledges to make the world a better place. As Drummond puts it: \u201cIt\u2019s so exasperating that prime minister Justin Trudeau will make another great speech today while the facts point in a shocking direction. Smart aid rates under Trudeau are lower than under his conservative predecessor Stephen Harper, the money he loudly promised would be new to fight aids, TB and malaria was in fact not new, and his feminist foreign policy is not backed by new funds. This can and must change now. Not in 2020, or some vague theoretical far-off point after the next election. Drummond urges WEF delegates to put Trudeau under pressure to deliver. This week in Davos he must be asked when and by specifically how much he will increase funding for girls education and women\u2019s economic empowerment; and please, he must do it this year. If we want him be a great leader on these issues, we must withhold praise until we see the quality of his action not just his delightful adverbs. Trust Trudeau - but verify. And if Davos doesn\u2019t pressure leaders like Trudeau to be the best they can be, or hold them accountable, this gathering is a self-defeating backslapping waste of time the world doesn\u2019t have.\u201d As we reported this morning, Drummond is threatening not to come back to Davos unless this annual shindig starts delivering the goods. The Greek prime minister Alexis Tsipras is among the world leaders who have lined up to get to Davos, reports Helena Smith from Athens: Tsipras, who arrived only hours after Athens wrapped up a third bailout compliance review \u2013 edging ever closer to ending dependence on international bailout loans when the programme expires this summer - is meeting investors also gathered in Davos. The leftist\u2013led government, in an about\u2013turn of its previous antagonism, is now keen to attract foreign capital as it prepares the country\u2019s return to capital markets. This afternoon\u2019s meeting is much in the vein of luring investors to fund projects in Greece with an eye to slashing unemployment \u2013 at 21% still the highest in the EU and by far the nation\u2019s biggest social ill. Monday\u2019s eurogroup meeting saw euro area finance ministers agreeing to disburse \u20ac6.7bn to the debt -stricken nation in two instalments. The first chunk of \u20ac5.7bn will be released in February, once outstanding reforms are implemented, to cover debt servicing needs, arrears and creation of a cash buffer that will support Greece\u2019s return to markets. Talks on debt relief are expected to begin soon \u2013 along with a fourth compliance review which included 88 creditor-mandates reforms being taken by June. Sounding a note of optimism, EU Financial Affairs Commissioner Pierre Moscovici said the single currency bloc should prepare for \u201ca successful conclusion, which means Greece being back as a normal member of the eurozone and the final signal \u2013 the end of the Greek crisis.\u201d After the better than expected German consumer confidence figures, there is more positive news from Europe. Eurozone consumer confidence rose from 0.5 points in December to 1.3 points in January, according to the European Commission. This was well above forecasts of a figure of 0.6. In the wide European Union, confidence jumped 1 point to 0.4 points. ING economist Bert Colijn said: With inflation still low, job growth surprising on the upside, house prices increasing and growth forecasts adjusted upwards, there is a lot to like for consumers and that\u2019s evident. The current mood among consumers is nothing short of ecstatic and current levels of confidence are generally associated with further acceleration in household consumption growth. Uncertainty about possible Eurozone reform, Italian elections and the success of the German coalition negotiations clearly take a backseat to improved economic factors. Over the past few months, consumer confidence improved most notably because of a much more positive view on the general economic situation, modest improvements in assessments of the financial situation and increased amounts of current and expected major purchases. This indicates that optimism and stronger consumption are going hand in hand, spurring the household consumption component of GDP growth. While unemployment expectations have become slightly less favourable over the last months of 2017, this is actually at odds with businesses indicating that hiring expectations remain very high. With such a favourable outlook, it could well be that the record for consumer confidence could be breached a few more times in 2018. This, in turn, confirms the rosy short-term picture for Eurozone growth. NF Dacher Keltner, Professor of Psychology from the University of California, is also on the sexual harassment panel alongside Winnie Byanyima. He says: Men tend to take more risks, they tend to be a lot more aggressive, and they tend to sexualise thing. So if you give a man power, those default tendencies will be expressed. Women tend to be more collaborative, co-operative, empathetic. You give them power, studies show it will amplify those pro-social tendencies. Lisa Sherman, President and Chief Executive Officer of the Advertising Council, says parents can do more to help boys treat women with respect. You teach your son how to hit a baseball, how to hit a jump shot, how to hit the net. But we should really be talking to them about who not to hit, and why. Peggy Johnson, executive Vice-President for Business Development at Microsoft, says the younger generation are helping to force change. She explains that her daughter recently started her career, and told her that \u2018when there\u2019s an inappropriate joke at work, I don\u2019t laugh\u2019. I thought back and thought, when I was her age I always laughed, says Johnson. My daughter said to me that she\u2019d learned not to laugh at these jokes from me, but she actually learned it from me in my 50s, not my 20s. Winnie Byanyima, the executive director of Oxfam International, is speaking powerfully about sexual exploitation against women around the globe. All the women in the world should be grateful to American women for taking a stand, and saying \u201cMe Too\u201d, Byanyima says, referring to the campaign that spread around the globe after the Harvey Weinstein scandal. It has brought new attention to a problem that is deep. Women in the developing world are at the bottom of the supply chain of big business. Oxfam hears stories of their lives, Byanyima explains, such as hotel housekeepers. All of them told us that they had faced sexual harassment or knew someone who had faced sexual harassment. It goes on with impunity. Domestic workers globally suffer abuse, she continues, and some of them are like slaves in the homes where they work. Only a few countries have ratified a new convention for domestic workers. It is not an accident that women are abused sexually at work or at home. It\u2019s due to the social norms that are there to justify their economic exploitation. That is why it is so important to tackle economic inequality, as this will also help tackle violence against women. Byanyima says there are three ways to tackle this problem: Remove all the laws that discriminate against women in the economy Tackle the social norms that justify sexual exploitation. Businesses have an important role to play here - they can use their factories, supply chains, advertising. Unilever are doing it, so others can too. Bring women into every level of decision-making and leadership, so they can drive change. In the wake of the resolution to the US government shutdown, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was initially expected to open higher. But when trading began the Dow dipped 27 points or 0.1%, with investors moving on to worry about the impact of Donald Trump\u2019s move to impose steep import tariffs, including possible retaliation. South Korea and China both protested at the duties on washing machines and solar panels. The S&amp;P 500 however edged up 0.03% and the Nasdaq composite climbed 0.23%. The uncertainty has taken some of the shine off European shares, with the FTSE 100 now up just 0.11% and France\u2019s Cac virtually unchanged. Germany\u2019s Dax is now up 0.76%, off its best levels. NF David Autor, Ford Professor of Economics at MIT, has predicted that today\u2019s giant tech companies - such as Facebook - will suffer the face of previous dominant companies. He\u2019s on a panel asking \u2018can we live with monopolies\u2019. Autor explains that we currently live in an environment of \u2018winner takes most\u2019 markets, where having a small edge over your competitor gives you a massive advantage. So firms like Amazon and Facebook are growing organically (people are on Facebook because their friends are on Facebook), but that doesn\u2019t mean that this growth is healthy. Or sustainable, in the long run. We did have these monopolies in the past, Autor points out, citing the US railroads, and AT&amp;T which was broken up by regulators. Also, companies which appear indomitable can fade pretty fast, he says - and then makes a bold prediction: I would guess that Facebook will be almost non-existent 20 years from now. Autor is also critical of the US model where employees are not treated as stakeholders (unlike shareholders). This situation has created a level of inequality that has led to political upheaval, he says. Elsewhere in Davos, the head of the Red Cross has warned that fresh humanitarian crises could break out this year. Peter Maurer, president of the International Committee of the Red Cross, says there are a lot of fragile situations that could develop into \u201cfull-fledged\u201d conflicts (as we saw with the Rohingya crisis in 2017). Maurer says there are plenty of places on the brink of war, violence and disruption. He cites Southern Philippines (which is under martial law), Myanmar, Afghanistan, the Middle East, and large parts of Africa as places where the Red Cross sees fragility - but \u201cwe don\u2019t know which one will blow up in our face\u201d. So what can Davos do about it? Top business leaders have the skills and resources to help businesses in those fragile areas, and help them tipping into conflict. Maurer also warns that humanitarian organisations need more money: In 2018 we face a big gap between the needs of people and the capacity of the international system as a whole to respond. The gap can only be bridged by more and better finance. Ultimately, Blanchett says, we must remember we are all citizens, and stand up for what we believe in. Cate Blanchett is close to tears, as she talks about one refugee family she met in Jordan. They had fled conflict with five of their children, being shot at by all sides. Eventually, the father had to choose between carrying his suitcases and carrying his children (he chose the children). No-one should be put in that position, she says. Q: Aren\u2019t politicians taking a hard line on refugees because they are reacting to the concerns of their populations? Cate Blanchett argues that they\u2019re actually reacting to populist media and the news cycle. We are at a fork in the road, she says. We try to teach our children to be compassionate, to be tolerant, to accept diversity, to share. But all the structures that are around them are not doing the same, so it\u2019s quite a schizophrenic world they\u2019re living in. And taking a swing at populist politicians, she says she don\u2019t understand how turning people in a boat back became an election winner. Australian actor Cate Blanchett is talking about the refugee crisis now (yesterday she was handed a WEF award for her work on this issue). She explains how she went backpacking through Europe in her youth, which opened her eyes to economic inequality. I was staying in youth hostels that were more like Turkish prisons, She explains, seeing people who didn\u2019t have anywhere else to go Q: There\u2019s been a lot of criticism of Australia\u2019s policy to refugees.... Blanchett says she was \u2018bewildered\u2019 to see the generous, openhearted, multi-cultural Australia she grew up in \u201cflouting the UN humans rights convention\u201d I was very distressed that Australia was reverting back to practices that made us a fortress again. This drove Blanchett to become a goodwill ambassador to UNHCR I think it\u2019s shameful. There\u2019s so much misinformation about refugees. They are forced to flee, and then they are vilified in the media. Blanchett says the misinformation about refugees is \u201cvery distressing\u201d, and doesn\u2019t connect with the actual people she has met. There are 65 million displaced people in the world, 22 million are refugees, half are women and children. But just 1% have been resettled in advanced developed economies. It\u2019s the developing world that is shouldering the deep burden of refugees. She cites the Lebanon, where a quarter of the population are now refugees. Blanchett also criticises the way refugees are reported in the media: People are told this narrative that these people, who have so much to offer, are going to be a burden on us or become a terrorist threat. Q: But have some people in developing economies been encouraged to travel to countries such as Germany, because they hoped to be given asylum? Should we not talk about it, Blanchett replies rhetorically. The problem is not going to go away. These are not terrorists. These are innocent people, who want to return home. She\u2019s also calling for more burden-sharing between countries, to help address the refugee crisis. The problem with all this optimism at Davos is that business leaders, economists and politicians have a nasty habit of missing impending disaster. WEF veterans point out that the mood is often particularly upbeat shortly before a crisis. Barclays CEO Jes Staley summed it up this morning, on the financial crisis session when he said Davos feels \u201ca little bit like 2006 when we were all talking whether we\u2019ve solved the riddle of economic crises.\u201d The Carlyle Group David Rubenstein agreed, saying: Generally, when people are happy and confident, something wrong happens. Back with the UK public finances, and a Treasury spokesperson said: We have made great progress in reducing the deficit by three quarters since 2010, but government debt is still far too high. Our balanced approach to government spending is getting debt falling, while investing in key public services and keeping taxes low. And the Office for Budget Responsibility said: It appears that the underlying improvement in borrowing so far this year is a little faster than would be consistent with our November forecast. NF Christoph Franz, the chairman of Roche, agrees that spirits are high at Davos this year - and with good reason. Speaking to CNBC, Frans argues that \u2018healthy\u2019 economic growth is boosting optimism among top execs. Basically, I have been here for more than ten years, I share your perspective, there\u2019s a very positive mood right now among business leaders here in Davos, and I think the reason is, we see a growth perspective in, not only some specific countries, but on a global scale, and the growth is achieving numbers which we have seen only before 2007. So, the economy is taking up, and for the time being, it is growth which has been created by a lot of investment. Britain\u2019s manufacturers continue to be optimistic about business prospects and exports, but are increasingly worried about skills shortages. The CBI\u2019s latest industrial trends survey for the three months to January showed 27% of firms were more optimistic about the general business situation that three months ago, while 14% were less optimistic. The balance of +13% is up from -11% in the previous quarter. Growth in manufacturing output and domestic and export orders all picked up, compared with the previous three-month period, although the monthly order book figure showed a fall from +17 in December to +14 in January. And the number of firms saying a lack of skilled labour was likely to limit output over the next three months was the highest for more than four decades. Rain Newton-Smith, CBI chief economist, said: It\u2019s good to see manufacturing going from strength-to-strength with growth up and the buoyant global economy boosting export orders. But the past depreciation in Sterling continues to leave its mark on firms\u2019 costs and margins. With expectations for factory gate price inflation at their highest in 30 years, the pressure on consumer prices looks set to persist. Capacity pressures are ramping up and skill shortages are a big concern, underlining the importance of establishing a future immigration system that provides companies with access to talent and labour. The building blocks of a new system that meets economic needs and public concerns must start with scrapping the net migration target, which has never been fit-for-purpose. NF Yup. Modi wraps up his speech by identifying three priorities: The world economy must be more inclusive Policymakers must remain committed to a rules-based world order Reforming the major institutions of the world, connected to politics, the economy and securtry He talks about the Indian soldiers who died in world wars in the 20th century, to help create \u201cpeace and humanity\u201d. India can be a humanising and harmonising force in an uncertain world, Modi promises, citing Indian prayers and poetry which advocates a free and peaceful world. Together we can create a \u2018heaven of future\u2019, he promises, in a somewhat gushing conclusion. Alas, he\u2019s not taking any questions. On climate change, Modi says India is making big progress towards hitting its goals for renewable energy. Modi says India will achieve strong growth over the next few years. Kenneth Roth of Human Rights Watch suggests Modi isn\u2019t living up to the glowing ideals he\u2019s preaching today: (remember, Modi was once banned from visiting the US following claims he had supported Hindu extremists during Hindu-Muslim riots. He was later cleared by the Indian Supreme Court). Modi is now encouraging businesses to invest in India, citing the hundreds of laws and regulations which have been stripped out to make te economy more competitive. Instead of red tape, we offer you a red carpet, he jokes. Democracy isn\u2019t just a political system, says Modi - it is a life view and a lifestyle. He cites India\u2019s proud democracy and diversity, declaring: For a society with diverse religions, cultures, languages, attires and cuisines, democracy is not just a political system but a way of living: Thirdly, the world is threatened by the rising attacks on globalisation, says Modi. We must accept that globalisation is slowly losing its lustre, he says. And he pits some of the blame on the institutions created after world war 2, such as the United Nations. Do the structures and action plans of these organisations match the aspirations and dreams of mankind, Modi asks rhetorically. Then he takes aim at protectionism, saying: Forces of protectionism are raising their heads against globalisation. They want to reverse its flow. The world risks new tariff and non-tariff barriers, he continues, cautioning that \u201cbilateral and multilateral trade negotiations have come to a kind of standstill\u2019. The second major threat is terrorism, Modi continues. He says there is an artificial distinction between \u2018good and bad\u2019 terrorism, and a worrying radicalism of young people. The world has moved from needs-based to greed-based consumption, says Modi seriously. This does not live up to the ideals of Gandhi, or the teaching of Buddha. Modi cites climate change as a major threat. Glaciers are melting, islands are disappearing under the sea, and in Davos we have the worst snow in 20 years, he says. And he criticises the leaders of advanced economies for not showing more solidarity Everyone talks about reducing climate emissions, but there are very few countries who back their words with their resources to help developing countries to adopt appropriate technology. Very few of them come forward to help. Here\u2019s some instant reaction to Modi\u2019s call for co-operation to build a better future, rather than descending into isolationism. Narendra Modi now turns to the \u201cfractures\u201d in the global economy, citing unemployment, inequality, lack of opportunities. Some important questions come to mind, which require answers, he says. Is our global order widening these fault lines, increasing these differences, and giving preference to isolationism over harmony and conflict over co-operation, he asks, adding: What paths can we follow, to eliminate rifts and differences. How can we realise the dream of a beautiful shared future. Modi is speaking in Hindi, incidentally, so the audience are getting a realtime translation. Today, data is the world\u2019s biggest asset, Modi declares. We are accumulating mountains and mountains of data, he continues. There is now a race to control data, because it is believes that whoever is able to control the data can dominate the world. Narendra Modi takes the stage, to another round of applause. He begins with a history lesson. The last time an Indian PM was at Davos was in 1997, when H. D. Deve Gowda visited. Back then, India\u2019s GDP was $400bn - it is now six times larger. WEF\u2019s theme in 1997 was \u2018building the networked society\u2019. Today, it is not just a networked society. We are living in the world of big data, artificial intelligence and robots. Back in 1997, Modi continues the eurozone didn\u2019t exist, the Asian financial crisis wasn\u2019t expected, and there was no sign that Brexit might happen. Very few people had heard of Osama Bin Laden, and Harry Potter was also an unknown name. Back then, Google didn\u2019t exist, a web search for Amazon would bring up a river or jungle, and tweeting was done by birds, Modi declares. Davos\u2019s founder, Klaus Schwab, is introducing Narendra Modi now. Globally we are moving to a multipolar, and multi-conceptual world, says Schwab. In a seemingly fractured world, India presents a bright image of optimism, he adds. It also presents an investment opportunity (something that business leaders at Davos will be interested in) There\u2019s a buzz on the floor of the World Economic Forum as India\u2019s prime minister Narendra Modi prepares to give the opening speech. Modi is a big draw - the main hall is filling up fast with delegates keen to hear his words. The speech should be streamed live here: Nariman Behravesh, chief economist at IHS Markit says the mood at Davos is very different this year than in 2017. He tells us: \u201cIt is a lot more optimistic and the optimism is broad based. Last year the Americans were upbeat but the Europeans were gloomy. A year ago the feeling was that politics was going to overwhelm economics but the opposite has happened. An improving economy may make populism less compelling\u201d Behravesh says that Donald Trump\u2019s arrival in the White House a year ago led to an increase in business confidence. Corporate America was not keen on Barack Obama, he says. \u201cBusiness finally got a president it thought was business friendly and the reduction in regulation has been received well.\u201d Business also likes the package of tax cuts Trump finally pushed through Congress at the end of 2017 and which are weighted in favour of the well off and corporations. \u201cOur estimate is that the tax cuts will add 0.3 percentage points to growth in 2018, 2019 and 2020\u201d Behravesh says. There are two risks, he adds. \u201cThe US and global economy may be running too hot. We think unemployment in the US will go as low as 3.5%, which is well below estimates of full employment. The question is how soon wage inflation and price inflation picks up. If inflation surprises on the upside we could see the Federal Reserve and other central banks step on the brakes a lot harder. The stock market could take a hit and that would be bad.\u201d The other risk is that Trump starts making good on his protectionist threats. \u201cSo far his bark has been worse then his bite, Behravesh says. \u201cBut I think China is going to come under a lot of pressure from the US this year. The US is very unhappy about the China\u2019s unwillingness to toe the line on intellectual property.\u201d Over in Germany, consumer confidence remains strong. The ZEW institute economic sentiment index came in at 20.4 points in January, up from 17.4 the previous month and better than the forecasts of a reading of 17.8. And this came amid uncertainty over the country\u2019s political future and before the weekend\u2019s agreement to take another step towards a coalition government. The index remains slightly below the long-term average of 23.7 points, but it is still a positive outcome. Meanwhile the current conditions index rose from 89.3 points o 95.2. ZEW president professor Achim Wambach said: The latest survey results reveal an optimistic outlook for the German economy in the first six months of 2018. With 95.2 out of 100 points, this is the most positive assessment of the current economic situation since the introduction of the survey in December 1991. Private consumption, which was the most important driver of economic growth in 2017, is likely to continue to stimulate growth in the coming six months according to the survey participants. The assessment of the global economic environment in Europe and the USA is also much more favourable than it was at the end of 2017. NF Despite the warnings from Davos, investors are pushing markets higher again this morning. There is renewed confidence following the IMF raising its growth forecasts on Monday (albeit not for the UK), as well as relief that the US government shutdown has been resolved, at least for another couple of weeks. Meanwhile there were no surprises from the Bank of Japan, which recently unnerved markets by reducing its monthly bond buying programme by $10bn. This time it left monetary policy unchanged. So the FTSE 100 is up 0.31%, France\u2019s Cac has climbed 0.11% and Germany\u2019s Dax is 0.86% better and at new highs. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said: It\u2019s taken a while for the DAX to join in with the all-time high hitting performances of the FTSE and the Dow Jones seen in 2018. However, with German coalition talks steadily moving along, a stop-gap deal to end the US government shutdown, and a subsequent pullback from the euro against the dollar, the bourse seems ready to bulge, shooting up by 130 points to tease a 13600 record peak. In the US the Dow Jones Industrial Average, which jumped 142 points or 0.55% after the news of the impasse over the government shutdown had been resolved, is expected to open 84 points higher. Fiona Cincotta at City Index said: The FTSE bounced on the open this morning, following a record session in the US overnight. The Dow surged over 140 points, whilst the S&amp;P and the Nasdaq tagged on 0.8% and 1% respectively, all hitting unchartered territory. The rally took place after the Democrats and the Republicans passed the funding bill to end the US government shut down, 72 hours after it started. NF Britain\u2019s budget deficit came in much better than expected, giving a boost to chancellor Philip Hammond. Thanks to an unusually large credit from the European Union and the strongest VAT receipts on record, public sector net borrowing fell from \u00a38.25bn in November to \u00a32.6bn last month. This was well below analyst forecasts of a figure of around \u00a35bn. There was a \u00a31.2bn credit from the EU related to the region\u2019s smaller than expected overall budget and improved economic performance. With the UK economy holding up despite Brexit vote fears, VAT receipts rose by an annual 4.8% to a record \u00a312.3bn. Total public borrowing since last April is now \u00a350bn, 12% less than in the same period in 2016 and leaving Hammond on track to meet his full year target of \u00a349.9bn by the end of March. NF More highlights from the Davos talk about financial risks: Anne Richards, chief executive of M&amp;G Investments, fears that a devastating IT crash could cause the next financial crisis. She tells an audience in Davos that policymakers risk ignoring the threat posed by investors\u2019 reliance on technology, and the damage that could be caused if key systems go down. Richards says she doesn\u2019t buy the argument that a geopolitical crisis will bring the bull market crashing down. After all, markets handle geopolitical events all the time. Instead, she fears that the \u201csystemic risk\u201d posed by new technology, and the cloud, could provoke an event that changes the \u201canimal spirits\u201d in the markets today. Richards warns: We all have businesses that are absolutely reliant on a very small number of people who provide the pipes that we put our business though. There\u2019s a technology thing out there that we\u2019re all somewhat blind to. It would be interesting to think how markets would react if none of us could trade for one, or two or three days\u201d David Rubenstein, co-executive chairman of The Carlyle Group, is also on the panel. He\u2019s more worried about political threats - predicting that if there is a geopolitical crisis, markets will be hurt and firms will pull back from capital investment. This year\u2019s World Economic Forum is being led by an all-female group of co-chairs. They\u2019re giving a press conference now: Erna Solberg, prime minister of Norway, is speaking now - calling for a new crackdown on illegal finance and corruption. Solberg says this is fuelling terrorism and security threats, and making it harder for emerging economies to develop their economies. She suggests a MeToo campaign to fight corruption is needed: We need to see who is taking money, who is bribing others, and show that this is unacceptable in all our societies. Solberg\u2019s other priority is gender equality -- she warns that women are still treated unfairly in many economies. The barriers to women\u2019s participation [in the labour market] is still large in many societies - it doesn\u2019t make sense economically or politically. Can Emmanuel Macron really succeed where his predecessors failed, and reform the French economy? Tidjane Thiam, the boss of Credit Suisse, says the answer is a resounding yes. Speaking on a panel about \u2018global markets in a fractured world\u2019, Thaim says Macron\u2019s programme of labour market reforms would have led to \u201ccertain electoral defeat\u201d 20 years ago - not last year\u2019s triumph against Marine Le Pen. As Thiam puts it: Macron only got elected because the French public, the French nation, decided to change. That\u2019s how it works in a democracy. Political scientist Ian Bremmer agrees that market sentiment and political reality have got out of whack.... The usual high security measures are in place in Davos this morning. Armed guards prevent any non-delegates getting into WEF; even if you\u2019re accredited, you have to negotiate airport-style security before you\u2019re actually allowed in. The snowdrifts have also provided a new reason to ban protests in Davos this week. Davos officials say \u201cthe extremely tight space situation due to the enormous amount of new snow\u201d doesn\u2019t leave any space for a rally.... UBS\u2019s chairman, Axel Weber, has warned that sentiment in the market is \u201ctoo buoyant\u201d. Speaking on CNBC this morning, Weber said there was a worrying gap between investor optimism and the actual state of the economy. Investors are taking risks, but I don\u2019t think they\u2019re getting adequate compensation for those risks. At some time, if it\u2019s got to stop it\u2019s got to stop. He added that the markets could be in a more difficult position by the time of Davos 2019.... Justin Trudeau says he\u2019ll be batting for middle-class Canadians in Davos this week. His speech this afternoon is also expected to cover corporate responsibility and the role of women in a changing world. Davos regular Jamie Drummond says he may not come back, unless this year\u2019s meeting makes real progress towards tackling inequality. Drummond is the executive director of the development group One, which he co-founded with the rock star Bono. In a blog, Drummond said he had been stung by the accusation that he had spent so long hobnobbing with the 1% that he was becoming a \u201cDavos man.\u201d \u201cA feminist activist, and someone I deeply respect, recently commented that I was at risk of becoming that awful thing: \u2018a Davos Man\u2019. Definitions vary but this phrase generally refers to a male who goes to places like Davos and inhabits an elite, unaccountable bubble while determining the fates of those without access to it. The comment cut deep. It forced me to question any complicity I might have in a system I have tried so hard to change. So I\u2019m putting my inner Davos Man on notice, and making this commitment: this will be my last World Economic Forum unless this one helps deliver on three crucial areas in the fight against extreme poverty and gender inequality. Those areas are the global education emergency; women\u2019s economic empowerment; and ambitious financing to back Africa\u2019s huge youth boom.\u201d Philip Jennings, head of the global union UNI, has been one of the strongest voices for labour at Davos for many a year but 2018 will be his last meeting before retiring in the summer. Speaking to the Guardian, Jennings said the current business model built on the principle of shareholder value was \u201cnot fit for purpose\u201d and that the opportunity provided by the financial crisis of a decade ago to build a more inclusive economy has been squandered. \u201cDonald Trump is Mr Shareholder value\u201d, Jennings said, adding: \u201cHe is exhibit A of the fractured world\u201d. Jennings said a test for the business leaders in Davos talking about the problems of global inequality was whether they recognised trade unions and collective bargaining at their firms. And he predicted a backlash against three of the new titans of the global economy: Amazon, Facebook and Google. \u201cThese companies were once seen as angelic, seen as our saviours\u201d, Jennings said. \u201cBut the big three has such market influence and power that the world has to wake up and start thinking about the need for anti-trust action. One of the fractures in the global economy is the power of the new monopolies and the danger it represents\u201d. The huge snowfalls in Davos recently mean the ski resort is now facing a Level 5 avalanche risk - the highest rating. Some homes have reportedly been evacuated, due to fears that the snow is too unstable. There has already been big delays getting up the mountain (someone I met last night spent six hours crawling here from Zurich), leading to plenty of chuntering among delegates. Davos has had an early wake-up call. PR chief Richard Edelman\u2019s annual trust index shows that Americans have become much less trusting of politicians, business chiefs and the media over the last year. He says: No country saw steeper declines than the United States, with a 37-point aggregate drop in trust across all institutions. At the opposite end of the spectrum, China experienced a 27-point gain, more than any other country. The survey shows that people are more worried about the rise of disinformation -- and finding it hard to separate truth from \u2018fake news\u2019 So, genuine voices of expertise are now regaining credibility. Edelman explains: Journalists have risen 12 points, and CEOs recorded a seven-percentage point gain, since 2017. Good morning from Davos! World leaders, business chiefs, trade unions, the heads of charities and NGOs, celebrities and the media are gathering in this small ski resort to discuss the state of the world, and how to improve it. This year\u2019s WEF is taking place amid the biggest snowfalls in many years. This is already leading to inequality on the streets of Davos: workers are furiously shovelling drifts aside and driving snowploughs as the global elite queue bumper-to-bumper to reach the WEF congress centre and the exclusive hotels and converted shops where events are taking place. Last night, Pope Francis set the mood by issuing a stern warning not to remain silent in the face of economic inequality and injustice. In a message read to the Davos attendees, the Pope warned not to allow people to be used as cogs in a machine and then chucked aside. He declared: \u201cNew actors are emerging, as well as new economic competition and regional trade agreements. Even the most recent technologies are transforming economic models and the globalized world itself, which, conditioned by private interests and an ambition for profit at all costs, seem to favour further fragmentation and individualism, rather than to facilitate approaches that are more inclusive,\u201d Even Sir Elton John weighed in, describing inequality in the world today as \u2018disgraceful\u2019 (as we covered in last night\u2019s blog). Two world leaders will address Davos today, with different priorities. Narendra Modi, who gives the opening speech, is the first Indian prime minister to visit WEF in 20 years. He\u2019s on a big push to attract more business to his country, billing India as a key growth engine for the global economy. India have sent a large delegation to Davos this year - many of whom found themselves caught up in the transport chaos yesterday.

The government acknowledges that progress has been made \u2013 with firms identifying and taking down extremist content more quickly, for example. But it would like to see more action taken. May will say: \u201cWe need to go further, so that ultimately this content is removed automatically. These companies have some of the best brains in the world. They must focus their brightest and best on meeting these fundamental social responsibilities.\u201d She will also single out the messaging app Telegram, which has been accused of facilitating communication by terrorists. \u201cJust as these big companies need to step up, so we also need cross-industry responses because smaller platforms can quickly become home to criminals and terrorists. We have seen that happen with Telegram. And we need to see more co-operation from smaller platforms like this. No one wants to be known as \u2018the terrorists\u2019 platform\u2019 or the first choice app for paedophiles,\u201d she will say. May will also meet the US president, Donald Trump, on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum \u2013 the first time the pair have met since they clashed over his sharing of videos from the far-right group Britain First. A report from Bloomberg News on Wednesday cited senior insiders saying that when the pair speak on the phone, Trump \u201ctotally dominates the discussion, leaving the prime minister with five or 10 seconds to speak before he interrupts and launches into another monologue\u201d. But Downing Street sources insisted the pair have a good relationship and suggested they would be likely to discuss foreign affairs, including North Korea and Iran, rather than the possibility of a Trump visit to Britain. May\u2019s 2017 trip to Davos, home of the global elite, raised eyebrows, as it followed criticism of her \u201ccitizens of nowhere\u201d comment in her first party conference speech as prime minister. This year the shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, will also be speaking at Davos. He issued a statement on Wednesday saying he would use the trip to issue \u201ca warning to the global elite\u201d. McDonnell added: \u201cjust as Davos faces the risk of an avalanche this week, growth for a few risks a political and social avalanche unless there is fundamental change to our rigged economic system.\u201d Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn was invited to Davos but declined to attend. \u201cHe chooses to go to events where he thinks he can make an effective contribution and it\u2019s appropriate for him to go,\u201d his spokesman said. \u201cThe Davos event has become representative of a system and set of global elites which have clearly failed, a system that clearly isn\u2019t delivering for people.\u201d Labour said McDonnell would make clear that he believed the global economy was being mismanaged. \u201cThe large majority of the success in taking hundreds of millions of people out of poverty is in one part of the world, namely China,\u201d the spokesman said. Asked if the country was a good example for the UK, he said: \u201cChina and Britain are entirely different countries at different stages of development with entirely different economic and political systems.\u201d In Davos, McDonnell will speak on a panel on Friday morning, as well as meet various charity executives, his office said.",

ING foreign exchange strategist Viraj Patel says:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>In an action-packed week for global markets, the main event will be President Trump\u2019s State of the Union address (Tueday 2100 ET) \u2013 which is set to outline the administration\u2019s 2018 policy agenda ahead of the pivotal November midterms. With US trade policy in particular focus, the burning question for investors is which type of Donald Trump will turn up: Dr Jekyll or Mr Hyde?</p> <p>While the former manifestation may have appealed to the international elite at Davos, we would not be entirely surprised to see the more fiery characteristics of the President surface back on home soil in Washington. Indeed, with President Trump fighting low approval ratings, fresh allegations that he wanted to fire Special Counsel Robert Mueller last year and with little policy progress to show (beyond the Tax Bill) \u2013 there\u2019s every chance that the \u2018America First\u2019 policy talk has a protectionist sting in the tail this week.

The damage is already done \u2013 and with structural factors \u2013 such as a late US economic cycle, relative US asset valuations and the twin current account and fiscal deficits \u2013 all supporting a weaker dollar trend, the naturally tendency will be for the greenback to fall over the course of 2018.

                "bodyText":"With the dollar recovering from its recent weakness, and continuing uncertainty over Brexit, the pound has come under pressure today and is currently 0.63% lower at $1.4080. Meanwhile bonds prices are falling and yields rising, as central banks increasingly look to move away from their low interest rate and QE programmes which have supported markets for several years now. German and US yields in particular have move sharply higher. In the US, the Federal Reserve\u2019s preferred measure of inflation - the PCE index - was in line with expections, up from 0.1% in November to 0.2% last month. But the savings rate fell to a more than 12 year low. Elsewhere the European Union has warned Donald Trump it is ready to retaliate on trade if the US tries to crack down on imports. And cryptocurrencies were back in the spotlight on concerns about a crackdown in Japan after hackers stole $400m from the Coincheck exchange. Finally, accountancy firm KPMG is to be investigated by the UK\u2019s Financial Reporting Council over its role in the collapse of construction group Carillion. On that note, it is time to close for the day. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. With the recovery in the dollar, a decline in bond prices and a busy week ahead, US markets have slipped back from their record levels. As well as the Federal Reserve\u2019s latest interest rate setting meeting, there is the State of the Union address and a host of results from the likes of Apple, Alphabet, Facebook, Microsoft and Amazon. Apple is already weighing on the markets, following reports it would make half the number of planned iPhone Xs this quarter. So the Dow Jones Industrial Average has dropped 37 points or 0.15%, the S&amp;P 500 lost 0.26% and the Nasdaq Composite fell 0.32%. Here\u2019s our full report on the EU\u2019s warning to Donald Trump over trade. Daniel Boffey writes: Brussels has warned that it stands ready to retaliate and potentially open up a transatlantic trade war if the US delivers on apparent threats to restrict European imports. The US president, Donald Trump, claimed in an interview with ITV broadcast on Sunday that the EU had been \u201cvery unfair\u201d on American exporters, and that it would \u201cmorph into something very big\u201d that would \u201cturn out to be very much to [the EU\u2019s] detriment\u201d. Washington is currently examining the case for protecting US economic interests on national security grounds, including the imposition of import tariffs on aluminium and steel. Responding to Trump\u2019s comments, a spokesman for the European commission told reporters in Brussels that the EU was ready to hit back if its importers were made to suffer. The spokesman said: \u201cFor us trade policy is not a zero sum game. It is not about winners and losers. We here in the European Union believe that trade can and should be win-win. The full report is here: The latest set of US inflation figures have risen in December in line with forecasts. The personal consumption expenditures price index - it may be a mouthful but it is the Federal Reserve\u2019s preferred measure of inflation - climbed from 0.1% in November to 0.2% last month. On an annual basis it rose 1.5%, the same as in November. It is still below the Fed\u2019s 2% target. Meanwhile consumer spending increased by 0.4% last month, again in line with expectations. The November figure was revised upwards from an initial reading of 0.6% to 0.8%. Personal income rose 0.4%, up from 0.3% in November, while wages increased by 0.5%. The savings rate fell to 2.4% from 2.5% in November, the lowest level since September 2005. Stock markets are pretty steady at the moment, but will that last if bond yields continue to climb? On the weak pound, financial analyst Connor Campbell at Spreadex said: With little else to focus on investors turned their attention to Theresa May\u2019s most recent bout of Tory turbulence, much to the pound\u2019s displeasure. The Prime Minister is dealing with the umpteenth swell of dissent over the state of her leadership, while at the same time having to try and quash the latest beef between her warring ministers, this round sparked by leaked Whatsapp messages from climate change minister Claire Perry calling Brexit voters \u2018swivel-eyed\u2019. Add onto that the Lords constitution committee labelling the EU withdrawal bill as \u2018fundamentally flawed\u2019 just one day before the legislation is set to be debated, alongside a warning from EU leaders that the UK is \u2018not ready\u2019 to secure a divorce deal, and there was plenty for the previously soaring pound to fret about. The pound continues to slip back against the dollar, and is now down 0.66% at $1.4074. Against the euro, sterling is down 0.32% at \u20ac1.1352. As well as the dollar\u2019s recovery, the pound is being hit by renewed Brexit uncertainty, after the continuing splits in the Conservative party and the prime minister\u2019s perceived weakness. President Trump said at Davos on Friday that he wanted free and fair trade, comments which did little to assuage fears of a possible trade war. Especially since they followed the imposition of tariffs on washing machines and solar panels from China and South Korea. Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK, said: President Trump\u2019s speech on Friday did nothing to increase [concerns about a trade war], but neither did they assuage them. His comments that the US wanted free but \u201cfair\u201d trade suggested that he would not be shy in confronting what he considered unfair trade practices, potentially putting him on a collision course with China, as well as the European Union. And here\u2019s a response from Europe: On a lighter note: Is this the end of the battle for the sunbed? Thomas Cook is offering holidaymakers the chance to pre-book sun loungers, eliminating the need for the dawn dash to the pool to bag one with a towel. For \u20ac25, customers will be able to book a specific sun lounger for their entire holiday. The Anglo-German company says it is the UK\u2019s first package holiday firm to offer this service, which it is trialling at three hotels in Lanzarote, Gran Canaria and Fuerteventura from the end of February. Customers will receive an email six days before departure asking if they would like to choose their sunbed in advance. They will be able to choose their preferred spot on a pool plan featuring a compass to help them work out what time of the day areas will be in the sun or shade. Read more here: The FTSE 100 is currently managing to stay in positive territory, just. But European markets have slipped back after a bright early start. The UK\u2019s leading index is up 0.13% while Germany\u2019s Dax has dipped 0.23% and France\u2019s Cac is down 0.07%. On Wall Street the Dow Jones Industrial Average is expected to open some 37 points lower, but Joshua Mahony, market analyst at IG, reckons US markets could generally be a better bet than European bourses. He said: The FTSE 100 [is] gaining ground thanks to a weaker pound and a strengthening price of copper. Rising copper prices have helped boost the commodity-heavy FTSE 100, with Anglo American, Glencore, Rio Tinto, and Antofagasta helping drive the index into the green. After last week\u2019s losses, UK traders will hope that this will represent the beginning of a resurgence for the FTSE, yet with the dollar devaluation likely to drive the pound higher yet, it makes more sense to be long US markets over their European counterparts. Today sees a somewhat serene start to what is likely to be a fairly frantic week, with the second half providing a whole host of top tier economic data points to drive market sentiment. Donald Trump\u2019s state of the union address tomorrow sees the market focus shift back to US economic prospects, and with the potential for a raft of infrastructure projects around the corner, there is another good reason to be long US stocks. Here\u2019s the Reuters report on the earlier Chinese central bank comments: China will consider including shadow banking, property financing and internet financing in its macro-prudential assessment (MPA), central bank vice governor Yi Gang wrote on Monday, according to China Finance, a publication under the People\u2019s Bank of China. The world\u2019s second-biggest economy still has problems and hidden dangers as the country\u2019s debt levels are still high while asset bubble risks have not yet been fully contained, Yi wrote. The central bank will maintain prudent and neutral monetary policy while seeking to increase flexibility and effectiveness of liquidity management, Yi said. China has conditions to keep the yuan basically stable, Yi said, adding that the regulator will look to increase the yuan\u2019s exchange rate flexibility. Back in the volatile world of cryptocurrencies, bitcoin is down 3.5% at $11,284 on fears of a further crackdown by regulators, this time in Japan. This follows news that one exchange, Coincheck, would refund around $400m to customers after hackers stole holdings in NEM, the world\u2019s tenth biggest cryptocurrency. NEM is currently down around 8%. Fiona Cincotta at City Index said: This incident highlights one of the biggest concerns towards crypto currencies, namely security. The Japanese government have ordered Coincheck to beef up its security to prevent a repeat incident, as more authorities are clamping down on the virtual currency. Given the headline grabbing numbers, this hack is unlikely to disappear into headline history fast. Japan is one of the largest markets for cryptocurrency trading, accounting for around 30% -40% of global traded volume last month. Should this hack seriously dent confidence in virtual currencies, Bitcoin could see the selloff extended. Bond prices are coming under pressure on the growing signs that central banks are moving away from their low interest rate and QE programmes. With the US economy growing at 2.6% in the final quarter and the Bank of Japan governor saying inflation was close to reaching its target, US Treasury bonds fell and the yield [or interest rate] rose. In Europe comments over the weekend from Klass Knot, head of the Dutch central bank, that the ECB should clarify how it will end its asset purchases have also hit the bond market. Germany\u2019s yield on its five year bonds has risen to 0.004%, the first time it has been in positive territory for more than three years. French and Dutch bond yields have climbed to their highest levels since July. Neil Wilson, senior market analyst at ETX Capital, said: US 10s [ten year bond yields] just hit 2.71%, while German bund yields are also on the march higher with the 5-year turning positive for the first time since 2015. It does look like this is capitulation time for bond bulls as yields are entering breakout mode, which will have important consequences for equity valuations. At this stage in the cycle it makes sense for yields to be climbing but breakout beyond the 30-year trend line does signal the bond bears are here at last. A spike to 3% in the 10-year now looks very possible and a bond market rout could spook the market. China\u2019s central bank says it will keep a prudent and neutral monetary policy, but admits the country\u2019s economy still has problems, including high debt levels and the risks of an asset bubble. It added in its latest bulletin that it had the right conditions to keep the renminbi basically stable, and said a two way fluctuation in yuan rates would become the norm. Julian Dunkerton, the co-founder of Superdry, is nearly \u00a318m richer after selling part of his stake in the fashion retailer. Dunkerton, which is now the company\u2019s product and brand director, sold one million shares at the end of last week at \u00a317.80 each. That amounts to 1.23% of the company and still leaves him with more than 25%, making him its largest shareholder. Superdry shares have surged 20% over the past year but an update earlier this month saw them slip back after it revealed a 28% fall in half year profits. More on the collapse of construction group Carillion. Julia Kollewe reports: Accountancy firm KPMG is to be investigated by the UK\u2019s Financial Reporting Council over its role in the collapse of Carillion. The business secretary, Greg Clark, welcomed the investigation, which the accounting watchdog said followed inquiries made since Carillion\u2019s shock profit warning in July. The FRC said it would conduct the investigation, which will cover 2014 to 2016, and additional audit work carried out during 2017, \u201c as quickly and thoroughly as possible\u201d. Carillion went into compulsory liquidation two weeks ago with debts of \u00a31.3bn, a pension deficit of nearly \u00a31bn and a host of unfinished public contracts. The full story is here: The move comes ahead of a select committee hearing tomorrow with the FRC, the Insolvency Service and Carillion pension trustees. MPs have already accused the Pensions Regulator of failing to act while Carillion racked up debts to pay dividends and executive bonuses, as the business built up a pension deficit that reached nearly \u00a31bn by the time it collapsed this month. As expected, most European markets have opened in positive territory - just about - helped by the weakness of the pound and euro against the dollar. A weaker currency gives a boost to exporters, with the FTSE 100 in particular packed with overseas earners. The UK\u2019s leading index is up 0.14%, also benefiting from positive performances by mining groups after a 1% rise in the copper price. But drinks group Diageo, one of those which might be expected to benefit from a weaker pound, is down nearly 1% after a downgrade by analysts at RBC. Germany\u2019s Dax and France\u2019s Cac have climbed 0.1%, Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB is up 0.17% but Spain\u2019s Ibex has dipped 0.2%. Despite the prospect of further US interest rate rises this year, ING Bank believes the dollar weakness is likely to continue (notwithstanding today\u2019s move higher.) Apart from the US inflation data later and the two day Federal Reserve meeting which starts tomorrow, there is another big event which could have a major impact on the curreny. ING foreign exchange strategist Viraj Patel says: In an action-packed week for global markets, the main event will be President Trump\u2019s State of the Union address (Tueday 2100 ET) \u2013 which is set to outline the administration\u2019s 2018 policy agenda ahead of the pivotal November midterms. With US trade policy in particular focus, the burning question for investors is which type of Donald Trump will turn up: Dr Jekyll or Mr Hyde? While the former manifestation may have appealed to the international elite at Davos, we would not be entirely surprised to see the more fiery characteristics of the President surface back on home soil in Washington. Indeed, with President Trump fighting low approval ratings, fresh allegations that he wanted to fire Special Counsel Robert Mueller last year and with little policy progress to show (beyond the Tax Bill) \u2013 there\u2019s every chance that the \u2018America First\u2019 policy talk has a protectionist sting in the tail this week. As such, we expect global risk sentiment to remain on red alert ahead of the speech \u2013 with outside risks that USD/JPY could fall to the 107.00 level on a more contentious Trump State of the Union address. As for the dollar\u2019s broader trajectory, it will now be very difficult for Washington to put the \u2018weak dollar\u2019 genie back in the bottle. The damage is already done \u2013 and with structural factors \u2013 such as a late US economic cycle, relative US asset valuations and the twin current account and fiscal deficits \u2013 all supporting a weaker dollar trend, the naturally tendency will be for the greenback to fall over the course of 2018. Add a US political and policy uncertainty premium into the mix \u2013 and the dollar\u2019s decline could transpire quicker than what we had initially expected. The weaker pound and euro are expected to give some support to stock markets when they open.: Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. The dollar has been under pressure for some time now, and is set for its worst start to a year for around 30 years. Conversely US stock markets are making their best start for the same period, partly due to that very dollar weakness. Concerns that President Trump\u2019s tax reforms will add to the already hefty US deficit have undermined sentiment for the US currency, as has the prospect of a trade war which picked up pace last week as the US slapped tariffs on washing machines and solar panels from China and South Korea. Contrasting comments at Davos did not help. Treasury secretary Steve Mnuchin said he didn\u2019t mind a weak dollar, then Trump said virtually the opposite a day or so later. But the weakness in the dollar looks like it might be starting to attract some bargain hunters, with the currency regaining a little ground in Asia and edging higher in Europe. And although the Federal Reserve is expected to make no move on interest rates at this week\u2019s meeting - the swansong for Janet Yellen as Fed chair - further rises are expected this year. Later today come some US inflation figures which are likely to influence whether the dollar can hold onto its gains. Jasper Lawler at London Capital Group said: Investors will now look ahead to the release of US PCE [personal consumption expenditure] figures, the Fed\u2019s preferred measure of inflation. Month on month inflation is expected to have increased 0.2% in December, from 0.1%. Meanwhile, on a annualised basis a constant reading of 1.5% is forecast. Given the ongoing concerns at the Fed over the sluggish inflation in the US, a higher reading this afternoon, could help cement the dollar\u2019s bounce. At the moment the dollar\u2019s recovery has left the pound 0.28% lower at $1.4128 while against the euro sterling has dipped 0.1% to \u20ac1.1376. As well as being affected by the dollar\u2019s recovery, the pound is being undermined by renewed Brexit concerns, with peers saying the EU withdrawal bill needs to be withdrawn and the prime minister under growing pressure amid calls for the chancellor to be sacked. The US PCE figures are due at 1.30pm GMT, which is the main item on the economic agenda.",

Labor frontbenchers on Wednesday were fielding calls from the public after the Australian Conservation Foundation issued a call to action on Facebook, urging its supporters to ring and email political offices over the next 24 hours. The environment movement hopes to persuade Labor to adopt a legal strategy to kill the project. That is currently under active consideration, with a number of key ALP players favouring a tough line on Adani. So, as Labor mulls its options, we examined what some of the mechanisms might be. Where things stand now Adani\u2019s Carmichael coalmine, and all the associated infrastructure, has gained its approvals under state and federal environmental laws. Several appeals were filed, some being rejected by courts and others upheld. But, even when upheld, there\u2019s nothing stopping environment ministers from simply regranting the approval \u2013 which is what happened with Adani. While there is now little that opponents to the mine can do from outside government, there is still room, potentially, in federal environmental law for a government to pull the plug on the project, and there are also options to amend the current framework. A new climate trigger Labor is examining several options. One is to insert a \u201cclimate trigger\u201d into the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act. A climate trigger would help deal with the problem that Australia\u2019s environmental protection framework is limited in scope. A climate trigger would, potentially, allow a future Labor government to require a new assessment process for the Adani mine, with tougher parameters, and allow an environment minister to withdraw approval for the project specifically on climate change grounds. This strategy would be tougher to enact if the mine was operational by the time Labor won government but current indications suggest the financing of the project is fraught. Labor\u2019s position is no taxpayer support for the project and Queensland has already decided to veto any loan to the Indian mining company from the Northern Australia Infrastructure Facility. Options under the existing legal framework The simplest way for a future government to kill Adani\u2019s ambitions to build its mine under the existing framework is to call on one of two little-used sections of the EPBC Act. Sections 144 and 145 of the EPBC act allow for an environment minister to, respectively, suspend or reject an approval that has already been made. Section 145, which allows for the approval to be revoked entirely, simply requires that the minister believes that the mine would have an impact a matter of national environmental significance, which was not identified at the time the approval was granted. If the minister finds the information available now would have meant the original approval would not have been made, they may then simply revoke the approval. In fact, this particular section of the EPBC was cited by lawyers at Environment Justice Australia who, acting on behalf of the renowned coral scientist Charlie Veron, wrote to the minister for energy and the environment, Josh Frydenberg, in July 2017, asking him to revoke approval. The lawyers said the two back-to-back bleaching events on the Great Barrier Reef in 2016 and 2017 could not have been known back in 2015 when the approval was granted, and constitute new information that shows the mine will have an impact on a matter of national environmental significance. \u201cWhen your predecessor approved the proposed action of Adani Mining Pty Ltd to develop and operate the Carmichael Coal Mine and Rail Infrastructure Project on 14 October 2015, information about the extent and severity of the 2016 and 2017 coral bleaching events and the probability of the increase in frequency and severity of coral bleaching events due to climate change noted above was not before the him,\u201d they wrote. \u201cIn effect we have moved from scientific prediction, which is open to challenge, to current reality, which is there for all to see.\u201d The lawyers also pointed to new scientific data showing that the bleaching events would have been virtually impossible without human greenhouse gas emissions. That study also found continued greenhouse gas emissions would mean conditions like those in 2016 would be normal in less than two decades. \u201cMaintaining the approval for the Adani mine under the EPBC act is inconsistent with the need to protect the Great Barrier Reef from climate change,\u201d the lawyers concluded. \u201cYou have it within your power to revoke the approval and we ask that you do so.\u201d There are other \u201cmatters of national significance\u201d that might also be used to trigger this section too. The minister might become aware of new information about how the mine might impact the threatened black-throated finch, for example, which is expected to lose its best habitat as a result of the mine being built. There are also rare ecological communities that rely on springs, some of which will disappear when groundwater is used under the mine\u2019s unlimited water licence. The super trawler Some experts point to another precedent set in 2012 when the then Labor government amended the EPBC act to ban a super trawler that intended to fish in one of Australia\u2019s fishery zones. The government amended the legislation to allow the environment minister, then Tony Burke, to prohibit a declared commercial fishing activity until an expert panel could assess what the owners of the super trawler intended to do. The owners of the super trawler, Seafish, challenged the government\u2019s move but the legal challenge was dismissed by the federal court.",
