                "bodyText":"The race is on to become the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s first trillion-dollar company, with all eyes fixed on tech giants such as Apple, Amazon, Facebook and Alphabet, the parent company of Google. Financial commentators and investors predict 2018 will herald the first firm with a stock market valuation of $1tn (\u00c2\u00a3738bn) or more, if technology share prices continue to rise as strongly as in 2017. Apple is leading the way, with a market valuation of $869bn on Tuesday, a figure arrived at by multiplying the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s share price by the number of shares in circulation. The Californian firm that transformed mobile communications, music and photography with the iPhone is $140bn ahead of Alphabet, which has a market value of $729bn. Apple, which was on the verge of bankruptcy in 1997 when its founder, Steve Jobs, retook the helm, would require a 15% increase in its share price to tip over the $1tn threshold. Apple\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shares increased by 47% last year. The shares were up 1.8% to $172.26 at the close of trading in New York on Tuesday after a dip in the last couple of weeks. Barron\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s, the US investment magazine, declared on its cover last week that Apple would hit the $1tn valuation this year and that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153we don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think the peak [of Apple\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rise] is near\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Apple earned revenue of $229bn in its latest financial year, and made profits of $48bn \u00e2\u20ac\u201c roughly as much as Microsoft and JP Morgan combined. David Rolfe, chief investment officer at Wedgewood Partners, which manages $25bn worth of funds, told Barron\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153You have to go back to Rockefeller and Standard Oil to find a company so dominant in a business so large. Other companies settle for unit sales or revenues, but in many quarters, Apple collects more than 80% of gross profit across the smartphone industry.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd George Salmon, an equity analyst at stockbroker Hargreaves Lansdown, said markets were forecast to continue their boom in 2018 and that it was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153just a matter of time\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd before one of the big US tech stocks tipped over into a trillion-dollar company. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153With Facebook, Google and Amazon attracting an ever-increasing number of eyeballs on screen, the US tech sector has more than played its part in the global stock market rally,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Salmon said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153However, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Apple, one of the older tech giants, that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s in pole position to break through the $1tn barrier.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Ian Forrest, an investment research analyst at the Share Centre, said the creation of a trillion-dollar company was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153inevitable\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It may not happen this year, if we have a correction [fall in stock markets] but it is certain to happen over the next five years,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said. Microsoft is in third place with a valuation of $664bn, but some analysts reckon that the online retail juggernaut Amazon is far more likely to take the crown as the first $1tn company because it is growing so quickly. Amazon is the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fourth most-valuable company with a market capitalisation of $566bn. Amazon\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shares increased in value by 58% last year, turning the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s founder and chief executive, Jeff Bezos, into the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s richest man with a net worth of $99bn. His fortune increased by $34bn last year.

Facebook, which floated on the stock market less than six years ago, is in fifth place, with a valuation of $520bn. Shares in the social network rose 56% last year. The world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s top five companies are collectively worth $3.35tn \u00e2\u20ac\u201c more than than gross domestic product of the UK and every other country on Earth bar the US, China, Japan and Germany. The huge increase in valuations came after global stock markets ended 2017 at record highs, as share prices benefitted from President Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tax cuts and continued quantitative easing from central banks. Many analysts expect global stocks to continue to rise in 2018, which would be the ninth consecutive year of gains for the US S&amp;P 500 index.

                "body":"<p>Welcome to the world of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153melt-up\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, a phrase we could be hearing a lot in coming months. It describes the idea that the US stock market, despite currently looking absurdly expensive by traditional yardsticks, could be set for one last euphoric hurrah before the inevitable crash happens.</p> <p>There are a couple of reasons why the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153melt-up\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd theory may not be as wacky as it sounds. First, it comes from Jeremy Grantham, an investor who has rightly earned a reputation for knowing how to read financial bubbles. He dodged the end-of-the-century dotcom bubble and the 2007-09 blowup in the US housing market \u00e2\u20ac\u201c two of the best calls anybody could have made in the past 20 years.</p> <p>Grantham\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s default setting, as you would expect, tends to be bearish, or at least cautious. If he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s talking melt-up, that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s newsworthy. Besides, GMO, the Boston-based fund management group he founded, manages $75bn of assets \u00e2\u20ac\u201c he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a player.</p> <p>A second reason is that Grantham is certainly not arguing that shares are cheap. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We can be as certain as we ever get in stock market analysis that the current price is exceptionally high,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he states. Instead, his melt-up thinking is driven by a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153mish-mash of statistical and psychological factors based on previous eras\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/dec/29/global-markets-end-on-record-high-after-adding-9tn-in-2017\">Global markets end on record high after adding $9tn in 2017</a> </p> </aside>  <p>On the statistical side, he points out that the global economy is in sync, profit margins are fat and president Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s corporate tax cuts could make them even fatter and \u00e2\u20ac\u0153perhaps provide the oomph to keep stock prices rising\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Then there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the fact that the current strength in the stock market is fairly broad-based. In past bubbles, the end was nigh when gains were concentrated in an increasingly small collection of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153winners\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. The likes of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/apple\">Apple</a> are roaring this time, but the same divergence has not occurred \u00e2\u20ac\u201c yet.</p> <p>For \u00e2\u20ac\u0153touchy-feely\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd evidence of excess about to appear, Grantham looks at media coverage. US newspapers and TV stations are getting interested in financial markets (with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/bitcoin\">bitcoin</a>, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a true, crazy mini-bubble of its own\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, to the fore) but not yet with the wild obsession of the frenzied dotcom years. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Keep an eye on what the TVs at lunchtime eateries are showing,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he says.</p> <p>Grantham\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s guess is that there is more than a 50% chance of a melt-up, or end-phase of the bubble, within the next six months to two years. If it happens, then there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a 90% probability of a melt-down, which could mean a halving of share prices from the peak.</p> <p>A credible theory? Well, yes, anything is possible. A year ago, when the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/jan/25/dow-jones-industrial-average-breaks-record-20000\">Dow Jones industrial average passed 20,000</a>, few thought it would hit 25,000 within 12 months \u00e2\u20ac\u201c but it happened on Thursday. Is that a case of extreme euphoria, or just early signs of it? Given the impossibility of knowing, Grantham\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s advice to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153brace yourself\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd sounds reasonable. Brace, and keep a clear eye on the exit.</p> <h2>Debenhams Christmas tidings not as joyful as chief predicted</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f021ce65aab1bb57388d4f474f83f64f56894603\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f021ce65aab1bb57388d4f474f83f64f56894603/0_43_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Exterior of Debenhams store with discounts on offer\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Debenhams: still not \u00e2\u20ac\u02dca destination, digital and different\u00e2\u20ac\u2122.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Phil Noble/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Eight months ago the chief executive of Debenhams, Sergio Bucher was telling investors he would make the tired-looking department store group \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a destination, digital and different\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd.

That won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t cut much ice with investors.

Equally, however, you can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t blame investors for taking a gloomy view \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the shares plunged 15% and Debenhams is now worth just \u00c2\u00a3370m. Five years ago, the business was making \u00c2\u00a3139m of pre-tax profits and the downwards trend has been consistent.</p> <p>Borrowings are lower than they were in the bad old days of private equity ownership, as the company keeps saying, but the current \u00e2\u20ac\u0153medium-term financial leverage target\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd is to reduce net debt to 0.5 times top-line operating profits. The new profits forecast may mean no progress whatsoever from last year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 1.3 times.

                "bodyText":"Welcome to the world of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153melt-up\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, a phrase we could be hearing a lot in coming months. It describes the idea that the US stock market, despite currently looking absurdly expensive by traditional yardsticks, could be set for one last euphoric hurrah before the inevitable crash happens. There are a couple of reasons why the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153melt-up\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd theory may not be as wacky as it sounds. First, it comes from Jeremy Grantham, an investor who has rightly earned a reputation for knowing how to read financial bubbles. He dodged the end-of-the-century dotcom bubble and the 2007-09 blowup in the US housing market \u00e2\u20ac\u201c two of the best calls anybody could have made in the past 20 years. Grantham\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s default setting, as you would expect, tends to be bearish, or at least cautious. If he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s talking melt-up, that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s newsworthy. Besides, GMO, the Boston-based fund management group he founded, manages $75bn of assets \u00e2\u20ac\u201c he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a player. A second reason is that Grantham is certainly not arguing that shares are cheap. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We can be as certain as we ever get in stock market analysis that the current price is exceptionally high,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he states. Instead, his melt-up thinking is driven by a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153mish-mash of statistical and psychological factors based on previous eras\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. On the statistical side, he points out that the global economy is in sync, profit margins are fat and president Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s corporate tax cuts could make them even fatter and \u00e2\u20ac\u0153perhaps provide the oomph to keep stock prices rising\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Then there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the fact that the current strength in the stock market is fairly broad-based. In past bubbles, the end was nigh when gains were concentrated in an increasingly small collection of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153winners\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. The likes of Apple are roaring this time, but the same divergence has not occurred \u00e2\u20ac\u201c yet. For \u00e2\u20ac\u0153touchy-feely\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd evidence of excess about to appear, Grantham looks at media coverage. US newspapers and TV stations are getting interested in financial markets (with bitcoin, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a true, crazy mini-bubble of its own\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, to the fore) but not yet with the wild obsession of the frenzied dotcom years. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Keep an eye on what the TVs at lunchtime eateries are showing,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he says. Grantham\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s guess is that there is more than a 50% chance of a melt-up, or end-phase of the bubble, within the next six months to two years. If it happens, then there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a 90% probability of a melt-down, which could mean a halving of share prices from the peak. A credible theory? Well, yes, anything is possible. A year ago, when the Dow Jones industrial average passed 20,000, few thought it would hit 25,000 within 12 months \u00e2\u20ac\u201c but it happened on Thursday. Is that a case of extreme euphoria, or just early signs of it? Given the impossibility of knowing, Grantham\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s advice to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153brace yourself\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd sounds reasonable. Brace, and keep a clear eye on the exit. Debenhams Christmas tidings not as joyful as chief predicted Eight months ago the chief executive of Debenhams, Sergio Bucher was telling investors he would make the tired-looking department store group \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a destination, digital and different\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. He didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t quite disavow discounting, but the tactic would be deployed less often and with more impact. Nice idea, shame about the results. Even before the completion of one lap of a three-year plan, Debenhams has coughed up a horrible profits warning that imperils shareholders\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 dividends, even if nobody is saying so yet. Profits for the full year will arrive at \u00c2\u00a355m-\u00c2\u00a365m. Call that a plunge of a third from last year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00c2\u00a395m. Debenhams\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Christmas grumbles sound familiar. The report was a long complaint about the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153highly competitive\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and \u00e2\u20ac\u0153promotion-driven\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd state of the market, especially on \u00e2\u20ac\u0153gifts\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, which is shorthand for everything from booze to Christmas crackers. That won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t cut much ice with investors. The likes of B&amp;M, with its cheap\u00e2\u20ac\u2122n\u00e2\u20ac\u2122cheerful sheds, aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t going away. One can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t, of course, judge a three-year revival plan on the basis of one bad Christmas. Equally, however, you can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t blame investors for taking a gloomy view \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the shares plunged 15% and Debenhams is now worth just \u00c2\u00a3370m. Five years ago, the business was making \u00c2\u00a3139m of pre-tax profits and the downwards trend has been consistent. Borrowings are lower than they were in the bad old days of private equity ownership, as the company keeps saying, but the current \u00e2\u20ac\u0153medium-term financial leverage target\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd is to reduce net debt to 0.5 times top-line operating profits. The new profits forecast may mean no progress whatsoever from last year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 1.3 times. That is why a dividend costing \u00c2\u00a342m a year looks unsustainable \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the theoretical (or imaginary) dividend yield of 11% says as much. Bucher came from Amazon, where they don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have to worry about excess store space, long leaseholds or even shareholders\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 dividend expectations. Good luck \u00e2\u20ac\u201c this job looks much harder.",

Come back on Monday to find out :) Until then, goodnight! GW Hello again. Marketwatch has an interesting explanation for the market rally: Investors are feeling good about the U.S. stock market. In fact, they haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t felt this good in years. The latest AAII investor sentiment survey, conducted on Jan. 3., indicates that 59.8% of polled investors are bullish on the market, meaning they expect prices will be higher in six months. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the highest level in about seven years, since a reading of 63.3% on Dec. 23, 2010, and it is significantly above the 38.5% historical average. The number of bullish investors has gone up by 7.1 percentage points in the past week alone. There has been a corresponding drop in both bearish and neutral investors. The percentage of market pessimists has dropped to 15.6%, down 5.1 percentage points over the last week, while neutral investors have slid by 2 percentage points to 24.7%. Both are below their historical averages, which is 30.5% for bears and 31% for neutral investors. More here: Bullish sentiment for U.S. stocks is at a seven-year high OK, time for a recap. The global stock market rally has driven Britain and America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock markets to fresh highs today, despite an underwhelming employment report from the US. The Dow Jones index has pushed further over the 25,000 mark, while in London the FTSE 100 has closed at a new peak over 7,700. Shares jumped despite the news that America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t create as many jobs in December as expected. The closely-watched Non-Farm Payroll only rose by 148,000, missing forecasts of a 190,000 gain, while wage growth was unexceptional at 2.5% over the last year. My colleague Dominic Rushe explains: The headline numbers suggest that the jobs market remains strong. The labor department announced that the unemployment rate held steady at 4.1% in December, close to a 17-year low. The US economy has now added more than 2m jobs a year for seven straight years, a run last seen in the 1990s. But the pace of hiring has slowed, the recovery remains uneven, and wages continue to lag behind growth. Analysts voiced concerns that US retailers cut jobs in December - despite the festive shopping season. In the UK, car sales fell in December for the first time since 2011 - and by the biggest amount since 2009. Further falls are expected in 2018, as consumers continue to shun diesel cars -- with some switching to electric cars instead. The automobile industry is now urging the government to agree a Brexit transition deal by March, at the latest, otherwise manufacturers will be forced to trigger contingency plans. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be back later with the close of Wall Street.... Boom! The FTSE 100 has ended the week at a new all-time high. The blue-chip index of the biggest companies listed in London has closed at 7724 - the first time it has finished over the 7700 mark. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a gain of 28 points, or 0.37%. Energy provider Centrica and water group United Utilities were the biggest risers, up around 3% after an analyst upgrade. But insurance group Admiral led the fallers, down 3% after figures showed UK car sales fell last year - and may keep falling in 2018. Fewer new cars means less insurance business. Other European markets also had a strong day, as the first week of 2018 gets off to a strong start. No wonder analysts are talking about a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcmelt-up\u00e2\u20ac\u2122.... I missed this detail earlier, but the opening bell of the New York stock exchange was rung by a professional bull rider - J.B. Mauney. This honour was to mark the 25 anniversary of Professional Bull Riders (an enterprise devoted to the noble art of not falling off a 2000 pound bull with a temper). You know you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re in a bull market when you see stetsons on a trading floor.... With 30 minutes to go, London\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock market could end the week at a new record high. The FTSE has dropped back from this morning\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s intraday peaks, but is still 11 points higher than yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s record close, at 7707 points. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a nice summary of the US jobs report: Just in: German lender Deutsche Bank says Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tax reform package will cost it \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.5bn. This makes Deutsche Bank the latest in a string of major companies to announce that their deferred tax assets are less valuable, now that America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s corporation tax rate is being cut from 35% to 21%. Deutsche also says that weak markets have hit its revenues, meaning it will post a small loss for the fourth quarter of the financial year. This has sent Deutsche\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shares sliding almost 5%. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s slightly ironic, as Deutsche Bank has been a major lender to Donald Trump over the years (a relationship that has come under increasing scrutiny). MSNBC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Steve Benen have calculated that US job creation slowed last year - the first 12 months of Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s presidency. Benen writes: Now that we have data for all of the previous calendar year, we can note that the U.S. added 1.84 million jobs in 2011, 2.19 million jobs in 2012, 2.33 million in 2013, 3.11 million in 2014, 2.74 million in 2015, 2.24 million in 2016, and 2.05 million in 2017. Or put another way, while Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s first year as president has been pretty good overall for job creation, Americans nevertheless saw the slowest job growth in six years. Newsflash: US factory orders rose by 1.3% in November, beating the consensus forecast of 1.1% growth. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s up from 0.4% in October, and the fourth monthly rise in a row. American factories reported rising demand for transportation and electrical equipment. However.... the latest survey of America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s services sector is less impressive. Growth slowed to a four-month low in December, according to ISM\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s non-manufacturing index which has dipped to 55.9 from 57.6. Boom! The US stock market has hit fresh record highs (yet again) at the start of trading in New York. Traders are shrugging off the news that America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s job creation slowed last month. The Dow Jones continued its march upwards, gaining 70 points to 25,145. The S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq are also pushing higher, as the bull market shows no inclination to fizzle out. But while shares rise, the US dollar has dropped. Jacob Deppe, Head of Trading at online trading platform, Infinox, explains: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Surprisingly, Wall Street shook off the lower than expected jobs data and rose still higher, although the Dollar fell 0.3% versus the Euro and 0.26% versus the Pound on the news. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153December\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Non-Farm Payrolls data does not fit the current narrative of booming US growth. The initial reaction from the market is to ignore. That could be perilous. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also possible markets have decided the recent harsh weather contributed to the slowdown in jobs The good news is that America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy has now created jobs for 87 months in a row - dating back to early in Barack Obama\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s first term as president. That has helped to pull the jobless rate down to its lowest since the end of 2000, at just 4.1%. Bart Hordijk, Market Analyst at Monex Europe, says the US may be approaching full employment: \u00e2\u20ac\u01532017 has been an extraordinary year for the US labour market, with around 200K jobs added every month, leading the Unemployment Rate to its lowest point in 16 years. The fact that we now see a slowdown can be more of a sign of employers not being able to find qualified personnel, than it is an indicator of weakness in the US economy. Despite the fact that the Hourly Earnings Growth remains soft, this can report can still be a nudge for the Federal Reserve in the direction of hiking the rates. The 148,000 increase in the US non-farm payroll last month was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153slightly disappointing\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, says Paul Ashworth of Capital Economics. He also singles out the drop in retail employment: Looking at the December gain in detail, manufacturing had a strong month, adding 25,000 jobs. Given the strength of the global economy, the decline in the dollar and the recent strength evident in the surveys, we can expect further factory job gains in the next few months. The obvious weakness was in retail, which shed 20,300 jobs. That could be just noise or a consequence of the shift from bricks and mortar stores to online. As a comparison, couriers &amp; messengers added only 2,100 jobs, so in net terms the structural shift is hardly positive for employmen Kully Samra, UK Managing Director at Charles Schwab, says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The US economy ended on a mixed note in 2017. However, despite disappointing job numbers, over the year average hourly earnings have risen by 2.5%. In addition, we have seen the economy grow quarter on quarter, manufacturing and services indices rise and other factors such as business confidence and housing are also picking up. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ian Kernohan, economist at Royal London Asset Management, on today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Non-Farm Payroll: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153There was something for everyone in the latest US Labour Market Report. On the one hand, employment growth slipped below 200,000 after a couple of strong months, while on the other, the headline rate of unemployment remained very low at just 4.1%, on an unchanged participation rate. Wage growth ticked higher to 2.5%, still a very modest rate despite the sharp fall in unemployment over the past few years. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The Federal Reserve puts much more weight on labour market data than on any other information, including the volatile and often misleading early estimates for GDP. Most survey based indicators of economic growth are strong in the US, and while the current severe weather is bound to impact economic activity in Q1, the Fed tend to look through these events, and are still on track to raise interest rates once again in March.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Jobs site Indeed.com have made a handy charts showing where jobs were created, or destroyed, last month across the US economy: Ben Casselman of the New York Times is also worried by the fall in retail jobs Seth Harris, who was deputy US labor secretary under president Obama, is concerned by the rise in under-employment (the U-6 rate). He tweets: Yikes! America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s retail sector cut around 20,000 jobs last month, according to today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s non-farm payroll. That could be proof that the rise of internet shopping is forcing Main Street stores to cut back. The NFP report also shows a 55,000 increase in goods-producing jobs, a 30,000 increase in construction, and a 91,000 increase in service-sector roles. Worryingly, the US under-employment rate rose to 8.1% in December, from 8.0% in October. That means more Americans wanted to work more hours than they were able. In better news, November\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s non-farm payroll has been revised up to show 252,000 new jobs were created (up from 228,000). But what the revisions give with one hand, they take with the other. October\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s NFP has been revised down to 211,000, from 244,000. Instant reaction - this isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t a great jobs report. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not a disaster either. On wages..... earnings rose by 2.5% per year in December, as expected. But November\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s wage data has been revised down, to 2.4% (from 2.5%). Breaking! The US economy created 148,000 new jobs in December. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rather less than the 190,000 which economists had predicted. The unemployment rate has come in at 4.1% - unchanged on last month. More to follow..... No argument.... Just five minutes to go, and the excitement is building.... The US jobs report is notoriously hard to predict, and invariably revised sometime in the future. But the Non-Farm Payroll is still one of the most eagerly awaited pieces of economic data in the calendar, as it gives an insight into how the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest labo(u)r market is performing. As Naeem Aslam of Think Markets puts it: Today is the day- the most important economic data, the US Non-Farm Payroll number, on the face of the earth will reveal its colour. This number sets the trading tone and the trend for the rest of the month for traders. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s number would provide us significant clues if the moderate growth in the US economy has left any impact on the jobs market, most importantly on the wage growth. Since the financial recession, the jobs market has been strengthening and this momentum was set by former President Barak Obama and Mr Trump is reaping the rewards. World stock markets are at record levels today, partly thanks to Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE 100 hitting new heights this morning. And Wall Street is likely to push the bull market even higher when trading begins -- unless the US jobs report is a shock. Lukman Otunuga, Research Analyst at FXTM says: Another day, another record high for world stocks, as a growing sense of optimism over the global economy boosts risk sentiment. Asian shares ventured higher during early trading on Friday, while European markets opened on a positive note amid the risk-on environment. With the Dow Jones Industrial Average surpassing 25,000 for the first time ever on Thursday, U.S equity bulls are clearly back in town and as such, we could see further gains on Wall Street this afternoon. Investors on both side of the Atlantic are bracing for the latest US jobs report to hit the wires, in 35 minutes time. December\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Non-Farm Payroll is expected to show that America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy created around 190,000 new jobs last month, leaving the unemployment rate at just 4.1%. However, there is talk that the NFP could be better, after another survey yesterday suggested that US firms hired 250,000 people in December. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a round-up of the latest Wall Street forecasts: Economists will also be looking closely at the wage growth figures, for signs that the US economic recovery is reaching workers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 pockets. Average earnings are expected to have risen by 2.5% per year, the same as a month ago, and by 0.3% in December alone. Craig Erlam of City firm Oanda says: We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve been promised higher inflation and wage growth for some time and investors are increasingly not buying it. Even some policy makers are starting to question why nothing has not materialised and should that continue, rate hike forecasts will start to slip, especially with interest rates now already elevated. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s jobs report should offer some insight on this, with average earnings having arguably become the most important component of it. Still earnings are only expected to have risen by 2.5% compared to a year ago, below last year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s peak and well below where they need to be for inflation to sustainably return to target. Whatever happens, we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll probably hear Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s views through the usual channel.... The Labour Party is also voicing concerns about the drop in UK car sales last year. Rebecca Long-Bailey MP, Labour\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Shadow Business Secretary, says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The Government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s mismanagement of the economy and mishandling of the Brexit negotiations has shaken consumer and business confidence and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s concerning that the sales of new cars are falling. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The industry has been warning the Government time and time again and, as has become typical with the Tories, they have failed to listen or take action. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The British car industry is a vital part of our economy, directly employing up to 170,000 people. Labour\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Industrial Strategy will set out a radical programme of investment and genuine partnership between industry and government, to protect vital jobs and build an economy that works for the many, not the few.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our financial editor, Nils Pratley, on the idea that markets are in a melt-up phase: Over in the City, the FTSE 100 index has climbed to new heights. It just hit 7727 points for the first time, up 0.4% or 31 points today, as the global stock market rally continues to bubble away. Markets have been surging in recent weeks, and there is plenty of talk that shares will keep rising as markets \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcmelt-up\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. Rupert Harrison of asset manager BlackRock (and former top official in the UK Treasury), told Bloomberg TV that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153there are very good reasons to be positive\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Harrisons says: Since coming back from New Year, the phrase I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve heard most is \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcmelt up\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been a strong start to the year, and there are good reasons for that - the data is staying barn-stormingly strong. There doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t seem to be any sign of the reversion to the mean that people had been looking out for. On top of that, you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve got tax cuts in the US juicing the prospects for earnings and also potentially boosting the Capex cycle we are in. But, Harrison also cautions that there are some potential risks, including: Everyone is \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcbought in\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 to the idea that global growth will continue, so any slowdown could alarm investors.. Trade policy: Donald Trump must soon decide whether to take action against China over the alleged dumping of cheap metals and solar panels. The US president is up early, and wasted no time in tweeting about the bull market: But as one City expert has already pointed out, each 1,000 point gain is less impressive than the last one..... While diesel sales slumped by 17% last year, sales of alternatively-fuelled vehicles jumped by almost 35% as more people bought electric cars. This shows that consumers are keen to drive less polluting vehicles, argues Greenpeace UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s clean air campaigner Paul Morozzo. He says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Sales of diesel cars are falling but sales of EVs and hybrids are growing at double-digit rates. Consumers are sending a clear message to the car industry that it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time to move on from polluting diesel and the industry should listen to it. Diesel cars have been fuelling a major air pollution crisis that has made our cities\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 air toxic and harmful to breathe. EVs and hybrids are better for both air quality and the climate. If the UK car industry fails to invest in the technologies that consumers want then they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be left behind in the race for this trillion-dollar market.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd This charts hows how the market changed last year: Back to cars, and Ana Nicholls of the Economist Intelligence Unit, has identified several reasons for the drop in sales last year: Most people who can afford a new car have bought one recently, and pent-up demand from the auto market crash during the financial crisis is now completely sated. The average age of cars on the road is now less than eight years, so there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s little replacement demand. Consumer confidence is faltering: with incomes nearly stagnant and the outlook uncertain because of Brexit people are becoming less keen to take out credit. November\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rise in interest rates didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t help, raising many people\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s mortgage payments and making the financing deals from dealers less attractive A drop in PPI claims has also cut the number of people with one-off lump sums to spend. The sharp slump in diesel sales, after the VW scandal exposed concerns about NOx emissions. With the London congestion charge now higher, and the vehicle excise duty due to rise for the most polluting diesels, buyers are edging away rapidly. In the longer term there will be a shift towards electric cars, but at the moment sales (though fast-growing) are too low to make up the difference. The latest inflation figures from the eurozone are out -- and they show that prices are rising more slowly than expected. Despite the European Central Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s huge money-printing operation, eurozone inflation probably only rose by 1.4% per year in December, down from 1.5% in November. Energy prices were up 3% year-on-year, down from 4.7% in November, while food, alcohol and tobacco inflation dipped to 2.1% from 2.2%. This seems to vindicate the ECB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision to press on with its monetary stimulus -- which has been a factor behind the rise in stock markets recently. Guardian Business has launched a daily email. Besides the key news headlines that you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d expect, there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s an at-a-glance agenda of the day\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s main events, insightful opinion pieces and a quality feature to sink your teeth into each day. For your morning shot of financial news, sign up here: Breaking away from the car sales figures.... we have good news for the UK economy. UK productivity (basically how much each worker actually produces) jumped by 0.9% in the third quarter of last year, new figures show. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the largest increase in productivity since April-June 2011, and may show that future growth will stronger than previously expected. Labour productivity grew in both the services and manufacturing industries, according to the Office for National Statistics. This looks like good news for the UK government. Last autumn, the independent Office for National Statistics slashed its forecast for productivity growth, having concluded that it would not recover to its levels before the financial crisis. Weak productivity leads to slower economy growth, smaller tax receipts and higher government borrowing. But.... UK productivity has still taken a severe knock over the last decade, and basically flat-lined since the financial crisis. Unions fear that British car workers could be laid off this year, if sales don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t recover. Tony Burke, assistant general secretary of Unite, says the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u0153world class car workers\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd will be looking to the year ahead with trepidation\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, adding: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The government has caused confusion and damage with its policy on diesel cars and needs to start listening to the industry and workforce. Diesel engines produced by Unite members in the UK are the cleanest in the world. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Ministers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 botched and badly thought through announcements are causing major damage to the industry. Combined with economic and Brexit uncertainty this risks taking the sheen off the jewel in the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s manufacturing crown and the 800,000 high skilled jobs it sustains. 2018 could be another bad year for the motor industry, if consumer confidence remains subdued. Richard Jones, managing director of motor finance group Black Horse, says the next few months will be crucial \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I believe we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll see new car sales continue to decline in the first quarter of 2018 given that this period in 2017 was so strong. This should help dampen fears of oversupply having a negative impact on used car prices and is positive in the long term by ensuring the new car market is operating from a sustainable position. I would also expect the used car market to continue to perform well. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153With uncertainties facing the UK economy it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hard to make a confident forecast for 2018 as a whole. I believe a big test for the industry will come after quarter one when we will see how the underlying UK economy and consumer confidence is influencing car demand.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Brexit is the biggest threat to the UK automobile industry this year, according to a new survey of car dealers from Close Brothers Motor Finance. More encouragingly, 92% of dealers are confident about business prospects in the market for 2018, up from 63% last year. However, that optimism could wilt if Britain doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t agree a Brexit transition deal soon.... Worryingly, the drop in diesel car sales seems to have pushed emissions of carbon dioxide up. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a disappointing consequence of consumers shunning diesel motors and buying petrol ones instead, following revelations that diesel cars were pumping more nitrogen oxides into the atmosphere than officially reported. The SMMT explains: Carbon tailpipe emissions have risen for the first time since 1997, with new cars averaging 121.04g/km, up 0.8% on 2016. Last year, UK new car CO2 emissions fell for the 19th consecutive year and this is the first year the figure has risen since records began. The SMMT have just issued a press release, confirming that UK car sales declined in 2017. Here are the key points: Overall annual demand falls -5.7% in 2017 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c but new car market still third biggest in a decade at over 2.5 million vehicles. December represents the ninth consecutive month of decline, as registrations for final month of year drop -14.4%. Appetite for electrified cars reaches record high, with almost 120,000 alternatively fuelled vehicles (AFVs) hitting UK roads \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a 34.8% uplift. Diesel demand declines -17.1%, undermining progress on emissions and CO2 as industry body warns consumers could end up paying more in fuel if they travel high mileages. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a couple of handy charts too: In contrast to the UK, car sales in Germany actually rose last year. Auto sales in Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest economy increased by 2.7% during 2017. However - as in Britain - diesel sales tumbled (by 13%). Reuters explains: Pressure is growing on Germany to tackle diesel pollution as dozens of cities including Munich and Stuttgart, where BMW and Daimler are based, could face penalties for allowing nitrogen dioxide (NO2) levels in excess of European Union limits introduced in 2010, the DUH environmental lobby has said. Newsflash: Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE 100 has hit a fresh intraday record high. The index of blue-chip companies gained another 12 points, or 0.15% points, to 7708 points, six points above yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s record levels. Rebecca O\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Keeffe, head of investment at interactive investor, says investor optimism is undimmed, for the moment.... European markets continue to make further gains, with the sheer scale of the global rally demonstrating how investors are embracing all things equity and risk related, basking in the euphoria of synchronous global growth. Equity markets, which were already strengthening well in advance of Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s $1.5tn tax cut, or indeed a prospective US infrastructure bill that could form the centrepiece of 2018 legislation, show no sign of any stress, with new record highs an almost daily occurrence. With the party in full swing and implied volatility at such low levels, markets are seemingly immune to any possible downside, but the key risk that might ultimately bring markets down is inflation. A material increase in inflationary pressures would potentially force central banks to tighten rates faster than the market is expecting Chris Bosworth, Director of Strategy at Close Brothers Motor Finance, believes Brexit anxiety and opposition to diesel cars are the main reason car sales fell last year. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s figures reflect the impact that anti-diesel messages from the government and ongoing Brexit trade negotiations are having on both business and consumer confidence across the motor industry. December marks the ninth month of consecutive decrease in new car sales as squeezed consumers are reluctant to purchase big ticket items such as cars and motorcycles. Alex Buttle, director of car buying comparison website Motorway.co.uk, says diesel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s days are numbered (after the emissions scandal). He wants the government to offer more incentives to shift to electric. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Quite frankly, 2017 has been a year to forget for the UK car industry. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153You\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d have to dig pretty deep to find anything positive to take from the past 12 months which has seen diesel demonised in the media on a weekly basis. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153As sales of new diesels continue to fall, 2017 could well mark the end of one era of motoring and the dawn of a new one, as hybrid and electric sales start to take off. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The destiny of diesel may already be set in stone. Now the Government needs to stand by its commitment to the future and put its full backing behind AFVs. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Incentives to encourage consumers to switch to hybrid and electric vehicles need to run alongside the billions of pounds of investment being pumped into the supporting infrastructure. Bloomberg blames \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Brexit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s impact on buyer confidence and lingering skepticism over the emissions performance of diesel cars\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd for the 5.6% drop in UK car sales last year. The Financial Times agrees that Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s car industry needs clarity about the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s future relationship with the EU, fast: You can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t wait until March 2019,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd [SMMT chief Mike Hawes] said, when the UK will leave the EU. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Production is a tap that takes a long time to turn on and off.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The SMMT said contingency plans could include carmakers investing in additional warehouse capacity to guard against delivery disruptions, or deciding to expand production abroad rather than produce new models in the UK. Mr Hawes said that even the more limited changes, such as investing in warehouse capacity, were the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153thin end of the wedge\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd because they would impose additional costs on British car manufacturers, making them less competitive and damaging their ability to attract new investment. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s official: Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s car industry has suffered its biggest drop in sales since the financial crisis. Sales of new vehicles fell by 5.6% during 2017 - the first annual decline since 2011, and the worst since 2009. Diesel sales were particularly dire, as my colleague Gwyn Topham explains: UK car sales declined in 2017 after five years of rapid growth, with the industry blaming government for a collapse in consumer confidence in diesel vehicles. Total sales for last year were 2.54m new vehicles, a decline of 5.6% on 2016, with diesel sales dropping 17%. Despite the decline, 2017 sales remained near the highest on record. The Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT), the UK automotive industry\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade body, has forecast a further 5% to 7% decline in sales in 2018. Mike Hawes, the SMMT\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chief executive, said 2017 had been a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153very volatile year\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. While sales reached a record high in March, by December they were 13.9% down year-on-year, with 152,000 fewer cars sold than in the same month in 2016. Hawes attributed the drop to a decline in business and consumer confidence in the wider economy and uncertainty over the future of diesel. Sales of diesel cars dropped by 31% in December, while petrol car sales dropped by 1.6%, after relatively minor tax changes targeting diesel in the November budget. The SMMT is now urging the UK government to rapidly agree a Brexit transition deal with Brussels. Otherwise, Hawes warns, carmakers will soon be forced to take tough - and potentially irreversible - decisions. He says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Some investment decisions are overdue \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 we need clarity [on the terms of a transitional period] by the end of the first quarter.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd [Otherwise] They will have to start implementing contingency plans.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. With stock markets at record levels, investors will be looking to today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s US unemployment report for reasons to keep optimistic, and keep buying assets. The monthly non-farm payroll report is expected to show that America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy continued to create jobs in December. The Wall Street consensus is that around 190,000 new workers were hired across the US last month, down from 228,000 in November. But it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s possible that the NFP could be stronger. The figures will probably also show that America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s unemployment rate remained at just 4.1%. But economists will be hoping to see evidence that employees are being paid more. David Madden of CMC Markets explains: On a month-on-month basis average earnings are tipped to increase by 0.3% and on an annual basis they are forecasted to rise by 2.5%. The US has been steadily creating new jobs over the past few years, but wage growth has been sluggish. If the US economy wants to step up a gear in terms of economic growth, wage growth and in turn the spending levels will need to tick up. Also coming up today. European stock markets are expected to open mixed, after Thursday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s strong session drove the UK FTSE 100 to a new alltime high. Last night the US Dow Jones closed over 25,000 points for the first time ever, on hopes that the world economy will remain upbeat this year. Traders will also be watching out for the latest eurozone inflation figures, and new UK car sales figures (of which more in a moment....)

It increased the total number of items sold as it kept overallfood price rises in its stores below the average industry rate. Sales of Morrisons\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 premium The Best range soared by 25% and it sold 8.8% more bags of Christmas vegetables with a three-for-\u00c2\u00a31 deal. Trade was also boosted by good sales of its Nutmeg range of children\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s and babies\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 clothes, and the expansion of its wholesale business through outlets at Rontec petrol stations and via Amazon. It also won new business in providing tobacco products to McColl\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stores that were let down by the collapse of wholesaler Palmer &amp; Harvey in late November. Online sales increased by 10% as Morrisons began delivering to more parts of the country with its partner Ocado. The majority of Morrisons\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 online sales are delivered from Ocado\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s warehouse in Dordon, Warwickshire. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This is a good start for UK food retail,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Bruno Monteyne, an analyst at Bernstein Research. But he said excitement should be tempered as it was not clear how much Morrisons had been helped by its recent move into selling non-food items, an area which many of its rivals have been exploiting for years. Despite the better than expected sales, Morrisons said it did not expect to exceed current predictions of a 10% rise in profits this year to \u00c2\u00a3371m, as it had invested in keeping prices competitive. Morrisons chief executive, David Potts, said there was no obvious sign that Brexit had hit consumer sentiment but shoppers \u00e2\u20ac\u0153were on the lookout for great value\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We feel well placed to provide that and the numbers appear to confirm it,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he added. With three consecutive years of sales growth under its belt, Potts said Morrisons would look at opening a handful of new stores, after a period of closures. The growing wholesale business was part of the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153broader, stronger Morrisons\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he wanted to build. He said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This is the start of the journey.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Morrisons has begun supplying McColl\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s with a range of own-label items under the Safeway brand, which Morrisons owns. It began deliveries to 25 stores and will add 25 more stores a week over the coming year. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2Follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk, or sign up to the daily Business Today email here.",

The intra-day peak of 7733.39 was reached on Monday. David Madden, market analyst at CMC Markets UK, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The London market has been helped along by the supermarkets as Marks and Spencer, Sainsburys and Morrisons are in demand on the back of the report from Nielsen which stated all of the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcbig four\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 had a positive Christmas period. </p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5a54e854e4b034b6630d21b4\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-01-09T16:08:52.022Z\">4.08pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>One of the main reasons for stock markets recovering so well since the financial crisis, of course, is the massive support provided by central banks in the form of low interest rates and quantitative easing. Now this support is being gradually and cautiously withdrawn, but could the process speed up, and what effect will it have on share prices? Chris Beauchamp, chief market Analyst at IG, says:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Markets continue to make gains even as investors begin to consider the possibilities of more central bank tightening over the coming year and beyond. There are those wondering whether the Bank of Japan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s moves overnight to ease back on bond purchases portends a bigger shift in global markets; if the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s most assiduous user of quantitative easing is itself easing back on the use of the proverbial punchbowl, will this mean that the others, especially the Fed and the ECB, will start to shift into a higher gear earlier than previously thought?</p> <p>At least it must be for the right reasons \u00e2\u20ac\u201c only signs of real recovery would get the BoJ to move in the direction of tighter policy, and so for now stocks should remain the best way to play the global economic recovery.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5a54e315e4b043ead794bd64\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-01-09T15:45:19.743Z\">3.45pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Meanwhile as the UK trading day enters its final straight, the FTSE 100 is tantalisingly near another record closing high.</p> <p>It is currently at 7725 which would not be an intra-day peak but would mark a new record close, just. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>While the FTSE ummed and ahhed over hitting new highs, the Dow Jones wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t as shy, opening at a fresh record peak.</p> <p>The Dow wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t <em>that</em> explosive after the bell rang on Wall Street. Yet, a 70 point rise left it tickling 25350, continuing its remarkable, seemingly unending climb. As for the afternoon\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meagre data offerings, just like its non-farm cousin last Friday, the latest JOLTS job openings reading came in below estimates, at 5.88 million compared to the downward revised 5.92 million seen the month previous.</p> <p>The FTSE rose a half a percent throughout the day, fuelled by the Morrisons-led gains in the supermarket sector, sterling\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 0.4% and 0.1% declines against the dollar and euro respectively, and a healthy set of commodity stocks. This once again leaves the UK index around the 7720 to 7730 mark, tantalisingly close to another record high \u00e2\u20ac\u201c hopefully Sainsbury\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Christmas update tomorrow will help the FTSE maintain the momentum it seems to have found today.</p> <p>Over in the Eurozone the DAX and CAC varied in their enthusiasm. The former nudged just 0.1% higher despite a far better than forecast German industrial production figure; the latter, meanwhile, found itself trading at a 2 month peak after jumping half a percent.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5a54df85e4b043ead794bd3d\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-01-09T15:32:18.623Z\">3.32pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Bitcoin is on the slide despite <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2018/jan/09/german-industrial-output-exports-eurozone-unemployment-morrisons-majestic-business-live?page=with:block-5a54ab6ee4b043ead794bad6#block-5a54ab6ee4b043ead794bad6\">the earlier comments </a>from JP Morgan chief executive Jamie Dimon that he regrets calling the cryptocurrency a fraud last September.</p> <p>Bitcoin is currently down nearly 2% at $14,708.

But the rally in oil prices to their highest level since May 2015 might fizzle out before too long, says Fawad Razaqzada, technical analyst at Forex.com:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Overnight saw the price of WTI crude hit its best level since May 2015, before falling back a little. Oil prices have hit the ground running at the start of this year, continuing their recovery from the middle of 2017, as global crude stockpiles fell from record high levels and due to good compliance with the production cuts by OPEC and Russia. Given that the production agreement has been extended to the end of 2018 at OPEC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s last meeting<strong>, </strong>the market clearly expects crude inventory levels to drop further.</p> <p>But with OPEC set to review the duration of oil output cuts based on fundamentals at its next meeting in June, there is a possibility they could end the agreement sooner than expected. What\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s more, oil prices are now at levels many regard as being high enough for US shale producers to accelerate drilling and production in the coming months. This could discourage OPEC and Russia to maintain their oil supply collusion until the end of the year, as many producers within OPEC itself won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be happy to lose further market share to the US. Thus, there is a risk that the agreement could end prematurely, potentially resulting in another supply war. </p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2018-01-09T14:39:50.029Z\">at 2.39pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5a54cb1de4b006063846c1d9\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-01-09T14:04:40.811Z\">2.04pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Leading UK shares are edging to within a hair\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s breadth of a new intra-day peak, with the FTSE 100 up 0.47% at 7733.12.</p> <p>That would beat the record of 7733.39 set as long ago as .... yesterday.

It then sets out these rules in its handbook.</p> <p>This is how what should have been a BYOD rule affecting only part of the market has been turned into a blanket ruling on BYOD affecting everyone \u00e2\u20ac\u201c right down to self-employed advisers.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>But before you chuck your phone in the bin, the FCA has since clarified that individuals can bring their own devices to work after all.</strong> However, bosses must take all reasonable steps to prevent them using them to send or receive unrecorded messages or calls. </p> <p>Another headache for the IT manager.....</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/GazTheJourno/status/950307088928051200\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Financial Conduct Authority &#39;gold-plates&#39; EU <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/MIFID?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#MIFID</a> II rule, bans BYOD across entire UK finance sector &lt;- exclusive by me <a href=\"https://t.co/9iHT4O6UFC\">https://t.co/9iHT4O6UFC</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/kUnTnaxVCz\">pic.twitter.com/kUnTnaxVCz</a></p>&mdash; Gareth Corfield (@GazTheJourno) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/GazTheJourno/status/950307088928051200?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">January 8, 2018</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2018-01-09T11:46:56.752Z\">at 11.46am GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5a54a14ee4b006063846c014\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-01-09T11:03:16.957Z\">11.03am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s government is optimistic about growth prospects in 2018:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/HandelsblattGE/status/950683947142348805\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s government expects the economy to grow this year at around the same rate as last year, when it expanded by 2.2%. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/newsdesk?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#newsdesk</a></p>&mdash; Handelsblatt Global (@HandelsblattGE) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/HandelsblattGE/status/950683947142348805?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">January 9, 2018</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5a549bd1e4b034b6630d1e76\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-01-09T11:01:33.251Z\">11.01am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2018/jan/09/german-industrial-output-exports-eurozone-unemployment-morrisons-majestic-business-live?page=with:block-5a5492e7e4b034b6630d1e18#block-5a5492e7e4b034b6630d1e18\">The decline in eurozone unemployment</a> will please the European Central Bank.</strong></p> <p>ECB president Mario Draghi has often cited falling joblessness as a defence of his stimulus policies, which cut interest rates to record lows and pumped trillions of euros into the economy.</p> <p><strong>Dennis de Jong</strong>, managing director at<strong> <a href=\"http://www.ufx.com/\">UFX.com</a>,</strong> reckons Draghi can feel vindicated, in the face of criticism from some politicians (particularly in Germany).

The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished up 34.51 points or 0.45% at 7731.02 Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax rose 0.13% to 13,385.59 France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac closed up 0.67% at 5523.94 Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB was 0.7% better at 23,004.98 Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ibex ended up 0.27% at 10,426.5 In Greece, the Athens market added 0.5% to 841.28 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently 122 points or 0.49% higher. On that note, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time to close for the day. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be back tomorrow. Healthcare and banking stocks are leading the way on Wall Street ahead of what is expected to be a strong reporting season. JP Morgan is the first big bank to report later this week. The UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s leading index has made it, closing at a new record high if not quite reaching an intra-day peak. The FTSE 100 finished up 34.51 points or 0.45% at 7731.02, beating last Friday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s record close of 7724.22. The intra-day peak of 7733.39 was reached on Monday. David Madden, market analyst at CMC Markets UK, said: The London market has been helped along by the supermarkets as Marks and Spencer, Sainsburys and Morrisons are in demand on the back of the report from Nielsen which stated all of the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcbig four\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 had a positive Christmas period. One of the main reasons for stock markets recovering so well since the financial crisis, of course, is the massive support provided by central banks in the form of low interest rates and quantitative easing. Now this support is being gradually and cautiously withdrawn, but could the process speed up, and what effect will it have on share prices? Chris Beauchamp, chief market Analyst at IG, says: Markets continue to make gains even as investors begin to consider the possibilities of more central bank tightening over the coming year and beyond. There are those wondering whether the Bank of Japan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s moves overnight to ease back on bond purchases portends a bigger shift in global markets; if the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s most assiduous user of quantitative easing is itself easing back on the use of the proverbial punchbowl, will this mean that the others, especially the Fed and the ECB, will start to shift into a higher gear earlier than previously thought? At least it must be for the right reasons \u00e2\u20ac\u201c only signs of real recovery would get the BoJ to move in the direction of tighter policy, and so for now stocks should remain the best way to play the global economic recovery. Meanwhile as the UK trading day enters its final straight, the FTSE 100 is tantalisingly near another record closing high. It is currently at 7725 which would not be an intra-day peak but would mark a new record close, just. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said: While the FTSE ummed and ahhed over hitting new highs, the Dow Jones wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t as shy, opening at a fresh record peak. The Dow wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t that explosive after the bell rang on Wall Street. Yet, a 70 point rise left it tickling 25350, continuing its remarkable, seemingly unending climb. As for the afternoon\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meagre data offerings, just like its non-farm cousin last Friday, the latest JOLTS job openings reading came in below estimates, at 5.88 million compared to the downward revised 5.92 million seen the month previous. The FTSE rose a half a percent throughout the day, fuelled by the Morrisons-led gains in the supermarket sector, sterling\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 0.4% and 0.1% declines against the dollar and euro respectively, and a healthy set of commodity stocks. This once again leaves the UK index around the 7720 to 7730 mark, tantalisingly close to another record high \u00e2\u20ac\u201c hopefully Sainsbury\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Christmas update tomorrow will help the FTSE maintain the momentum it seems to have found today. Over in the Eurozone the DAX and CAC varied in their enthusiasm. The former nudged just 0.1% higher despite a far better than forecast German industrial production figure; the latter, meanwhile, found itself trading at a 2 month peak after jumping half a percent. Bitcoin is on the slide despite the earlier comments from JP Morgan chief executive Jamie Dimon that he regrets calling the cryptocurrency a fraud last September. Bitcoin is currently down nearly 2% at $14,708. On Monday two US companies withdrew proposals to launch bitcoin exchange-traded funds, citing concerns by the Securities and Exchange Commission. If the FTSE 100 is not quite there, US markets have opened at new high. Bolstered by hopes of strong economic growth, the Trump tax reforms and the expectation of a positive reporting season which starts this week, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has climbed 0.26% to 25,345. The S&amp;P 500 opened up 0.13% at a record 2751 while the Nasdaq Composite is 0.24% better at a new peak of 7174. Oil prices continue to move higher, shrugging off reports that Iran\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s oil minister had said that Opec did not want to see crude much above $60 a barrel. At the moment, Brent crude is up 0.43% at $68.07 a barrel while West Texas Intermediate is up 0.68% at $62.15. But the rally in oil prices to their highest level since May 2015 might fizzle out before too long, says Fawad Razaqzada, technical analyst at Forex.com: Overnight saw the price of WTI crude hit its best level since May 2015, before falling back a little. Oil prices have hit the ground running at the start of this year, continuing their recovery from the middle of 2017, as global crude stockpiles fell from record high levels and due to good compliance with the production cuts by OPEC and Russia. Given that the production agreement has been extended to the end of 2018 at OPEC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s last meeting, the market clearly expects crude inventory levels to drop further. But with OPEC set to review the duration of oil output cuts based on fundamentals at its next meeting in June, there is a possibility they could end the agreement sooner than expected. What\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s more, oil prices are now at levels many regard as being high enough for US shale producers to accelerate drilling and production in the coming months. This could discourage OPEC and Russia to maintain their oil supply collusion until the end of the year, as many producers within OPEC itself won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be happy to lose further market share to the US. Thus, there is a risk that the agreement could end prematurely, potentially resulting in another supply war. Leading UK shares are edging to within a hair\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s breadth of a new intra-day peak, with the FTSE 100 up 0.47% at 7733.12. That would beat the record of 7733.39 set as long ago as .... yesterday. Retailers are leading the way after the better than expected Christmas trading update from Morrison while technology group Micro Focus has recovered some of the ground lost following disappointment with Monday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s half year results. If it stays at this level it will manage a new closing high. The previous level is 7724.22, set last Friday. More retail news: troubled burger chain Byron\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s is reportedly planning to shut stores in a bid to cut its rental bill and keep operating. Sky News\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Mark Kleinman reports: Sky News has learnt that the company will launch a so-called company voluntary arrangement (CVA) on Wednesday that will require the approval of creditors including landlords. The CVA is critical to Byron\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s future because a new injection of cash into the business, agreed last month, will only take place if the restructuring of its property interests is voted through. Sources close to the deal, which is being handled by KPMG, said the proposals were likely to involve the closure of around 15 poorly performing restaurants and a reduction of rental payments at approximately 20 others. CVA\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s are a popular way for struggling companies to ditch their worst-performing outlets and trim costs, making them financially viable. But if Byron\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s landlords reject the plan, the burger vendor could soon be out of the grill and into the fire.... Aid and development charity Oxfam has also had a good Christmas - and people in the poorest parts of the world should benefit My colleague Angela Monaghan explains: Oxfam proved a Christmas hit with UK shoppers as vintage designer party clothing and first-edition books helped drive a sharp rise in online sales over the festive season. The charity said Burberry, Barbour, Gucci, Whistles and Boden were among the most popular clothing brands searched for on its online shop, where sales jumped by a third in the eight weeks to 23 December. Cameras, blankets and throws were also sought-after items. Oxfam\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s total sales over the period were \u00c2\u00a316.9m, up 1.2% on the same period in 2016. The charity said the extra money raised was enough to provide clean, safe water for almost 200,000 people in an emergency. More here: JP Morgan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s CEO, Jamie Dimon, seems to have eaten some bitcoin humble pie. Dimon has told Fox News that he \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcregretted\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 labelling bitcoin as a fraud last September - a comment that enraged (or amused) cyber-currency supporters. But while he acknowledges that the blockchain that underpins bitcoin has real uses, he insists he still isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t very interested in the whole issue of digital currencies. As Dimon put it: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The blockchain is real. You can have crypto yen and dollars and stuff like that. ICO\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s [initial coin offerings - or new digital coins] you have to look at individually. The bitcoin to me was always what the governments are gonna feel about bitcoin as it gets really big, and I just have a different opinion than other people. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m not interested that much in the subject at all.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Dimon also backed Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new tax reforms -- arguing that the president was right to almost halve US corporation tax to 21%. The old 40% tax rate was a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153huge disadvantage\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to America, Dimon argued, driving capital and skilled labour overseas. In the long run, the cut will help firms to grow their businesses and invest in research and development, Dimon insists. Critics of the tax reforms, though, argue that they will mainly benefit high-earners, and end up costing middle-class Americans in the long term. And here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a reminder of how bitcoin shrugged off Dimon\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s warning: Technology site The Register has a good scoop -- apparently Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s City watchdog has (perhaps accidentally) banned workers across the financial services industry from using their own phones and computers for work. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s all to do with the new MIFID II directive; designed to prevent market abuse which came into force this week. The FCA seems to have enforced the new rules with excessive zeal. The Reg\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Gareth Corfield explains: The UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Financial Conduct Authority has quietly transposed an EU rule without including a crucial bit of detail, thus effectively banning BYOD [bring your own device] policies in all financial services organisations across Blighty. The UK version of the rule, which came into force on January 1, prohibits any business regulated by the FCA from letting its employees communicate with each other or the outside world \u00e2\u20ac\u0153on privately owned equipment which the firm is unable to record or copy\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. However, the original version of the rule, contained in the European Union\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Market In Financial Instruments Directive (MIFID II), restricted this only to investment firms \u00e2\u20ac\u201c not applying it to the entire financial sector. The FCA regulates financial services firms ranging in size from behemoths such as Goldman Sachs right down to independent financial advisers who tell ordinary folk where best to put their savings and investments. The body uses powers contained in the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (FSMA) to implement conduct and prudential rules, among these directives received from EU. It then sets out these rules in its handbook. This is how what should have been a BYOD rule affecting only part of the market has been turned into a blanket ruling on BYOD affecting everyone \u00e2\u20ac\u201c right down to self-employed advisers. But before you chuck your phone in the bin, the FCA has since clarified that individuals can bring their own devices to work after all. However, bosses must take all reasonable steps to prevent them using them to send or receive unrecorded messages or calls. Another headache for the IT manager..... Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s government is optimistic about growth prospects in 2018: The decline in eurozone unemployment will please the European Central Bank. ECB president Mario Draghi has often cited falling joblessness as a defence of his stimulus policies, which cut interest rates to record lows and pumped trillions of euros into the economy. Dennis de Jong, managing director at UFX.com, reckons Draghi can feel vindicated, in the face of criticism from some politicians (particularly in Germany). But there could be more challenges ahead.... \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Lower unemployment sets the field for wage growth and ultimately higher inflation, so the euro should be in demand with traders today. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Draghi has successfully navigated the eurozone through a particularly tricky period, and its economic prospects look strong. However, with further political instability brewing in both Spain and Germany, not to mention uncertainty surrounding Brexit, some continue to ask what lies beneath this millpond?\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd This is an significant moment: Unemployment among young people across the eurozone has also fallen, but the job isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t finished yet. The euro-area jobless rate dropped to 18.2% in November, down from 20.5% a year ago. But again, some countries are in much better shape than others: In November 2017, the lowest rates were observed in the Czech Republic (5.0%) and Germany (6.6%), while the highest were recorded in Greece (39.5% in September 2017), Spain (37.9%) and Italy (32.7%). The unemployment rate across the wider European Union has fallen to a nine-year low of 7.3%, down from 7.4%. Over the last 12 months, unemployment in the EU has dropped by 2.133 million people, and by 1.561 million in the euro area. But before anyone gets carried away, there are still 18.116 million men and women unemployed in the EU, including 14.263 million in the eurozone. Newsflash: Unemployment across the eurozone has hit its lowest rate on almost nine years. The euro-area jobless rate fell to 8.7% in November, down from 8.8% in October. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the best reading since January 2009, when the global economy was crashing into recession. But... there are still sharp differences between euro-area members. The lowest unemployment rates were recorded in the Czech Republic (2.5%), and Malta and Germany (both 3.6%). While in Greece, more than one in five people (20.5%) are out of work, followed by Spain with a 16.7% jobless rate. More to follow.... City analysts are welcoming today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s strong German economic data, particularly the 3.4% jump in industrial production in November. Jennifer McKeown of Capital Economics says German seems to be ending 2017 \u00e2\u20ac\u0153with a bang\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. She writes: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153November\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s surge in German industrial production is a welcome confirmation that the economy approached the end of 2017 in very good health and the surveys point to further strength to come. Mark Ostwald of ADM Investor Services agrees, saying: Better than expected German Trade and Production data affirmed what is already well known, i.e. that the German economy is in rude health. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s great to see Majestic Wine and Morrison\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bosses praising their hard-working employees this morning. But a cynic might wonder whether they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re partly motivated by a fear of losing them. Recruitment firms say that UK companies are finding it harder and harder to find skilled staff - putting a real premium on retaining workers. Kevin Green, chief executive of the Recruitment and Employment Confederation, says it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the worst situation in at least a decade. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We have lists where recruiters cite the jobs they are currently finding it hard to fill, in permanent jobs there used to be six or seven areas. Now there are 50 or 60. It goes on and on and on. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It is comprehensive, you would have to say the skill and talent shortages are pervasive across the economy at the moment.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd This tightening labour market is good news for employees, as they should be able to negotiate significant pay rise. Warm words in the Christmas trading updates won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be enough! The Telegraph has the details: Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE 100 is on the brink of a new all-time high. The blue-chip index has gained 33 points to 7,729 points, just 4 point shy of yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s intraday peak. Majestic Wine is also highlighting its staff\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s cheerful nature in the face of customers seeking the perfect Pinot Grigio or Pomerol for the Christmas festivities. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest wine retailer grew its like-for-like sales by 4.1% over the 10-week Christmas period, including a 1.3% rise at its retail outlets. CEO Rowan Gormley says Majestic, which also owns online retailer Naked Wines, is on track to hit City forecasts: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The team performed brilliantly. The fact that we have been able to grow sales and maintain margins shows that our winning formula of fabulous customer service from delightful people and delicious wines at fair prices works even when times are tough. 15 months ago, Majestic Wine hit its shareholders with a profits warning, so Gormley hopefully enjoyed a better Christmas this time around. Christmas can be a stressful time for shoppers and shop-workers alike. So it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s interesting that Morrisons reckons its staff\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s cheery demeanour boosted its sales over the festive period. It says: Customer satisfaction again improved year-on-year \u00e2\u02c6\u2019 we had more tills open, shorter queues, and customers noticed our colleagues\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 friendliness even at the busiest times. The Evening Standard\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Alex Lawson doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t sound convinced: Neil Wilson of ETX Capital is impressed by Morrisons\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 sales growth over Christmas. He suspects that investors who bet against Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fourth-largest supermarket will soon have burned fingers, following this morning\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s financial results. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The market has not really been buying into Morrisons\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 recent run of form, but yet another very impressive trading statement that has beaten expectations comfortably could turn the tide of opinion. Eight straight quarters of sales growth, yet shares were last trading c8% off the highs last February. That may change now and the shorts could face a big squeeze this morning. Short interest is quite high so this share could pop if they throw in the towel and finally buy into David Potts and co\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s strategy, which is clearly paying off. Connor Campbell of SpreadEx says Morrisons has a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153mega\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Christmas: For the 10 weeks to 7th January the smallest of the Big Four supermarkets smashed expectations, posting a 2.8% surge in like-for-like sales (excluding fuel) against the 1.7% rise forecast Breaking down the figures further and Morrisons had plenty to smile about; its Best premium range jumped 25%, suggesting savvy branding on the supermarket\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s behalf, while online sales, which include those made through Amazon Fresh, were up 10%. These figures sent the Northern favourite nearly 4.5% higher to a 3 month peak, and set a high bar to clear for Sainsbury\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s, Tesco and Marks &amp; Spencer, all of whom report this week. Supermarket chain Morrisons has smashed City forecasts for the crucial Christmas period, sending its shares jumping. Morrisons grew its like-for-like sales by 2.8% over the last 10 weeks, beating expectations of 1.7% growth. The Christmas and New Year period was particularly strong, with sales surging by 3.7% CEO David Potts says his turnaround plan is bearing fruits: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153More and more customers found more things they wanted to buy at competitive prices at Morrisons this Christmas. The hard work and friendliness of our colleagues continues to be key in delivering our strengthening performance, and I would like to thank them for everything they do for our customers.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Shares have jumped by 4% in early trading, as Morrison\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s cements its place as a Christmas winner. More reaction to follow.... European stock markets have opened higher, with the jump in German industrial production cheering traders. Naeem Aslam of Think Markets says: European markets are trading higher as investors have reacted to positive German industrial data. The number was simply astonishing, and it printed the reading of 3.4% when the market was expecting a number of 1.8%. But Maxime Sbaihi of Bloomberg is a little more cautious: Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s factory sector has staged a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153strong comeback\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, says analyst Carsten Brzeski of ING. He points out that these industrial production figures have been volatile - but the trend is positive, suggesting Germany isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t being held back by pick-up in the euro exchange rate. Brzeski writes: German industry has gone through a small rollercoaster ride since the start of the summer. Disappointing numbers were followed by impressive rebounds. Behind the vacation and weather driven white noise of monthly data, however, there is a clear upward trend. Up to now, 2017 industrial production has had its best year since 2011. Contrary to earlier cycles, industrial production has been a lagging, rather than a leading indicator for the German recovery. The strengthening of the euro exchange rate since April 2017 has left the German export sector unharmed. The geographic diversity of German exports once again seems to be the key to success. Particularly, Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s close and distant neighbours in the East have safeguarded this year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s export revival. Germany currently exports as much to Hungary, Poland and the Czech Republic as it does to the Netherlands, Belgium and Luxembourg. Exports to China have also rebounded this year. At the same time, the US remains the single most important export destination, while exports to the UK are becoming less important. More here: We also have new German trade figures - and they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re also stronger than expected. German companies grew their exports by a sparkling 4.1% in November, well ahead of forecast of a 1.2% gain. Imports also rose too, by 2.3%, ahead of forecasts of a 0.8% rise. The seasonally adjusted data suggests that German manufacturers and service companies benefitted from the growing global economy, and that domestic demand was also solid. Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s foreign trade balance swelled to a surplus of \u00e2\u201a\u00ac23.7bn in November 2017, up from \u00e2\u201a\u00ac22.0bn a year earlier. It ran a surplus with its fellow EU members, and with the rest of the world. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the details: In November 2017, Germany exported goods to the value of \u00e2\u201a\u00ac67.9bn to the Member States of the European Union (up 8%), while it imported goods to the value of \u00e2\u201a\u00ac62.1bn from those countries (up 9.5%) Exports of goods to countries outside the European Union (third countries) amounted to \u00e2\u201a\u00ac48.5bn in November 2017 (up 8.4%), while imports from those countries totalled \u00e2\u201a\u00ac30.7bn euros (up 5.9%). On an annual basis, German industrial output growth hit a six-year high. Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy has smashed forecasts this morning, with a big jump in factory output. German industrial production rose by 3.4% in November, new figures from statistics body Destatis show. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the biggest monthly rise since September 2009, suggesting Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest economy picked up pace late last year. Factories reported a surge in demand for heavy-duty machinery, vehicles and other equipment (capital goods), with consumer products also in demand. Destatis explains: Within industry, the production of capital goods increased by 5.7% and the production of consumer goods by 3.6%. The production of intermediate goods showed an increase by 3.0%. Energy production was down by 3.1% in November 2017 and the production in construction increased by 1.5%. Oliver Rakau of Oxford Economics is impressed: Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Today, we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll find out if supermarket chain Morrisons, drinks business Majestic Wine and floorings business Topps Tiles were festive winners and losers, as they report their Christmas trading figures. Housebuilder Persimmon is also updating the City. New eurozone jobless figures are due this morning, which may show that unemployment in Europe has hit a new eight-year low of 8.7%. Otherwise there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not much on the economic calendar. Stock markets remain at record levels again this morning, as the global rally in shares continues. City investors will also be digesting yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s cabinet reshuffle, which frankly looks like a mess after health secretary Jeremy Hunt dug his heels in and refused to move, and education secretary Justine Greening quit rather than take a new role. It wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t exactly an exhibition of prime ministerial authority from Theresa May, says Robin Bew of the Economist Intelligence Unit.

The Microsoft founder might also have been worth more than Bezos today if he hadn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t given away almost $36bn through the charitable foundation he runs with his wife, Melinda. Measured against the total wealth in the US at the time the dotcom bubble burst Gates was much richer than Bezos. According to Credit Suisse, total wealth in the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest economy has more than doubled to $93.5tn since the year 2000. Billionaires have been getting richer in recent years, at a time of growing concerns over inequality in developed nations. The world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s super-rich have been estimated to now own the greatest concentration of wealth since the US Gilded Age at the turn of the 20th century, when industrialists such as Rockefeller and Carnegie grew rich beyond imagination. That period came to an end with the Wall Street crash of 1929 and the subsequent Great Depression. The world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 500 richest people increased their wealth by $1tn last year, buoyed by huge increases in the value of global shares. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk, or sign up to the daily Business Today email here.",

                "bodyText":"It is China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s web giant and has a string of high-profile investments spanning Snapchat, Spotify, Tesla and Hollywood film and TV. It is a sprawling corporate giant that has recently overtaken Facebook to become the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fifth most valuable listed company \u00e2\u20ac\u201c but few, in the west at least, will have heard of Tencent, even though it is worth half a trillion dollars and rising. China is the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s most populous digital market and the protection afforded by state censorship through the so-called great firewall \u00e2\u20ac\u201c which has meant no competition from Facebook, Google, Twitter and Netflix \u00e2\u20ac\u201c has helped Tencent flourish since it launched nearly two decades ago in Shenzhen. But in the last year the shares have been supercharged \u00e2\u20ac\u201c climbing from less than HK$200 (\u00c2\u00a318) at the beginning of 2017 to HK$442 now \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and the value of the company has soared. There are three cornerstones of Tencent\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s business \u00e2\u20ac\u201c its messaging app WeChat; the biggest mobile gaming franchises in the world; and an ecosystem built around its 1 billion users that apes many of the services offered by the Silicon Valley firms that do not operate in China. The company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Netflix-style Tencent Video service \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the biggest in China with exclusive content including NFL games and HBO series such as Game of Thrones \u00e2\u20ac\u201c more than doubled in size in the last year, attracting more than 40 million paying subscribers. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153They have a relationship of mutual benefit with the Chinese state,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd says Jamie McEwan, an analyst at Enders. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153They have been allowed to grow and massively diversify their businesses without the level of scrutiny or competition you might see in western countries.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Late last year, Tencent became the first Chinese firm to pass the $500bn stock market valuation mark, supplanting Facebook as the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fifth biggest firm, a bittersweet moment for company co-founder Ma Huateng, 46, also known as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Pony\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Ma. In 2014, Tencent had been on the brink of buying What\u00e2\u20ac\u2122sApp, which would have made it a global power player overnight. The company was close to a deal when talks had to be delayed so that Ma could undergo back surgery. A panicked Mark Zuckerberg got wind of the move and swooped, tabling an enormous $19bn rival bid \u00e2\u20ac\u201c by far Facebook\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest deal and more than twice the offer made by Tencent \u00e2\u20ac\u201c to see off the threat. Thwarted but undeterred, late last year Ma took a 12% holding in Snapchat (he had made a small investment in 2013) in a busy year that also included buying 5% of Elon Musk\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s electric car firm Tesla and swapping minority stakes in its music streaming business with Spotify. Tencent Music, which dwarfs efforts by Apple and Spotify in China, is expected to make a $10bn stock market listing this year. Tencent also cranked up its domination of mobile gaming, handing over $8.6bn for the Finnish company Supercell, maker of two of the biggest games in the world, Clash of Clans and Clash Royale. It also owns the Los Angeles game-maker Riot, behind the huge League of Legends franchise, and has stakes in Gears of War maker Epic and Activision Blizzard, home to Call of Duty, World of Warcraft and Candy Crush Saga. Tencent also owns the most profitable game in the world, Honour of Kings, which makes about $1bn a quarter and has 200 million monthly players. It has proved so addictive in games-mad China that the government warned Tencent in an article in the state-owned People\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Daily last year saying it was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153poison\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153drug\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd that harms kids. The risk of a government crackdown on one (or more) of Tencent\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s golden geese \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the company relies on gaming for more than 40% of total revenues \u00e2\u20ac\u201c spurred jittery investors to wipe almost $18bn off its stock market value. Tencent swiftly introduced one-hour time limits for under-12s and two hours for 12- to 18-year-olds. Analysts estimate that Tencent digital services are used by more than two-thirds of the Chinese population. Chinese users collectively spend 1.7bn hours a day on the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s apps. The business started in cramped Shenzhen offices in the late 1990s, swiftly developing a bad reputation for cloning digital products for the Chinese market, but it was the launch of WeChat in 2011 that supercharged the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s strategy. The WeChat eco-system is so broad it is almost like rolling most of the apps on a typical western user\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s mobile phone into one. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It is compared to What\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s App or Facebook messenger but it is not really,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd says Xiaofeng Wang, a Singapore-based analyst with Forrester. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It has payment systems, smart city offerings such as the ability to schedule appointments at a bank, a doctor, pay traffic fines or make visa applications and e-commerce.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Tencent\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ambition to be an essential part of digital daily life means it holds a dizzyingly diverse range of interests including in Didi, China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s answer to Uber, the nation\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s second biggest e-tailer JD.com and Hike, a messaging service popular in India. In December, it even did an Amazon, which has gone real-world buying retailer Whole Foods, taking a stake in one of China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest supermarket chains, Yonghui Superstores. It also has a stake in Hollywood film distributor STX Entertainment, behind movies such as Bad Moms and All The Money in the World, while movie arm Tencent Pictures was a backer of blockbuster Kong: Skull Island. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The ultimate goal of all their investments is to enhance the services they have already developed, to support the eco-system,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd says Ruomeng Wang, senior analyst at IHS Markit. The protected market conditions that have allowed Tencent to flourish, and the vast differences between Chinese and foreign internet users\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 web habits, has seen the company struggle abroad. Seven years after launching WeChat it is yet to break into any other market, although it has earmarked Malaysia. Analysts believe a key focus will be on targeting the huge numbers of Chinese diaspora and tourists by making WeChat features like payment available overseas, rather than try and make the app a fully-fledged Facebook rival. The payment system is already available in places like Harrods and Selfridges. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153WeChat and Tencent tried aggressively expanding into international markets like South America, Europe and even the US but it didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t work out so well in mainstream western markets where existing players like What\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s App are so established,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd says Forrester\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Wang. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Their global expansion will in some places target Chinese travellers, with different strategies in emerging markets like South East Asia.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Tencent facts It is ironic that a company worth over $500bn happens to be called Tencent, which translates into English as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153soaring information\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd.

Company sales reports are coming in and so far they indicate the holiday season was a big success. At the same time evidence is emerging that the radical reordering of the retail landscape is hitting women hard, and there may be worse to come. </p> <p>The retail sector has been the biggest loser of jobs for the last two years in a row in the US, as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/mar/26/us-retail-stores-market-macys-sears\">thousands of stores closed</a> as shoppers moved online. It remains one of the US\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest employers, providing 15.8m jobs, but the reordering of the retail landscape is having a profound impact on the nature of its workforce.</p> <p>Between November 2016 and November 2017, the sector fired 129,000 women (the largest loss for any industrial sector for either sex) while men gained 109,000 positions, according to an analysis by the Institute for Women\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Policy Research (IWPR). In the whole labour force women gained 985,000 jobs over the year, while men gained 1.08m jobs.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/aug/16/retail-industry-cashier-jobs-technology-unemployment\">End of the checkout line: the looming crisis for American cashiers</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Retail remains a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153hugely important\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd employer for women, said Heidi Hartmann, IWPR president, especially as a provider of part-time jobs for women who are looking to balance work with family obligations. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Women are very dependent on the nearby shopping center and retail outlets especially as they get back into the work market.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd But the shift in how Americans shop \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and in what they are buying \u00e2\u20ac\u201c is having a profound effect.</p> <p>Major retailers shut shops across the US last year. A record 6,700 stores shut in 2017, according to Fung Global Retail &amp; Technology, a retail thinktank. Macy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s alone closed 68 stores and shed 10,000 jobs. Drugstore chain Walgreens closed 600 locations.</p> <p>New jobs are being created in shipping, handling, back office and warehousing but traditional retail is being hollowed out with the loss of checkout and sales assistant jobs. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153There are still jobs being created in retail but they are jobs with different skill sets,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Andrew Challenger, vice-president of outplacement experts Challenger, Gray and Christmas. But despite those gains \u00e2\u20ac\u0153there is real job loss going on and we may not see those jobs coming back. In many cases these jobs are being lost in places where retailers are the largest employers in the area.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd</p> <p>Challenger described the losses as one of the most dramatic changes in the jobs market the US had witnessed since manufacturing was rocked by outsourcing and automation.<br></p> <p>Hartmann said there were some similarities with the hollowing out of manufacturing. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Women lost jobs in manufacturing first. They had the easiest jobs to ship abroad \u00e2\u20ac\u201c clothing, textiles \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and the men had the jobs that did eventually get shipped abroad but were more difficult to move, like cars, with big transportation costs.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"3855b07b391a602c9f3d3ad0fe7ffb9708b67ae7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3855b07b391a602c9f3d3ad0fe7ffb9708b67ae7/0_0_4930_3287/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Job losses in the retail sector have been compared to the hollowing out of manufacturing due to outsourcing and automation.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Job losses in the retail sector have been compared to the hollowing out of manufacturing due to outsourcing and automation.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Daniel Leal-Olivas/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>She pointed out that women are still the majority recipients of the trade assistance adjustment act \u00e2\u20ac\u201c benefits that are given to US workers for retraining if they lose their employment because of international trade.</p> <p>But she said other factors were also at play. The recovery of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153consumer durable\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd sales \u00e2\u20ac\u201c which are sales of big ticket items such as cars and home appliances \u00e2\u20ac\u201c have bounced back and men hold more of the retail jobs in those sectors. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153When you have a long, slow recovery most people have put off renewing their washing machine, their fridge, their car and now they are feeling that they can start those purchases again. And it seems like they want to see those goods at the store. And those stores offer services, taking away old appliances, installing the new one. Less of those orders are being done online. And there have always been more men in those sectors,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd she said.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/dec/31/the-year-of-the-disruptors-bitcoin-tesla-and-the-slow-demise-of-cash\">Year of the disruptors: bitcoin, Tesla and the slow demise of cash</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The Amazon effect too is hurting women more than men.

                "bodyText":"It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s beginning to look a lot like Christmas for US retailers, but not if you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re a woman working for one. Company sales reports are coming in and so far they indicate the holiday season was a big success. At the same time evidence is emerging that the radical reordering of the retail landscape is hitting women hard, and there may be worse to come. The retail sector has been the biggest loser of jobs for the last two years in a row in the US, as thousands of stores closed as shoppers moved online. It remains one of the US\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest employers, providing 15.8m jobs, but the reordering of the retail landscape is having a profound impact on the nature of its workforce. Between November 2016 and November 2017, the sector fired 129,000 women (the largest loss for any industrial sector for either sex) while men gained 109,000 positions, according to an analysis by the Institute for Women\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Policy Research (IWPR). In the whole labour force women gained 985,000 jobs over the year, while men gained 1.08m jobs. Retail remains a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153hugely important\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd employer for women, said Heidi Hartmann, IWPR president, especially as a provider of part-time jobs for women who are looking to balance work with family obligations. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Women are very dependent on the nearby shopping center and retail outlets especially as they get back into the work market.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd But the shift in how Americans shop \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and in what they are buying \u00e2\u20ac\u201c is having a profound effect. Major retailers shut shops across the US last year. A record 6,700 stores shut in 2017, according to Fung Global Retail &amp; Technology, a retail thinktank. Macy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s alone closed 68 stores and shed 10,000 jobs. Drugstore chain Walgreens closed 600 locations. New jobs are being created in shipping, handling, back office and warehousing but traditional retail is being hollowed out with the loss of checkout and sales assistant jobs. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153There are still jobs being created in retail but they are jobs with different skill sets,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Andrew Challenger, vice-president of outplacement experts Challenger, Gray and Christmas. But despite those gains \u00e2\u20ac\u0153there is real job loss going on and we may not see those jobs coming back. In many cases these jobs are being lost in places where retailers are the largest employers in the area.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Challenger described the losses as one of the most dramatic changes in the jobs market the US had witnessed since manufacturing was rocked by outsourcing and automation. Hartmann said there were some similarities with the hollowing out of manufacturing. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Women lost jobs in manufacturing first. They had the easiest jobs to ship abroad \u00e2\u20ac\u201c clothing, textiles \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and the men had the jobs that did eventually get shipped abroad but were more difficult to move, like cars, with big transportation costs.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd She pointed out that women are still the majority recipients of the trade assistance adjustment act \u00e2\u20ac\u201c benefits that are given to US workers for retraining if they lose their employment because of international trade. But she said other factors were also at play. The recovery of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153consumer durable\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd sales \u00e2\u20ac\u201c which are sales of big ticket items such as cars and home appliances \u00e2\u20ac\u201c have bounced back and men hold more of the retail jobs in those sectors. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153When you have a long, slow recovery most people have put off renewing their washing machine, their fridge, their car and now they are feeling that they can start those purchases again. And it seems like they want to see those goods at the store. And those stores offer services, taking away old appliances, installing the new one. Less of those orders are being done online. And there have always been more men in those sectors,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd she said. The Amazon effect too is hurting women more than men. Alongside store closures in non-durable goods \u00e2\u20ac\u201c food and clothing for example \u00e2\u20ac\u201c retailers are experimenting with ways to remove checkout positions, jobs where women dominate. The numbers now are \u00e2\u20ac\u0153noisy\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd; the new shape of retail is still in flux and positions created by online retailing are not always categorized as retail in the government jobs figures. But the trend so far looks worrying for women. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a stunning thing to show women have lost more than 100,000 jobs over the year and men have gained almost as many. It does look like coal in the stocking for Christmas for many women workers,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Hartmann. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk, or sign up to the daily Business Today email here.",

The US currency has been under pressure on worries that the Trump tax cuts would increase the already hefty US national debt. And the dollar has become less attractive as other central banks begin edging up interest rates and gradually removing their long standing stimulus programmes.</p> <p>And despite a resolution to the government shutdown, the problem has only been postponed until early next month. Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at IG, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Renewed dollar weakness is the revival of yet another familiar friend from 2017. Post-shutdown euphoria has been replaced by a weary acceptance that we will probably have to do this all over again in just over two weeks.

Uncertainty about possible Eurozone reform, Italian elections and the success of the German coalition negotiations clearly take a backseat to improved economic factors.</p> <p>Over the past few months, consumer confidence improved most notably because of a much more positive view on the general economic situation, modest improvements in assessments of the financial situation and increased amounts of current and expected major purchases. This indicates that optimism and stronger consumption are going hand in hand, spurring the household consumption component of GDP growth.

                "bodyText":"Time for a quick recap of the main events from the first day of Davos: Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau has challenged business leaders and politicians to end gender inequality and tackle unacceptable and systemic sexual harassment. You can watch a clip here. Trudeau also announced that the ten members of the trans-pacific partnership have agreed to extend their agreement. Oxfam\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Winnie Byanyima has also hailed campaigners against sexual harrassment, saying they have helped people worldwide. Davos also heard that parents need to teach their sons not to hit women, rather than simply how to hit baseballs. India\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Narendra Modi has warned that globalisation is under threat, and also cited climate change and terrorism as key threats to the global economy. The mood at Davos has been optimistic, although bank bosses have warned against complacency. An MIT economics professor has predicted that Facebook will barely exist in 20 years. Australian actor Cate Blanchett has criticised politicians for pandering to anti-refugee sentiment, instead of helping the millions of people displaced worldwide. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s probably all for tonight. Thanks for reading and commenting. GW A positive start following news that the US government shutdown had been resolved, for the moment at least, soon faded, leaving European markets a mixed bag by the close. Sterling rose above $1.40 to a new post-Brexit vote high, partly due to hopes that a successful trade deal can be negotiated, but also thanks to continuing weakness in the dollar. The US currency has been under pressure on worries that the Trump tax cuts would increase the already hefty US national debt. And the dollar has become less attractive as other central banks begin edging up interest rates and gradually removing their long standing stimulus programmes. And despite a resolution to the government shutdown, the problem has only been postponed until early next month. Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at IG, said: Renewed dollar weakness is the revival of yet another familiar friend from 2017. Post-shutdown euphoria has been replaced by a weary acceptance that we will probably have to do this all over again in just over two weeks. Why buy the greenback, when so many other economies can show solid growth without the government disruption so prevalent in the US at the moment? So with the stronger pound, the FTSE 100 came off its best levels. But Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax hovered around record levels, following upbeat consumer confidence figures and signs that a coalition government could be moving closer. In the US, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fluctuated between positive and negative, but Nasdaq was lifted by the positive Netflix update. The final scores in Europe showed: The FTSE 100 finished up 16.39 points or 0.21% at 7731.83 Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax rose 0.71% to 13,559.60 France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac closed down 0.12% at 5535.26 Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB fell 0.22% to 23,836.60 Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ibex ended up 0.24% at 10,609.5 In Greece, the Athens market added 1.62% to 872.00 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 28 points or 0.11%. NF Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a video clip of Justin Trudeau laying down the law on sexual harassment: Justin Trudeau\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s speech has caused quite a stir, with its trenchant criticism of greedy, uncaring businesses and gender inequality. Adam Parsons of the BBC thinks it was a punchy speech: John Stackhouse of Royal Bank of Canada says Trudeau is shaking up the idea of what \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcDavos Man\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 acts like: Ian Bremmer says Trudeau showed how gender equality is an important economic issue: But Jamie Drummond of campaigning group One isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t convinced Trudeau will deliver: Justin Trudeau also made an important point about trade. He tells Davos that Canada is trying to convince U.S. President Donald Trump that the NAFTA trade agreement was in the interest of the United States as well as other countries. Trudeau says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re working very hard to make sure that our neighbour to the south recognizes how good NAFTA is and that it has benefited not just our economy but his economy and the world economy,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Justin Trudeau moves onto another vital issue - campaigns such as #MeToo and Time\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Up. The Canadian PM declares: These movements show us we must have a critical discussion on women\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rights, equality and the power dynamics of gender. Sexual harassment in business and in government is a systemic problem and it is unacceptable. As leaders, we must recognise and act to truly show that time is up. Justin Trudeau now urges business chiefs at Davos to help fight inequality by hiring, promoting and retaining more women. Getting more women into the workforce isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t just the right thing to do, or the nice thing to do, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the smart thing to do, he tells the World Economic Forum, Studies show it can provide a significant economic boost. Firms need to address gender pay, and he warns that many firms aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t doing as well as they think. Just paying men and women the same doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t go far enough, unless you also tackle the barriers faced by female workers. Women do more part-time work, and more unpaid work than men. Parental leave and childcare policies must be reexamined, Trudeau tells WEF. Firms should implement policies to improve gender balance. He also reminds us that he introduced Canada\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s first gender-balanced cabinet, and the performance of those female ministers has proved the naysayers wrong. Justin Trudeau has warned that businesses and politicians are failing to help their workers and citizens in today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u0153rapidly changing world\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. People have been taken advantage of, losing their jobs, the Canadian PM warns: Governments and corporations, we haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t done enough to address this. He also blasts corporate greed, saying: Too many corporations have single-mindedly put the pursuit of profit ahead of the well-being of workers. The gap between the rich and the poor is staggering, Trudeau points out, adding All the while, companies avoid taxes and boast record profits with one hand while slashing benefits with the other. Our priority must be the people who are struggling the most, and who will never get to Davos, Trudeau says. And he warns that if we operate on the basis of business as usual, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the system will break down and we will all fail.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau is now speaking to Davos. He begins by thanking the seven all-female co-chairs for organising this year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s WEF. He then makes an important announcement: The 10 remaining members of the Trans-Pacific Partnership have concluded a new agreement that will maintain their alliance. The agreement reached today in Tokyo is the right deal, Trudeau insists. It will create growth, prosperity, and middle class jobs in Canada today and for generations. This is significant, as Donald Trump pulled the US out of the TPP. In an hour\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time, Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau will give a special address to the World Economic Forum. As a liberal, feminist leader, Trudeau is a Davos favourite. But that shouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t mean he gets a free pass. Jamie Drummond, executive director of the development group One, says that Trudeau isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t actually delivering on pledges to make the world a better place. As Drummond puts it: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s so exasperating that prime minister Justin Trudeau will make another great speech today while the facts point in a shocking direction. Smart aid rates under Trudeau are lower than under his conservative predecessor Stephen Harper, the money he loudly promised would be new to fight aids, TB and malaria was in fact not new, and his feminist foreign policy is not backed by new funds. This can and must change now. Not in 2020, or some vague theoretical far-off point after the next election. Drummond urges WEF delegates to put Trudeau under pressure to deliver. This week in Davos he must be asked when and by specifically how much he will increase funding for girls education and women\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economic empowerment; and please, he must do it this year. If we want him be a great leader on these issues, we must withhold praise until we see the quality of his action not just his delightful adverbs. Trust Trudeau - but verify. And if Davos doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t pressure leaders like Trudeau to be the best they can be, or hold them accountable, this gathering is a self-defeating backslapping waste of time the world doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd As we reported this morning, Drummond is threatening not to come back to Davos unless this annual shindig starts delivering the goods. The Greek prime minister Alexis Tsipras is among the world leaders who have lined up to get to Davos, reports Helena Smith from Athens: Tsipras, who arrived only hours after Athens wrapped up a third bailout compliance review \u00e2\u20ac\u201c edging ever closer to ending dependence on international bailout loans when the programme expires this summer - is meeting investors also gathered in Davos. The leftist\u00e2\u20ac\u201cled government, in an about\u00e2\u20ac\u201cturn of its previous antagonism, is now keen to attract foreign capital as it prepares the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s return to capital markets. This afternoon\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meeting is much in the vein of luring investors to fund projects in Greece with an eye to slashing unemployment \u00e2\u20ac\u201c at 21% still the highest in the EU and by far the nation\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest social ill. Monday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s eurogroup meeting saw euro area finance ministers agreeing to disburse \u00e2\u201a\u00ac6.7bn to the debt -stricken nation in two instalments. The first chunk of \u00e2\u201a\u00ac5.7bn will be released in February, once outstanding reforms are implemented, to cover debt servicing needs, arrears and creation of a cash buffer that will support Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s return to markets. Talks on debt relief are expected to begin soon \u00e2\u20ac\u201c along with a fourth compliance review which included 88 creditor-mandates reforms being taken by June. Sounding a note of optimism, EU Financial Affairs Commissioner Pierre Moscovici said the single currency bloc should prepare for \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a successful conclusion, which means Greece being back as a normal member of the eurozone and the final signal \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the end of the Greek crisis.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd After the better than expected German consumer confidence figures, there is more positive news from Europe. Eurozone consumer confidence rose from 0.5 points in December to 1.3 points in January, according to the European Commission. This was well above forecasts of a figure of 0.6. In the wide European Union, confidence jumped 1 point to 0.4 points. ING economist Bert Colijn said: With inflation still low, job growth surprising on the upside, house prices increasing and growth forecasts adjusted upwards, there is a lot to like for consumers and that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s evident. The current mood among consumers is nothing short of ecstatic and current levels of confidence are generally associated with further acceleration in household consumption growth. Uncertainty about possible Eurozone reform, Italian elections and the success of the German coalition negotiations clearly take a backseat to improved economic factors. Over the past few months, consumer confidence improved most notably because of a much more positive view on the general economic situation, modest improvements in assessments of the financial situation and increased amounts of current and expected major purchases. This indicates that optimism and stronger consumption are going hand in hand, spurring the household consumption component of GDP growth. While unemployment expectations have become slightly less favourable over the last months of 2017, this is actually at odds with businesses indicating that hiring expectations remain very high. With such a favourable outlook, it could well be that the record for consumer confidence could be breached a few more times in 2018. This, in turn, confirms the rosy short-term picture for Eurozone growth. NF Dacher Keltner, Professor of Psychology from the University of California, is also on the sexual harassment panel alongside Winnie Byanyima. He says: Men tend to take more risks, they tend to be a lot more aggressive, and they tend to sexualise thing. So if you give a man power, those default tendencies will be expressed. Women tend to be more collaborative, co-operative, empathetic. You give them power, studies show it will amplify those pro-social tendencies. Lisa Sherman, President and Chief Executive Officer of the Advertising Council, says parents can do more to help boys treat women with respect. You teach your son how to hit a baseball, how to hit a jump shot, how to hit the net. But we should really be talking to them about who not to hit, and why. Peggy Johnson, executive Vice-President for Business Development at Microsoft, says the younger generation are helping to force change. She explains that her daughter recently started her career, and told her that \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcwhen there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s an inappropriate joke at work, I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t laugh\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. I thought back and thought, when I was her age I always laughed, says Johnson. My daughter said to me that she\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d learned not to laugh at these jokes from me, but she actually learned it from me in my 50s, not my 20s. Winnie Byanyima, the executive director of Oxfam International, is speaking powerfully about sexual exploitation against women around the globe. All the women in the world should be grateful to American women for taking a stand, and saying \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Me Too\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, Byanyima says, referring to the campaign that spread around the globe after the Harvey Weinstein scandal. It has brought new attention to a problem that is deep. Women in the developing world are at the bottom of the supply chain of big business. Oxfam hears stories of their lives, Byanyima explains, such as hotel housekeepers. All of them told us that they had faced sexual harassment or knew someone who had faced sexual harassment. It goes on with impunity. Domestic workers globally suffer abuse, she continues, and some of them are like slaves in the homes where they work. Only a few countries have ratified a new convention for domestic workers. It is not an accident that women are abused sexually at work or at home. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s due to the social norms that are there to justify their economic exploitation. That is why it is so important to tackle economic inequality, as this will also help tackle violence against women. Byanyima says there are three ways to tackle this problem: Remove all the laws that discriminate against women in the economy Tackle the social norms that justify sexual exploitation. Businesses have an important role to play here - they can use their factories, supply chains, advertising. Unilever are doing it, so others can too. Bring women into every level of decision-making and leadership, so they can drive change. In the wake of the resolution to the US government shutdown, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was initially expected to open higher. But when trading began the Dow dipped 27 points or 0.1%, with investors moving on to worry about the impact of Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s move to impose steep import tariffs, including possible retaliation. South Korea and China both protested at the duties on washing machines and solar panels. The S&amp;P 500 however edged up 0.03% and the Nasdaq composite climbed 0.23%. The uncertainty has taken some of the shine off European shares, with the FTSE 100 now up just 0.11% and France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac virtually unchanged. Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax is now up 0.76%, off its best levels. NF David Autor, Ford Professor of Economics at MIT, has predicted that today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s giant tech companies - such as Facebook - will suffer the face of previous dominant companies. He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s on a panel asking \u00e2\u20ac\u02dccan we live with monopolies\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. Autor explains that we currently live in an environment of \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcwinner takes most\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 markets, where having a small edge over your competitor gives you a massive advantage. So firms like Amazon and Facebook are growing organically (people are on Facebook because their friends are on Facebook), but that doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t mean that this growth is healthy. Or sustainable, in the long run. We did have these monopolies in the past, Autor points out, citing the US railroads, and AT&amp;T which was broken up by regulators. Also, companies which appear indomitable can fade pretty fast, he says - and then makes a bold prediction: I would guess that Facebook will be almost non-existent 20 years from now. Autor is also critical of the US model where employees are not treated as stakeholders (unlike shareholders). This situation has created a level of inequality that has led to political upheaval, he says. Elsewhere in Davos, the head of the Red Cross has warned that fresh humanitarian crises could break out this year. Peter Maurer, president of the International Committee of the Red Cross, says there are a lot of fragile situations that could develop into \u00e2\u20ac\u0153full-fledged\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd conflicts (as we saw with the Rohingya crisis in 2017). Maurer says there are plenty of places on the brink of war, violence and disruption. He cites Southern Philippines (which is under martial law), Myanmar, Afghanistan, the Middle East, and large parts of Africa as places where the Red Cross sees fragility - but \u00e2\u20ac\u0153we don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know which one will blow up in our face\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. So what can Davos do about it? Top business leaders have the skills and resources to help businesses in those fragile areas, and help them tipping into conflict. Maurer also warns that humanitarian organisations need more money: In 2018 we face a big gap between the needs of people and the capacity of the international system as a whole to respond. The gap can only be bridged by more and better finance. Ultimately, Blanchett says, we must remember we are all citizens, and stand up for what we believe in. Cate Blanchett is close to tears, as she talks about one refugee family she met in Jordan. They had fled conflict with five of their children, being shot at by all sides. Eventually, the father had to choose between carrying his suitcases and carrying his children (he chose the children). No-one should be put in that position, she says. Q: Aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t politicians taking a hard line on refugees because they are reacting to the concerns of their populations? Cate Blanchett argues that they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re actually reacting to populist media and the news cycle. We are at a fork in the road, she says. We try to teach our children to be compassionate, to be tolerant, to accept diversity, to share. But all the structures that are around them are not doing the same, so it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s quite a schizophrenic world they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re living in. And taking a swing at populist politicians, she says she don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t understand how turning people in a boat back became an election winner. Australian actor Cate Blanchett is talking about the refugee crisis now (yesterday she was handed a WEF award for her work on this issue). She explains how she went backpacking through Europe in her youth, which opened her eyes to economic inequality. I was staying in youth hostels that were more like Turkish prisons, She explains, seeing people who didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have anywhere else to go Q: There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been a lot of criticism of Australia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s policy to refugees.... Blanchett says she was \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcbewildered\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 to see the generous, openhearted, multi-cultural Australia she grew up in \u00e2\u20ac\u0153flouting the UN humans rights convention\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd I was very distressed that Australia was reverting back to practices that made us a fortress again. This drove Blanchett to become a goodwill ambassador to UNHCR I think it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shameful. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s so much misinformation about refugees. They are forced to flee, and then they are vilified in the media. Blanchett says the misinformation about refugees is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153very distressing\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, and doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t connect with the actual people she has met. There are 65 million displaced people in the world, 22 million are refugees, half are women and children. But just 1% have been resettled in advanced developed economies. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the developing world that is shouldering the deep burden of refugees. She cites the Lebanon, where a quarter of the population are now refugees. Blanchett also criticises the way refugees are reported in the media: People are told this narrative that these people, who have so much to offer, are going to be a burden on us or become a terrorist threat. Q: But have some people in developing economies been encouraged to travel to countries such as Germany, because they hoped to be given asylum? Should we not talk about it, Blanchett replies rhetorically. The problem is not going to go away. These are not terrorists. These are innocent people, who want to return home. She\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also calling for more burden-sharing between countries, to help address the refugee crisis. The problem with all this optimism at Davos is that business leaders, economists and politicians have a nasty habit of missing impending disaster. WEF veterans point out that the mood is often particularly upbeat shortly before a crisis. Barclays CEO Jes Staley summed it up this morning, on the financial crisis session when he said Davos feels \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a little bit like 2006 when we were all talking whether we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve solved the riddle of economic crises.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The Carlyle Group David Rubenstein agreed, saying: Generally, when people are happy and confident, something wrong happens. Back with the UK public finances, and a Treasury spokesperson said: We have made great progress in reducing the deficit by three quarters since 2010, but government debt is still far too high. Our balanced approach to government spending is getting debt falling, while investing in key public services and keeping taxes low. And the Office for Budget Responsibility said: It appears that the underlying improvement in borrowing so far this year is a little faster than would be consistent with our November forecast. NF Christoph Franz, the chairman of Roche, agrees that spirits are high at Davos this year - and with good reason. Speaking to CNBC, Frans argues that \u00e2\u20ac\u02dchealthy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 economic growth is boosting optimism among top execs. Basically, I have been here for more than ten years, I share your perspective, there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a very positive mood right now among business leaders here in Davos, and I think the reason is, we see a growth perspective in, not only some specific countries, but on a global scale, and the growth is achieving numbers which we have seen only before 2007. So, the economy is taking up, and for the time being, it is growth which has been created by a lot of investment. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s manufacturers continue to be optimistic about business prospects and exports, but are increasingly worried about skills shortages. The CBI\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s latest industrial trends survey for the three months to January showed 27% of firms were more optimistic about the general business situation that three months ago, while 14% were less optimistic. The balance of +13% is up from -11% in the previous quarter. Growth in manufacturing output and domestic and export orders all picked up, compared with the previous three-month period, although the monthly order book figure showed a fall from +17 in December to +14 in January. And the number of firms saying a lack of skilled labour was likely to limit output over the next three months was the highest for more than four decades. Rain Newton-Smith, CBI chief economist, said: It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s good to see manufacturing going from strength-to-strength with growth up and the buoyant global economy boosting export orders. But the past depreciation in Sterling continues to leave its mark on firms\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 costs and margins. With expectations for factory gate price inflation at their highest in 30 years, the pressure on consumer prices looks set to persist. Capacity pressures are ramping up and skill shortages are a big concern, underlining the importance of establishing a future immigration system that provides companies with access to talent and labour. The building blocks of a new system that meets economic needs and public concerns must start with scrapping the net migration target, which has never been fit-for-purpose. NF Yup. Modi wraps up his speech by identifying three priorities: The world economy must be more inclusive Policymakers must remain committed to a rules-based world order Reforming the major institutions of the world, connected to politics, the economy and securtry He talks about the Indian soldiers who died in world wars in the 20th century, to help create \u00e2\u20ac\u0153peace and humanity\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. India can be a humanising and harmonising force in an uncertain world, Modi promises, citing Indian prayers and poetry which advocates a free and peaceful world. Together we can create a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcheaven of future\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, he promises, in a somewhat gushing conclusion. Alas, he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not taking any questions. On climate change, Modi says India is making big progress towards hitting its goals for renewable energy. Modi says India will achieve strong growth over the next few years. Kenneth Roth of Human Rights Watch suggests Modi isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t living up to the glowing ideals he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s preaching today: (remember, Modi was once banned from visiting the US following claims he had supported Hindu extremists during Hindu-Muslim riots. He was later cleared by the Indian Supreme Court). Modi is now encouraging businesses to invest in India, citing the hundreds of laws and regulations which have been stripped out to make te economy more competitive. Instead of red tape, we offer you a red carpet, he jokes. Democracy isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t just a political system, says Modi - it is a life view and a lifestyle. He cites India\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s proud democracy and diversity, declaring: For a society with diverse religions, cultures, languages, attires and cuisines, democracy is not just a political system but a way of living: Thirdly, the world is threatened by the rising attacks on globalisation, says Modi. We must accept that globalisation is slowly losing its lustre, he says. And he pits some of the blame on the institutions created after world war 2, such as the United Nations. Do the structures and action plans of these organisations match the aspirations and dreams of mankind, Modi asks rhetorically. Then he takes aim at protectionism, saying: Forces of protectionism are raising their heads against globalisation. They want to reverse its flow. The world risks new tariff and non-tariff barriers, he continues, cautioning that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153bilateral and multilateral trade negotiations have come to a kind of standstill\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. The second major threat is terrorism, Modi continues. He says there is an artificial distinction between \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcgood and bad\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 terrorism, and a worrying radicalism of young people. The world has moved from needs-based to greed-based consumption, says Modi seriously. This does not live up to the ideals of Gandhi, or the teaching of Buddha. Modi cites climate change as a major threat. Glaciers are melting, islands are disappearing under the sea, and in Davos we have the worst snow in 20 years, he says. And he criticises the leaders of advanced economies for not showing more solidarity Everyone talks about reducing climate emissions, but there are very few countries who back their words with their resources to help developing countries to adopt appropriate technology. Very few of them come forward to help. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s some instant reaction to Modi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s call for co-operation to build a better future, rather than descending into isolationism. Narendra Modi now turns to the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153fractures\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in the global economy, citing unemployment, inequality, lack of opportunities. Some important questions come to mind, which require answers, he says. Is our global order widening these fault lines, increasing these differences, and giving preference to isolationism over harmony and conflict over co-operation, he asks, adding: What paths can we follow, to eliminate rifts and differences. How can we realise the dream of a beautiful shared future. Modi is speaking in Hindi, incidentally, so the audience are getting a realtime translation. Today, data is the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest asset, Modi declares. We are accumulating mountains and mountains of data, he continues. There is now a race to control data, because it is believes that whoever is able to control the data can dominate the world. Narendra Modi takes the stage, to another round of applause. He begins with a history lesson. The last time an Indian PM was at Davos was in 1997, when H. D. Deve Gowda visited. Back then, India\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s GDP was $400bn - it is now six times larger. WEF\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s theme in 1997 was \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcbuilding the networked society\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. Today, it is not just a networked society. We are living in the world of big data, artificial intelligence and robots. Back in 1997, Modi continues the eurozone didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t exist, the Asian financial crisis wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t expected, and there was no sign that Brexit might happen. Very few people had heard of Osama Bin Laden, and Harry Potter was also an unknown name. Back then, Google didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t exist, a web search for Amazon would bring up a river or jungle, and tweeting was done by birds, Modi declares. Davos\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s founder, Klaus Schwab, is introducing Narendra Modi now. Globally we are moving to a multipolar, and multi-conceptual world, says Schwab. In a seemingly fractured world, India presents a bright image of optimism, he adds. It also presents an investment opportunity (something that business leaders at Davos will be interested in) There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a buzz on the floor of the World Economic Forum as India\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s prime minister Narendra Modi prepares to give the opening speech. Modi is a big draw - the main hall is filling up fast with delegates keen to hear his words. The speech should be streamed live here: Nariman Behravesh, chief economist at IHS Markit says the mood at Davos is very different this year than in 2017. He tells us: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It is a lot more optimistic and the optimism is broad based. Last year the Americans were upbeat but the Europeans were gloomy. A year ago the feeling was that politics was going to overwhelm economics but the opposite has happened. An improving economy may make populism less compelling\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Behravesh says that Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s arrival in the White House a year ago led to an increase in business confidence. Corporate America was not keen on Barack Obama, he says. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Business finally got a president it thought was business friendly and the reduction in regulation has been received well.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Business also likes the package of tax cuts Trump finally pushed through Congress at the end of 2017 and which are weighted in favour of the well off and corporations. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Our estimate is that the tax cuts will add 0.3 percentage points to growth in 2018, 2019 and 2020\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Behravesh says. There are two risks, he adds. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The US and global economy may be running too hot. We think unemployment in the US will go as low as 3.5%, which is well below estimates of full employment. The question is how soon wage inflation and price inflation picks up. If inflation surprises on the upside we could see the Federal Reserve and other central banks step on the brakes a lot harder. The stock market could take a hit and that would be bad.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The other risk is that Trump starts making good on his protectionist threats. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153So far his bark has been worse then his bite, Behravesh says. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153But I think China is going to come under a lot of pressure from the US this year. The US is very unhappy about the China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s unwillingness to toe the line on intellectual property.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Over in Germany, consumer confidence remains strong. The ZEW institute economic sentiment index came in at 20.4 points in January, up from 17.4 the previous month and better than the forecasts of a reading of 17.8. And this came amid uncertainty over the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s political future and before the weekend\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s agreement to take another step towards a coalition government. The index remains slightly below the long-term average of 23.7 points, but it is still a positive outcome. Meanwhile the current conditions index rose from 89.3 points o 95.2. ZEW president professor Achim Wambach said: The latest survey results reveal an optimistic outlook for the German economy in the first six months of 2018. With 95.2 out of 100 points, this is the most positive assessment of the current economic situation since the introduction of the survey in December 1991. Private consumption, which was the most important driver of economic growth in 2017, is likely to continue to stimulate growth in the coming six months according to the survey participants. The assessment of the global economic environment in Europe and the USA is also much more favourable than it was at the end of 2017. NF Despite the warnings from Davos, investors are pushing markets higher again this morning. There is renewed confidence following the IMF raising its growth forecasts on Monday (albeit not for the UK), as well as relief that the US government shutdown has been resolved, at least for another couple of weeks. Meanwhile there were no surprises from the Bank of Japan, which recently unnerved markets by reducing its monthly bond buying programme by $10bn. This time it left monetary policy unchanged. So the FTSE 100 is up 0.31%, France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac has climbed 0.11% and Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax is 0.86% better and at new highs. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said: It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s taken a while for the DAX to join in with the all-time high hitting performances of the FTSE and the Dow Jones seen in 2018. However, with German coalition talks steadily moving along, a stop-gap deal to end the US government shutdown, and a subsequent pullback from the euro against the dollar, the bourse seems ready to bulge, shooting up by 130 points to tease a 13600 record peak. In the US the Dow Jones Industrial Average, which jumped 142 points or 0.55% after the news of the impasse over the government shutdown had been resolved, is expected to open 84 points higher. Fiona Cincotta at City Index said: The FTSE bounced on the open this morning, following a record session in the US overnight. The Dow surged over 140 points, whilst the S&amp;P and the Nasdaq tagged on 0.8% and 1% respectively, all hitting unchartered territory. The rally took place after the Democrats and the Republicans passed the funding bill to end the US government shut down, 72 hours after it started. NF Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s budget deficit came in much better than expected, giving a boost to chancellor Philip Hammond. Thanks to an unusually large credit from the European Union and the strongest VAT receipts on record, public sector net borrowing fell from \u00c2\u00a38.25bn in November to \u00c2\u00a32.6bn last month. This was well below analyst forecasts of a figure of around \u00c2\u00a35bn. There was a \u00c2\u00a31.2bn credit from the EU related to the region\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s smaller than expected overall budget and improved economic performance. With the UK economy holding up despite Brexit vote fears, VAT receipts rose by an annual 4.8% to a record \u00c2\u00a312.3bn. Total public borrowing since last April is now \u00c2\u00a350bn, 12% less than in the same period in 2016 and leaving Hammond on track to meet his full year target of \u00c2\u00a349.9bn by the end of March. NF More highlights from the Davos talk about financial risks: Anne Richards, chief executive of M&amp;G Investments, fears that a devastating IT crash could cause the next financial crisis. She tells an audience in Davos that policymakers risk ignoring the threat posed by investors\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 reliance on technology, and the damage that could be caused if key systems go down. Richards says she doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t buy the argument that a geopolitical crisis will bring the bull market crashing down. After all, markets handle geopolitical events all the time. Instead, she fears that the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153systemic risk\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd posed by new technology, and the cloud, could provoke an event that changes the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153animal spirits\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in the markets today. Richards warns: We all have businesses that are absolutely reliant on a very small number of people who provide the pipes that we put our business though. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a technology thing out there that we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re all somewhat blind to. It would be interesting to think how markets would react if none of us could trade for one, or two or three days\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd David Rubenstein, co-executive chairman of The Carlyle Group, is also on the panel. He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s more worried about political threats - predicting that if there is a geopolitical crisis, markets will be hurt and firms will pull back from capital investment. This year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s World Economic Forum is being led by an all-female group of co-chairs. They\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re giving a press conference now: Erna Solberg, prime minister of Norway, is speaking now - calling for a new crackdown on illegal finance and corruption. Solberg says this is fuelling terrorism and security threats, and making it harder for emerging economies to develop their economies. She suggests a MeToo campaign to fight corruption is needed: We need to see who is taking money, who is bribing others, and show that this is unacceptable in all our societies. Solberg\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s other priority is gender equality -- she warns that women are still treated unfairly in many economies. The barriers to women\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s participation [in the labour market] is still large in many societies - it doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t make sense economically or politically. Can Emmanuel Macron really succeed where his predecessors failed, and reform the French economy? Tidjane Thiam, the boss of Credit Suisse, says the answer is a resounding yes. Speaking on a panel about \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcglobal markets in a fractured world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, Thaim says Macron\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s programme of labour market reforms would have led to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153certain electoral defeat\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd 20 years ago - not last year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s triumph against Marine Le Pen. As Thiam puts it: Macron only got elected because the French public, the French nation, decided to change. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s how it works in a democracy. Political scientist Ian Bremmer agrees that market sentiment and political reality have got out of whack.... The usual high security measures are in place in Davos this morning. Armed guards prevent any non-delegates getting into WEF; even if you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re accredited, you have to negotiate airport-style security before you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re actually allowed in. The snowdrifts have also provided a new reason to ban protests in Davos this week. Davos officials say \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the extremely tight space situation due to the enormous amount of new snow\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t leave any space for a rally.... UBS\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chairman, Axel Weber, has warned that sentiment in the market is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153too buoyant\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Speaking on CNBC this morning, Weber said there was a worrying gap between investor optimism and the actual state of the economy. Investors are taking risks, but I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re getting adequate compensation for those risks. At some time, if it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s got to stop it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s got to stop. He added that the markets could be in a more difficult position by the time of Davos 2019.... Justin Trudeau says he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be batting for middle-class Canadians in Davos this week. His speech this afternoon is also expected to cover corporate responsibility and the role of women in a changing world. Davos regular Jamie Drummond says he may not come back, unless this year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meeting makes real progress towards tackling inequality. Drummond is the executive director of the development group One, which he co-founded with the rock star Bono. In a blog, Drummond said he had been stung by the accusation that he had spent so long hobnobbing with the 1% that he was becoming a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Davos man.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u0153A feminist activist, and someone I deeply respect, recently commented that I was at risk of becoming that awful thing: \u00e2\u20ac\u02dca Davos Man\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. Definitions vary but this phrase generally refers to a male who goes to places like Davos and inhabits an elite, unaccountable bubble while determining the fates of those without access to it. The comment cut deep. It forced me to question any complicity I might have in a system I have tried so hard to change. So I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m putting my inner Davos Man on notice, and making this commitment: this will be my last World Economic Forum unless this one helps deliver on three crucial areas in the fight against extreme poverty and gender inequality. Those areas are the global education emergency; women\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economic empowerment; and ambitious financing to back Africa\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s huge youth boom.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Philip Jennings, head of the global union UNI, has been one of the strongest voices for labour at Davos for many a year but 2018 will be his last meeting before retiring in the summer. Speaking to the Guardian, Jennings said the current business model built on the principle of shareholder value was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153not fit for purpose\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and that the opportunity provided by the financial crisis of a decade ago to build a more inclusive economy has been squandered. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Donald Trump is Mr Shareholder value\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, Jennings said, adding: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153He is exhibit A of the fractured world\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Jennings said a test for the business leaders in Davos talking about the problems of global inequality was whether they recognised trade unions and collective bargaining at their firms. And he predicted a backlash against three of the new titans of the global economy: Amazon, Facebook and Google. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153These companies were once seen as angelic, seen as our saviours\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, Jennings said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153But the big three has such market influence and power that the world has to wake up and start thinking about the need for anti-trust action. One of the fractures in the global economy is the power of the new monopolies and the danger it represents\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. The huge snowfalls in Davos recently mean the ski resort is now facing a Level 5 avalanche risk - the highest rating. Some homes have reportedly been evacuated, due to fears that the snow is too unstable. There has already been big delays getting up the mountain (someone I met last night spent six hours crawling here from Zurich), leading to plenty of chuntering among delegates. Davos has had an early wake-up call. PR chief Richard Edelman\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s annual trust index shows that Americans have become much less trusting of politicians, business chiefs and the media over the last year. He says: No country saw steeper declines than the United States, with a 37-point aggregate drop in trust across all institutions. At the opposite end of the spectrum, China experienced a 27-point gain, more than any other country. The survey shows that people are more worried about the rise of disinformation -- and finding it hard to separate truth from \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcfake news\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 So, genuine voices of expertise are now regaining credibility. Edelman explains: Journalists have risen 12 points, and CEOs recorded a seven-percentage point gain, since 2017. Good morning from Davos! World leaders, business chiefs, trade unions, the heads of charities and NGOs, celebrities and the media are gathering in this small ski resort to discuss the state of the world, and how to improve it. This year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s WEF is taking place amid the biggest snowfalls in many years. This is already leading to inequality on the streets of Davos: workers are furiously shovelling drifts aside and driving snowploughs as the global elite queue bumper-to-bumper to reach the WEF congress centre and the exclusive hotels and converted shops where events are taking place. Last night, Pope Francis set the mood by issuing a stern warning not to remain silent in the face of economic inequality and injustice. In a message read to the Davos attendees, the Pope warned not to allow people to be used as cogs in a machine and then chucked aside. He declared: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153New actors are emerging, as well as new economic competition and regional trade agreements. Even the most recent technologies are transforming economic models and the globalized world itself, which, conditioned by private interests and an ambition for profit at all costs, seem to favour further fragmentation and individualism, rather than to facilitate approaches that are more inclusive,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Even Sir Elton John weighed in, describing inequality in the world today as \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcdisgraceful\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 (as we covered in last night\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s blog). Two world leaders will address Davos today, with different priorities. Narendra Modi, who gives the opening speech, is the first Indian prime minister to visit WEF in 20 years. He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s on a big push to attract more business to his country, billing India as a key growth engine for the global economy. India have sent a large delegation to Davos this year - many of whom found themselves caught up in the transport chaos yesterday. Canada\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Justin Trudeau is expected to pitch at business leaders. But his speech, this afternoon, may also cover weightier issues such as women\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s empowerment. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s loads of other stuff coming up too, including debates on the financial markets, capitalism, and sexual harassment. The agenda: 9.30am Davos (8.30am GMT): Opening press conference by the Davos co-chairs 9.45am Davos (8.45am GMT): Debate: Are we heading for a new financial crisis? 11.15am Davos (10.15am GMT): Indian PM Narendra Modi gives the opening plenary speech 2pm Davos (1pm GMT): Actor Cate Blanchett speaks about the global refugee crisis 3pm Davos (2pm GMT): Bollywood actor Shah Rukh Khan talks about women\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s empowerment in India. 3.30pm Davos (2.30pm GMT): Debate on gender, power and sexual harassment 5pm Davos (4pm GMT): Debate on capitalism: 5.30pm Davos (4.30pm GMT): Canadian PM Justin Trudeau gives a special address",

                "bodyText":"Canada\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s prime minister, Justin Trudeau, has challenged leaders of the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest corporations to hire more women and to tackle sexual harassment as he warned that a business-as-usual approach to tackling inequality would lead to failure for everyone. In a keynote speech to the World Economic Forum in Davos, Trudeau said hiring, promoting and retaining more women was the key to narrowing the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153staggering\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd gap between rich and poor. Business leaders at the annual WEF meeting in Switzerland have enjoyed an increase in wealth in the past year as a result of rising stock markets but the Canadian premier asked whether they wanted \u00e2\u20ac\u0153to live in gated enclaves while those around them struggle\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. He said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Too many corporations have single-mindedly put the pursuit of profit before the wellbeing of workers. All the while, companies avoid taxes and boast record profits with one hand while slashing benefits with the other.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Trudeau said that employing more women was the smart thing to do, adding that it would lead to a greater diversity of ideas, more innovation and fewer disputes.

The US president is due to speak in Davos on Friday but, before his arrival, the heads of some of the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s leading financial institutions were warning that the stock market boom since his election victory could be threatened by systemic IT failure, political crisis or a failure to remember the lessons of the recent past. Concerns that the recent rise in share prices that has taken markets around the world to record highs might be too good to last dominated the first full day of the Davos event. Anne Richards, the chief executive of the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s M&amp;G Investments, said a collapse of IT systems that put markets out of action for several days could be the trigger for a crash. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We all have businesses which are absolutely reliant on a very small number of people who provide the [IT] pipes that effectively we all put our business though,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd she said.

When someone says a good exchange rate is good, that is targeting exchange rate. That goes back to years ago before the [recent] terms of agreement were agreed.</p> \n  <p><em>Q:Why did you chooses September to end QE?

What level of concern was there today about a possible change in US policy [after US dollar comments]</em></p> \n  <p>Yes there was concern. It was broader than simply the exchange rate, but about broader state of international relations right now. If this leads to an unwarranted tightening of monetary policy we would have to think about our monetary policy strategy.</p> \n  <p>On communications, you see same thing in other jurisdictions. All the communiations since Dec have in common three characteristics. All based on commitment to objective of inflation target. None questioned the sequence whereby interest rates will stay at current levels well past end of asset buying programme. Well past was emphasised.</p> \n  <p><em>Q: Some commentators factoring in an interest rate rise this year? At its current level does euro reflect fundamentals?</em></p> \n  <p>Based on today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s data I see very few chances at all that interest rates can be raised this year. On euro, we should ask is it produced by strength of economy, or by statements, or by monetary policy elsewhere. </p> \n  <p><em>Q: Another question on the G30 membership, could it compromise ECB?</em></p> \n  <p>Draghi repeats his previous answer, but adds ombudsman said there was no evidence the meeting influenced ECB, and ECB must have contacts with other financial participants.</p> \n  <p><em>Q: Will differences of views within ECB deepen on exit strategy? At March meeting, will you give restatement of forward guidance.</em></p> \n  <p>I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think the differences are as substantive as they were on other occasions. Some are a little more confident, if they live where inflation is rising. But there are not deep existential differences.</p> \n  <p>But there may be differences on when to say certain things, when to move forward. Markets have expectations on path, but also on dates, timelines. </p> \n  <p>In March we will assess how things stand at that point in time.</p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5a69d9b0e4b00f225a1c7a86\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-01-25T15:06:10.845Z\">3.06pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">ECB: Draghi press conference</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Away from Davis briefly and back with the ECB, and president Mario Draghi said at his press conference that domestic price pressures remained muted, inflation has yet to show a convincing upward trend.</p> \n  <p>He said the recent foreign exchange volatility is a source of uncertainty. An ample degree of monetary stimulus is necessary.</p> \n  <p>On the economy, he said there could be positive growth surprise in the near term. But there were downside risks remain relating to global factors, forex.</p> \n  <p>More on inflation: he said it was expected to rise gradually over the medium term, supported by our measures, rising wage growth etc</p> \n  <p>He then repeats his usual call to governments to do more: To reap the ull benefits from monetary policy measures, other policy areas must contribute. Structural reform in euro area countries needs to be stepped up . On fiscal policies, the case is strengthened for rebuilding fiscal buffers, especially in in countries where debt remains high. Strengthening EMU remains a priority.</p> \n  <p>Now for questions:</p> \n  <p><em>Q: What will have to happen for the exchange rate to be a problem for the inflation target? And you said in December you would revisit guidance [on the bond buying programme] early this year?</em></p> \n  <p>Draghi says there is confusion about the guidance comment, there was no difference between what was said at the December meeting and what Draghi said at the press conference. All that was said was there would have to be discussions about the need to have a discussion in the early part of the year. That discussion hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t really started. We went through the events since October to now, trying to assess whether something has changed. There was not much of a change except the strengthening of the economy a little more than expected. By and large the risk to growth is balanced.</p> \n  <p>We can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t declare victory. Price pressures are muted. Underlying inflation is showing little signs of upward movement. So we simply restated policy.</p> \n  <p>He said the commitment to the inflation target remained firmer than ever. Monetary policy will remain accommodative.</p> \n  <p>On exchange rates he said there were three reasons for volatility. The improvement in the economy, the heightened market sensitivity to perceived changes in our communication. Finally the use of language in discussion exchange rate developments that doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t reflect the terms of reference that have been agreed in October in Washington [an agreement between governments on exchange rate policy]</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a263a300171d6e4db1e16a9fb5d2f56b0fed19e9\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a263a300171d6e4db1e16a9fb5d2f56b0fed19e9/27_0_750_450/500.jpg\" alt=\"newdraghi25\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Draghi at the press conference</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: ECB</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n  <p><em>Q:Dollar weakness is what you were probably referring to. It must not be helpful to hear a lower dollar is something [US officials] like. Are we heading to currency war scenario. Also, could you envisage ending QE programme in September.</em></p> \n  <p>We don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t target exchange rates, they are important for growth and price stability. </p> \n  <p>Movements justified by strength of economy are a fact of natiure. Are there other movements caused by use of language, not parts of terms agreed. Whether that has an effect on our inflation path...inflation is our main concern. Too early to assess whether pass through has already taken place, and what will be extent.</p> \n  <p>Some are questioning the extent of pass through, but large exchange rate movements are bound to have an effect. In Washington - ministers and governments recognised excessive volatily or disorderly movements in exchange rates could have adverse effects. [They agreed] we will refrain from competitive devaluations and will not target exchange rates for competitive purposes.</p> \n  <p>On second question, we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have any discussion today, but we never stop the programme abruptly.</p> \n  <p><em>Q: Will you give up you membership of the G30, after ombudsman letter?</em></p> \n  <p>We received the letter from the ombudsman, we will respond in time. There is a procedure. We will assess the letter and the comments and respond.</p> \n  <p><em>Q: German pay negotiations. Could there be broad pay increases across eurozone economy following Germany?</em></p> \n  <p>We observe from a monetary policy angle, where we consider wage growth as a convincing sign of future inflation convergence to our objective. Whether it spreads, depends on conditions of labour market. Tight conditions in Germany, not so in other countries.</p> \n  <p><em>Q: Are there financial stability risks from long term accommodative policy? </em></p> \n  <p>Vice president Vitor Constancio answers. No one can talk about asset price bubbles in euro area. We have overstretched valuations in some places for commercial real estate, high yield corporate bonds but nothing else.... We see prices in market are close to fair value. Same is true of housing prices. Fundamental values are in line with fundamental. Prices of houses increasing by 4%, between 2000 and 2006 they were up 7%. So no general situation of overvaluation in residential properties.</p> \n  <p>Some countries have also taken macroprudential policies to combat excesses.</p> \n  <p>The effect on banks of negative rates, taking into account all our policies, they have been favourable to their profitability which is still low but increasing.

In Asia overnight it hit $1.4328, and although it has eased back from that, it is still up 0.11% so far today at $1.4255.</p> \n  <p>It is partly the expectation of an earlier than expected UK rate rise, given the recent strong data including Wednesday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s employment and wages figures. But of course there is also the weak dollar, hit recently by the expectation that Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tax cuts would raise the already hefty US deficit. More immediately Treasury secretary Steven Mnuchin told Davos the US wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t worried about a flagging greenback. Kit Juckes at Societe Generale said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Steven Mnuchin (US Treasury Secretary) went to Davos and said that a weaker dollar \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcis good for us as it relates to trade and opportunities\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. He also pointed out that that he isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t concerned by where it is in the short term and that in the longer term, its strength is a reflection of the strength of the US economy. In other words, he said very little really, but he said it under snow-plastered slopes and he was speaking to a market where dollar bulls have been under the cosh. A few more capitulated.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Against the euro the pound is pretty flat, down just 0.01% at \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.1473 ahead of the latest European Central Bank meeting. But the euro is up against the dollar, 0.11% better at $1.2421.</p> \n  <p>The strength of the euro presents a problem for ECB president Mario Draghi. If he appears too bulllish at hinting at an end to the bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s QE programme, the euro will appreciate even further. And that would keep a lid on inflation which is already below the bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s target. Equally, he cannot ignore the improving European economy. Michael Hewson at CMC Markets explains:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>With headline inflation remaining well below its 2% target rate at 1.4% and an economy that continues to show decent levels of economic activity the ECB is faced with having to navigate the minefield of guiding markets over the tightrope of communicating a credible timeline for stimulus reduction and interest rate policy, while trying to move CPI back to target against the difficulty of a rising currency. </p> \n   <p>Since the beginning of 2017 the euro has risen 18% against the US dollar and could well rise even further given yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s remarks by US Treasury Secretary Mnuchin.<strong> </strong></p> \n   <p>Last week ECB vice president Vitor Constancio along with Austria\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ewald Nowotny expressed concern about recent exchange rate movements. These concerns are likely to have increased in recent days which will make today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s press conference by ECB President Mario Draghi much more interesting. He can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t very well ignore the improving outlook but if he comes across as too bullish the euro could well be well on the way to the 1.3000 level by the end of this quarter.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Naeem Aslam, chief market analyst at Think Markets, said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Draghi would have to adopt a delicate approach and seek a strategy which stops the euro from firming further. The only way out of this situation for him would be to emphasize that the process of the rate hikes is not within sight yet. The market is expecting a rate hike in 2019 from the ECB, Draghi would have to pull a rabbit out of hat in order to convince the market that rate hike isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t on the agenda and market participants are getting ahead of themselves.</p> \n   <p>We do think that overly dovish statement by the European central bank is priced in the euro to some extent. If Draghi fails to convince the market or if he doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t sound as dovish as the market is expecting, we think that the euro can take off from here. I think the risk to the downside for the euro are limited, it is the upside move which would be more exciting. </p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p><strong>NF</strong></p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2018-01-25T09:35:55.305Z\">at 9.35am GMT</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5a699fbae4b0473d0bc1006d\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-01-25T09:14:06.963Z\">9.14am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6b01f8328d4d3d09f9d57f014effee666cffec85\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6b01f8328d4d3d09f9d57f014effee666cffec85/0_0_3500_2518/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Swiss police officers on the roof of the Davos Congress Hotel this morning.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"719\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Swiss police officers on the roof of the Davos Congress Hotel this morning.</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Denis Balibouse/Reuters</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5a699c38e4b00f225a1c77eb\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-01-25T08:59:11.454Z\">8.59am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Theresa May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Conservative Party has confirmed she will hold social media giants to account in Davos:</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/CCHQPress/status/956450450433339392\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Today, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/theresa_may?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@theresa_may</a> will put pressure on social media companies to stop providing a platform for terror, extremism and child abuse.

                "bodyText":"A late PS, from the Associated Press\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Pan Pylas on the moment Trump arrived at the World Economic Forum. One way to get President Donald Trump to stop and talk at the World Economic Forum: wield a book about him. On his way into the World Economic Forum, Trump stopped and talked for about ten seconds to one delegate who was brandishing a copy of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153God and Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd by Stephen E. Strang. He then proceeded to hold the book aloft in his left hand. Trump is the first U.S. president to attend the World Economic Forum since Bill Clinton back in 2000. Trump is holding a series of meetings and is due to deliver a speech on Friday in which he will argue that what is good for the U.S. economy is beneficial for the global economy. And finally, readers will be keen to know that Donald Trump is probably tucked up in bed. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the final dispatch: Motorcade arrived at the Intercontinental at 9:23. Pool did not see POTUS get out. He will sleep here tonight. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s all from us until tomorrow! Thanks for reading and commenting. GW Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s some colour from Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s dinner with business leaders, from the White House press pack: President Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s eyes narrowed, as he looked a bit tired by the jetlag and long trip. But he seemed to enjoy the camaraderie with businessmen, joking with them about their success and lofty responsibilities, and nodding in agreement as they spoke about their large manufacturing capacity and thousands of US-based employees. Among the topics discussed: Kanye West\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s role in designing Adidas shoes, Mack Trucks made by Volvo, Nestl\u00c3\u00a9\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s non-chocolate business portfolio. Among Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s asides: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153When he says he works for Siemens, he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the president of Siemens!...Wow, that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s big!....Good luck with the G.E. purchase.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Trump spoke about the thriving American economy \u00e2\u20ac\u201c crediting his tax policies, deregulation and his role as a cheerleader for American business. Soros then claims the bitcoin price will be propped by up by dictators, who use it to \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcbuild their nest eggs abroad\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Q: As a former currency trader (who beat the Bank of England on Black Wednesday) what do you think of cryptocurrencies? Bitcoin is not a currency, Soros replies. A currency is supposed to be a stable store of value, and a currency that can fluctuate 25% in a day can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be used to pay wages It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a speculation, based on a misunderstanding. Soros suggest the EU should help Africa\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy develop, if it wants to address the migration crisis. Onto questions. Q: What should be done to tackle the technology giants? It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a very complicated issue, Soros replies. It requires the full-time attention of those who formulate and enforce new laws. I put my faith in them, especially commissioner Vestigar who has done so much to enforce the laws - and made an award against Google. Q: If you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t like social media companies, why do you buy shares in them? calls out a diner from the back of the room. Soros doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t reply (I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m not sure he heard). Instead he takes a question about migration, saying he cares about refugees because he was one himself; he came to Britain and was better treated than refugees arriving in Europe today. Another punchy quote from Soros: On Europe, Soros suggests that a multi-speed, multi-track approach would be more successful. This would allow Britain to rejoin the EU in the future without having to commit to joining the euro, explained Soros (who hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t given up hope that Brexit won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t happen). George Soros then turns his guns at the technology sector. In a blistering attack, he accuses social media companies of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153deliberately engineering addiction\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, which is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153particularly harmful\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd for adolescents. He accuses them of inducing customers to give up their autonomy too. Soros says there are similarities between internet platforms and gambling platforms - pointing out that casinos have developed techniques to hook customers so they keep gambling even when they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve run out of money. But... while tech giants may think they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re masters of the universe, they are actually just slaves to preserving their dominant position Soros continues. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s only a matter of time before the monopoly of the US IT giants is broken, he declares: Davos is a good place to announce that their days are numbered. Regulation and taxation will be their undoing. I see Trump as a purely temporary phenomenon which will disappear in 2020, or earlier, Soros says - winning a laugh from his audience as they tuck into their chicken, potatoes and spinach. Soros adds that he expects a Democratic landslide in 2018. America must recognise the reality that North Korea has become a nuclear power, Soros continues. There is no military action that can prevent what has already happened. The only sensible strategy is to accept reality\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6.and come to terms with North Koreas as a nuclear power. That means working with China to find a solution. Soros says that the survival of our whole civilisation is at stake, due to the rise of Kim Jong Un in North Korea and Donald Trump in the United States. They both seem to be willing to risk a nuclear war to keep themselves in power. At another dinner in Davos, billionaire businessman-turned-philanthopist George Soros is giving his views on the state of the world. He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s warning that open societies are in crisis, with various forms of dictatorship on the rise - such as Vladimir Putin\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Russia. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153In the United States, President Trump would like to establish a mafia state, but can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, Soros continues, because America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s institutions, constitution and its \u00e2\u20ac\u0153vibrant civil society\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t allow it. If you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re just tuning in, here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our news story about the prospect of Donald Trump visiting the UK later this year: UK government officials have been updating the British press about Theresa May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meeting with Donald Trump this afternoon, shortly after he arrived at WEF (and brought it to a standstill). Mark Knoller, CBS News White House Correspondent, has details of Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s dinner with European business chiefs: Donald Trump is now sitting down for diner with the bosses of some of Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest companies. Mark Tucker, the chairman of HSBC, and Punit Renjen, the chief executive of Deloitte, are flying the flag for Britain - according to this guest list from the White House press pack: President Donald J. Trump Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, Department of State Secretary Kirstjen Nielson, Department of Homeland Security General H.R. McMaster, National Security Advisor Gary Cohn, Director of the National Economic Council Kasper Rorsted, Adidas (Apparel)\u00e2\u20ac\u201dGermany Joe Kaeser, Siemens AG (Tech)\u00e2\u20ac\u201dGermany Heinrich Hiesinger, Thyssenkrupp AG (Industrials)\u00e2\u20ac\u201dGermany Eldar Saetre, Statoil ASA (Energy)\u00e2\u20ac\u201dNorway Mark Schneider, Nestle SA (Food and Beverage)\u00e2\u20ac\u201dSwitzerland Vas Narasimhan, Novartis AG (Pharmaceutical)\u00e2\u20ac\u201dSwitzerland Mark Tucker, HSBC (Financial Services)\u00e2\u20ac\u201dUK Patrick Pouyanne, Total SA (Energy)\u00e2\u20ac\u201dFrance Carlos Brito, Anheuser-Busch InBev NV (Food and Beverage)\u00e2\u20ac\u201dBelgium Rajeev Suri, Nokia Corporation (Technology)\u00e2\u20ac\u201dFinland Punit Renjen, Deloitte (Consulting)\u00e2\u20ac\u201dUK Martian Lundstedt, AB Volvo (Auto)\u00e2\u20ac\u201dSweden Werner Baumann, Bayer AG (Pharmaceutical)\u00e2\u20ac\u201dGermany Bill McDermott, SAP SE (Technology)\u00e2\u20ac\u201dGermany Ulrich Spiesshofer, ABB Ltd (Manufacturing)\u00e2\u20ac\u201dSwitzerland \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 This list was amended on 26 January 2018 to correct inaccurate details provided by the White House press office. The spelling of Carlos Brito\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s first name was corrected from Carols, and the location of Anheuser-Busch InBev NV\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s headquarters has been corrected from the Netherlands to Belgium. President Trump is likely to face protests if and when his visit to the UK takes place, even if it is just a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153working visit\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. For a start, Liberal Democrat deputy leader Jo Swinson pulled no punches, saying: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Trump is a dangerous, misogynistic racist and is deserving of the protests he will undoubtedly face. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153If and when he comes to the UK the Liberal Democrats will be at front and centre of the protests.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The White House says Theresa May and Donald Trump discussed plans for a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153working visit\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to London. That may mean that it won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be a full-blown state visit. A working visit would mean less pomp and ceremony (and probably not a visit to see the Queen). Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the official statement (which includes that all-important nod to the Special Relationship). President Donald J. Trump met today with Prime Minister Theresa May of the United Kingdom. The President and Prime Minister discussed joint efforts to ensure the enduring defeat of ISIS and other jihadist terrorist organizations in Syria and Iraq. They discussed the importance of confronting Iran\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s destructive behavior across the Middle East and fundamental flaws in the Iran nuclear deal. The leaders committed to expanded trade between the United States and the United Kingdom, as well as how the two countries can work together to ensure all nations engage in fair and reciprocal trade practices. The two leaders also discussed plans for a working visit to London in the coming months and affirmed the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153special relationship\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd between the two countries is stronger than ever. Donald Trump emerged from his meetings a little while ago, and briefly chatted with delegates who hadn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t been driven away by security. He said his first day at Davos had been \u00e2\u20ac\u0153really good\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and \u00e2\u20ac\u0153very successful\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, before calling it a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153very great day\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the key quote (with thanks to the White House press corp) \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I think the real message is we want great prosperity and we want great peace and I think that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the message. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been going really well. A lot of people are coming back to the United States. We are seeing tremendous investment and today has been a very exciting day. Very great day and great for our country. Thank you very much.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s more details: Q: Is America great? Trump: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s great\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Q: Is everybody else great? \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Everyone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s great,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Trump said, turning his head toward the questioner as he walked through the convention hallway. Donald Trump may be in the spotlight in Davos today, but it was Wednesday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s comments by US Treasury secretary Steven Mnuchin about the dollar which caused ructions at the European Central Bank. Mnuchin said that a weaker dollar was good for American trade, and ECB president Mario Draghi suggested this was not in the spirit of an agreement between governments made in October in Washington. Draghi said: Ministers and governments recognised excessive volatily or disorderly movements in exchange rates could have adverse effects. [They agreed to] refrain from competitive devaluations and not target exchange rates for competitive purposes. He said the current exchange rate volatility was partly due to\u00e2\u20ac\ufffdthe use of language in discussing exchange rate developments that doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t reflect the terms of reference that have been agreed.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Mnuchin\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s comments yesterday sent an already weak dollar still lower. Marco Valli, chief European economist at UniCredit Bank, said: [The ECB] remains fairly relaxed about the effects of a stronger euro, but bluntly criticised the recent foreign exchange messages from the US administration, seen as violating the long-standing international commitment to avoid competitive devaluation. And of course Donald Trump has tweeted about his meeting with Theresa May: Theresa May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meeting with Donald Trump at Davos took place shortly after she gave a special address to the World Economic Forum (highlights start here) May focused on the opportunities and threats of new technology, and Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s efforts to equip its economy for the challenges ahead. Paul Sheard, chief global economist at S&amp;P Global Ratings, tells us that she missed a trick by not also talking about Brexit, and UK-US relations. Prime Minister May made a strong pitch for the UK to be seen as a global leader in AI and regulation-friendly innovation, but \u00e2\u20ac\ufffdI thought her not spending some time laying out the UK government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s latest thinking on Brexit - particularly what it aspires for the all-important future relationship - was a bit of a missed opportunity. We don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know what details still need to be finalised, so it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s possible that officials can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t actually get Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s visit nailed down. One possible hitch might be the certainty of large protests against the US president from British citizens appalled by his view on climate change, accusations of sexual harassment, the Muslim ban, his America First policies - to name just four. Trump is reportedly rather worried about facing major protests - something he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been spared in Davos, due to its ultra-tight security net. Bloomberg reported this week that the US president had asked May to make sure he got a good reception. In one phone conversation during 2017, Trump complained to May over the criticism he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d been getting in British newspapers. Amid warnings that Trump would face protests in the streets when he arrived, he told the prime minister he would not be coming to the U.K. until she could promise him a warm welcome. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s official. Barring a few details, US president Donald Trump will visit the United Kingdom later this year. May and Trump asked their respective officials to work on \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcfinalising the details\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 of a trip, at the end of their bilateral meeting here in the World Economic Forum. A Downing Street spokesman says that: The PM and President concluded by asking officials to work together on finalising the details of a visit by the President to the UK later this year.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no word on when it might happen, though. Downing Street also say that the two leaders discussed Brexit, Iran, terrorism, and worries that jobs could lost at Bombardier\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s factory in Northern Ireland due to the trade dispute with Boeing. The spokesman says: The two leaders began by discussing Bombardier, with the PM reiterating the importance of the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s jobs in Northern Ireland. The PM and the President discussed Iran, and the need to work together to combat the destabilising activity which it is conducting in the region, including ballistic missile development, and continuing efforts to ensure Iran does not develop nuclear weapons. They also agreed on the importance of continuing to stand side-by-side in the fight against Daesh in Syria and elsewhere. The Prime Minister updated the President on the good progress which had been made in the Brexit negotiations so far. The two leaders reiterated their desire for a strong trading relationship post-Brexit, which would be in the interests of both countries. NEWSFLASH: Theresa May and Donald Trump have asked officials to work on \u00e2\u20ac\u0153finalising the details of a visit by the President to the UK later this year\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, Downing Street said. More to follow. Swiss campaign group CAMPAX have hung a Trump protest banner on a mountain at Sargans - about 50 kilometres from Davos. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a photo of the Davos meeting room which Donald Trump and his delegation swept into, a couple of hours ago: There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s still a huge crowd at the bottom of the stairs; I think there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s only one way out.... During his meeting with Benjamin Netanyahu, president Trump suggested that aid would be withheld from the Palestinians if they didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t show respect. He said \u00e2\u20ac\u0153they disrespected our great Vice President\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd (Last November, Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t meet Mike Pence during his visit to the Middle East). Trump said (via the White House pool report): \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The money is on the table. And the money was never off the table. [Yesterday, it was reported that former US secretary of state John Kerry had advised Abbas not to give in to Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s demands] Israeli president Benjamin Netanyahu has returned from his meeting with Trump. He says it was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153excellent\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the White House pool report on the Trump-May meeting: President Trump and PM May sat beside one another in a WEF conference room with aides on each side. Among them on US side: Gary Cohn, HR McMaster, Tillerson, Sarah Sanders. Highlights: Trump \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Its a false rumor\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd that there is tension in the US-UK relationship. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re on the same wavelength in I think every respect\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The two are \u00e2\u20ac\u0153liking each other a lot\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and \u00e2\u20ac\u0153joined at the hip\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd when it comes to the military. He looked at her and said there was nothing that would happen where the US would not be there for Britain. May also reaffirmed the special relationship. When asked about a state visit, May said it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s being discussed now. Trump seconded that. No answers to shouted questions about the far right video retweet [back in November, Trump retweeted several anti-Muslim videos] Donald Trump has also talked about the prospect of a trade deal with the UK, but only in very general terms. Trade between the US and the UK is going to increase \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcmany times\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, Trump said during his meeting with May, adding: The discussions...that will be taking place are going to lead to tremendous increase in trade between our countries, which is great for both in terms of jobs. Q: But what about a state visit to Britain? May and Trump say they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll talk about that during their meeting at Davos. Several people have come down the stairs where Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meetings are taking place. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve spied IMF chief Christine Lagarde, Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier, and Labour\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shadow chancellor John McDonnell. That doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t mean they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve all been meeting the US president - there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s more than one room up there. Q: How large an effect does your communication have on exchange rate? When I said communication I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t mean ECB communication but other people\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s communication. We don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t target exchange rate. When someone says a good exchange rate is good, that is targeting exchange rate. That goes back to years ago before the [recent] terms of agreement were agreed. Q:Why did you chooses September to end QE? Commodities are priced in dollars and could effect inflation data. When we recalibrated programme last October we had a discussion whether it should be six or nine months, and how much. So after that we came out with this educated outcome. In defining our objective we have different definitions, including underlying inflation which excludes energy etc. We target headline inflation, but we look at evidence from other definitions. Q: Oil price has risen significantly since December, could that cancel out strong euro. Yes, although it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not easy to understand exactly the timing of these compensations. That doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t imply we accept a certain level of exchange rate as a good or bad thing. And with that it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s over. Q: how do you feel about ECB communications this year including from individual members, could it be improved. What level of concern was there today about a possible change in US policy [after US dollar comments] Yes there was concern. It was broader than simply the exchange rate, but about broader state of international relations right now. If this leads to an unwarranted tightening of monetary policy we would have to think about our monetary policy strategy. On communications, you see same thing in other jurisdictions. All the communiations since Dec have in common three characteristics. All based on commitment to objective of inflation target. None questioned the sequence whereby interest rates will stay at current levels well past end of asset buying programme. Well past was emphasised. Q: Some commentators factoring in an interest rate rise this year? At its current level does euro reflect fundamentals? Based on today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s data I see very few chances at all that interest rates can be raised this year. On euro, we should ask is it produced by strength of economy, or by statements, or by monetary policy elsewhere. Q: Another question on the G30 membership, could it compromise ECB? Draghi repeats his previous answer, but adds ombudsman said there was no evidence the meeting influenced ECB, and ECB must have contacts with other financial participants. Q: Will differences of views within ECB deepen on exit strategy? At March meeting, will you give restatement of forward guidance. I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think the differences are as substantive as they were on other occasions. Some are a little more confident, if they live where inflation is rising. But there are not deep existential differences. But there may be differences on when to say certain things, when to move forward. Markets have expectations on path, but also on dates, timelines. In March we will assess how things stand at that point in time. Away from Davis briefly and back with the ECB, and president Mario Draghi said at his press conference that domestic price pressures remained muted, inflation has yet to show a convincing upward trend. He said the recent foreign exchange volatility is a source of uncertainty. An ample degree of monetary stimulus is necessary. On the economy, he said there could be positive growth surprise in the near term. But there were downside risks remain relating to global factors, forex. More on inflation: he said it was expected to rise gradually over the medium term, supported by our measures, rising wage growth etc He then repeats his usual call to governments to do more: To reap the ull benefits from monetary policy measures, other policy areas must contribute. Structural reform in euro area countries needs to be stepped up . On fiscal policies, the case is strengthened for rebuilding fiscal buffers, especially in in countries where debt remains high. Strengthening EMU remains a priority. Now for questions: Q: What will have to happen for the exchange rate to be a problem for the inflation target? And you said in December you would revisit guidance [on the bond buying programme] early this year? Draghi says there is confusion about the guidance comment, there was no difference between what was said at the December meeting and what Draghi said at the press conference. All that was said was there would have to be discussions about the need to have a discussion in the early part of the year. That discussion hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t really started. We went through the events since October to now, trying to assess whether something has changed. There was not much of a change except the strengthening of the economy a little more than expected. By and large the risk to growth is balanced. We can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t declare victory. Price pressures are muted. Underlying inflation is showing little signs of upward movement. So we simply restated policy. He said the commitment to the inflation target remained firmer than ever. Monetary policy will remain accommodative. On exchange rates he said there were three reasons for volatility. The improvement in the economy, the heightened market sensitivity to perceived changes in our communication. Finally the use of language in discussion exchange rate developments that doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t reflect the terms of reference that have been agreed in October in Washington [an agreement between governments on exchange rate policy] Q:Dollar weakness is what you were probably referring to. It must not be helpful to hear a lower dollar is something [US officials] like. Are we heading to currency war scenario. Also, could you envisage ending QE programme in September. We don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t target exchange rates, they are important for growth and price stability. Movements justified by strength of economy are a fact of natiure. Are there other movements caused by use of language, not parts of terms agreed. Whether that has an effect on our inflation path...inflation is our main concern. Too early to assess whether pass through has already taken place, and what will be extent. Some are questioning the extent of pass through, but large exchange rate movements are bound to have an effect. In Washington - ministers and governments recognised excessive volatily or disorderly movements in exchange rates could have adverse effects. [They agreed] we will refrain from competitive devaluations and will not target exchange rates for competitive purposes. On second question, we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have any discussion today, but we never stop the programme abruptly. Q: Will you give up you membership of the G30, after ombudsman letter? We received the letter from the ombudsman, we will respond in time. There is a procedure. We will assess the letter and the comments and respond. Q: German pay negotiations. Could there be broad pay increases across eurozone economy following Germany? We observe from a monetary policy angle, where we consider wage growth as a convincing sign of future inflation convergence to our objective. Whether it spreads, depends on conditions of labour market. Tight conditions in Germany, not so in other countries. Q: Are there financial stability risks from long term accommodative policy? Vice president Vitor Constancio answers. No one can talk about asset price bubbles in euro area. We have overstretched valuations in some places for commercial real estate, high yield corporate bonds but nothing else.... We see prices in market are close to fair value. Same is true of housing prices. Fundamental values are in line with fundamental. Prices of houses increasing by 4%, between 2000 and 2006 they were up 7%. So no general situation of overvaluation in residential properties. Some countries have also taken macroprudential policies to combat excesses. The effect on banks of negative rates, taking into account all our policies, they have been favourable to their profitability which is still low but increasing. So negative rates have been absorbed by banking sector. Draghi talks about fiscal buffers. Interest rates will at some point stop being so low. At that point all governments will want to have policy space, so budget consideration now when the time is good is favourable. NF We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve now got video footage of Theresa May and Donald Trump meeting. Trump says he and May have a mutual feeling of \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcliking each other a lot\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. He says there have been a false rumour out there, which he wants to rebut. He tells May: We have great respect for everything you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re doing, and we love your country. We think it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s truly good. Trump says that the US and the UK are working on economic development, trade and military issues. We are very much joined at the hip when it comes to the military Theresa May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meeting with Trump is over - she\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s departed the scene without speaking to the press. Next up.... Israel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s president Benjamin Netanyahu. He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s gone up the stairs with a small group, presumably to meet Trump. Curiously, Theresa May and a few advisors came down from the Trump meeting.....vanished into another room...reappeared and then went back up again. OK, it looks like Trump and May have been holding their meeting - and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s nearly over.... White House reporters are travelling with Trump - here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s one of the latest pooled reports: Pool arrived at 2:40 at the conference center after brief motorcade through town that includes some small souvenir shops, ski shops, restaurants. There were some JP Morgan flags posted on the route as well. The smattering of onlookers included a few waving American flags and some young kids in ski helmets. A few more photos of Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s arrival: I managed a short video clip of Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s arrival: President Trump and his entourage then move up the stairs, to a constant clicking of cameras. One delegate welcomes him to Switzerland. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Thank you very much. Great country.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Trump replies. He then continues up another flight of stairs, to an area where most delegates (and journalists) aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t allowed. A security guard is now posted there to prevent any intruders. Trump arrives to his audience; reporters shout out a few questions. Asked what his message is to Davos, he replies \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Peace and prosperity\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. There are a few laughs. Here he comes...... The entire World Economic Forum has gone into a weird semi-lockdown. Half the delegates are crowding around, in a hush, waiting for Trump. The rest are milling around in the corridors and lounges, or getting on with business. Curiously, most delegates are waiting in silence..... President Trump is about to arrive at the World Economic Forum. People are crowding around the security cordon and flocking on the balcony , desperate for a glimpse. Theresa May ends her speech by calling on the World Economic Forum to work together to solve the problems she identified. The UK has a proud history of stepping up and delivering progress that can deliver for all, she says: Let\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s renew our commitment to collaboration - and set ourselves on a path to benefit all our people. Now, and for generations to come. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s it. No questions. Theresa May says technology companies employ some of the brightest minds in the world - they should be able to design a system where unacceptable content is deleted automatically. No-one wants to be known as a a platform for terrorism, or the best place for child pornography, she points out. She says there are three key priorities: Considering whether new regulations are needed for these tech platforms Investors must think about the social impact of the firms they invest in. Working on the ethical implications of Artificial Intelligence Theresa May is now challenging social media companies to do more to protect users - especially children. We want Britain to be a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153World leader in innovation-friendly regulation\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd she says (not the catchiest slogan). That means being the safest place in the world to be online, while also being a great place to run a digital business. Technology companies must \u00e2\u20ac\u0153step up to their responsibilities\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, the PM says sternly. Companies simply cannot stand by while their platforms are used to facilitate child abuse, modern slavery, or the spreading of terrorist and extremist content. Theresa May singles out Uber as an example of the potential,and problems, created by technology. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s an innovative company, but it has also got things wrong - with safety issues and concerns about its treatment of workers The solution isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t to shut them down, but to improve the system so companies work better. Employment law must protect workers and give businesses the flexibility it needs, says the PM - it can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t just be a one-way street. Maybe 2/3 full was an overstatement.... May is pitching to businesses here, saying the government is raising Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s digital skills for the 21st century. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re also at the forefront of low-carbon technologies, she declares. And on artificial intelligence, we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re only at the beginning of what AI can achieve, says May. Those of you up here in Davos mustn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t forget the plight of those who face losing their job after 20 years, says May. We must channel the power of business and government together to harness technology, and make it a force for good, May continues - to address people\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s concerns. I understand the power of business as a force for good. Free markets drive risk-taking that have delivered the great advances of our time. But I also believe in the power of government, she adds. Our new business strategy will make Britain one of the best place in the world to start and run a business, she pledges. Turning to technology, Theresa May says the internet can deliver $2.2 trillion worth of GDP to developing countries. And just last week, a drone saved two boys from drowning off Australia by carrying a float to them. Medical tests show that technology can reduce breast cancer cases by a third. But people are worried about the malevolent impact of technology, she says. Britain will continue to be an advocate of free trade after Brexit, May insists. And she challenges Davos delegates to live up to their commitments, in three ways: The commitments on steel must be implemented. Aid donors must match the UK and help developing countries The World Trade Organisation must do more to keep pace with the global economy - she singles out the service sector, and e-commerce Theresa May begins by saying that last year, she warned that the benefits of free trade weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t being shared fairly, and this risked undermining the global world order. One year on, there are grounds for optimism. Global growth is strengthening. The populism of the far left and far right has not made the progress some predicted, and in the UK, unemployment is at a 40-year low and government and business are working together well. Klaus Schwab, the founder of the World Economic Forum, is introducing Theresa May now. The room is roughly two-thirds full - respectable, not as much as for president Macron last night. Schwab says many Davos attendees were impressed last year, by May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s passionate plea to address global slavery. That work continues this year, he says. Cowbells are ringing across the Davos congress centre (yes, really), to tell delegates that Theresa May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s speech starts soon. The hall is filling up well, but it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not packed out yet. One delegate tells me she\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hoping to hear some clarity on Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s future after Brexit. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a lot of uncertainty right now\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. At the CBI\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s lunch in Davos, Philip Hammond insisted that Britain would leave the EU on 31st March 2019. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a statement of political reality, the chancellor insists. Hammond said Britain should go for something more ambitious than previous deals with the EU. An off-the-shelf Norway or Canada agreement won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t work. Unusually for trade talks, we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re starting from a point where we are already deeply interconnected with highly aligned regulatory systems and close co-operation on defence and security. Should go for something much more ambitious than anything that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s previously been agreed. Former UK cabinet minister and New Labour architect Peter Mandelson was also at the lunch, and pointed out that French president Emmanuel Macron had hosted 140 CEOs at Versailles the other day. Mandelson warned: For France, Brexit is a gift that keeps on giving. Hammond hit back, though, saying you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d get more top CEOs in London on an average day (probably not all meeting a world leader, though!). The European Central Bank has left interest rates unchanged and repeated that its bond buying programme will run until September or beyond if necessary. The ECB added it could increase the programme from its current \u00e2\u201a\u00ac30bn a month if circumstances change: If the outlook becomes less favourable, or if financial conditions become inconsistent with further progress towards a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation, the Governing Council stands ready to increase the asset purchase programme (APP) in terms of size and/or duration. On rates it said they would be kept at present levels \u00e2\u20ac\u0153for an extended period of time, and well past the horizon of the net asset purchases.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Of course the detail will come in president Mario Draghi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s press conference this afternoon, when analysts will be looking for more on the future of the QE programme and when rates might rise. But Draghi must be tempted to keep his cards close to his chest, and avoid anything which could push the euro higher when inflation is still below the bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s target. NF Donald Trump and his team are staying at the Intercontinental Hotel in Davos. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a sensible move from a security point of view; the Intercontinental is at the edge of Davos, rather than slap bang next to the conference centre like the Belvedere (scene of many parties and meeting). It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also up a steep hill, so easier to prevent protests . The White House press pack report that they saw onlookers snapping pictures of the Trump convoy, but no demos on the route. Hello... Business Insider\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Paul Colgan has spotted some anti-Trump protesters outside the conference halls. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s very tight security all around the Davos area, making it hard for demonstrators to travel up the mountain and exercise their democratic rights. You\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d almost think the global elite didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to know what people really think of them.... Chancellor Philip Hammond is cracking some jokes at the CBI\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s lunch with British business chiefs - including one at Theresa May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s expense. He reminds his audience that it was a walk in the mountain air that inspired the prime minister to call a general election last year*. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m discouraging her from taking any strolls, Hammond grins. * - (wiping out her majority) Boris Johnson once said that he was put off from visiting parts of New York by the very real risk of meeting Donald Trump. Well in Davos, you also run the very real risk of running into Piers Morgan. The UK journalist and TV personality has done well, though, securing an exclusive sit-down interview with the US president. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s due to air on Sunday night, with clips released on Friday morning. Davos delegates without a swanky lunch invite (or the time to go) are being fed individual jars of pasta dishes. And it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s great fun to watch the global elite scrambling to over each other whenever the waiting staff emerge with a new tray of goodies. Your humble correspondent finally gets a pot, balances it on his iPad - and is promptly mistaken for a waiter by a fellow delegate who tries to nab it off me. Maybe it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time for a career change... Trump has touched down in Switzerland, but there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no sign of him in the Congress Hall yet. Ireland\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s leader, Leo Varadkar, is in Davos -- and refusing to accept that Apple got an unfairly good tax deal from the Irish government. In 2016, the EC ruled that Apple had received \u00e2\u201a\u00ac13bn of state aid. Last November, it referred Ireland to the European Court of Justice because Dublin hadn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t started reclaiming the cash. According to Varadkar, this process will start soon.....but he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not rolling over in the ECJ. Speaking of the CBI, UK retail sales have grown modestly in January so far, according to its latest distributive trades survey, but at a slower pace than anticipated. The survey showed a balance of +12 for January, down from +20 in December. Sales for the time of year were the weakest compared to the norm for more than four years, said the CBI. Orders to suppliers also fell, and looking ahead retailers expect similar growth in sales volumes while orders are forecast to be flat. Anna Leach, CBI head of economic intelligence, said: Retailers have seen fairly modest sales growth this month overall, but it is online retailers who have set the pace during the January sales. Household spending will remain under pressure this year from higher inflation and low wage growth, which will continue to weigh on sales growth in the retail sector. NF British business chiefs and media leaders have headed to a lunchtime event with chancellor Philip Hammond, hosted by the CBI. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a traditional part of the Davos week for the UK delegation, but this year it could be a little frostier than usual. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s because CBI chief Caroline Fairbairn declared last week that Britain must remain in the customs union after Brexit. I imagine the Treasury weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t best pleased by this intervention (unless we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve outsourced Brexit negotiations to the CBI...a safer bet than using Carillion, anyway). But we understand that Hammond won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t use his speech to rebut Fairbairn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s call, and will cover other issues.... My colleague Larry Elliott\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s there, so we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll have more details soon.... Theresa May has given an interview to Bloomberg. She spoke about the revelations about sexual harassment at a charity dinner in London, saying: I was frankly appalled when I read the report of this Presidents Club event. I thought that that sort of attitude of the objectification of women was something that was in the past. Sadly, what that event showed is that there is still a lot more work for us to do. That chimes with Malala Yousafzai\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s comments this morning. Our Politics Live blog has more details: We hear that Theresa May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meeting with Donald Trump will take place shortly after her speech (which starts at 2pm, or 1pm GMT). It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s likely to focus on foreign affairs issues like Syria and North Korea. Theresa May has now ended her private meeting (perhaps a roundtable?) and swept the WEF congress hall in a gaggle of aides. Down the stairs at pace, she\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s quickly into another secure section of this rabbit-warren of a building. Disappointingly she didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t stop for questions - a camera had been lined up, just in case. Still, we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll hear from her in a couple of hours. Chancellor Philip Hammond has told the Davos panel on financial risks that Europe will lose out if the City suffers after Brexit. New York and Singapore would benefit from new business, he says, not European cities. The idea that you can recreate London\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s financial centre anywhere else is a fantasy. Hammond also says that financial services are very important to the UK side, and \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the centre of our negotiating strategy\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Those who say the financial sector will not be part of a deal have not been looking at the numbers, he says. We have a trade deficit of \u00c2\u00a3100bn with Europe, and a surplus in services of \u00c2\u00a340bn, Hammond explains, adding: The only deal that can be done is one that can be fair to both parties One that included trade and not services would not be fair to the UK. Theresa May and her entourage have just swept through the Davos congress centre, into a private meeting room. Alas media are certainly not allowed in to listen. Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s treasury secretary, Stephen Mnuchin is also on the panel on the future of finance. Yesterday, Mnuchin sent the dollar tumbling by saying a weak currency is good for exports. Today, he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s very relaxed about the whole issue, saying: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153In the short term where the dollar is is not a concern of mine. It is not something I spend a lot of time thinking about.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Mnuchin also denies that America is trying to launch a trade war, insisting that the US doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want less trade it wants \u00e2\u20ac\u0153fair trade\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. The big debate on financial stability is also underway. Christine Lagarde, managing director of the IMF, says trade is one of the factors leading to stronger growth. When asked about the risks of a trade war, she says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Who would want to do anything that would lead to weaker growth? Al Gore, former US vice-president, has suggested that Donald Trump can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t disrupt the battle against climate change - especially if he isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t reelected in 2020. Speaking on a panel here in Davos, Gore says there is strong momentum to fight climate change. Several governors of our largest states, hundreds of cities, and thousands of US businesses are now ensuring that the US will not just meet, but exceed, the commitments it made in the Paris Agreement. Gore explains that America can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t legally leave the Paris Agreement (to act to limit rising global temperatures) until after the next presidential election. And if there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a new president (at which point Al Gore offers a silent prayer), they could give 30 days notice and America would be back in the agreement. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the good news. The bad news, Gore says, is that the maximum action that is political feasible falls far short of the minimum of what is needed to battle climate change. So, we need to move the boundary of what politicians can do. You can watch the panel live, here. Back in the UK, and mortgage approvals by Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s banks fell to their lowest level since April 2013 in December, according to trade association UK Finance. Banks approved 36,115 mortgages for housebuying, down from 39,007 in November and 19% lower than a year ago. Annual growth in consumer credit slipped from 0.8% to 0.7%. And this could give the Bank of England a problem: NF Newsflash: Theresa May has met with South Africa\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s deputy president, Cyril Ramaphosa.....and there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not a fondue dish in sight either. Theresa May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s former press chief has caused a stir this morning, accusing the PM of spending last year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Davos \u00e2\u20ac\u0153sitting in a hotel eating fondue\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd rather than meeting fellow world leaders and business chiefs. Writing in The Times, Katy Perrior claims the PM struggled to schmooze at the 2017 World Economic Forum, and even turned up with the wrong sort of footwear (her new \u00c2\u00a3120 snowboots should work better this time). Perrior claiming business leaders were frozen out by May: \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcElsewhere they get personal audiences with President Macron in France and Malcolm Turnbull in Australia but not so much as a digestive biscuit from the PM. \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcDoes she have any idea how frustrating that is for them? Other world leaders are on a charm offensive, desperate to woo major businesses to their shores. \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcAs we count down to post-Brexit Britain, she would do well to spend less time enjoying the fondue and more time meeting and greeting.\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 More here. Personally, I was disappointed not to see May meeting business chiefs and academics at Oxford University\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s excellent Davos cheese and port party last night (maybe I left too early #bestbehaviour ) Perrior also claims May turned down the chance to meet Alibaba\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Jack Ma last year. He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s still at Davos, so there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s still time to make amends, prime minister... Kristin Lemkau, JP Morgan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chief marketing officer, sums up Davos so far: Sterling continues to go from strength to strength. In Asia overnight it hit $1.4328, and although it has eased back from that, it is still up 0.11% so far today at $1.4255. It is partly the expectation of an earlier than expected UK rate rise, given the recent strong data including Wednesday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s employment and wages figures. But of course there is also the weak dollar, hit recently by the expectation that Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tax cuts would raise the already hefty US deficit. More immediately Treasury secretary Steven Mnuchin told Davos the US wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t worried about a flagging greenback. Kit Juckes at Societe Generale said: Steven Mnuchin (US Treasury Secretary) went to Davos and said that a weaker dollar \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcis good for us as it relates to trade and opportunities\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. He also pointed out that that he isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t concerned by where it is in the short term and that in the longer term, its strength is a reflection of the strength of the US economy. In other words, he said very little really, but he said it under snow-plastered slopes and he was speaking to a market where dollar bulls have been under the cosh. A few more capitulated. Against the euro the pound is pretty flat, down just 0.01% at \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.1473 ahead of the latest European Central Bank meeting. But the euro is up against the dollar, 0.11% better at $1.2421. The strength of the euro presents a problem for ECB president Mario Draghi. If he appears too bulllish at hinting at an end to the bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s QE programme, the euro will appreciate even further. And that would keep a lid on inflation which is already below the bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s target. Equally, he cannot ignore the improving European economy. Michael Hewson at CMC Markets explains: With headline inflation remaining well below its 2% target rate at 1.4% and an economy that continues to show decent levels of economic activity the ECB is faced with having to navigate the minefield of guiding markets over the tightrope of communicating a credible timeline for stimulus reduction and interest rate policy, while trying to move CPI back to target against the difficulty of a rising currency. Since the beginning of 2017 the euro has risen 18% against the US dollar and could well rise even further given yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s remarks by US Treasury Secretary Mnuchin. Last week ECB vice president Vitor Constancio along with Austria\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ewald Nowotny expressed concern about recent exchange rate movements. These concerns are likely to have increased in recent days which will make today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s press conference by ECB President Mario Draghi much more interesting. He can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t very well ignore the improving outlook but if he comes across as too bullish the euro could well be well on the way to the 1.3000 level by the end of this quarter. Naeem Aslam, chief market analyst at Think Markets, said: Draghi would have to adopt a delicate approach and seek a strategy which stops the euro from firming further. The only way out of this situation for him would be to emphasize that the process of the rate hikes is not within sight yet. The market is expecting a rate hike in 2019 from the ECB, Draghi would have to pull a rabbit out of hat in order to convince the market that rate hike isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t on the agenda and market participants are getting ahead of themselves. We do think that overly dovish statement by the European central bank is priced in the euro to some extent. If Draghi fails to convince the market or if he doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t sound as dovish as the market is expecting, we think that the euro can take off from here. I think the risk to the downside for the euro are limited, it is the upside move which would be more exciting. NF Theresa May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Conservative Party has confirmed she will hold social media giants to account in Davos: Bruce Carnegie-Brown, chairman of Lloyd\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s, says that companies are taking out more insurance against cyber attacks. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It is the fastest growing part of our business\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, Carnegie-Brown says, adding: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Companies are certainly becoming more concerned about the risks.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Lloyd\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s has 30% of the global market, Carnegie-Brown says, with 85% of the business coming from US firms. The insurance market is changing, he says. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153People are more concerned about cyber attack than a fire when it comes to the potential impact on their business.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Carnegie-Brown says he has been floating the idea in Davos that governments might use part of their aid budgets to insure poor developing countries against the cost of natural disasters. Lloyd\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s will pay out almost $5b to the US states affected by the three hurricanes last year but says the world as a whole is under-insured. Malala also warns that world leaders need to invest more in education, to help future generations. Malala Yousafzai, the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s youngest Nobel Prize winner, is speaking at Davos right now, about the importance of giving girls equal rights to education. She\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s explaining that education can play a key role in improving giving the message of equality. So what\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s your message to Trump on the issue of gender equality, asks Miriam Elder of Buzzfeed. Yousafzai says: I get so disappointed to see that people in these high positions openly talk against women, do not accept women as equals, they harass woman. It is just shocking to think that is is happening I hope that women stand up and speak out against it. I hope that people who are involved in such shameful things think about their own daughters, their own mothers, their own close female relations, and just imagine for a second, could they let it happen to them? I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think they would accept that. Malala, who was shot by the Taliban in 2012 after campaigning for girls education, says women must \u00e2\u20ac\u0153raise up their voice\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, and reach the ears and minds of those who still hold views which we hoped didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t exist any more Just in: chancellor Philip Hammond says he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u0153very happy\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd with the strength of sterling, which has hit its highest level since the Brexit vote. Foreign exchange rates are a big story at Davos, after America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Treasury secretary Stephen Mnuchin seemed to hint that Washington liked a weaker dollar Some of President\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s top officials are briefing the press again this morning. Commerce secretary Wilbur Ross is in combative mood, denying that America is protectionist - even though it just slapped new tariffs on washing machines and solar panels from Asia. Ross also says that America is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153more interested\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in bilateral trade deals than multilateral ones - which doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t bode very well for the ongoing NAFTA negotiations. John McDonnell, Labour\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shadow chancellor, is also in Davos, and bringing a warning for the global elite: McDonnell will be telling top business people and world leaders that they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re dangerously insulated from the problems outside WEF\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s security cordon and swanky parties: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Many of those attending the World Economic Forum have been patting themselves on the back as international growth figures have begun to pick up. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153But they should be worried. In the real world, outside the Davos bubble of Alpine restaurants and chalets, the global economic system they have built isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t working for billions of people. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153And just as Davos faces the risk of an avalanche this week, growth for a few risks a political and social avalanche unless there is fundamental change to our rigged economic system. Philip Hammond, the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chancellor of the Exchequer, is also at Davos. He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been giving his views about artificial intelligence at a Microsoft breakfast, saying: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We are at the point where computers move from being dumb and fast to being smart and fast.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Hammond says AI is going to be disruptive and managing the process is the key to it being accepted, warning: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153To many it will seem to be a big threat to their prosperity and livelihoods\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Losers would include members of the middle class but it was important to embrace the new technology rather than resist it. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Let\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not create a generation of 21st Century Luddites who feel the only chance of survival is to resist change.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Hammond said AI would affect the jobs market, would disrupt business models and had ethical dimensions including privacy and the way new technology could be used in wars. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The choice is simple: do we look inward or outward, look to the future or cleave to the past?\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Here are some photos of Donald Trump setting off to Davos last night: Good morning from Davos. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s another big day at the World Economic Forum, with Theresa May giving a keynote speech this afternoon \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and meeting Donald Trump on the sidelines. The UK PM is expected to put technology giants under pressure to clean up their act and tackle extreme content. She\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll say: Investors can make a big difference here by ensuring trust and safety issues are being properly considered. And I urge them to do so. These companies simply cannot stand by while their platforms are used to facilitate child abuse, modern slavery or the spreading of terrorist and extremist content.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Her meeting with Trump will be a chance to talk trade after Brexit, discuss terrorism, and perhaps patch up that Special Relationship after the row over the US embassy. As Beth Rigby from Sky News puts it: The two leaders are expected to focus on areas where there is common ground in international affairs: North Korea, as well as eradicating Islamic State in Syria and northern Iraq. They might touch on Iran. But the thornier issue of Russian aggression in Europe is less likely to be raised as the Prime Minister seeks to soothe relations and not stoke further tensions. President Trump set off for Davos last night - part of the biggest US delegation ever. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be hearing more from his team this morning. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also masses of other events, covering gender equality, financial stability, tax avoidance and climate change. Here are some highlights coming up today 9am Davos (8am UK): Malala Yousafzai on girls education 9.15am Davos: Debate: could rogue technology kill us all? 10.30am Davos: A speech by King Abdullah II of Jordan 11am Davos: Debate: How should leaders fighting climate change, with Greenpeace boss Jennifer Morgan and Al Gore 11am Davos: Debate: How to remake global finance, with IMF chief Christine Lagarde, chancellor Philip Hammond, US treasury secretary Steven Mnuchin, Larry Fink 2pm Davos: Special address by prime minister Theresa May 3pm Davos: Debate: Beyond the Paradise Papers: Can Global Tax Avoidance Be Stopped? 4pm Davos: A speech by Benjamin Netanyahu 6pm Davos: Are cryptocurrencies going to cause a financial crisis? 6.30pm Davos: A debate on global warming",

Sky has already said it will review Sky News's future if the bid is blocked.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n    <p>The second option is a spin-off or sale of Sky News. Before the Murdochs abandoned their 2011 bid for Sky \u00e2\u20ac\u201c which was derailed by the phone-hacking scandal \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the then culture secretary accepted a plan to publicly list Sky News.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p>The third option is to keep Sky News as part of Sky but to beef up its independence. Fox has already tabled a range of measures, or \u00e2\u20ac\u0153firewall\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd remedies, to broadcasting regulator Ofcom which the CMA is now using as the basis of further consultation. These include a commitment to maintaining investment in Sky News at current levels for a least five years, and establishing an editorial board with a majority of independent directors.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p>In June, Ofcom said this plan did mitigate media plurality concerns, but the then culture secretary said she would be \u00e2\u20ac\u0153reluctant\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to accept them as they did not \u00e2\u20ac\u0153fully remedy\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd the problem.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p>Fox now has an opportunity to submit improved remedies.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p>The CMA has until 1 May to deliver its final recommendation to the culture secretary, who then has 30 days to make his decision.</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>\u00e2\u20ac\u0153Sky is mostly the old-guard, traditional TV,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Sarah Simon of research firm Berenberg. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Disney may think it can create more value with its own direct-to-consumer platform than by holding a 39% stake in Sky.

Neil Wilson, senior market analyst at ETX Capital, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>US 10s [ten year bond yields] just hit 2.71%, while German bund yields are also on the march higher with the 5-year turning positive for the first time since 2015.

At this stage in the cycle it makes sense for yields to be climbing but breakout beyond the 30-year trend line does signal the bond bears are here at last. A spike to 3% in the 10-year now looks very possible and a bond market rout could spook the market. </p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5a6ee940e4b0d3de59ee3fc6\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-01-29T09:31:34.690Z\">9.31am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s central bank says it will keep a prudent and neutral monetary policy, but admits the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy still has problems, including high debt levels and the risks of an asset bubble.</p> <p>It added in its latest bulletin that it had the right conditions to keep the renminbi basically stable, and said a two way fluctuation in yuan rates would become the norm.<br></p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2018-01-29T09:39:40.371Z\">at 9.39am GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5a6ede6ae4b0530bd3483689\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-01-29T08:48:58.343Z\">8.48am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Julian Dunkerton, the co-founder of Superdry, is nearly \u00c2\u00a318m richer after selling part of his stake in the fashion retailer.</p> <p>Dunkerton, which is now the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s product and brand director, sold one million shares at the end of last week at \u00c2\u00a317.80 each.

ING foreign exchange strategist Viraj Patel says:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>In an action-packed week for global markets, the main event will be President Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s State of the Union address (Tueday 2100 ET) \u00e2\u20ac\u201c which is set to outline the administration\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 2018 policy agenda ahead of the pivotal November midterms. With US trade policy in particular focus, the burning question for investors is which type of Donald Trump will turn up: Dr Jekyll or Mr Hyde?</p> <p>While the former manifestation may have appealed to the international elite at Davos, we would not be entirely surprised to see the more fiery characteristics of the President surface back on home soil in Washington. Indeed, with President Trump fighting low approval ratings, fresh allegations that he wanted to fire Special Counsel Robert Mueller last year and with little policy progress to show (beyond the Tax Bill) \u00e2\u20ac\u201c there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s every chance that the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcAmerica First\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 policy talk has a protectionist sting in the tail this week. As such, we expect global risk sentiment to remain on red alert ahead of the speech \u00e2\u20ac\u201c with outside risks that USD/JPY could fall to the 107.00 level on a more contentious Trump State of the Union address.</p> <p>As for the dollar\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s broader trajectory, it will now be very difficult for Washington to put the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcweak dollar\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 genie back in the bottle. The damage is already done \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and with structural factors \u00e2\u20ac\u201c such as a late US economic cycle, relative US asset valuations and the twin current account and fiscal deficits \u00e2\u20ac\u201c all supporting a weaker dollar trend, the naturally tendency will be for the greenback to fall over the course of 2018. Add a US political and policy uncertainty premium into the mix \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and the dollar\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decline could transpire quicker than what we had initially expected.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5a6ecfdfe4b0d3de59ee3f4f\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-01-29T07:40:57.568Z\">7.40am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The weaker pound and euro are expected to give some support to stock markets when they open.:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/IGSquawk/status/957863725611929600\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">European Opening Calls:<a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/FTSE?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#FTSE</a> 7678 +0.16%<a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/DAX?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#DAX</a> 13378 +0.28%<a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/CAC?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#CAC</a> 5546 +0.31%<a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/MIB?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#MIB</a> 23899 +0.17%<a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/IBEX?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#IBEX</a> 10631 +0.34%</p>&mdash; IGSquawk (@IGSquawk) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/IGSquawk/status/957863725611929600?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">January 29, 2018</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5a6ec8bbe4b03d22f608b5cd\" class=\"block is-summary\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-01-29T07:38:51.845Z\">7.38am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Agenda: Currencies in focus as dollar strengthens</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business.</strong></p> <p>The dollar has been under pressure for some time now, and is set for its worst start to a year for around 30 years.

                "bodyText":"With the dollar recovering from its recent weakness, and continuing uncertainty over Brexit, the pound has come under pressure today and is currently 0.63% lower at $1.4080. Meanwhile bonds prices are falling and yields rising, as central banks increasingly look to move away from their low interest rate and QE programmes which have supported markets for several years now. German and US yields in particular have move sharply higher. In the US, the Federal Reserve\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s preferred measure of inflation - the PCE index - was in line with expections, up from 0.1% in November to 0.2% last month. But the savings rate fell to a more than 12 year low. Elsewhere the European Union has warned Donald Trump it is ready to retaliate on trade if the US tries to crack down on imports. And cryptocurrencies were back in the spotlight on concerns about a crackdown in Japan after hackers stole $400m from the Coincheck exchange. Finally, accountancy firm KPMG is to be investigated by the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Financial Reporting Council over its role in the collapse of construction group Carillion. On that note, it is time to close for the day. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be back tomorrow. With the recovery in the dollar, a decline in bond prices and a busy week ahead, US markets have slipped back from their record levels. As well as the Federal Reserve\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s latest interest rate setting meeting, there is the State of the Union address and a host of results from the likes of Apple, Alphabet, Facebook, Microsoft and Amazon. Apple is already weighing on the markets, following reports it would make half the number of planned iPhone Xs this quarter. So the Dow Jones Industrial Average has dropped 37 points or 0.15%, the S&amp;P 500 lost 0.26% and the Nasdaq Composite fell 0.32%. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our full report on the EU\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s warning to Donald Trump over trade. Daniel Boffey writes: Brussels has warned that it stands ready to retaliate and potentially open up a transatlantic trade war if the US delivers on apparent threats to restrict European imports. The US president, Donald Trump, claimed in an interview with ITV broadcast on Sunday that the EU had been \u00e2\u20ac\u0153very unfair\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd on American exporters, and that it would \u00e2\u20ac\u0153morph into something very big\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd that would \u00e2\u20ac\u0153turn out to be very much to [the EU\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s] detriment\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Washington is currently examining the case for protecting US economic interests on national security grounds, including the imposition of import tariffs on aluminium and steel. Responding to Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s comments, a spokesman for the European commission told reporters in Brussels that the EU was ready to hit back if its importers were made to suffer. The spokesman said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153For us trade policy is not a zero sum game. It is not about winners and losers. We here in the European Union believe that trade can and should be win-win. The full report is here: The latest set of US inflation figures have risen in December in line with forecasts. The personal consumption expenditures price index - it may be a mouthful but it is the Federal Reserve\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s preferred measure of inflation - climbed from 0.1% in November to 0.2% last month. On an annual basis it rose 1.5%, the same as in November. It is still below the Fed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 2% target. Meanwhile consumer spending increased by 0.4% last month, again in line with expectations. The November figure was revised upwards from an initial reading of 0.6% to 0.8%. Personal income rose 0.4%, up from 0.3% in November, while wages increased by 0.5%. The savings rate fell to 2.4% from 2.5% in November, the lowest level since September 2005. Stock markets are pretty steady at the moment, but will that last if bond yields continue to climb? On the weak pound, financial analyst Connor Campbell at Spreadex said: With little else to focus on investors turned their attention to Theresa May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s most recent bout of Tory turbulence, much to the pound\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s displeasure. The Prime Minister is dealing with the umpteenth swell of dissent over the state of her leadership, while at the same time having to try and quash the latest beef between her warring ministers, this round sparked by leaked Whatsapp messages from climate change minister Claire Perry calling Brexit voters \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcswivel-eyed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. Add onto that the Lords constitution committee labelling the EU withdrawal bill as \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcfundamentally flawed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 just one day before the legislation is set to be debated, alongside a warning from EU leaders that the UK is \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcnot ready\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 to secure a divorce deal, and there was plenty for the previously soaring pound to fret about. The pound continues to slip back against the dollar, and is now down 0.66% at $1.4074. Against the euro, sterling is down 0.32% at \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.1352. As well as the dollar\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s recovery, the pound is being hit by renewed Brexit uncertainty, after the continuing splits in the Conservative party and the prime minister\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s perceived weakness. President Trump said at Davos on Friday that he wanted free and fair trade, comments which did little to assuage fears of a possible trade war. Especially since they followed the imposition of tariffs on washing machines and solar panels from China and South Korea. Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK, said: President Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s speech on Friday did nothing to increase [concerns about a trade war], but neither did they assuage them. His comments that the US wanted free but \u00e2\u20ac\u0153fair\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd trade suggested that he would not be shy in confronting what he considered unfair trade practices, potentially putting him on a collision course with China, as well as the European Union. And here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a response from Europe: On a lighter note: Is this the end of the battle for the sunbed? Thomas Cook is offering holidaymakers the chance to pre-book sun loungers, eliminating the need for the dawn dash to the pool to bag one with a towel. For \u00e2\u201a\u00ac25, customers will be able to book a specific sun lounger for their entire holiday. The Anglo-German company says it is the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s first package holiday firm to offer this service, which it is trialling at three hotels in Lanzarote, Gran Canaria and Fuerteventura from the end of February. Customers will receive an email six days before departure asking if they would like to choose their sunbed in advance. They will be able to choose their preferred spot on a pool plan featuring a compass to help them work out what time of the day areas will be in the sun or shade. Read more here: The FTSE 100 is currently managing to stay in positive territory, just. But European markets have slipped back after a bright early start. The UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s leading index is up 0.13% while Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax has dipped 0.23% and France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac is down 0.07%. On Wall Street the Dow Jones Industrial Average is expected to open some 37 points lower, but Joshua Mahony, market analyst at IG, reckons US markets could generally be a better bet than European bourses. He said: The FTSE 100 [is] gaining ground thanks to a weaker pound and a strengthening price of copper. Rising copper prices have helped boost the commodity-heavy FTSE 100, with Anglo American, Glencore, Rio Tinto, and Antofagasta helping drive the index into the green. After last week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s losses, UK traders will hope that this will represent the beginning of a resurgence for the FTSE, yet with the dollar devaluation likely to drive the pound higher yet, it makes more sense to be long US markets over their European counterparts. Today sees a somewhat serene start to what is likely to be a fairly frantic week, with the second half providing a whole host of top tier economic data points to drive market sentiment. Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s state of the union address tomorrow sees the market focus shift back to US economic prospects, and with the potential for a raft of infrastructure projects around the corner, there is another good reason to be long US stocks. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the Reuters report on the earlier Chinese central bank comments: China will consider including shadow banking, property financing and internet financing in its macro-prudential assessment (MPA), central bank vice governor Yi Gang wrote on Monday, according to China Finance, a publication under the People\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Bank of China. The world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s second-biggest economy still has problems and hidden dangers as the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s debt levels are still high while asset bubble risks have not yet been fully contained, Yi wrote. The central bank will maintain prudent and neutral monetary policy while seeking to increase flexibility and effectiveness of liquidity management, Yi said. China has conditions to keep the yuan basically stable, Yi said, adding that the regulator will look to increase the yuan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s exchange rate flexibility. Back in the volatile world of cryptocurrencies, bitcoin is down 3.5% at $11,284 on fears of a further crackdown by regulators, this time in Japan. This follows news that one exchange, Coincheck, would refund around $400m to customers after hackers stole holdings in NEM, the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tenth biggest cryptocurrency. NEM is currently down around 8%. Fiona Cincotta at City Index said: This incident highlights one of the biggest concerns towards crypto currencies, namely security. The Japanese government have ordered Coincheck to beef up its security to prevent a repeat incident, as more authorities are clamping down on the virtual currency. Given the headline grabbing numbers, this hack is unlikely to disappear into headline history fast. Japan is one of the largest markets for cryptocurrency trading, accounting for around 30% -40% of global traded volume last month. Should this hack seriously dent confidence in virtual currencies, Bitcoin could see the selloff extended. Bond prices are coming under pressure on the growing signs that central banks are moving away from their low interest rate and QE programmes. With the US economy growing at 2.6% in the final quarter and the Bank of Japan governor saying inflation was close to reaching its target, US Treasury bonds fell and the yield [or interest rate] rose. In Europe comments over the weekend from Klass Knot, head of the Dutch central bank, that the ECB should clarify how it will end its asset purchases have also hit the bond market. Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s yield on its five year bonds has risen to 0.004%, the first time it has been in positive territory for more than three years. French and Dutch bond yields have climbed to their highest levels since July. Neil Wilson, senior market analyst at ETX Capital, said: US 10s [ten year bond yields] just hit 2.71%, while German bund yields are also on the march higher with the 5-year turning positive for the first time since 2015. It does look like this is capitulation time for bond bulls as yields are entering breakout mode, which will have important consequences for equity valuations. At this stage in the cycle it makes sense for yields to be climbing but breakout beyond the 30-year trend line does signal the bond bears are here at last. A spike to 3% in the 10-year now looks very possible and a bond market rout could spook the market. China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s central bank says it will keep a prudent and neutral monetary policy, but admits the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy still has problems, including high debt levels and the risks of an asset bubble. It added in its latest bulletin that it had the right conditions to keep the renminbi basically stable, and said a two way fluctuation in yuan rates would become the norm. Julian Dunkerton, the co-founder of Superdry, is nearly \u00c2\u00a318m richer after selling part of his stake in the fashion retailer. Dunkerton, which is now the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s product and brand director, sold one million shares at the end of last week at \u00c2\u00a317.80 each. That amounts to 1.23% of the company and still leaves him with more than 25%, making him its largest shareholder. Superdry shares have surged 20% over the past year but an update earlier this month saw them slip back after it revealed a 28% fall in half year profits. More on the collapse of construction group Carillion. Julia Kollewe reports: Accountancy firm KPMG is to be investigated by the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Financial Reporting Council over its role in the collapse of Carillion. The business secretary, Greg Clark, welcomed the investigation, which the accounting watchdog said followed inquiries made since Carillion\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shock profit warning in July. The FRC said it would conduct the investigation, which will cover 2014 to 2016, and additional audit work carried out during 2017, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153 as quickly and thoroughly as possible\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Carillion went into compulsory liquidation two weeks ago with debts of \u00c2\u00a31.3bn, a pension deficit of nearly \u00c2\u00a31bn and a host of unfinished public contracts. The full story is here: The move comes ahead of a select committee hearing tomorrow with the FRC, the Insolvency Service and Carillion pension trustees. MPs have already accused the Pensions Regulator of failing to act while Carillion racked up debts to pay dividends and executive bonuses, as the business built up a pension deficit that reached nearly \u00c2\u00a31bn by the time it collapsed this month. As expected, most European markets have opened in positive territory - just about - helped by the weakness of the pound and euro against the dollar. A weaker currency gives a boost to exporters, with the FTSE 100 in particular packed with overseas earners. The UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s leading index is up 0.14%, also benefiting from positive performances by mining groups after a 1% rise in the copper price. But drinks group Diageo, one of those which might be expected to benefit from a weaker pound, is down nearly 1% after a downgrade by analysts at RBC. Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax and France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac have climbed 0.1%, Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB is up 0.17% but Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ibex has dipped 0.2%. Despite the prospect of further US interest rate rises this year, ING Bank believes the dollar weakness is likely to continue (notwithstanding today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s move higher.) Apart from the US inflation data later and the two day Federal Reserve meeting which starts tomorrow, there is another big event which could have a major impact on the curreny. ING foreign exchange strategist Viraj Patel says: In an action-packed week for global markets, the main event will be President Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s State of the Union address (Tueday 2100 ET) \u00e2\u20ac\u201c which is set to outline the administration\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 2018 policy agenda ahead of the pivotal November midterms. With US trade policy in particular focus, the burning question for investors is which type of Donald Trump will turn up: Dr Jekyll or Mr Hyde? While the former manifestation may have appealed to the international elite at Davos, we would not be entirely surprised to see the more fiery characteristics of the President surface back on home soil in Washington. Indeed, with President Trump fighting low approval ratings, fresh allegations that he wanted to fire Special Counsel Robert Mueller last year and with little policy progress to show (beyond the Tax Bill) \u00e2\u20ac\u201c there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s every chance that the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcAmerica First\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 policy talk has a protectionist sting in the tail this week. As such, we expect global risk sentiment to remain on red alert ahead of the speech \u00e2\u20ac\u201c with outside risks that USD/JPY could fall to the 107.00 level on a more contentious Trump State of the Union address. As for the dollar\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s broader trajectory, it will now be very difficult for Washington to put the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcweak dollar\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 genie back in the bottle. The damage is already done \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and with structural factors \u00e2\u20ac\u201c such as a late US economic cycle, relative US asset valuations and the twin current account and fiscal deficits \u00e2\u20ac\u201c all supporting a weaker dollar trend, the naturally tendency will be for the greenback to fall over the course of 2018. Add a US political and policy uncertainty premium into the mix \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and the dollar\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decline could transpire quicker than what we had initially expected. The weaker pound and euro are expected to give some support to stock markets when they open.: Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. The dollar has been under pressure for some time now, and is set for its worst start to a year for around 30 years. Conversely US stock markets are making their best start for the same period, partly due to that very dollar weakness. Concerns that President Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tax reforms will add to the already hefty US deficit have undermined sentiment for the US currency, as has the prospect of a trade war which picked up pace last week as the US slapped tariffs on washing machines and solar panels from China and South Korea. Contrasting comments at Davos did not help. Treasury secretary Steve Mnuchin said he didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t mind a weak dollar, then Trump said virtually the opposite a day or so later. But the weakness in the dollar looks like it might be starting to attract some bargain hunters, with the currency regaining a little ground in Asia and edging higher in Europe. And although the Federal Reserve is expected to make no move on interest rates at this week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meeting - the swansong for Janet Yellen as Fed chair - further rises are expected this year. Later today come some US inflation figures which are likely to influence whether the dollar can hold onto its gains. Jasper Lawler at London Capital Group said: Investors will now look ahead to the release of US PCE [personal consumption expenditure] figures, the Fed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s preferred measure of inflation. Month on month inflation is expected to have increased 0.2% in December, from 0.1%. Meanwhile, on a annualised basis a constant reading of 1.5% is forecast. Given the ongoing concerns at the Fed over the sluggish inflation in the US, a higher reading this afternoon, could help cement the dollar\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bounce. At the moment the dollar\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s recovery has left the pound 0.28% lower at $1.4128 while against the euro sterling has dipped 0.1% to \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.1376. As well as being affected by the dollar\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s recovery, the pound is being undermined by renewed Brexit concerns, with peers saying the EU withdrawal bill needs to be withdrawn and the prime minister under growing pressure amid calls for the chancellor to be sacked. The US PCE figures are due at 1.30pm GMT, which is the main item on the economic agenda.",

The eurozone even grew faster than the U.S., which expanded by 2.3 percent.</p> <p>In the decade since 2007, the eurozone has had to grapple with one crisis after another, starting with the financial crash of 2008 that prompted the deepest worldwide recession since World War II. That exposed the weak underbelly of the eurozone the state of the public finances in a number of member economies. </p> <p>Four countries Greece, Ireland, Portugal and Cyprus had to be bailed out by their partners in the eurozone and the International Monetary Fund, and in return they made deep budget cuts to get their public finances into shape, hitting their economies hard.</p> <p>The Greek economy, for example, shed around a quarter of its output, and saw unemployment and poverty levels ratchet higher. </p> <p>It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s only recently that fears of a eurozone break-up have eased.

David Madden, market analyst at CMC Markets UK, says another factor for the US market decline is concern about what the Federal Reserve will say tomorrow at the end of its two day meeting: Profit taking is rife on Wall Street as the hefty declines last night has spooked traders and now the selling has intensified. Investors have been concerned about the US stock market being overbought for some time, and now it seems the jitters are setting in. The chatter is the Federal Reserve will raise growth and inflation expectations, and that is pushing up US government bond yields, which are now at a rate that is attractive to investors. The jump from stocks to bonds could continue until we hear from the US central bank tomorrow. The US dollar index has fallen to a three year low, and that is likely to lead to inflation as imports are tipped to become more expensive. The perception that inflation will rise is fuelling the rise in US government bond yields. Despite Goldman Sachs talking of a possible market correction, not everyone agrees. Joshua Mahony, market analyst at IG, says Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s State of the Union address later could give a renewed lift to flagging markets: The global stock selloff has persisted into a second day, with overnight losses in Asia giving way to widespread selling in Europe and the US. Interestingly, with gold and the yen gaining ground over recent weeks, there has clearly been an underlying risk-off move waiting to rear its head. However, with treasuries selling off throughout the beginning of 2018, there is reason to believe that market confidence will not be gone for long, as investors shift away from bonds amid improved economic and corporate performance... The focus is going to shift firmly onto the US from here on, as markets brace themselves for Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s State of the Union address. Despite the pause in the US equity rally, there is reason to believe that Trump could provide enough of a boost to see us back into the highs yet again. Talk of a $1.5 trillion infrastructure package may simply be words for now, but with the tax reforms passed, there is a growing belief that Donald Trump can finally deliver. Away from the markets, and Bank of England governor Mark Carney is appearing in front of the House of Lords economic affairs committee. He is being quizzed on forecasting (timely, given the latest Brexit forecast confusion). My colleague Andrew Sparrow is monitoring Carney\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s performance in the politics live blog here: As markets continue to wobble, Spreadex financial analyst Connor Campbell said: The US open was not a welcome sight for the European indices, with an ugly start from the Dow Jones infecting the FTSE et al. The Dow Jones plunged a stomach-churning 300 points after the bell, hitting an 8 day low of just under 26150 as investors stared down the barrel of an incredibly hectic rest of the week. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the unknown of this evening\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s State of the Union address from Donald Trump; the first Fed meeting of the year on Wednesday, with rising bond yields suggesting something hawkish; and a non-farm Friday that may become even more important than normal dependant on what the central bank say mid-week. Interestingly the dollar, which had been mounting something of a comeback as recent as this morning, completely gave up the ghost this Tuesday afternoon. Having at one point fallen below $1.40, cable jumped 0.4% to re-cross $1.41, while against the euro the greenback shed 0.3%, allowing the single currency back above $1.24. All this spelt disaster for the European indices. The FTSE plunged 70 points, falling below 7600 for the first time in more than a month. The DAX and CAC, meanwhile, dropped 0.8% apiece, hitting 13210 and 5475 respectively. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is now down 300 points, which puts it on course for its biggest one day fall since May last year. Added to Monday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 177 point decline, it would be the biggest two day points fall since June 2016 after Britain voted to leave the EU. US consumer confidence remains strong, according to a new report from the Conference Board. Its confidence index climbed to 125.4 in January from 1 revised figure of 123.1 in the previous month. Analysts had been expecting 123.1. (The survey was taken before this week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decline on Wall Street of course.) The decline on Wall Street has meant the falls in Europe have accelerated. The FTSE 100 is now down nearly 1%, Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax has dropped 0.9% and France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac has fallen 0.8%. Trevor Greetham, head of multi asset at Royal London Asset Management, said: Global stock markets dipped on Tuesday on concerns about rising US interest rates and high equity valuations. This sell-off doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t come as a surprise. Investor sentiment has been getting very frothy, with our composite sentiment indicator hitting its highest reading since March 2017 this week. The recent increase in share prices has been powered by the prospect of large corporate tax cuts in America so it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s noteworthy that US company directors have started to sell shares in their own companies in large numbers. With expectations running high, we think the sell-off may have further to run and we reduced our exposure to equities in our multi asset funds yesterday, although we still remain overweight stocks. With the world economy strong and interest rates low, we would probably buy a more pronounced dip. The worst performer in the Dow is, unsurprisingly, United Healthcare: And here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our report on the new healthcare partnership causing all the fuss: US markets have come under renewed pressure, as investors face the prospect of rising interest rates and the withdrawal of central banks\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 bond buying programmes. With bond prices falling ahead of the latest Federal Reserve decision (no move is expected yet but there is a growing expectation of at least three more rises this year) the Dow Jones Industrial Average has fallen 230 points or 0.9% in early trading. After Monday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 177 point fall, that would mark the first two day decline since December. But bear in mind, US markets had hit new peaks as recently as Friday. Meanwhile the S&amp;P 500 opened 0.8% lower and the Nasdaq Composite fell just over 1%. Neil Wilson, senior market analyst at ETX Capital, said: The rise in global sovereign bond yields has unsettled investors and hit riskier assets. US 10s are holding above 2.7%, while the 30-year T note is approaching 3%. Certainly the dynamics have shifted in bond markets. Central banks are either out of the market or buying fewer bonds. The Fed is now in the business of selling not buying. The ECB seems to be teeing up a short taper that could see QE end in September, which is a shade earlier than most anticipated back in December. The BoJ is also tilting towards normalisation, albeit much more slowly. Earlier this week Goldman Sachs warned of a possible market correction. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Whatever the trigger, a correction of some kind seems a high probability in the coming months,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Peter Oppenheimer, the bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chief global equity strategist. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153[But] the continuation of low core inflation and easy monetary policy suggests that a correction is more likely than a bear market.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd A sharp decline in healthcare stocks is also hitting the market today, after Amazon, Warren Buffett and JP Morgan teamed up to form their own healthcare partnership. Ahead of Wall Street opening, Lukman Otunuga, research analyst at FXTM, said: Global equity bulls failed to make an appearance during Tuesday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trading session as higher U.S. bond yields and caution ahead of the Federal Reserve meeting weighed heavily on sentiment. World shares were under renewed selling pressure today with Asian shares tumbling lower during early trade, following Wall Street\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s steep declines overnight. In Europe, equities tumbled amid the lack of appetite for risk. With Wall Street suffering its largest drop in more than four months on Monday, U.S. stocks could remain pressured by the negative sentiment this afternoon. The eurozone has posted its strongest growth in a decade. The region grew by 2.5% last year, the best performance since the financial crisis. Economists think Europe is going to have another good year. France and Spain led the way. France racked up its fastest growth since 2011, thanks to stronger business spending, while Spain notched up another year of 3%+ growth. But in the UK, new figures show that consumers racked up more credit last month. Mortgage approvals fell to a near three-year low. Over in America, Amazon is piling into the health market in partnership with JP Morgan and Berkshire Hathaway. Shares in healthcare firms are down heavily in pre-market trading. European markets in the red, amid speculation that shares could be heading for a correction. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s going to get worse when Wall Street opens in half an hour... PwC also made this chart, showing how the eurozone outperformed other major economies last year: Getting back to the eurozone growth figures...Barret Kupelian, senior economist at PwC, says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The good news keeps on coming from the Eurozone, which grew at a quarterly rate of 0.6% in the last quarter of 2017. Even though this is slightly slower than the previous quarter, the fuller picture for 2017 is overwhelmingly positive, with growth in the Eurozone ahead of the UK, US and Japan. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Taking a more historical look at the growth track record of large advanced economies, the Eurozone can now boast holding the title of the fastest growing large advanced economy four times since the financial crisis compared to three times for the US and the UK and once for Japan. PwC also expect the eurozone to do well in 2018, unless any \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcmajor unexpected shocks\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 hit the global economy. Kupelian says: In our main scenario projection, we expect the Eurozone to grow by at least 2%, marking its strongest two-year streak since the global financial crisis.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd More here. Economists are continuing to welcome today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s French GDP figures, which showed a strong pick-up in business investment. This is from Emily Mansfield of the Economist Intelligence Unit (GFCF = gross fixed capital formation, or the purchase of new assets) Nikolay Markov, senior economist at Pictet Asset Management, hopes this trend will continue: The selloff continues! Wall Street is heading for a second day of losses, as heathcare companies are hit by the surprise arrival of Amazon in their sector... Investors in US healthcare firms may need a lie-down, possibly with a cold flannel.... In other news....retail giant Amazon, Warren Buffett\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Berkshire Hathaway and Wall Street titan JPMorgan have announced a curious tie-up. The three companies are going to create a not-for-profit company to give their own staff high-quality and transparent healthcare. Veteran investor Warren Buffett suggests the trio are keen to shake up the way healthcare is provided in America. Buffett says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The ballooning costs of healthcare act as a hungry tapeworm on the American economy. Our group does not come to this problem with answers. But we also do not accept it as inevitable. Rather, we share the belief that putting our collective resources behind the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s best talent can, in time, check the rise in health costs while concurrently enhancing patient satisfaction and outcomes.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Pan Pylas of Associated Press has a good take on today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s growth figures: The eurozone economy, for so long a source of uncertainty, has enjoyed its best year in a decade, clear evidence it has broken out of its prolonged and acute debt crisis that raised fears about the very survival of the euro currency. In its first estimate for the fourth quarter, Eurostat, the European Union\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s statistics agency, said Tuesday that the eurozone expanded by 0.6 percent in the October-December period from the three months before. That more-than-healthy level of growth means that for the whole of 2017, the eurozone economy expanded by 2.5 percent, its best performance since 2007, when it grew 3 percent. The eurozone even grew faster than the U.S., which expanded by 2.3 percent. In the decade since 2007, the eurozone has had to grapple with one crisis after another, starting with the financial crash of 2008 that prompted the deepest worldwide recession since World War II. That exposed the weak underbelly of the eurozone the state of the public finances in a number of member economies. Four countries Greece, Ireland, Portugal and Cyprus had to be bailed out by their partners in the eurozone and the International Monetary Fund, and in return they made deep budget cuts to get their public finances into shape, hitting their economies hard. The Greek economy, for example, shed around a quarter of its output, and saw unemployment and poverty levels ratchet higher. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s only recently that fears of a eurozone break-up have eased. Greece, notably, is set to emerge from its bailout era this summer, eight years after it first faced potential bankruptcy. Another chart showing how the eurozone outpaced its major rivals last year: ING\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Bert Colijn is also impressed that the eurozone grew by 2.5% during 2017. He writes: Economic growth has shifted to a substantially faster growth path over the course of 2017, and current GDP data confirms that. Eurozone growth for 2017 as a whole was stronger than many advanced markets, like the US and UK for example. While detailed breakdowns have yet to be released, it seems that the Eurozone economy continues to fire on all cylinders. Investment has yet to recover from the crisis fully but has been an essential contributor to growth during the year. However, Colijn is also concerned that the strong euro could hold back growth in 2018 (as exports will be less competitive) Analysts at Ulster Bank are hopeful that the eurozone will continue to grow robustly in 2018. Jacob Deppe, Head of Trading at online trading platform, Infinox, is impressed by Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s growth last year: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Anything the US economy can do the Eurozone economy can do, slightly better it seems. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This is the best economic growth the Eurozone has seen since before the Global Financial Crisis. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Where we go from here is anyone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s guess. But with both the US and Eurozone growing in tandem and with Asian economies on a roll, the hope is that 2018 delivers continued growth, further confidence and economic stability for the first time in a decade. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153There remain issues on the horizon. Unemployment in the Eurozone, while falling, is still too high, particularly among the young. We now have confirmation that Europe and America both grew much faster than Britain last year. Economists Rupert Seggins has tweeted a handy chart: Aila Mihr of Danske Bank says Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy is expanding strongly: NEWSFLASH: The eurozone and the wider EU have both posted their strongest annual growth since the financial crisis. New GDP figures from Eurostat confirm that the European recovery remains on track, with annual growth of 2.5% during 2017 in the EU and the narrower single currency block. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the strongest annual growth in a decade. In comparison, the UK grew by around 1.8% during 2017 (according to figures released last week) Eurostat also reports that the eurozone and the EU both grew by 0.6% in the final three months of 2017, partly thanks to France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 0.6% growth and Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 0.7%. Compared to Q4 2016, seasonally adjusted GDP rose by 2.7% in the euro area and by 2.6% in the EU28. In another boost, Eurozone and EU growth in the third quarter of last year has been revised up, from +0.6% to +0.7%. There may be some celebrations in Brussels as this data filters through. Three years ago, the eurozone was being rocked by the Greek debt crisis. Now, the region is looking calmer and more secure, despite Brexit. Over in Frankfurt, the European Central Bank might feel vindicated after launching a massive stimulus programme to ward off deflation, drive down unemployment and keep the economy growing. Economists are concerned by the rise in UK consumer borrowing: Breaking; The number of new mortgages approved in Britain has hit its lowest in almost three years. Just 61,039 mortgages were signed off in December, a drop of over 3,000 compared to November. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the smallest number since January 2015. Bank of England figures also show that UK consumers borrowed an extra \u00c2\u00a31.5bn on credit last month. That pushed the annual growth in credit to 9.5%, up from 9.3%. So, people are finding it harder to buy a new house, and borrowing more on credit to make ends meet. Not a good sign for the UK economy in 2018. Poland\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy accelerated last year, according to new data. Poland\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s GDP expanded by 4.6% in 2017, up from 2.9% in 2016. Mining companies are leading the selloff today: Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s major stock markets have all fallen this morning, despite the solid growth figures from France and Spain. The UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE 100, the German DAX and the French CAC are all in the red, following last night\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s losses on Wall Street. The selloff in government bonds in recent days is starting to spook the equity markets, encouraging traders to sell shares. Markets have had a strong run, of course, but analysts are wondering whether a selloff is imminent. Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tax cuts are likely to push US inflation higher, especially if more firms pass savings onto their staff in pay rises. That in turn increases the chance of US interest rates moving up. Yesterday, Goldman Sachs predicted that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a correction of some kind seems a high probability in the coming months.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Some reaction to the Spanish growth data: Newsflash: Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy grew by 0.7% in the final quarter of 2017. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a slight slowdown, following 0.8% growth in July-September, but still a decent performance. It should make Spain one of the faster-growing European members. Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy grew by 3.1% during 2017, matching 2016\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s performance, according to the INE statistics body. The last few months of 2017 were dominated by the Catalonian independence crisis, as the region tried to break away from Madrd. Update: the pound is slipping lower. The most encouraging part of the French growth report is that business investment has risen sharply. This means French firms have boosted their spending on equipment, offices and factories - a sign that they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re more confident about their future prospects. Fred Ducrozet of Swiss bank Pictet says it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcbig story\u00e2\u20ac\u2122: Brexit worries are weighing on the pound again this morning. Sterling has shed half a cent against the US dollar, to $1.402, after leaked government papers showed that Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy would be worse off under all three likely Brexit scenarios. My colleague Rowena Mason explains: The document suggested that chemicals, clothing, manufacturing, food and drink, and cars and retail would be the hardest hit and every UK region would also be affected negatively in all the modelled scenarios, with the north-east, the West Midlands and Northern Ireland facing the biggest falls in economic performance. France is benefitting from President Emmanuel Macron\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s election win and the upturn in the global economy, says Bloomberg. They add: Macron\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s government is currently working with unions and business lobbies to overhaul France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s job training system, and will move on to unemployment insurance in coming months. Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire plans a major economy law for the spring that aims to further loosen restrictions on businesses, as well as increase profit-sharing plans for employees. Newsflash: France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy grew by 0.6% in the last three months. Strong business investment and rising exports boosted growth, and compensated for a slowdown in household spending. This means France slightly outpaced Britain, which grew by 0.5% in the last quarter. Statistics body INSEE says: Total gross fixed capital formation (business investment) accelerated slightly to +1.1% after +0.9% Household consumption expenditure slowed down (+0.3% after +0.6%). Foreign trade balance contributed positively to GDP growth (+0.6 points after \u00e2\u02c6\u20190.5 points): exports accelerated markedly (+2.6% after +1.1%) while imports slowed down sharply (+0.7% after +2.4%). Inventory changes made a negative contribution (\u00e2\u02c6\u20190.5 points after +0.3 points). The figures also show that France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy expanded by 1.9% during 2017 - the strongest annual growth since 2011. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Today we learn if Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economic recovery is on track. New eurozone growth figures, due at 10am GMT, are expected to show that the single currency bloc expanded by 0.6% in October-December. That would be another solid quarter, as the region puts the debt crisis behind it. Individual figures from France (in a moment) and Spain will also give some country-level insights. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll also be watching the markets closely. Yesterday, government bond prices fell (pushing up bond yields), fuelling fears that the bull market might be over. Wall Street suffered losses last night, and European markets are expected to drop this morning. Jasper Lawler of London Capital Group explains: After such a promising end to last week where the Dow rallied 200 points to a fresh record close, trading on Monday couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have been more different. US stocks experienced a spectacular reversal and plummeted overnight, as the US 10 year treasury yield pushed relentlessly higher. Concerns are starting to enter the market that inflation could be catching up and higher interest rates could pour cold water on the bull run. As the US treasury bond sell off depended, US treasury yields shot up to a peak of 2.73%, the highest level since 2014.The Dow dumped 177 points in its worst trading day so far this year and the S&amp;P dived 0.7%. Plus, new UK consumer credit figures will show if Britons melted their credit cards last month, or reined in spending. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the agenda: 6.30am GMT: French GDP for Q4 2017 (first estimate) 8am GMT: Spanish GDP for Q 2017 (first estimate 9.30am: UK consumer credit and mortgage approval figures for December 2017 10am: Eurozone GDP for Q4 2017 (first estimate)",
