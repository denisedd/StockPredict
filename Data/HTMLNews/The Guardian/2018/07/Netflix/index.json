So at face value, the latest slip in average earnings (ex bonuses) to 2.7% may appear disappointing.</p> <p>However, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s worth noting that, like last month\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fall, this is mainly a function of base effects. Wage growth was particularly weak in early 2017, but began to recover from the second quarter \u00e2\u20ac\u201c meaning the year-on-year growth rates are beginning to ease. Admittedly the recent momentum has slipped a little too. But with Bank of England Agents still pointing to skill shortages resulting in more rapid pay increases, we doubt the recent figures will lead to any kind of rethink amongst the committee on the overall trend for wages.</p> <p>With employment growth also reasonably solid, Tuesday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s jobs report gives the Bank another green light to hike in August. We doubt the few remaining data points between now and the next meeting will do much to change this. And even though the political scene has become particularly noisy, the Parliamentary recess that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s due to start in a matter of days should (in theory) create a brief period of calm, giving the Bank enough cover to hike in August.</p> <p>However, when it comes to Brexit, the bigger headache for the Bank of England could come beyond August. With the EU likely to remain resistant to the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s latest proposals, the perceived risk of a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153no deal\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd could feasibly increase (even if the actual probability of this happening remains low in our view).</p> <p>If Brexit uncertainty picks up as time starts to run out, we think the Bank could have a tricky time hiking rates later this year.

                "bodyText":"Bank of England governor Mark Carney has told MPs that a no-deal Brexit would have \u00e2\u20ac\u0153big\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd economic consequences and could prompt a review of interest rates. The Bank is widely expected to raise rates early next month, although it is by no means a certainty. The latest UK data shows unemployment steady at 4.2% but wage growth slipping back to 2.5%. While it is still above the latest 2.4% inflation rate, that could change tomorrow if - as expected - the year on year June figure rises to 2.6%. Meanwhile the government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s budget watchdog has said the outlook for the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s finances has become gloomier, partly because a proposed increase in NHS spending is not paid for with tax increases or cuts in spending elsewhere. On the markets, Brexit uncertainty is rattling the pound but share indices are little changed. On that note, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time to close for the day. Thanks for your comments, and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be back tomorrow. US markets have slipped back at the start of the day\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trading. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 0.14%, while the S&amp;P 500 opened 0.32% lower and the Nasdaq Composite fell 0.7%, as the disappointing Netflix update weighed on the market and sent the streaming service\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shares down around 14%. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Investec\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chief economist on the pound: The latest Brexit uncertainties have sent the pound to its lowest levels of the day. Against the dollar it is down around 0.7% at $1.3146 while against the euro it has fallen 0.43% to \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.1245. Over in New York, Goldman Sachs has confirmed that Lloyd Blankfein will step down as chairman and chief executive, the positions he has held since 2006. He will be replaced in both roles by co-chief operating officer David Solomon, who has a sideline as DJ D-Sol, spinning dance music at nightclubs. Meanwhile Goldman reported a better than expected 44% in second quarter net income, boosted by good performances in investment banking and bond trading. Bank of England governor Mark Carney has said a no-deal Brexit would have big economic consequences and prompt a review of interest rates, as well as leaving many bankers idle, reports Reuters: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Our job is to make sure we are as prepared as possible,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Carney told lawmakers at a parliamentary hearing held at an air show in Farnborough, southern England. Crashing out would prompt the BoE\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s monetary policy committee to reassess the economic outlook and interest rates. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It would be a material event. I wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t prejudge in which direction, though,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Carney said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Speaking very narrowly about the financial services side, in the event of a no-deal scenario... there would be big economic consequences. We might have a lot of idle bankers as there is not a lot of demand for their services,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Carney said. Lenders, insurers and asset managers in Britain are playing safe and opening new EU hubs by March to maintain links with customers there irrespective of whether a transition deal of generous future trading terms are secured. But they worry that without a transition deal, existing cross-border contracts such as derivatives and insurance policies would be disrupted, leaving consumers unable to make claims or companies not covered against adverse moves in currencies or borrowing costs. Britain has said it will legislate to ensure \u00e2\u20ac\u0153continuity\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in contracts and that the EU must reciprocate, but the bloc says it was up to banks and not public authorities to get ready. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Yes, we are concerned that the EU has not yet indicated its solution. The private sector cannot solve these issues,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Carney said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This is fundamentally about taking responsibility to protect the financial system... It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s cold comfort, but it will be worse in Euorpe than it is here.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s banks, however, hold enough capital and cash reserves to withstand a disorderly Brexit, Carney said... Carney said it was too soon to judge what the government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s [Brexit] proposals meant for financial services or for the BoE\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ability to take all decisions necessary to keep the financial system and banks stable. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s premature for us to make a judgement on the White Paper and the outcome of these negotiations. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also not clear which activities are going to be in scope,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Carney said. The White Paper was a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153first step\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in a hugely important negotiation, he added. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our story on the day\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s UK data: The rate of pay growth for British workers has fallen to the lowest level in six months, despite record numbers of people in work across the country, official figures show. Heaping renewed pressure on the Bank of England to delay raising interest rates from as early as August, the latest snapshot for the British labour market showed workers are still unable to demand higher pay despite the lowest unemployment levels since the mid-1970s. High rates of employment and low levels of unemployment usually signal rising wages. The Office for National Statistics said average weekly earnings rose by 2.5% on the year in the three months to May, slowing down from the previous three months when they grew by 2.6%. Pay growth excluding bonuses also slowed by a similar amount to 2.7%. There have been signs of recovery in the British economy that could tempt the Bank to raise interest rates from as early as next month to counter persistently high levels of inflation since the EU referendum two years ago. Having shuddered to a standstill during the freezing weather earlier this year, the economy rebounded in May thanks to warmer weather and the royal wedding. The Bank has previously said it would raise rates should the economy continue to improve. The full report is here: The pound is now virtually flat against the dollar, and the FTSE 100 has dipped just 0.15% in the wake of the latest UK data. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said: The UK jobs report failed to move the needle on Tuesday, with investors seemingly waiting for Wednesday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s inflation reading before making a call on what the Bank of England might do in August. For the quarter to the end of May wage growth including bonuses came in at 2.5%, down on the 2.6% seen for the previous 3 months; remove bonuses and wages still saw a similar decline, from 2.8% to 2.7%. Though a smidge higher than the 2.4% inflation reading seen for the same period, real wages are hardly healthy at the moment, especially with the UK CPI set to jump back to 2.6% in June. So, not the most hawkish news, if not particularly dovish either, leaving the pound without much reason to rebound on Tuesday... With Brent Crude slipping 0.7%, and BP shedding another half a percent, there was little reason for the FTSE to move higher as the day went on, the UK index keeping the wrong side of 7600. Elsewhere the UK Office for Budget Responsibility has warned on the state of the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s finances. Reuters reports: Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s budget watchdog on Tuesday outlined a gloomier picture for the government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s finances in the long term, reflecting recent pledges to increase health spending without tax hikes or spending cuts to pay for it. The Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) stuck to its view that the public finances are likely to come under significant pressure from an aging population. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The long-term outlook for the public finances is less favourable than at the time of our last (fiscal sustainability report) in January 2017,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd the OBR said in its report. This was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153more than explained\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd by the government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s health spending announcement in June. Last month Prime Minister Theresa May announced a 4 billion pound ($5.3 billion) boost for the National Health Services, to be funded in part by a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Brexit dividend\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd that the Institute for Fiscal Studies says does not exist. Finance minister Philip Hammond has indicated that taxpayers will need to foot some of the bill. The OBR also looks at falling immigration: Even if the Bank of England does raise rates in August, the Brexit uncertainty casts some doubt on further increases, reckons economist James Smith at ING Bank: For the Bank of England, rising wage growth is a key pillar of its rate hike rationale. So at face value, the latest slip in average earnings (ex bonuses) to 2.7% may appear disappointing. However, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s worth noting that, like last month\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fall, this is mainly a function of base effects. Wage growth was particularly weak in early 2017, but began to recover from the second quarter \u00e2\u20ac\u201c meaning the year-on-year growth rates are beginning to ease. Admittedly the recent momentum has slipped a little too. But with Bank of England Agents still pointing to skill shortages resulting in more rapid pay increases, we doubt the recent figures will lead to any kind of rethink amongst the committee on the overall trend for wages. With employment growth also reasonably solid, Tuesday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s jobs report gives the Bank another green light to hike in August. We doubt the few remaining data points between now and the next meeting will do much to change this. And even though the political scene has become particularly noisy, the Parliamentary recess that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s due to start in a matter of days should (in theory) create a brief period of calm, giving the Bank enough cover to hike in August. However, when it comes to Brexit, the bigger headache for the Bank of England could come beyond August. With the EU likely to remain resistant to the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s latest proposals, the perceived risk of a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153no deal\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd could feasibly increase (even if the actual probability of this happening remains low in our view). If Brexit uncertainty picks up as time starts to run out, we think the Bank could have a tricky time hiking rates later this year. After an August hike, our current expectation is that the BoE remains on hold until May 2019. On interest rates, Bank of England governor Mark Carney said at Farnborough a no-deal Brexit would be a material event for borrowing costs. Reuters reports: Bank of England Governor Mark Carney said on Tuesday it would be a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153material event\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd for interest rates if Britain leaves the European Union next year without a deal to smooth its departure. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Our job is to make sure we are as prepared as possible,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Carney told lawmakers at a parliamentary hearing held at an air show in Farnborough, southern England. Carney said he could not predict which direction rates would move in the event of a no-deal Brexit. It was too soon to judge the government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s proposals for Brexit published earlier this month, Carney said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I am stopping short of saying it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s all there [in the Brexit white paper],\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said. Carney also said that after Brexit, the Bank needed to retain its ability to regulate banks to maintain financial stability. With the slip in wage growth to 2.5%, any increase in inflation tomorrow could see real incomes squeezed again. Analysts are forecasting inflation could rise from 2.4% to 2.6%. Ed Monk, associate director for Personal Investing at Fidelity International said: While today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s figures may put wage growth above last month\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s CPI inflation reading for May, any reason for British households to cheer could be short lived as there is a possibility that we could see inflation jump back up and over take wage growth when June\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s CPI figure is released tomorrow. If inflation does jump back up after this weakening in pay growth, then it adds to the conundrum for the Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Monetary Policy Committee who are desperate to deliver a rate hike in August\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s MPC meeting. Higher inflation would support that position but an absence of sustained real wage growth as well as ongoing fears about the impact that Brexit will have on the UK economy means that we could see the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcunreliable boyfriend\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 make an appearance again if Mark Carney and the central bank is forced to make another U-turn come August. At the Treasury committee meeting, Bank of England governor Mark Carney says he is concerned the European Union has not yet indicated its solution to continuity in derivatives contracts after Brexit. He said that a no-deal Brexit would have big economic consequences. But he said it was possible that an increase in financial services business from emerging markets could make up for any loss of EU activity. And he believed the UK banking sector was appropriately capitalised even for a disorderly Brexit. (Courtesy Reuters) They have given up trying to stream the Treasury Select committee from Farnborough: Not everyone believes an August rate rise is a done deal, however. Ben Brettell, senior economist at Hargreaves Lansdown, says: Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s numbers showed wage growth dipped slightly in the three months to May, to 2.7% excluding bonuses and 2.5% including them. Unemployment held steady at an ultra-low 4.2%, but the claimant count \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the number of people claiming out-of-work benefits rose unexpectedly by almost 8,000. In a quirk of the data this number is a month more recent than the rest of the report, so could spell tougher times ahead. Both sterling and the FTSE were little changed after the data was released. All in all these numbers don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t alter the economic picture of anaemic growth, a relatively tight labour market and under-control inflation. Markets are still expecting the Bank of England to raise interest rates in August. But given the increasingly uncertain climate I think there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a real chance policymakers will sit on their hands and wait for firmer signals the economy is on the right track before risking raising borrowing costs. The jobs and wages figures will probably not deter the Bank of England from raising interest rates in August, says Jeremy Thomson-Cook, chief economist at WorldFirst: At least one part of the UK economy is showing strength with employment hitting fresh 47 year highs in May. Slowing wage growth is unlikely to shade expectations that the Bank of England will raise interest rates on August 2nd although tomorrow\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s inflation numbers are expected to show that the real wage gains that consumers have been receiving for a few months now may peter out soon courtesy of higher oil prices and a weaker pound. Here is a chart showing the slip in wages growth: And the increase in employment: And the unemployment rate: While the stream is down from Farnborough, over to the day\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s big UK data release. Wages growth slipped to its weakest level in six months, rising by 2.5% in the three months to May compared to a 2.6% increase in the previous three months. Pay excluding bonuses came in at 2.7%. These were in line with analyst forecasts, and are above the inflation rate of 2.4%. The unemployment rate remained at 4.2%, while 137,000 jobs were created over the three months to May. Nicky Morgan now moves on to Brexit and derivatives, but the answers are impossible to hear. And the live stream has now died...... And we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re off (with a rather poor audio signal from Farnborough). Chair Nicky Morgan asks about cyber attacks on the financial system as well as internal bank problems such as TSB and VIsa experienced. However the signal keeps cutting out making the answers difficult to get... The session with the Bank will be streamed live here. The Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s financial stability report for June - which is what Carney and Co will be talking about shortly - warned that the EU was not doing enough to prevent disrupution to the financial system after Brexit. It said material risks remained to trillions of pounds worth of contracts. Is the pound likely to take more notice of the economic data, or the current political uncertainty? Kit Juckes at Societe Generale says: The contrast between the economy, which fully justifies the market\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s belief that rates will rise in August, the politics, which is a shambles, is ever more striking. The Prime Minister has sacrificed aspect of her \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcsoft Brexit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 strategy to get legislation through parliament, relying on Brexiteer Labour MPs in the process and damaging her own support in the process. Labour strategists are dreaming that she\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll make the Conservatives unelectable for a decade or more. But does it matter for the pound? In the short run, the data probably matter more. In the long run, it just keeps sterling anchored near historic trade-weighted lows. Investors are clearly taking a back seat as trading begins in Europe. Markets have made an unconvincing start, with the FTSE 100 losing 0.07%, Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax up 0.05%, France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac down 0.1% and Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ibex 0.03% lower. Despite a fairly pedestrian trading update, Royal Mail is leading the FTSE 100 risers, up 1.7%. But Paddy Power Betfair has lost 2% following a sell note from analysts at Investec. More on the forthcoming UK data. Jasper Lawler, head of research at London Capital Group, said: Brexit woes continue to keep the pound range bound, with too may uncertainties still unresolved regarding Brexit; deal or no deal and even over whether Theresa May will be able to cling onto power through the week. However, the UK economic calendar provides at least some distraction from Brexit concerns, this week, although it may not all be good news. UK data out today is not expected to do much to support the downbeat pound, with the employment report forecast to paint a mixed picture of the labour market... UK unemployment is expected to remain constant at 4.2%, and 115k jobs are expected to have been created in the three months to May. Wage growth is expected to remain constant and earnings including bonuses is forecast to have slipped to 2.7% from 2.8% in April. The immediate concern for the BoE will be wage growth, particularly given that inflation also continued to decline. These figures are hardly likely to encourage the BoE to vote to tighten monetary policy when it meets in two weeks\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 time. With rate hike expectations siting at around 70%, this probability could find it is under pressure and pull sterling towards $1.31, should wages surprise to the downside. On the other hand, should the data reinforce the central bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s theory that the slow down in the economy was just in the first quarter and that activity is picking up again in the second quarter, the pound could look to target the 50-day moving average at $1.3320. At the moment sterling is up around 0.17% at $1.3256. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. With Brexit concerns continuing, the latest comments from Bank of England governor Mark Carney will be monitored carefully this morning. Carney and a number of colleagues - Andrew Bailey, Sir Jon Cunliffe and Elisabeth Stheeman - will be giving evidence on the Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s financial stability report to the Treasury select committee. Not in parliament as usual but at Farnborough, so at least they will be able to do a bit of plane spotting too. The subject of Brexit will inevitably come up, and Carney will no doubt end up commenting on the prospects for a UK interest rate rise in August. Shortly after Carney and Co begin, there will be more UK data which should help give a little more guidance for the Bank in the shape of unemployment and wages figures. Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK, said: The Bank of England will get a final look at how well the UK economy is doing this week starting today with the latest unemployment and wages data. Since the Bank of England deferred a decision on raising rates in May the UK economy has rebounded strongly from the slowdown seen in Q1 with a strong performance seen across all the major sectors, raising expectations that the monetary policy committee may coalesce around a majority decision to raise rates in just over a couple of weeks\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 time. This week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s data could go some further in raising these expectations or dash them completely, unless Bank of England governor Mark Carney performs another one of his reverse ferrets this morning and pours cold water on the prospect when he speaks in Farnborough today, just prior to the release of this morning\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s data. Despite all the recent reports of job losses in the retail sector, thus far we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve seen little evidence of an impact in the headline unemployment numbers, though that could change in the coming months. For now, unemployment is expected to remain unchanged at 4.2%, while on the wages front there has been evidence that the recent rise in the private sector wages has been slowing a touch, though with inflation slipping back to 2.4% we are now seeing wages outstrip prices. This looks set to remain the case in today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s numbers with weekly average earnings for the three months to May expected to fall slightly from 2.8% to 2.7%. On the markets, Wall Street ended slightly higher but after the close Netflix shares fell 14% following badly received results. So European markets are expected to make an uncertain start. Analysts at London Capital Group expect the FTSE 100 to open 3 points higher at 7603, Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax to open 3 points lower at 12558 and France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac to dip 1 point to 5407.

Fiona Cincotta, senior market analyst at City Index, said: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The pound tumbled to a 10-month low versus the dollar after inflation in June failed to tick high...</p> <p>These figures could give the BoE reasons to pause for thought over an August rate hike. With inflation steady at a one year low and average wages slipping, the central bank could have problems justifying the need for a rate hike. Policy makers could use the argument of recovering economic growth over the last few months, however the inflation figures show that growth is not at levels where it is starting to push up inflation. From whichever angle you look at this the data so far this week has not been supportive of an interest rate rise. Instead we are in danger of seeing a repeat of May, where weak data leading up to the MPC meeting prevented the widely expected rate hike.

The bigger issue here may be the obvious benefits to Amazon (and potentially Apple) from the ruling; first, even though Amazon already generates ~50% of commerce and product-related searches, the EC will require Android users to take another step before they can access an alternative product search engine. Secondly, to force Google to support distribution of forked-versions of Android (which Google does not control) could directly benefit Amazon\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Fire devices. To use the example cited by Margrethe Vestager in the press conference, the EC argues that Fire smartphones were not commercially successful because Google did not allow manufacturers to pre-install Google apps on those devices (forget the fact that the apps wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t work as well, or at all, on a modified OS.)</p> <p>In order to make an anti-trust argument, the EC needed to argue that Apple iOS (25% market share in Europe) is not a direct competitor to Android, and that Amazon is not a competitor to Google in search. In fact, the EC specifically cites Google/Android having 95% mobile OS market share (outside of China.) While convenient for an anti-trust ruling, we think these assumptions do not reflect the reality of the marketplace. In fact, as others have pointed out numerous times, Apple puts far more restrictions on network operators than Google does, including requirements to pre-install at least 3x as many apps as Google does, while Amazon continues to take share of product search. </p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5b4f41a1e4b0afc5fe5824da\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-07-18T13:39:44.912Z\">2.39pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Google parent Alphabet has said it will accrue the EC fine in the second quarter of 2018, in <a href=\"https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1652044/000119312518220240/d552608d8k.htm\">a filing to the Securities and Exchange Commission.</a></p> <p>Meanwhile its shares have edged marginally higher - up 0.18% - after an initial dip.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5b4f3f76e4b0a426f7db4a14\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-07-18T13:25:20.527Z\">2.25pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Investors will be watching shares in Google parent Alphabet when Wall Street opens shortly.

Thanks for all your comments, and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be back tomorrow. Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell gave his second day of testimony to Congress, including a discussion on the current trade situation following President Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tariffs. Reuters reports: Powell, questioned by members of a House congressional committee, repeated on Wednesday that rising world protectionism would over time pose a risk to a U.S. and global expansion that appears largely on track to continue. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153If this process leads to a world of higher tariffs on a wide range of goods and services that are traded and those are sustained for a longer period of time, if it results in a more protectionist world, that would be bad for our economy,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Powell told the House Financial Services Committee. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t up to us to criticise (administration) policies. But the evidence is clear that countries that remain open to trade have higher productivity. They have higher incomes.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Powell\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s appearance largely retraced the testimony and questioning from a Tuesday hearing with the Senate Banking Committee. In prepared testimony and an accompanying report Powell depicted a U.S. economy poised for perhaps years more continued growth, with the central bank close to its goals of maximum employment and inflation stable at around 2 percent. But as with senators the day before, House members zeroed in on the possible economic consequences of the Trump administration\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s imposition of tariffs, with threats of more to come, in the name of cutting better trade deals with both allies like Canada and rivals like China. Powell has tried to walk a fine line in his responses, at once steering clear of direct criticism of the president who appointed him, while also making the economic consequences clear. Powell said he thought the administration\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s aim was to ultimately lower tariffs worldwide, and if there was disruption in the meantime \u00e2\u20ac\u0153it might be worth paying a bit of a short-term price to get to a better place.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd At the same time, he and other Fed officials have been clear that businesses are telling them that they already are changing spending and investment plans because of the risks and uncertainties around a possible trade conflict. Troubled UK outsourcer Capita has seen its shares fall around 2.5% after it said its finance director is stepping down. It said Nick Greatorex would stay with the company for the next few months as it searched for a replacement. Capita, which is cutting costs as it attempts to cut its debt levels, appointed a new chief executive, Jon Lewis, in December. The pound has pulled back from its lowest levels but is still down on the day. Immediately following the unchanged UK inflation figures, which cast doubt on whether the Bank of England would indeed raise interest rates next month, sterling slid to a 10 month low against the dollar of $1.3011. It is now at $1.3042, still down more than 0.5% on the day. Fiona Cincotta, senior market analyst at City Index, said: The pound tumbled to a 10-month low versus the dollar after inflation in June failed to tick high... These figures could give the BoE reasons to pause for thought over an August rate hike. With inflation steady at a one year low and average wages slipping, the central bank could have problems justifying the need for a rate hike. Policy makers could use the argument of recovering economic growth over the last few months, however the inflation figures show that growth is not at levels where it is starting to push up inflation. From whichever angle you look at this the data so far this week has not been supportive of an interest rate rise. Instead we are in danger of seeing a repeat of May, where weak data leading up to the MPC meeting prevented the widely expected rate hike. The market expectations of a rate hike slipped to 72% from 77% prior to the release. Back with Google, and Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK, said: In a way Google has become a victim of its own success in terms of its search and marketing capabilities, with little in the way of alternative search and browser options available. In terms of browsing there is Firefox, Opera and Microsoft Edge, however search options are more limited, with Yahoo and Bing the more well-known names. The solution is likely to be something similar to the solution which Microsoft implemented a few years ago when it had to unbundle Internet Explorer from its operating system to comply with similar EU antitrust rules, allowing the user to choose their own search and browse options. With Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s visit to Nato and Russia hogging the headlines, his trade battle with China seemed to have gone a bit quiet. Now one of his advisors has been talking trade again. Reuters reports: U.S. President Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s top economic adviser said on Wednesday that Chinese President Xi Jinping was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153holding up\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd a deal to resolve a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153significant trade dispute\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd between the United States and China. Larry Kudlow, head of the White House Economic Council, also said that he expects European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker to bring a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153significant\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd trade offer to Trump when he visits Washington next week. The comments were made to CNBC: Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell gave his latest testimony to the US Senate yesterday, and shortly he will be up before the House of Representatives. His testimony is the same to both committees and can be found here. On yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s comments Jasper Lawler, head of research at London Capital Group, said: In his appearance in front of the Senate Banking Committee Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell was unequivocal in his upbeat assessment of the US economy. [He] continued with the Fed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s message to continue raising rates gradually as he sees several years of the jobs market remaining strong and inflation steady around 2%. This was music to the ears of the dollar, providing the greenback a welcome distraction from the trade war noise over recent weeks. Overall US markets have edged ahead in early trading. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is up 19 points or 0.06%, while the S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite are both showing similar percentage gains. Positive results from United Airlines and Morgan Stanley are helping to support industrial and banking shares. The EC ruling on Google is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a bit misguided\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd but is likely to be a minor inconvenience in the short and medium term, says Colin Sebastian, senior analyst at investment bank Baird. (Given the muted reaction from the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s share price, the market seems to agree). Sebastian adds: Longer term, we see modest (but not unexpected) added risk from requirements to support forked versions of Android, and secondly, from the direct and/or indirect benefits of this ruling for Apple and Amazon. Overall, this ruling should have a limited direct impact on Google since it ostensibly does not force a change to the Google search algorithm, and it also seems relatively straight-forward for Google to comply. The bigger issue here may be the obvious benefits to Amazon (and potentially Apple) from the ruling; first, even though Amazon already generates ~50% of commerce and product-related searches, the EC will require Android users to take another step before they can access an alternative product search engine. Secondly, to force Google to support distribution of forked-versions of Android (which Google does not control) could directly benefit Amazon\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Fire devices. To use the example cited by Margrethe Vestager in the press conference, the EC argues that Fire smartphones were not commercially successful because Google did not allow manufacturers to pre-install Google apps on those devices (forget the fact that the apps wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t work as well, or at all, on a modified OS.) In order to make an anti-trust argument, the EC needed to argue that Apple iOS (25% market share in Europe) is not a direct competitor to Android, and that Amazon is not a competitor to Google in search. In fact, the EC specifically cites Google/Android having 95% mobile OS market share (outside of China.) While convenient for an anti-trust ruling, we think these assumptions do not reflect the reality of the marketplace. In fact, as others have pointed out numerous times, Apple puts far more restrictions on network operators than Google does, including requirements to pre-install at least 3x as many apps as Google does, while Amazon continues to take share of product search. Google parent Alphabet has said it will accrue the EC fine in the second quarter of 2018, in a filing to the Securities and Exchange Commission. Meanwhile its shares have edged marginally higher - up 0.18% - after an initial dip. Investors will be watching shares in Google parent Alphabet when Wall Street opens shortly. At the moment the pre-market price is showing limited damage from the EC fine, down just 0.25%. Sundar Pichai, Google\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s CEO, has issued a statement decrying the EC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision, and confirming that the company plans to appeal against its fine. Pichai argues that Google\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s open source model (which allows manufacturers to modify Android to their purposes) has been good for competition. He also accuses the Commission of favouring proprietary rivals (such as Apple, which keeps a tight hold on its own operating system). Significantly, Pichai states that Google offers phone makers \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the option of pre-loading a suite of popular Google apps\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. The EC, though, accuses Google of using \u00e2\u20ac\u0153tying practices\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and \u00e2\u20ac\u0153exclusivity payments\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to prevent rivals app-makers getting a foothold on Android. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s at the heart of today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fine. Pichai writes: Today, because of Android, a typical phone comes preloaded with as many as 40 apps from multiple developers, not just the company you bought the phone from. If you prefer other apps\u00e2\u20ac\u201dor browsers, or search engines\u00e2\u20ac\u201dto the preloaded ones, you can easily disable or delete them, and choose other apps instead, including apps made by some of the 1.6 million Europeans who make a living as app developers. In fact, a typical Android phone user will install around 50 apps themselves. Last year, over 94 billion apps were downloaded globally from our Play app store; browsers such as Opera Mini and Firefox have been downloaded more than 100 million times, UC Browser more than 500 million times. This is in stark contrast to how things used to be in the 1990s and early 2000s\u00e2\u20ac\u201dthe dial-up age. Back then, changing the pre-installed applications on your computer, or adding new ones, was technically difficult and time-consuming. The Commission\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Android decision ignores the new breadth of choice and clear evidence about how people use their phones today. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the full statement. The EC have created this graphic to explain how Google has been unfairly keeping a grip on its Android operating system, hurting rival search engine and browser makers. The French government has welcomed the EC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s move. Government spokesman Benjamin Griveaux told reporters in Paris that it was a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcexcellent decision\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, adding: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153No-one is above the laws that have been laid down in common for all....Not Google, nor any other entity.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd US tech entrepreneur Jason Kint has calculated that the EC has basically fined Google 4% of its annual revenues. That happens to be the maximum penalty available under Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new data privacy rules (even though this isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t a data violation). Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a video clip of Margrethe Vestager denying she has a vendetta against America during today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s press conference: Our news story about Google\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s record fine for breaking Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s competition rules is now live. Our Brussels correspondent Jennifer Rankin writes: Google has been hit with a record \u00e2\u201a\u00ac4.34bn (\u00c2\u00a33.8bn) fine by the European Union for abusing its market dominance in mobile phone operating systems. The EU imposed the multibillion-euro penalty after finding that the US tech firm required smartphone manufacturers to pre-instal Google\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s search and browser apps devices using its Android operating system, otherwise they would not be allowed to use its Google Play online store and streaming service. Margrethe Vestager, the EU\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s competition commissioner, said Google has used its Android mobile phone operating system \u00e2\u20ac\u0153to cement its dominance as a search engine\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, preventing rivals from innovating and competing \u00e2\u20ac\u0153and this is illegal under EU antitrust rules\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Vestager added: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The vast majority of users simply take what comes with their device and don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t download competing apps. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Or to slightly paraphrase what [US free market economist] Milton Friedman has said \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcthere ain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t no such thing as a free search.\u00e2\u20ac\u2122\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Jennifer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s story: Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ruling comes too late to affect the mobile phone market, my colleague Sam Gibbs says: Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a flavour of his analysis: The EC is demanding that Google cede some control over Android in its licensing. The EC is demanding that manufacturers should be free to use Android and include the Google Play Store without having to pre-install the Google Search app and Chrome. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a similar strategy to that employed by the EC in 2004, when it forced Microsoft to release a version of Windows without Windows Media Player and later offer a browser choice screen, which allowed users to select a web browser other than Internet Explorer. But as with the Media Player-free version of Windows, Windows XP N, for which there was no demand, consumers are unlikely to buy a version of Android without Google\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s services. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The EU\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stance is arguably six to eight years too late,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Geoff Blaber from analyst firm CCS Insight. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Android has already helped establish Google apps and services as essentials for consumers in the western world. More here: Q: Why does Google get fined in Europe, but not in the US and Canada? Commissioner Vestager insists that the EC has been fair - it has investigated complaints and taken evidence in order to reach its decisions. Q: Was today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision really taken outside the context of the political situation? [a reference to Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s attacks on the EU\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade policies, and threats to impose tariffs on European exports, I think] People more insightful than me say that the world is becoming more and more unpredictable, Vestager replies. That means it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s important to do predictable things -- so if you breach antitrust rules you pay the penalty, she adds. The press conference is now over. Q: Currently, the mobile phone operating system is dominated either by Android or Apple. Do you really think that is going to change? Commissioner Vestager says she isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t going to guess how the mobile sector will develop. But she insists that competition will develop, if the market is fair. She says that Amazon developed a fork which they were very keen to roll out to manufacturers, but \u00e2\u20ac\u0153it wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t possible because of Google\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s illegal restrictions\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Q: This is the biggest fine ever for antitrust violations, so is Google guilty of the biggest ever antitrust breach? Vestager jokes that she loves all her children equally, so it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not fair to make her choose which company has been the worst sinner against competition in the EU. Q: Wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t breaking up Google address these antitrust concerns? Vestager denies that breaking up a company would be a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcsilver bullet\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 to deliver competition. Q: Was Donald Trump right when he told Jean-Claude Juncker last week that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Your tax lady really hates the US\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd? Vestager says she has fact-checked this statement. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s true that she\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a woman, and that she deals with tax. But after that point, the US president\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s claim becomes less accurate. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I very much like the US\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, Vestager insists, pointing out that she\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s from Denmark, where people often have American friends and appreciate US culture and travel. Q: Why is today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fine twice as big as the one imposed on Google in 2017? The fine reflects the scale of Google\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u0153very serious illegal behaviour\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, Vestager replies. Q: Do you think Google needs to be broken up to improve competition? Vestager says she doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know whether that would improve the situation. The EC really wants Google to allow proper competition at the mobile phone operating system level. Q: Does the length of time these cases take limit their impact, as the market has moved on by the time the EU acts? Vestager says that the case began in 2015, following a number of complaints. The EC sticks to \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcdue process\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, which limits how fast these cases can be wrapped up, she explains. Q: What remedies will be available to existing Android phone users? Could Google be forced to send out a notification to customers, telling them they can change their search engine or browser? Vestager says the EC is making a classical \u00e2\u20ac\u02dccease and desist\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 decision. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s now up to Google to decide how to make amends in the future. [I think that means that existing Android users won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t see any difference on their handset] Q: Google now has an entrenched position in the mobile sector (with four-fifths of devices), so how can you enforce changes now? Vestager says Google needs to take away the contractual restrictions that have held back competition on Android. Q: Did you examine whether Google blocked rivals from collecting data on Android users? Vestager says that rival search engines \u00e2\u20ac\u0153never really\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd got a foothold on Android, due to Google\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s restrictions (ie, the company didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have to actively block its rivals, as they weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t there in the first place). Q: Could your decision drive up the cost of mobile phone handsets? Vestager says there are still various ways in which Google can monetising the Android operating system, rather than simply hiking prices. Q: What will happen to the money (assuming Google pays up). Vestager says that the fine will be returned to EU member states, based on how much each country pays into the EU budget. But that could take a while, if Google files an appeal. Commissioner Vestager is taking questions about the Google fine now. Q: Could this decision affect next week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meeting between EC president Juncker and US president Trump? Vestager says that the US competition authorities want fair competition, just as Europe does. As such, they expect the EC to do its job. Q: Should Google apologise? We want Google to end its illegal behaviour, Vestager replies. This isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t a moral endeavour - we just want Google to play by the rules. The size of Google\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fine reflects the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153seriousness\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and sustained natures of its violation of the EC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s antitrust rules, commissioner Margrethe Vestager tells reporters in Brussels. The company must end its \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcillegal conduct\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 within 90 days, by ending the restrictions it has imposed on mobile phone makers (as outlined here), Vestager explains. Our decision stops Google from controlling which search and browser apps manufacturers can install, or which android operating system they can use, she says. And if Google doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t comply, its parent company Alphabet could be fined up to 5% of its daily turnover each day. Newsflash: Google says it will appeal against the EC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fine. Google spokesman Al Verney argues that its Android operating system [which is used on 80% of phones worldwide] has been good for consumers. Verney says: Android has created more choice for everyone, not less. A vibrant ecosystem, rapid innovation and lower prices are classic hallmarks of robust consequences. We will appeal the Commission\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision. The EC says that Google has been abusing its market position for seven years. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ruling states: Google has prevented device manufacturers from using any alternative version of Android that was not approved by Google (Android forks). In order to be able to pre-install on their devices Google\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s proprietary apps, including the Play Store and Google Search, manufacturers had to commit not to develop or sell even a single device running on an Android fork. The Commission found that this conduct was abusive as of 2011, which is the date Google became dominant in the market for app stores for the Android mobile operating system. Commissioner Vestager is now outlining how Google restricts manufacturers from creating rival \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcforks\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 of its Android operating system. In theory, a manufacturer can used the Android source code to create their own platform, as Google makes it openly accessible. But in practice, Vestager says, device manufacturers who wish to obtain Google\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s proprietary Android apps and services need to enter into contracts with Google, as part of which Google imposes a number of restrictions. Commissioner Margrethe Vestager adds: Google has used Android as a vehicle to cement its dominance as a search engine. These practices have denied rivals a chance to innovate and to compete on the merits. They have denied European consumers the benefit of effective competition in the very important mobile sphere. And this is illegal under EU antitrust rules. Vestager is outlining the case against Google. She says: Google required manufacturers to pre-install the Google search and browser apps on Android phones, otherwise they wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be allowed to use Google Play (its app service)/. Google paid manufacturers and network operators to make sure that only the Google search app was installed on devices Google has restricted the development of competing mobile phone operating systems, which could have provided a platform for rival search engines. Commissioner Vestager says Google must make amends within 90 days, or the company will incur penalty payments. NEWSFLASH: The European Commission has fined Google \u00e2\u201a\u00ac4.34bn for breaching EU antitrust rules. The tech giant is being sanctioned for abusing its dominant position in the Android operating system for mobile phones. The EC says Google unfairly took advantage of the popularity of its Android mobile phone operating system, and forced phonemakers to pre-install Google services such as its flagship search product. Competition commissioner Margrethe Vestager is outlining the decision now. More to follow! Margrethe Vestager, the EC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Competition Commissioner for Competition, is about to give a press conference in Brussels. Presumably this is to announce the Google fine. It will be streamed online here. Over in Brussels, antitrust regulators are preparing to hit Google with a multi-billion euro fine. My colleague Jennifer Rankin explains: Google could be hit with a record fine by the European Union\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s competition authorities on Wednesday for abusing its market dominance in mobile phone operating systems. The company risks a multibillion-euro penalty for making the Google search engine the default on most phones using its Android operating system. Citing people familiar with the case, the Financial Times reported that the fine is likely to exceed the \u00e2\u201a\u00ac2.4bn (\u00c2\u00a32.1bn) penalty imposed by the European commission in 2017 when Google was found to have used its dominant search engine to build its internet shopping service. Google is appealing against that decision. The EU regulator could fine Google up to 10% of its turnover, or some \u00e2\u201a\u00ac11bn. Reuters is reporting that Google could be fined around \u00e2\u201a\u00ac4.3bn, or $5bn. The decision could be just minutes away.... Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s retail sector has suffered another blow \u00e2\u20ac\u201c meaty restaurant chain Gaucho is expected to file for administration today. The move will threaten around 1,500 jobs, adding to the thousands being cut at high street chains such as House of Fraser, Poundworld, Marks &amp; Spencer and Mothercare. UK house price inflation has hit a five-year low. House prices across the UK rose by 3.0% in the year to May, which is the slowest growth since August 2013. Once again, falling house prices in London dragged the national average down. The Office for National Statistics explains: The lowest annual growth was in London, where prices decreased by 0.4% over the year. London has shown a general slowdown in its annual growth rate since mid-2016. This is the fourth consecutive month that London house prices have fallen over the year. Political uncertainty (ie Brexit) is hurting prices in the capital, says Guy Bradshaw, Director of Central London Sales and Lettings at UK Sotheby\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s International Realty: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153As annual growth in the UK has continued to decline to the lowest rate we have seen since August 2013, it is unsurprising to see the London market has also followed suit. We were never expecting to see a particularly buoyant market this year, with political uncertainty and stamp duty continuing to dampen sales. The \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcSpring Bounce\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 is undeniably modest in comparison to previous years and whilst this may be due to the poor weather we encountered late into the year this may very well be setting the scene for the summer market. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our economics correspondent Richard Partington on today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s inflation figures: The chances of a rise in interest rates in August have dipped after British inflation remained at a one-year low last month. Confounding expectations for the return of higher rates of inflation in June fuelled by the rising price of petrol, the Office for National Statistics said the consumer price index remained unchanged at 2.4% from the previous month. Although the cost of gas and electricity prices increased and the price at the pump hit the highest level for nearly four years, consumers benefited from the falling cost of computer games and the summer clothing sales. House prices across the UK also rose at the slowest pace in nearly five years. Faced with falling wage growth, the latest snapshot from the ONS poses the Bank of England with limited grounds for raising interest rates next month. Sterling slid to a 10-month low against the dollar on foreign exchanges after the data was released. More here: The Resolution Foundation has warned that inflation could overtake earnings growth soon, which would mean real wages would start falling again: Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s response to today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s inflation data, from Financial Secretary to the Treasury and Paymaster General, Mel Stride: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Inflation has fallen from its peak last year but we recognise the cost of living is still a challenge for some families. That is why we are freezing fuel duty saving drivers \u00c2\u00a3160 a year, cutting income taxes for 31 million people and increasing the National Living Wage to \u00c2\u00a37.83 an hour.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The pound is acting more like the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcGreat British Peso\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 right now, as it is buffeted by political tensions as well as economic data. So says Bart Hordijk, Market Analyst at Monex Europe, who believes sterling is behaving increasingly like an emerging market currency. Hordijk explains: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153As the dust settles on yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcWild West\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 style standoff in Parliament, UK macroeconomic data comes back into the spotlight ahead of the Bank of England rate decision in August..... Sterling\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s knee jerk reaction [to the inflation data], carving lows not seen since September 2017, evidences how over-inflated expectations were on the Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s upcoming decision. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s soft inflation reading will do little to knock the Bank of England off of their implied course, but tail risk of the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcunreliable boyfriend\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 resurfacing has increased. Sterling looks to be in for a bleak day, especially as Theresa May will have to fend off grilling during today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Prime Minister\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Questions.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Professor Costas Milas of the University of Liverpool predicts that the Bank of England will hike borrowing next month, even though inflationary pressures are less intense than feared. He thinks the BoE will be keen to get an interest rate rise through before Brexit becomes even more tense. Despite inflation getting stuck at 2.4%, I sense that early August is a very convenient time for the MPC members to hike. Why? UK inflation, at 2.4% in the second quarter of 2018, is fully in line with their 2.43% forecast recorded in the May Inflation report. So no surprises there. This, together with the widespread expectation that GDP growth in 2018 Q2 will be higher than the previous quarter figure will encourage MPC members to raise the policy rate. At the same time, with the Parliament moving in recess in less than a week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time, May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s government will get a much needed \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcbreathing space\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 in terms of Brexit-related tensions. All this implies a very short \u00e2\u20ac\u02dctime window of opportunity\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 for MPC members to hike in August rather than kicking the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcinterest-rate can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 down the road. Inflation is still taking a big chunk out of UK workers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 pay cheques. At 2.4% in June, consumer prices are rising nearly as fast as earnings, meaning real wages are only up around 0.3%. Andrew Sentance, senior economic adviser at PwC, explains: \u00e2\u20ac\ufffdUK CPI inflation remains steady at 2.4%, but it is still above the 2% target and is likely to be stuck close to 2.5% over the summer. The gap between wage growth (2.7%) and inflation remains narrow - just 0.3%. So consumers are likely to remain cautious while their living standards are still rising very slowly. Tej Parikh, Senior Economist at the Institute of Directors, warns that wages are unlikely to rise sharply this year. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The unchanged inflation rate offers some reprieve for households at a time when wage growth remains uninspiring. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Despite higher utility bills and petrol costs, consumers may have benefitted from offsetting seasonal discounts, particularly on clothing. The good news should however be taken with a pinch of salt. With the recent weak performance in pay packets, and high street bargains only temporary, the cost of living still remains high. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The stickiness in prices will reduce pressure on the Bank of England to hike interest rates in August. The decision is certainly not set in stone, particularly as wage growth is a key component of inflation, and the recent data shows little promise of a sustained rise in salaries.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd UK inflation is still over the Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s target of 2%, meaning prices are rising much faster than the saving rates on offer from the banks. Kate Smith, head of pensions at life insurance firm Aegon, says household budgets are still being squeezed. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Financial pressure created by rising prices will continue to hit people on fixed incomes, such as pensioners, the hardest. As people live longer, with more years spent in retirement, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s vital they protect their savings from the erosive effects of inflation. Even at relatively low levels of inflation the spending power of \u00c2\u00a3100 in today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s money could be halved in 20 years\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 time. June\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s unchanged inflation rate is a huge surprise, says Tom Stevenson, investment director for Personal Investing at Fidelity International. Inflation had been expected to bounce back up to 2.6% or even 2.7% on the back of higher fuel and energy prices. While these came through, they were offset by falling prices for clothes and games. Inflation remained at 2.4% for the third month in a row. Faster rising prices would have given the Bank of England cover for an interest rate hike next month. Now it looks odds-on that the MPC will hold fire yet again. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s particularly the case after yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s wage growth data emerged weaker than expected at 2.5% including bonuses. Stevenson suspects that the Bank of England will hold off raising interest rates until November, or maybe until 2019.... Economist Philip Shaw of City firm Investec says the pound is suffering from \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcpolitical trauma\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, as well as today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s weaker-than-expected inflation data. Jamie McGeever of Reuters predicts that sterling could fall through the $1.30 mark (which would be a new 10-month low) Simon French of Panmure Gordon says that an August interest rate rise looks less likely, especially after UK wage growth slowed to a six-month low yesterday. The pound has hit its lowest level in 10 months, as traders react to this morning\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s unexpectedly weak inflation data. Sterling has dropped to $1.3011, its weakest level since September 2017. The City is calculating that an August interest rate rise is now less likely, as there is less sign that inflationary pressures are building. Michael Hewson of CMC Markets says the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153political shenanigans in Westminster\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd are also weighing on the pound, following last night\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s narrow victory for Theresa May over her customs plan (see earlier post). This chart shows how Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s household heating bills, and petrol costs, drove the cost of living up last month. Clothing, toys and computer games got cheaper, though, meaning inflation was flat month-on-month (rising by 2.4% year-on-year). Men\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s clothing prices fell sharply last month, also helped to keep inflation pegged last month. The ONS says: Prices of clothing fell by 2.3% between May and June this year compared with a fall of 1.1% between the same two months a year ago. Prices usually fall between May and June as the summer sales season begins, but the fall in 2018 is the largest since 2012. The effect came mainly from men\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s clothing. The Office for National Statistics says that recreation got cheaper last month, making up for more expensive energy and fuel. Rising prices for motor fuels and domestic gas and electricity produced the largest upward contributions to change in the rate between May and June 2018. Falling prices for clothing and games, toys and hobbies provided the largest downward effects. At just 2.4%, UK inflation remains at its joint-lowest level in 14 months. Newsflash: Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s inflation rate remained at 2.4% in June, defying expectations that it would rise to 2.6%. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s good news for households, given the slowdown in wage growth in the last quarter. It also takes some pressure off the Bank of England to raise interest rates next month. More to follow! UK engineering group Smiths is having a bad morning. Smiths shares are down 7%, after it told the City that some of its medical products have lost certification under the EU\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new Medical Device Regulations. In London, the FTSE 100 has gained 35 points in early trading, partly thanks to easyJet. The budget airline\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shares have jumped by 3%, after it reported a 14% jump in revenues in the last quarter and also raised its profit forecast. Richard Hunter, Head of Markets at interactive investor, says easyJet is benefiting from falling competition: The demise of competitors such as Monarch, Air Berlin and Alitalia has opened up the field, ancillary revenue has increased due to a change in passenger behaviour (increasingly paying for additional baggage and allocated seating) and load factors remain high. European stock markets have hit a one-month high this morning, led by technology stocks. The Stoxx 600 has risen by 0.6% today, with the tech sector gaining over 2%. Semiconductor firm ASML and telecoms equipment maker Ericsson are leading the rally, after both beating analyst forecasts this morning. That follows a solid day in Wall Street yesterday, where the Nasdaq hit another record high. With Amazon hitting new peaks, and Netflix recovering from disappointing results earlier this week, the tech boom doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t appear to have ended yet. The pound has dipped below $1.31 against the US dollar this morning, close to its lowest level of 2018. Sterling slumped yesterday when the unemployment figures showed wages growth slowing, potentially making an August interest rate rise less likely. The pound is also being dragged down by Brexit anxiety, after prime minister Theresa May was forced to threaten her own MPs with a general election to force them to back her Brexit plan. Although May won a crucial vote on the customs union last night, she lost on a separate amendment which demanded that the UK remained under EU medicines regulation after leaving the bloc. Given the PM\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s precarious position, City investors aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t convinced that May can drive her plans through the Commons. Kallum Pickering of Berenberg Bank says the PM\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s challenge is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Like herding cats\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Once again, the Brexiteers have laid bare how difficult it is for UK Prime Minister Theresa May to hold her Conservative government together. Although May had turned her plan for a semi-soft Brexit into the official line of her Cabinet last week, causing prominent dissenters to quit, Brexiteers led by MP Jacob Rees-Mogg forced her on Monday to accept an amendment that would make it even more difficult for the EU to endorse her proposed customs arrangement. The strongly pro-EU House of Lords will probably reject the amendment. After the House of Commons barely passed it anyway (305 for, 302 against), the amendment may not survive a second vote. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Britain may be facing a new cost of living squeeze. Inflation figures due out this morning are expected to show that prices rose at a faster rate in June, hitting consumers in the pocket. Economists predict that the consumer prices index rose by around 2.6% in June, up from 2.4% in May, partly due to rising energy prices. Sue Trinh of Royal Bank of Canada says: The rise in petrol prices in June should ensure that the transport category continued to make a strong positive contribution to UK inflation. Added to that, a number of pre-announced utility price increases kicked in last month, including a 5.5% rise from the largest energy provider British Gas which came into effect at the end of May. This comes as UK wage growth slows. Yesterday we learned that basic pay only rose by 2.7% in the three months to May, the weakest in six months. If you include bonuses, then total earnings only rose by 2.5%. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s inflation figures will help to influence whether the Bank of England feels confident enough to raise interest rates next month. If prices are rising faster, then the hawks at the BoE will push for borrowing costs to be hiked. But dovish colleagues may worry that wage growth isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t strong enough. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also inflation day in the eurozone. Consumer prices in the euro area are expected to have risen by 2% in the last year, up from 1.9% in May. Also coming up today Google is bracing for a record fine from the European Commission today, over claims it has abused its dominant position in the mobile phone operating system market. America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s top central banker, Jerome Powell, is returning to Capitol Hill later for a second day of questioning. Yesterday he told senators that the US economy was growing strongly, adding: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The unemployment rate is low and expected to fall further. Americans who want jobs have a good chance of finding them.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The agenda 9.30am BST: UK inflation date for June 9.30am BST: UK house price data for May 10am BST: Eurozone inflation data for June 3pm BST: Fed chair Jerome Powell testifying to the US House of Representatives",

                "bodyText":"European stock markets have closed higher tonight, swept up by Google\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s strong performance and optimism over China. Mining stocks led the rally in London, on hopes that Beijing\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new stimulus package will protect China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy from a crash. BHP Billiton, Anglo American and Glencore all surged over 5% to the top of the Footsie leaderboard, as commodity prices were lifted. Tech stocks also gained ground in Europe, as traders watched the Nasdaq hit today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s record high. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the closing prices: Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE 100: Up 53 points or 0.7% at 7709 German DAX: Up 120 points or 1.1% at 12,689 French CAC: Up 55 points or 1% at 5,434 Fiona Cincotta, senior market analyst at City Index, says China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new stimulus package has calmed some anxiety over the trade dispute with America, boostings sentiment across the globe. A package of tax cuts, research spending, special bonds, infrastructure spending and a pledge to use tax policy to stimulate growth shows that the authorities in China are concerned over the impact that the developing trade war will have on growth and are taking measures to counteract a weakening economy. Traders are also hopeful about the Q2 earnings season, which is getting into full swing; Earning season is off to a strong start, of the 21% of S&amp;P firms that have reported, 80.6% has beaten expectations for Q2 earnings, whilst 74% have surpassed expectations on earnings. These are the fundamental figures which are going to keep the equity rally alive given they offer the perfect distraction to trade war headlines. Until those trade war headlines are reflected in the data, these strong fundamentals will keep the bulls in charge. Over in New York, the Nasdaq remains at record levels. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s up 45 points at 7412. Alphabet is the second-top riser, up 4%, behind biotechnology company Biogen whcih also smashed profit forecasts today. PayPal (+2.1%) and Facebook (+1.3) are also among the top risers. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s probably all for today. Thanks for reading and commenting. GW Newsflash from Lancashire: Shale gas firm Cuadrilla has been given the green light by government to start fracking at a well between Blackpool and Preston. This is the first permit granted under the government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new regulatory regime, and comes despite protests from local residents and anti-fracking campaigners. Energy minister Claire Perry said shale gas was an important potential new energy source, and she was satisfied Cuadrilla had met the government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s conditions for granting a hydraulic fracturing permit. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Our world class regulations will ensure that shale exploration will maintain robust environmental standards and meet the expectations of local communities.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Some in the local community, though, fear that injecting liquid at high pressures into the rock to split it and release hydrocarbons could cause earthquakes and pollute the water supply. The IMF\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s cure for the global economy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s imbalances includes cutting pensions in countries who are borrowing too much. On the other wide of the coin, it wants saver countries to keep older citizens in the jobs market for longer. Newsflash: The International Monetary Fund has warned that the global economy is being destabilised by current account imbalances. In a new report, the IMF flags up that some countries are simply saving too much (such as Germany), while others are running persistent deficits (Britain and America). And over time, this is creating dangerous instability. The Fun warns: From a global perspective, excess surpluses have been especially large and persistent in a small group of countries, most prominently in Germany and China, and to a lesser extent, in Korea, Netherlands, Sweden and Singapore Excess deficits remain mainly in the United States and the United Kingdom, some euro area debtor countries, and a few vulnerable emerging market and developing economies (e.g. Argentina, Turkey). Donald Trump would surely agree, having made \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcfair trade\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 a key plank of his administration. But the IMF aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t endorsing the White House\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade war. Instead, it warns that protectionist measures will back fire. Chief economist Maurice Obstfeld says: The persistence of global imbalances and mounting perceptions of an uneven playing field for trade are fueling protectionist sentiment. These impulses are misguided. An escalation of protectionist policies would mainly hurt domestic and global growth, without much of an effect on current account imbalances, as this year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s report also finds. The Fund also warns that Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tax cuts could make the things worse: The fiscal easing currently underway in the United States is leading to a tightening in monetary conditions, a stronger US dollar, and a larger US current account deficit. In the near term, these trends risk aggravating trade tensions, and the resulting faster tightening of global financing conditions, which could prove even more disruptive for emerging market economies, especially those with weak external positions Most of the famous FAANG stocks are bursting ahead today. Google/Alphabet is leading the way (+4%), followed by Facebook (+2%), Amazon (+1.7%) and Apple (+0.9%). Investors are wagering that Alphabet\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s strong results bode well for the current results season (Facebook reports tomorrow, followed by Amazon on Thursday and Apple early next week). Netflix, which missed Wall Street forecasts last week, is lagging behind though. Breaking: The Nasdaq stock index has hit a fresh record high at the start of trading in New York. Tech giant Alphabet is driving the rally, up 4%, after smashing Wall Street forecasts last night. This helped send the Nasdaq Composite Index up 70 points, or, 0.9%, to 7,912 in early trading. Traders are cheered by the strong earnings from its Google operations (see opening post), which delivered earnings per share of $11.75, compared to forecasts of $9.59 per share. The broader S&amp;P 500 index has gained 0.75%, while the benchmark Dow Jones industrial average is 0.6% higher. Investors in Europe are also putting their worries about trade wars behind them, pushing shares up in London, Frankfurt and Paris: Traders are also cheering China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new stimulus measures. Beijing\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s plan to cut R&amp;D taxes and spur local investment is bolstering optimism in the markets. David Madden, market analyst at CMC Markets, says: European stock markets are higher in the wake of Beijing\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s plans to stimulate the economy. The Chinese government unveiled plans to boost domestic demand in the face of heightened trade tensions. The second-largest economy in the world has been slowing down in recent years, and the tariffs imposed by the US are making matters worse. The proactive move by the Chinese authorities has lifted investor confidence around the global. Bitcoin is also on a tear this morning, as cryptocurrencies rally sharply. The Bitcoin price has jumped by 6% this morning to $8,175 on the Luxembourg Bitstamp exchange, extending its recent rally. The digital currency has now surged by a third in the last 10 days, having fallen sharply from around $20,000 at the start of the year. Lukman Otunuga, research analyst at FXTM, suggests that the Bitcoin bulls have been lured out of hibernation, and could push bitcoin towards $10,000 An inflow of positive news over the past few weeks regarding cryptocurrencies has revived investor appetite for Bitcoin and this can be reflected in the bullish price action. Goldman Sachs and BlackRock have expressed interest in the cryptocurrency markets while the Financial Services Board declared that they do not pose a threat to the global financial system. With this renewed sense of optimism over cryptocurrencies attracting investors from all directions, further upside could be on the cards in the near term. Alphabet shares are expected to jump around 4% when Wall Street trading begin in 45 minutes, after the tech giant beat revenue and earnings targets last night. In the old days, world leaders would prepare for a visiting politician by getting the red carpet swept, and perhaps organising a banquet. Times change, though (and not always for the better). So president Trump has limbered up for his meeting with EC president Jean-Claude Juncker tomorrow with another blast about trade. Tomorrow\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meeting between Juncker and Trump could be heated. The EC would like to dial down the trade tensions with the US, which has already threatened to impose tariffs on European car imports. But Juncker may struggle to persuade his host that tariffs are counter-productive, and will hurt US consumers and cost jobs. The two sides have already fired shots in the trade wars; America hit Europe with 25% tariffs on steel imports, prompting new levies on US goods such as jeans and orange juice. But despite all the noise, the two sides actually have fairly low trade barriers. As Chris Giles wrote in the Financial Times today: Even though some trade is deterred by specific high tariffs on both sides of the Atlantic, the average weighted tariffs applied by the EU on US goods were 3 per cent in 2015, a little lower than the US equivalent of 3.3 per cent in the same year. City economist Timothy Ash thinks the Turkish central bank blundered today by not hiking interest rates: Yikes! The Turkish lira is tumbling after the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s central bank surprisingly left interest rates on hold. The financial markets had widely expected a rate hike today, of at least one percentage point. Instead, the Turkish central bank left borrowing costs unchanged at 17.75%, despite concerns over high inflation and the weak currency. The move dealt the lira another blow, wiping 3% off its value against the US dollar. The decision will fuel concerns that president Erdogan is undermining central bank independence, as he pushes for lower interest rates. He has just promoted his son-in-law to a top role overseeing the Turkish economy. London\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s taxi drivers have been pushing back against ride-hail app Uber for years, holding protests and demanding for tighter regulation. But now, they are taking their fight to a higher level - considering suing Uber for more than a billion pounds of lost earnings. Sky News\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Mark Kleinman has the details: London\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s army of black cab drivers are drawing up a stunning plot to sue Uber for more than \u00c2\u00a31bn weeks after the ride-hailing app won a 15-month extension to its licence to operate in the capital. Sky News has learnt that the Licensed Taxi Drivers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Association (LTDA), which has 11,000 members in London, has engaged the leading law firm Mishcon de Reya to explore the potential for a massive legal claim against Uber. Sources said on Tuesday that if the case proceeded, the LTDA was expected to argue that all 25,000 black cab drivers in London had suffered lost earnings averaging around \u00c2\u00a310,000 for at least five years as a consequence of failings in the way Uber had operated. At that level, the overall compensation bill could total \u00c2\u00a31.25bn. Last September, Uber learned it was losing its licence after Transport for London concluded it wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153fit and proper\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 operator. That forced the firm to tighten up its practices, including the reporting of criminal offences and carrying out background checks on drivers. TfL then granted Uber a new probationary licence last month, after the firm passed several inspections. Back in the markets, and Chinese stocks have surged after Beijing announced new fiscal measures to stimulate its economy. Overnight, China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s government rolled out a mixture of tax cuts and infrastructure spending to tackle the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153uncertainty\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd hurting its economy. The People\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Bank of China also acted, pumping $74bn into China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s banking system to prevent credit drying up. Premier Li Keqiang said it was important to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153preserve economic activity within a reasonable range\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, as the cabinet agreed tax cuts for company research and development projects. China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s government will also accelerate the issuance of new bonds to finance local government building projects, and promote privately funded transport, oil and gas, and telecommunications projects. ANZ economists Raymond Yeung and Betty Wang said in a note. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The government is sending a clear signal that it is preparing to defend growth, ... Premier Li may be concerned about the negative impact of deleveraging on growth,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The move comes just days after China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s growth rate dipped. It follows rising trade tensions with America, and Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s threat to impose tariffs on all Chinese imports. After months of losses, investors hailed the news. Shares jumped in Shanghai, sending the benchmark index up 1.5% - making its best three-day run in two years. Just in: Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s factories kept growing last month, but bosses are slashing some investment plans as trade war and Brexit fears grow. The CBI has reported that UK manufacturing output rose in the last quarter. Around 35% of businesses reported an increase in new orders, and 20% reported a decrease, giving a balance of +15%. Firms reported that new orders continued to expand \u00e2\u20ac\u0153at a brisk pace\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, with stronger demand from domestic customers making up for a slowdown in exports. However, firms are cautious; 18% of firms said they were more optimistic about the general business situation than three months ago and 21% were less optimistic, giving a balance of -3%. Tom Crotty, Group Director of Ineos and Chair of CBI Manufacturing Council, says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s great to see the manufacturing sector firing on all cylinders, with production revving up again after the slowdown earlier this year. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153But rising trade tensions and ongoing uncertainty over our future trade and customs arrangements are clearly taking their toll on manufacturers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 confidence and investment.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd With Donald Trump hiking tariffs, and Britain possibly heading for a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcno-deal\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 exit from the EU, firms are axing their spending on \u00e2\u20ac\u0153intangible\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd assets, such as product &amp; process innovation and training and re-training. Investment in this area is expected to fall at a pace unseen since the global financial crisis, the CBI warns. Newsflash: Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Serious Fraud Office has launched a new attempt to prosecute Barclays bank over its emergency fundraising from Qatar during the 2008 financial crisis. The SFO has applied to the High Court to get charges against Barclays PLC and Barclays Bank (which holds its banking licence to operate in different countries) reinstated. Barclays says it will defend the application brought by the SFO. Two months ago, the Crown Court dismissed charges that Barclays had conspired to commit fraud by false representations, and provided \u00e2\u20ac\u0153unlawful financial assistance\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to Qatar over the fund-raising. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s some reaction to this month\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s eurozone slowdown, from Oxford Economics\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Angel Talavera: ...and from Piet Christiansen of Danske Bank: Trader Marc-Andr\u00c3\u00a9 Fongern points out how Germany is outperforming the rest of the eurozone this month: Growth across Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s private sector is slowing this month, according to a new survey of purchasing managers across the region. Data firm Markit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u02dccomposite output\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 index has fallen to 54.3, from 54.9 in June, due to a slowdown in growth at service sector companies. Its manufacturing PMI index held steady at 54.2, but factory bosses reported the slowest growth in export orders in almost two years. Markit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chief business economist, Chris Williamson, says Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy has entered July on a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153soft footing\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd - amid worries about trade disputes. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Given the waning growth of new business and further slide in business optimism, the outlook has also deteriorated, notably in manufacturing, where the surveys saw worries about trade wars intensify markedly in July. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153While there are signs that improving domestic demand in many countries is helping drive robust service sector expansion and support manufacturing, a worsening picture for export growth is clearly having an increasingly detrimental effect on manufacturing. Much of the growth came from Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest two members. Markit adds. Growth in the periphery hit its lowest level since autumn 2016, though. By country, faster growth in Germany contrasted with a slight slowing in France. Elsewhere, growth was the weakest for 21 months, slipping lower in both manufacturing and services. The rate of growth of Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s private sector economy rebounded from a 20-month low in May to a five-month high, driven by a stronger increase in manufacturing output. But France saw the second- weakest expansion in 18 months, stymied in particular by near-stagnant manufacturing. European stock markets have all opened higher, as Alphabet gives the technology sector a boost. The Europe-wide Stoxx 600 index has gained 0.4%, with the mining sector up 1% and tech gaining 0.5%. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s love for a (properly mixed) gin and tonic has swept mixer maker Fever-Tree\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shares to a fresh record high. They surged to \u00c2\u00a339.87 in early trading, up from $34.60 last night, after Fever-Tree posted a 45% jump in revenues this year. The company has also landed a deal with America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest wine and spirits distribution company, leaving it optimistic about the future. CEO Tim Warrillow declared: Given the strong performance in the first half of the year, the Board anticipates that the outcome for the full year will be comfortably ahead of its expectations.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Anyone who had the foresight to buy Fever-Tree\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shares in 2014, when they were worth below \u00c2\u00a32, can afford a cheeky double G&amp;T tonight. Back in the UK, supermarkets are rubbing their hands after enjoying a boost from England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s World Cup run. Data firm Kantar reports that sales of alcohol at supermarkets surged to \u00c2\u00a3287 million during the week that the England football team played (and beat!) Colombia and Sweden. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a record, if you exclude Christmas and Easter. Fraser McKevitt, head of retail and consumer insight at Kantar Worldpanel, explains: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153England may not have won the World Cup \u00e2\u20ac\u201c but its journey to the semi-finals not only helped to kickstart the summer, but supermarket sales to boot. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Over the past month, football-frenzied customers visited supermarkets an extra 13 million times as they hurried to stock up on World Cup-viewing essentials, with alcohol in particular the stand-out winner. Supermarkets also saw strong demand for BBQ products and sun cream: McKevitt adds: With the hot and sunny weather showing no signs of letting up, al fresco dining has continued to tempt shoppers. Over the past month, sales of firelighters and fresh burgers rocketed by 47% and 30% as customers honed their barbecuing skills. Meanwhile, sun care products and painkillers were both in demand: sales of sun creams jumped by 38%, while nearly a third of all households picked up pain-killing tablets over the past month. [Those pain killers might have something to do with those alcohol sales....] Financial analysts are impressed by the ability of Google\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s parent company to keep growing fast, even with an EU antitrust case hanging over it. As Richard Kramer of Arete Research puts it: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153There was never a question about Google\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s dominance of a buoyant digital ads market\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd JMP Securities analyst Ron Josey agrees that Google\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s core revenue stream, web adverts, remains strong: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153First and foremost, Google Sites revenue has continued to grow, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the fourth quarter in a row of accelerating growth rates. The company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s continued ability to reinvent or launch new ad products that have been adopted by advertisers, and that drives return on investment.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Forrester Research\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Collin Colburn said the $5bn fine imposed by commissioner Margrethe Vestager last week was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153pretty big\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd for most companies, but only a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153slap on the wrist\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to Google. But Naeem Aslam of Think Markets argues that Google must avoid further financial penalties, for the sake of its reputation: Today, it is all about Alphabet; Google is the king of the advertisement and its ad business is in full throttle. The message is clear for its investors that the company is a monster in this arena and the EU regulatory backlash hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t been able to damage its number in any significant way. The internet giant reported its earning number last night and it smashed all the estimates. The crown jewel, its ads business experienced growth of 24% and its second most important lucrative business; cloud services also added a strong number. The growth in the cloud services was 37%. When we look at the Alphabet\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s earning, it makes us comfortable that there is a moderate slowdown in spending. This means that the user acquisition cost is going down. This creates a more efficient environment for revenue growth. Having said this, the company cannot afford to have reputation damage and it still needs to bring fines under-control because eventually this would add go against Google\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s values. Last night, Google CEO Sundar Pichai reported that the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s self-driving car division is making progress. He told investors: Waymo expanded its partnership with Fiat Chrysler with the option to add up to 62,000 Chrysler Pacifica minivans to its self-driving fleet. And lastly Waymo announced that it has driven more than 8 million fully autonomous miles with most of those on city streets. Pichai also revealed that Google Translate got a boost during the World Cup. Pichai told investors he was: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153...extremely proud to see the positive feedback on how useful Google Translate was for people who traveled to Russia\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd In these simple moments, when you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re in an unfamiliar place or you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know the language, Google is there to help with the right information at the right time.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. European investors are in cheerier mood today, after Google\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s parent company smashed expectations last night. Alphabet shrugged off the impact of its penalty for breaking European competition rules, by posting revenues of $26.24bn in just the last three months, beating expectations of $25.5bn. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s up from $20.9bn a year earlier. Profits dipped to $2.8bn from $4.1bn, but they would have been a sparkling $7.8bn but for the $5bn fine imposed by the EU last week. Chief financial officer Ruth Porat declared the company had delivered \u00e2\u20ac\u0153another quarter of very strong performance\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Wall Street agreed - Google\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shares jumped by 4% in after-hours trading following the results. This is feeding through to Europe this morning, with shares rising in London: The results showed that Google\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s grip on Web advertising remains extremely strong, with 58% more \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcclicks\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 on its mobile and YouTube adverts than a year ago. Non-advertising revenues (such as mobile apps, cloud computing and Google Home speakers) jumped to $4.4bn, up from around $3bn a year ago. Tech shares are expected to be in demand today after Alphabet\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcimpressive set of results\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, says Jasper Lawler of London Capital Group: It wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t just the headline figures impressing traders, but also a surprise drop in costs reported by Alphabet. Costs had been increasing at a concerning rate over previous quarters as Alphabet played catch up in areas such as developing its cloud business and consumer business. These higher costs had been squeezing margins causing concern particularly among short term traders. Unexpectedly lower costs have eased these fears, boosting demand for the stock in the process. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our news story on the results: Also coming up today There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a flurry of corporate news today, as companies clear the decks before the summer holidays. Swiss Bank UBS posted a 12% rise in pre-tax profits in the last quarter, thanks to its investment banking arm. European carmaker PSA has reported record earnings, after the takeover of Opel-Vauxhall last year. But UK energy producer Drax\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s profits fell 15% in the first half of the year, following various outages. And among the the smaller companies, tonic and mixer-maker Fevertree has posted another big jump in profits - adjusted earnings rose 35% in the last six months, to \u00c2\u00a334m. More on all hose shortly...

They are not shooting a porn film but indulging in the latest must-have for the wealthy: a private West End theatre production.</p> \n<p>This week the \u00c2\u00a310,000-a-night Shangri-La suite of the Shard was transformed into a 1930s apartment for the setting of No\u00c3\u00abl Coward\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Tonight at 8:30, a cycle of one-act comic plays. Next week it could be Pinter in your living room, Shakespeare at your Hamptons summer house or even Wilde on the deck of your superyacht. If you have the money, production crews promise to transform any space into a theatre set and actors will create \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the most intimate play you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve ever seen\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd.</p> \n<p>The producer Lucy Eaton, 30, said she hit upon the idea of offering the wealthy private performances after putting on a play in a super-rich patron\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s house after a theatre pulled out at the last minute. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It was an incredible experience and the guest said they were so sold on the intimacy of it,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd she said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We thought: \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcThis could be an absolutely wonderful idea, bringing theatre to you.\u00e2\u20ac\u2122\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"6a28a9d1-5da2-41c2-889c-8105c89be9a8\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Gw5_rTJIhJM?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Eaton and her partners formed the production company Revels in Hand and have put on A Midsummer Night\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dream in a walled garden in Chelsea, west London, transformed a private polo field into a living room for Coward\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ways and Means and flown actors out to New York to put on plays at a wealthy backer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s property in the Hamptons.</p> \n<p>\u00e2\u20ac\u0153This is theatre in its purest form. Inviting actors to one\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s home or to a private gathering was the thing to do in Shakespearean times and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our ambition to revive this definitive form of entertainment, so loved by the aristocracy and royalty,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Eaton said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153You and your guests are so up close and personal with the actors you can see the laughter lines.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd</p> \n<p>The intimate experience does not come cheap. The average price of production is \u00c2\u00a35,000 and longer or more complex plays can cost a lot more. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It is expensive,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Eaton said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153But it really is an elite luxury experience for lords, sheikhs and CEOs.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd She said her company had created productions for all three categories but she was prevented from sharing the details because of non-disclosure agreements.</p> \n<p>The weirdest location so far, she said, was a polo field at a country estate near London. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The funniest thing was we were offering two plays at the time \u00e2\u20ac\u201c one was set in a living room and the other was A Midsummer Night\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dream,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd she said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153They asked for the living room one, despite the polo field kind of being perfect for A Midsummer Night\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dream. They got their staff to move a vast amount of furniture on to the polo field to make it a living room.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd</p> \n<p>Other bookings have included weddings, where Revels in Hand performed extracts from As You Like It in the aisle just the after the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I dos\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd). The production company has also been booked to perform on a yacht in the Mediterranean.</p> \n<p>\u00e2\u20ac\u0153It should be like a much more culturally sound version of watching a chick flick,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Eaton said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve joked that we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re competing with Netflix but without a TV screen \u00e2\u20ac\u201c it is your living room or garden that the characters are inhabiting.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd</p> \n<p>Olivia, a 42-year-old executive in the City who did not want to give her surname, said she had twice booked Revels in Hand to perform at her house in Chelsea. For a John Van Druten play arranged for her children, guests were welcomed with canap\u00c3\u00a9s and drinks before one of the characters burst into the room with his first line. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153There was a palpable sense of excitement and \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcwhat\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s going on here?\u00e2\u20ac\u2122,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Olivia said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153In the front or second row you feel so exposed; they are just lying on the bed right there. You could reach out and touch them.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd</p> \n<p>She said the experience was a lot more exciting and funnier than going to a theatre \u00e2\u20ac\u0153and you have champagne and canap\u00c3\u00a9s circling throughout the performance\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd.</p> \n<p>The executive also booked the company for her 40th birthday party. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I have seen well over a 100 productions over the last few years in London and New York, and this was the only time I felt part of the play,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd she said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153They really draw you in and they make it personal. At the end all of our friends were on their feet.</p> \n<p>\u00e2\u20ac\u0153And, afterwards they [the actors] stayed for a glass of wine before dinner. How many times have you gone to the theatre and wanted to tell the actors to their faces how great they were. With this you really can.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Guardian business email sign-up\"> \n <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/3887\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for&nbsp;Business&nbsp;Today\" data-form-description=\"Get the headlines and editors' picks every weekday morning.\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk\n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>She declined to state how much the productions cost, saying only that it was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a lot of money\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd.

                "bodyText":"Eleven people are looking on as a couple argue in bed on the 39th floor of the Shard tower in London. They are not shooting a porn film but indulging in the latest must-have for the wealthy: a private West End theatre production. This week the \u00c2\u00a310,000-a-night Shangri-La suite of the Shard was transformed into a 1930s apartment for the setting of No\u00c3\u00abl Coward\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Tonight at 8:30, a cycle of one-act comic plays. Next week it could be Pinter in your living room, Shakespeare at your Hamptons summer house or even Wilde on the deck of your superyacht. If you have the money, production crews promise to transform any space into a theatre set and actors will create \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the most intimate play you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve ever seen\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. The producer Lucy Eaton, 30, said she hit upon the idea of offering the wealthy private performances after putting on a play in a super-rich patron\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s house after a theatre pulled out at the last minute. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It was an incredible experience and the guest said they were so sold on the intimacy of it,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd she said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We thought: \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcThis could be an absolutely wonderful idea, bringing theatre to you.\u00e2\u20ac\u2122\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Eaton and her partners formed the production company Revels in Hand and have put on A Midsummer Night\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dream in a walled garden in Chelsea, west London, transformed a private polo field into a living room for Coward\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ways and Means and flown actors out to New York to put on plays at a wealthy backer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s property in the Hamptons. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This is theatre in its purest form. Inviting actors to one\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s home or to a private gathering was the thing to do in Shakespearean times and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our ambition to revive this definitive form of entertainment, so loved by the aristocracy and royalty,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Eaton said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153You and your guests are so up close and personal with the actors you can see the laughter lines.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The intimate experience does not come cheap. The average price of production is \u00c2\u00a35,000 and longer or more complex plays can cost a lot more. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It is expensive,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Eaton said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153But it really is an elite luxury experience for lords, sheikhs and CEOs.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd She said her company had created productions for all three categories but she was prevented from sharing the details because of non-disclosure agreements. The weirdest location so far, she said, was a polo field at a country estate near London. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The funniest thing was we were offering two plays at the time \u00e2\u20ac\u201c one was set in a living room and the other was A Midsummer Night\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dream,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd she said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153They asked for the living room one, despite the polo field kind of being perfect for A Midsummer Night\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dream. They got their staff to move a vast amount of furniture on to the polo field to make it a living room.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Other bookings have included weddings, where Revels in Hand performed extracts from As You Like It in the aisle just the after the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I dos\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd). The production company has also been booked to perform on a yacht in the Mediterranean. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It should be like a much more culturally sound version of watching a chick flick,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Eaton said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve joked that we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re competing with Netflix but without a TV screen \u00e2\u20ac\u201c it is your living room or garden that the characters are inhabiting.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Olivia, a 42-year-old executive in the City who did not want to give her surname, said she had twice booked Revels in Hand to perform at her house in Chelsea. For a John Van Druten play arranged for her children, guests were welcomed with canap\u00c3\u00a9s and drinks before one of the characters burst into the room with his first line. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153There was a palpable sense of excitement and \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcwhat\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s going on here?\u00e2\u20ac\u2122,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Olivia said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153In the front or second row you feel so exposed; they are just lying on the bed right there. You could reach out and touch them.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd She said the experience was a lot more exciting and funnier than going to a theatre \u00e2\u20ac\u0153and you have champagne and canap\u00c3\u00a9s circling throughout the performance\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. The executive also booked the company for her 40th birthday party. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I have seen well over a 100 productions over the last few years in London and New York, and this was the only time I felt part of the play,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd she said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153They really draw you in and they make it personal. At the end all of our friends were on their feet. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153And, afterwards they [the actors] stayed for a glass of wine before dinner. How many times have you gone to the theatre and wanted to tell the actors to their faces how great they were. With this you really can.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd She declined to state how much the productions cost, saying only that it was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a lot of money\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. She added: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153But it is really special. People do all sorts of lavish things with their money but with this what you get really is incredible. It truly is like having the West End in your sitting room.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Eaton, who studied at the University of Cambridge and the London Academy of Music and Dramatic Art, conceded that the cost was out of reach of the vast majority of people.

Measured by the harmonized European consumer price index, headline inflation remained unchanged at 2.1%, suggesting that headline inflation in the entire Eurozone (to be released tomorrow) could have hit the 2%-mark for the fourth time in the last five years.<br></p> <p>Returning to Germany, headline inflation at around 2% YoY, however, is still less the result of the ECB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ultra-loose monetary policy but rather the result of higher energy prices. In fact, where available, regional core inflation measures remained broadly unchanged and only slightly above 1%, indicating that underlying inflationary pressures in the German economy remain low. Judging from the available components, German inflation data still tells a two-sided story: while prices for consumer goods have gradually accelerated in recent months, inflation on services has slowed down and has even been negative for a couple of months for communication. Also, whether it was the World Cup effect or just the ordinary sales season is hard to tell, but prices for clothing and shoes were the biggest drag on headline inflation.</p> <p>Looking ahead, there are still little signs supporting the ECB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s general optimism that underlying inflation in the entire Eurozone is picking up. Despite a very long economic cycle, low unemployment and rising wages, the German economy shows little sign of overheating, not even a significant pick-up in underlying inflation. Instead, headline inflation is mainly dominated by external and one-off factors. In this regard, the current heatwave could push up food prices and hence headline inflation in the coming months. But with little upside pressure on underlying inflation, chances that headline inflation will fall back under 2% towards the end of the year are much higher than staying at, or closely above, the 2%-mark.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5b5ef322e4b09ef967470779\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-07-30T11:17:23.589Z\">12.17pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Oil prices are moving higher, helped by last week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s strong growth figures from the US.</p> <p>The prospects of sanctions on Iran denting supply is also supporting the market, although the continuing trade tensions between the US and China are a dampening influence.</p> <p>Brent crude is currently up 0.75% at $74.85 a barrel while West Texas Intermediate - the US benchmark - is 1.76% better at $69.9. <br></p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5b5ee9d2e4b0a09780004cd7\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-07-30T10:36:18.726Z\">11.36am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the Press Association on the UK lending figures:</p> <blockquote> <p>The number of mortgage approvals made to home-buyers jumped to a five-month high in June, Bank of England figures show.</p> <p>Some 65,619 mortgages got the green light for house purchase - the highest monthly total since January.</p> <p>Re-mortgage approvals fell by 7.3% month on month, with 47,895 loans approved in June.

Economic sentiment decreased slightly in July, adding to the view that the current pace of 0.4% GDP growth QoQ is more or less the cruising speed for 2018. The PMI and ESI sent differing signals about the performance of industry and services. The PMI saw a decline in the services index, while the ESI saw improvements and while the PMI indicated stable manufacturing conditions, the ESI industry indicator dropped. Overall, the picture was less positive from a business perspective for both surveys, while the ESI indicated stable consumer confidence.</p> <p>While disappointment with current economic conditions seems to be par for the course at the moment, growth concerns seem to be overstating the current situation somewhat. The outlook for domestic demand remains quite bright with continued employment recovery and some improvements in wage growth. The outlook for the external environment remains uncertain thanks to trade war concerns, although recent developments have been more positive. Even though a trade war has far from been avoided, last week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meeting between US President Trump and European Commission President Juncker at least cleared the air for the moment and could be positive for Eurozone sentiment.

                "bodyText":"Markets remain edgy after technology shares remain unloved in the wake of disappointing updates last week from Facebook and Twitter. Investors are also cautious ahead of a raft of central bank meetings this week, including the Bank of Japan, the US Federal Reserve and the Bank of England. The FTSE 100 is virtually flat while Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax is down 0.29% and France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac has slipped 0.18%. On Wall Street the Dow Jones Industrial Average is up 0.12% while the technology heavy Nasdaq index is down 0.49%. On the economics front, confidence across the European Union held up this month with the European Commission figures showing a pick-up in sentiment in the UK. Still with the UK, mortgage approvals hit a five month high while in Germany, inflation was steady in July. On that note, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time to close for the day. Thanks for your comments, and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be back tomorrow. Better than expected second quarter earnings from industrial giant Caterpillar have given some support to struggling US markets. The heavy equipment maker raised its outlook for the full year, easing fears that the continuing trade dispute between the US and China would badly damage corporate profits. The Dow Jones Industrial Average has edged up 13 points or 0.07% in early trading while the S&amp;P 500 is up 0.01%. But last week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tech sell-off continues to undermine the Nasdaq Composite, which has dipped 0.27%. Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s inflation rate remained steady in July, above the European Central Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s target of 2%. Consumer prices rose 2.1% year on year, the same as the previous month, according to the Federal Statistics Office. That was the figure harmonised with the rest of the European Union - without that it was within the 2% target and down from 2.1% the previous month. Economist Carsten Brzeski at ING Bank said the figures provided little evidence of a sustainable increase in underlying inflation: Based on the results of seven regional states, German headline inflation recorded another marginal drop and slowed down to 2.0% year on year in July, from 2.1.% YoY in June and 2.2% YoY in May. Measured by the harmonized European consumer price index, headline inflation remained unchanged at 2.1%, suggesting that headline inflation in the entire Eurozone (to be released tomorrow) could have hit the 2%-mark for the fourth time in the last five years. Returning to Germany, headline inflation at around 2% YoY, however, is still less the result of the ECB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ultra-loose monetary policy but rather the result of higher energy prices. In fact, where available, regional core inflation measures remained broadly unchanged and only slightly above 1%, indicating that underlying inflationary pressures in the German economy remain low. Judging from the available components, German inflation data still tells a two-sided story: while prices for consumer goods have gradually accelerated in recent months, inflation on services has slowed down and has even been negative for a couple of months for communication. Also, whether it was the World Cup effect or just the ordinary sales season is hard to tell, but prices for clothing and shoes were the biggest drag on headline inflation. Looking ahead, there are still little signs supporting the ECB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s general optimism that underlying inflation in the entire Eurozone is picking up. Despite a very long economic cycle, low unemployment and rising wages, the German economy shows little sign of overheating, not even a significant pick-up in underlying inflation. Instead, headline inflation is mainly dominated by external and one-off factors. In this regard, the current heatwave could push up food prices and hence headline inflation in the coming months. But with little upside pressure on underlying inflation, chances that headline inflation will fall back under 2% towards the end of the year are much higher than staying at, or closely above, the 2%-mark. Oil prices are moving higher, helped by last week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s strong growth figures from the US. The prospects of sanctions on Iran denting supply is also supporting the market, although the continuing trade tensions between the US and China are a dampening influence. Brent crude is currently up 0.75% at $74.85 a barrel while West Texas Intermediate - the US benchmark - is 1.76% better at $69.9. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the Press Association on the UK lending figures: The number of mortgage approvals made to home-buyers jumped to a five-month high in June, Bank of England figures show. Some 65,619 mortgages got the green light for house purchase - the highest monthly total since January. Re-mortgage approvals fell by 7.3% month on month, with 47,895 loans approved in June. Despite the drop-off, the Bank said \u00e2\u20ac\u0153re-mortgaging approvals remain broadly in line with the average over 2018 so far\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd... The Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Money and Credit report also said that, excluding mortgages, households\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 annual growth in borrowing \u00e2\u20ac\u0153remained stable\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd at 8.8% in June. It said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Credit cards have been accounting for an increasing share of consumer credit growth over the past couple of years and the growth rate of credit card lending has exceeded that of other loans and advances (which includes personal loans, overdrafts and car finance) since January 2018.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Annual credit card growth stood at 9.5% in June, compared with 8.5% annual growth in other loans and advances. Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said the continued strength in non-mortgage borrowing \u00e2\u20ac\u0153is symptomatic of the pressure on consumers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 finances, rather than rising confidence about the outlook for their incomes\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. The recent volatility in tech shares could herald a tricky summer for markets, says David Cheetham, chief market analyst at online trading platform XTB: The summer months are often seen as doldrums as far as the markets are concerned with the perception dating back several centuries and characterised succinctly with the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153sell-in-May\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd trading adage. However, there have been some large moves in recent years and there are growing signs that we could be set for another turbulent August as we saw in 2011 and 2015. The root causes of those plunges were the Eurozone debt crisis and fears of a Chinese slowdown, and while the latter of the two could in particular resurface in the not too distant future the early signs this time around, should another plunge occur, seem to be in US tech stocks. Last week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stunning drop in Facebook caught many off guard and serves as a timely reminder that the latest leg higher in US markets has come on a narrowing breadth and increasingly ambitious price multiples. There remains much to occur before we even get anywhere near the panic seen in previous August\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s but there are a growing set of circumstance arising which may spark a period of heightened volatility. Speaking of the Bank of England rate-setting meeting on Thursday, Stefan Koopman, market economist at Rabobank, says: This meeting is Mark Carney\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s leap of faith. He has led the markets to expect a rate rise, so he now has little choice but to follow through or risk losing credibility. The good news is that after disappointing economic data earlier in the year, we expect to see 0.4% GDP growth this quarter. With there being evidence to show that the Q1 dip was weather-related rather than a structural, the Bank appears to have the platform to push through a hike. The only plausible reason we could see behind interest rates remaining flat would be the ongoing uncertainty around Brexit. But if rates do stay at 0.5% this time, we wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t expect another rise until there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s more clarity around the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s departure from the European Union. The pound is having an uncertain time as investors try to decide whether or not an interest rate rise is coming this week. Against the dollar it has edged up 0.15% to $1.3122 while against the euro it is down 0.18% at \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.1226. Sterling is of course being influenced not only by the prospect of a rate rise but the continuing Brexit discussions and the progress (or lack of it) being made by the government. Ahead of the latest eurozone GDP figures due on Tuesday, ING economist Bert Colijn said: We don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t expect tomorrow\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s GDP data for Q2 to have improved from the disappointing Q1 and it does not look like Q3 has started on a stronger footing. Economic sentiment decreased slightly in July, adding to the view that the current pace of 0.4% GDP growth QoQ is more or less the cruising speed for 2018. The PMI and ESI sent differing signals about the performance of industry and services. The PMI saw a decline in the services index, while the ESI saw improvements and while the PMI indicated stable manufacturing conditions, the ESI industry indicator dropped. Overall, the picture was less positive from a business perspective for both surveys, while the ESI indicated stable consumer confidence. While disappointment with current economic conditions seems to be par for the course at the moment, growth concerns seem to be overstating the current situation somewhat. The outlook for domestic demand remains quite bright with continued employment recovery and some improvements in wage growth. The outlook for the external environment remains uncertain thanks to trade war concerns, although recent developments have been more positive. Even though a trade war has far from been avoided, last week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meeting between US President Trump and European Commission President Juncker at least cleared the air for the moment and could be positive for Eurozone sentiment. The Eurozone economy has shifted into a lower gear for now, but the expansion does not seem to be at risk. Business confidence across Europe remained fairly stable in July with a particularly strong performance from the UK, according to the latest figures. The EC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economic sentiment indicator for the eurozone was down just 0.2 points at 112.1 while for the wider European Union it edged up 0.1 points to 112.3. The commission said: Broadly unchanged euro-area sentiment resulted from decreases in industry and retail trade confidence, which were offset by an increase in the services sector. Confidence in construction remained broadly stable while it stayed unchanged among consumers. The marginally better outcome of the headline indicator for the EU (+0.1) was mainly due to the marked improvement of sentiment in the largest non-euro area EU economy, the UK (+1.6) More on the UK borrowing figures: Signs of life in the UK housing market, as mortgage approvals picked up last month. Bank of England figures showed approvals rising from 64,684 in May to 65,619, slightly better than expected and hitting a five month high. Net mortgage lending rose by \u00c2\u00a33.851bn while consumer lending increased by \u00c2\u00a31.567bn. Some bad news from Heineken, the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s second-largest beer maker. Reuters reports: [The company] cut its full-year margin forecasts due to currency weakness in some more profitable markets and expansion in Brazil, knocking its shares on Monday. The brewer of Heineken lager, Tiger, Sol and Strongbow cider reported first-half earnings below market expectations and said its operating margin would decline by 20 basis points in 2018, compared with a previous forecast of a 25 basis point increase, after it fell sharply in the first six months. Overall, the brewer sold more beer in the first six months of 2018 than expected, with growth rose steepest in its two most profitable markets, Vietnam and Mexico, along with Brazil, Cambodia, South Africa, Ethiopia and Russia. Heineken shares traded down 6.0 percent at 86.84 euros, by far the weakest performers in the FTSEurofirst index of leading European shares. The Dutch brewer, whose Heineken lager is the top seller in Europe, said the new guidance was because of the negative translational hit from currencies concentrated more in its higher margin countries, such as Vietnam, and a larger dilutive effect of its expanding Brazilian business. Heineken acquired the loss-making Brazilian operations of Japan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Kirin in 2017 to become the number two player in the South America country, and had previously warned of an impact on its margins. The latest Twitter comments from the US president have moved away from trade disputes for the moments, which may give some relief to investors, says Paul Donovan, chief economist at UBS Global Wealth Management: US President Trump has been active on Twitter. Most of the tweets are about media and the Mueller investigation, and do not matter to markets. However, there was also a threat of shutting down the US government if US President Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u0153big, beautiful wall\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd is not approved by Congress. There is a 30 September budget deadline. Markets may be somewhat relieved that the political focus of the Trump Twitter Feed has shifted from trade to immigration. Both matter as long-term economic topics, but trade is a bigger threat to investors in the near term. The downbeat mood continues although it is by no means a rout. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said: The markets got off to a negative start on what is going to be a crazy busy week, with investors caught between last Friday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s US tech-sell-off and the Fed and Bank of England meetings on Wednesday and Thursday respectively. The FTSE \u00e2\u20ac\u201c which is not only facing the much-awaited BoE decision, but the latest PMIs AND updates from nearly a fifth of its constituents \u00e2\u20ac\u201c fell 0.4% after the bell. That dragged the index back under 7700, a level it has struggled to substantially break beyond for most of July. Once again its commodity stocks proved to be an issue, especially its miners, led lower by a 1% drop from copper. While the FTSE struggled, the pound \u00e2\u20ac\u201c for which Thursday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s BoE interest rate decision could be a make or break event \u00e2\u20ac\u201c was fairly serene. Against both the dollar and the euro sterling rose around 0.1%, hitting $1.312 against the former and \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.125 against the latter. As for the Eurozone indices, there were in a similar mood to their UK counterpart. The DAX dipped 35 points, taking it back under 12850, with the CAC slipping 20 points to slip below 5500. In comparison to the UK and US the region doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have a huge amount going on this week, meaning its trading could be driven by the euro\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s relationship to the dollar and pound. GVC, the owner of bookmakers Ladbrokes and Coral, is topping the FTSE 100 risers after confirming a $200m deal with MGM Resorts, the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest casino operator. GVC is currently up more than 5%. Our full story on the deal is here: As expected, European markets have begun the week on a downbeat note, following the tech sell-off on Wall Street on Friady. The FTSE 100 has fallen 25 points or 0.33%, Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax is down 0.27%, France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac has lost 0.4% and Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB is 0.42% lower. On the results front, London focused estate agency Foxtons has slumped into loss as the capital\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s property market continues to struggle. It lost \u00c2\u00a32.5m in the first half compared to a \u00c2\u00a33.8m profit this time last year, and said the outlook was mixed with a subdued sales market. Neil Wilson, chief market analyst at Markets.com, said: Sales are the real problem as the exodus of buyers in the wake of the Brexit vote continues, while higher stamp duty is biting. Sales revenues fell 23% to \u00c2\u00a317.2m. Chief executive Nic Budden finds comfort in London\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcstrong fundamentals as a global hub\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. So he won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be pleased to see Deutsche Bank moving half of its euro clearing out of the capital to Germany. Deutsche is reported by the Financial Times to be moving almost half its euro clearing activities from London to Frankfurt (\u00c2\u00a3). Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Stock markets are expected to open lower after a tech sell-off on Wall Street at the end of last week. Investors are beginning to wonder if the relentless rise of the FAANG companies - Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix and Google (now owned by Alphabet) - could be over. More likely is that there will be increasing divergence between them. Amazon reported stellar results once more and Alphabet easily shook off the effects of a European Commission fine, but Facebook recorded the biggest ever one day loss in value on Thursday after its outlook statement unnerved the market. This followed disappointing results from Netflix a few days earlier. Meanwhile Twitter\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s user numbers saw a 1m fall and its shares plummeted 20% on Friday. So the tech heavy Nasdaq Compositie index lost nearly 1.5% on Friday, which has already fed through into declines in Asian markets. Europe, which on the whole put in a reasonable performance last week after Donald Trump and EC president Jean-Claude Juncker eased trade war fears after a better than expected meeting, is also on course for early losses. The falls in the US came despite news that the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy had grown by 4.1% on an annualised basis. Jasper Lawler, head of research at London Capital Group, said: The US session at the end of last week left traders digesting 4.1% yoy economic growth in the US in addition to another round of tech stocks reporting. After Facebook\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s disappointing update and record breaking sell off, Twitter quickly followed suit. A beat in revenue but a drop off in user activity sent the stock plunging 12% on fears that the platform\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s user growth could be limited. Earnings season had set off to a good start, however tech stock headlines have quickly dominated, transforming perceptions and raising questions over valuations of FAANG stocks. With Netflix, Facebook and now Twitter disappointing with results, investors are seriously questioning these advertising revenues based or subscription-based models. On the other hand, Amazon beat earnings expectations comfortably, whilst Alphabet shrugged off a \u00e2\u201a\u00ac5 billion fine. This original FAANG trade, which petty much guaranteed impressive returns across previous years, suddenly looks a lot more complicated. Whilst prior to the year these stocks could do no wrong, suddenly that is no longer the case. Investors will now be looking ahead to Apple\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s results on Tuesday, with the iPhone maker expected to be closer to the Amazon end of the scale than Facebook, This week also sees a number of central bank meetings. The Bank of England is expected to sanction an interest rate rise on Thursday, but the US Federal Reserve is likely to hold fire a day earlier, albeit it could well give further hints at a September increase. Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK, said: It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the turn of the Bank of Japan, US Federal Reserve and the Bank of England to guide on monetary policy, and while no surprises are expected from the FOMC, we could get some policy tweaks from the Bank of Japan after last week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s interventions in the JGB market. We could also get a rate rise from the Bank of England on Thursday when they meet to run the rule over the UK economy and the latest inflation report. Back to today, and there are a few economic numbers to look out for.
