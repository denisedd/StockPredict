                "bodyText":"European markets have closed higher, as traders welcomed a day without trade war escalation. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE 100 gained 45 points or 0.6% to close at 7953, while the German DAX gained 0.9% and the French CAC picked up 0.75%. The reassuring noises out of Beijing today helped to calm nerves (although perhaps only temporarily), as did the German coalition deal on migration. David Madden of CMC Markets explains: Stocks are higher as improved political relations in Germany and constructive trade comments from China has lifted investor sentiment. Angela Merkel has brokered a deal with Horst Seehofer which will keep their alliance intact. The positive mood might not last long though, as the Social Democrats need to inspect the agreement. An official from the People\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Bank of China announced they will not use the yuan as a tool in the trade spat with the US, and traders are taking this as a step in the right direct for global trading relations. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s probably all for today. GW Time for a quick recap. Chinese central bankers have vowed not to use their currency as a weapon in the trade conflict with the U.S. The People\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Bank of China has pledged to keep the yuan stable, after seeing it slide to its weakest level in almost a year. PBOC insisted that Beijing is committed to upholding \u00e2\u20ac\u0153multilateralism, globalization, free trade and rule-based global guidelines\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, a roll-call of causes under threat from America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s protectionist moves. Sun Guofeng, head of the central bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s financial research institute, told Bloomberg: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Recently the yuan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s exchange rate has shown some weakness. This is entirely due to changes in market expectations as external uncertainties rise rather than intended guidance of the central bank. China upholds multilateralism, globalization, free trade and rule-based international guidelines, and will not make the yuan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s exchange rate a tool to cope with trade conflicts.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd PBOC also pledged to maintain the yuan at a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153reasonable, equilibrium\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd level. This has helped to pull the yuan back up; earlier today it tipped below the 6.7 mark against the US dollar. Donald Trump has defended his policy of pushing other countries to reform their trade rules, or be hit with fresh tariffs. European stock markets are recovering from Monday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s losses. In London, the FTSE 100 is now up 76 points (1%) at 7622. Fiona Cincotta, senior market analyst at City Index, says European investors are relieved that Angela Merkel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s coalition crisis has been resolved. A day after the German interior minister offered his resignation over Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s policy on immigrants, a move that had serious implications on the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s brittle coalition government, Chancellor Angela Merkel managed to pull Germany back from the brink with a last minute deal which has pacified the rebels in her government. There was a collective sigh of relief across European stock markets Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s construction sector has posted stronger growth. Housebuilding helped to push activity up last month, but Brexit uncertainty may be restricting big projects. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no wild dramas on Wall Street...yet anyway. The US stock market has opened calmly, with the Dow Jones industrial average gaining 109 points, or 0.4%. China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s central bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pledge not to use the yuan as a tool in the trade conflict with America is providing some reassurance. But, analyst Marc-Andr\u00c3\u00a9 Fongern believes the PBOC may have to back up its words with actions, and prop up the yuan if it falls again. Indian industrialist S.M. Lodha has warned that Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s attempts to shake up global trade will backfire. Lodha, who chairs UK insulation firm Western Thermal Limited, believes US firms will suffer as the EU, China, Canada and Mexico impose retaliatory tariffs. Lodha explains: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The trade tariffs imposed by President Trump on America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s closest allies including Canada, Mexico, European Union and India, are strategically misplaced and self-defeating as it stands to directly weaken the US economy. The US Chamber of Commerce, the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest lobbying group which has been historically close to Republican administrations, have themselves gone on record to denounce Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s erroneous idea of putting \u00e2\u20ac\u0153America First\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd though trade wars. As President Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s steel tariff directly affects countries including Canada, EU and India, the EU has already warned that an estimated $300 billion worth of US goods could be hit by countermeasures. Even Canada has vowed to impose punitive countermeasures which can see over $12.6 billion worth of American goods being directly hit. Therefore, it is the American exporters who would be bearing a brunt over something the illogical and politically misguided actions of President Trump. If a country imposes tariffs on another, one can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t complain if they retaliate. This is a key \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcArt of the Deal\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Mr Trump seems to have missed.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Newsflash: China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s central bank has promised not to launch a currency war against America. Bloomberg has the details: China is committed to multilateralism, globalization, free trade and rule-based global guidelines, Sun Guofeng, director of the PBOC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s financial research institute, said in a written response to Bloomberg News. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s an interesting pledge, given that the yuan (which is tightly controlled by Beijing) fell to an 11-month low today. Even the PBOC can only have so much effect - if Chinese companies and wealthy citizens try to move capital overseas, the yuan will fall. A weaker yuan also helps Chinese exporters, allowing them to cut prices and cushion the blow of US tariffs. Sun Guofeng\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pledge seems to be reassuring the markets, pushing the yuan a little higher against the US dollar away from today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 6.7 low. The Treasury committee has been quizzing tax experts this morning, and hearing that online giants are still getting an unfair advantage. Charlie Elphicke, Tory MP for Dover and Deal, asked Richard Allen, the founder of group Retailers Against VAT Abuse Schemes, whether recent changes in the Finance Act had been effective in cracking down on VAT fraud by sellers on Ebay, Amazon and other online marketplaces. Allen replied that the measures were not tough enough and that legislation was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153more relaxed\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd than in Germany. Elphicke asked: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Compared to Germany, our taxpayers are still being taken for a ride and Amazon are still in a position where they are not having to hand over information?\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Allen agreed, saying: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Small traders get very annoyed when they find themselves being investigated for VAT when big companies don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t seem to get the same kind of attention. I was told by senior officials they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d been instructed, HMRC had been instructed not to go too hard on Amazon yet.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd This has resulted in online firms having an unfair competitive advantage over high street retailers. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The regulatory environment in which these online businesses operate is not as tough as the regulatory environment for highstreet retailers.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Allen added: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153You couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t sell dangerous products in a shop. You couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t openly sell goods where there is no VAT charge in a shop\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 There is a huge imbalance between online retail and high street retail.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd His biggest concern is that online retailers are unregulated private marketplaces operated by one company. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The owner of a private marketplace online gets to see the sales data of everyone selling on that platform and can use that to their advantage selling products themselves.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd This means \u00e2\u20ac\u0153they can manipulate prices on their own marketplace,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Allen said, adding that Amazon sometimes sold lost leaders to maintain its market position. He is backing a VAT surcharge on overseas retailers selling goods in Britain \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a similar measure is working well in Australia, he said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It would introduce an extra cost on these cheap imports that would protect British retailers from an avalanche of cheap stuff\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Exactly 49 days before Greece exits its third and final EU-sponsored bailout programme, the bloc\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economic and financial affairs commissioner Pierre Moscovici is visiting the country \u00e2\u20ac\u201c with a message of hope. Helena Smith reports from Athens: The French have done more to back Greece than any other euro zone member in the nine years since the country almost crashed on the rocks of bankruptcy and as one of Paris\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 most prominent politicians, Pierre Moscovici is an embodiment of that support. On a flying one-day visit Tuesday, the EU\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economics chief insisted there were no ifs and buts to Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ordeal finally being over. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The time has come for Greece to be a normal country,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Moscovici emphasising that oversight of the nation once it exited its last economic adjustment program would not amount to a fourth bailout. He told the Greek parliament: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153There is no more program for Greece. There won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be any more programs for Greece.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Meeting the nation\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s head of state earlier, Moscovici said the agreement euro zone countries had reached last month to reduce the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s staggering debt load had \u00e2\u20ac\u0153opened a new road with new conditions and prospects\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd for Greece. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I know well that the story that we all experienced had tragic aspects and was dangerous for the euro zone and very, very difficult for the Greeks,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said referring to the depression the country had suffered as it applied tough austerity and structural reforms in exchange for rescue funds. Moscovici added he would never forget the pensioners who had had their pensions slashed, workers who had lost jobs, and families who had seen their children leave for wealthier climes. Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s finance minister, Euclid Tsakalotos, who also met Moscovici, praised his supra-nationalism saying he and his team had worked for the good of Europe even if along the way \u00e2\u20ac\u0153we had very big disagreements.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Greece exits its third bailout programme on August 20. Another early start for the US president...and a chance to bang the drum for trade reform. I suspect \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcmost countries\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 would also rather the president tackled the issue in a more multilateral way, rather than using \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcnational security threats\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 to justify new tariffs on nations that saw themselves as US allies.... Good news from Ireland: the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s jobless rate has hit a 10-year low. Irish unemployment fell to just 5.1% in June, the central statistics office reports. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not been this low since October 2007, just after the credit crunch struck. Ireland\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s jobless rate has been falling steadily since its bailout ended in 2013, and is someway below the eurozone average of over 8%. World stock markets are staging a recovery from yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s slides, after China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s central bank tried to calm the panic. In London, the FTSE 100 has gained 32 points or 0.44% to 7580 (it would be more, but for Glencore\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s slump). The other European markets are also up, with Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s DAX leading the way after Angela Merkel resolved the migration dispute that was threatening to rip her coalition apart. Investors have been cheered by the People\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Bank of China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pledge to protect the yuan at a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153reasonable, equilibrium\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd level, after it hit an 11-month low toda. Although we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve not got details, that feels like a promise not to allow the yuan to plunge alarmingly. Even so, trade war fears still dominate the markets - with America and China set to impose retaliatory tariffs on tens of billions of dollars of exports later this week. Mihir Kapadia, founder of Sun Global Investments, explains: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153At the end of the Asian trading day, markets in China are in a more nervous state than last week as investors fear the dispute between the United States and other nations will have a significant and serious impact on global growth. The Chinese yuan fell to an 11 month low, unsettling investors and causing the Chinese central bank to pledge to keep the currency stable. Despite similar tensions over tariffs on EU goods, European markets saw some relief on the back of a migration deal that appears to have helped to stabilise Merkel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s coalition government and has allayed fears of German political uncertainty at least for the time being. With President Trump setting an implementation deadline for the extra US$ 200bn of tariffs against China for this Friday, the markets reflect the anxiety and concern of many investors and stockholders with multi-billion dollar tariffs due to hit the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s second biggest economy. With the dispute continuing to escalate, it is likely that global markets will feel the force of the tariffs set to be imposed by both nations, with Chinese companies likely to be hit the hardest.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a little early, but we should raise a glass to Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s gin industry, which has enjoyed a bumper year. Sales of UK-produced gin jumped by 32.5% in 2017 to \u00c2\u00a3461m, the Office for National Statistics reports. That follows a spate of new distillery openings across the country, the rise of \u00e2\u20ac\u02dccraft\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 or artisan gins, and even special gin festivals. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s food producers were the largest division of UK manufacturing, creating \u00c2\u00a370bn of products sold at home and around the world. Petrol cars were the biggest single product category last year, with sales over \u00c2\u00a320bn. Aircraft parts and diesel cars were also very significant . Beer also shone last year, breaking back into the list of top 10 products. More here. Hold on. Max Jones, global Corporates relationship director for construction at Lloyds Bank Commercial Banking, argues that Brexit is hurting the UK building sector. He points out that large construction projects are being held back, despite the rise in activity last month: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The industry has regained some confidence after the lows of earlier this year. The bounce-back in Q2 appears to confirm that much of the weakness in the first quarter was the result of shutdowns in the wake of the Beast from the East rather than anything more structural. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153But the sector is hardly motoring, with some large contractors blaming Brexit uncertainty for the delay or cancellation of projects. The London market also looks significantly exposed to any reduction in EU labour. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Nevertheless, the announcement of approval for a new runway at Heathrow has boosted sentiment in the sector, if not yet order books and revenue. But with Heathrow, Hinkley Point and HS2 all now given the green light, the focus shifts to the next mega-project that will offer firms comfort and visibility over their long-term pipelines.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s construction sector appears to be shrugging off economic anxiety (despite the looming shadow of Brexit), says Duncan Brock, Group Director at the Chartered Institute of Procurement &amp; Supply. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153With the fastest rise in new orders since May 2017, it appears the brakes are off for the construction sector. Despite being hampered by economic uncertainty, firms reported an improved pipeline of work as clients committed to projects and hesitancy was swept away. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Input prices were a challenge with the biggest inflationary rise since September 2017, so the pressure was on to build up stocks of materials rising in price and becoming more scarce. This resulted in a heavy impact on suppliers unable to keep pace as deliveries became laboured and purchasing managers were at their busiest for two and a half years. Newsflash: Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s housing sector has strengthened, thanks to a pick-up in house-building. Data firm Markit reports that construction activity accelerated last month, at the fastest pace since November 2017. New orders jumped, prompting companies to splash out on new materials - driving prices up. This all propelled Markit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s construction PMI (which measures activity) up to 53.1 in June, from 52.5 in May, beating expectations. Encouragingly, optimism in the construction sector picked up in June, from May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s seven-month low. Tim Moore, associate director at IHS Markit, says Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s builders are getting back to work after the winter slowdown. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The latest increase in UK construction output marks three months of sustained recovery from the snow-related disruption seen back in March. A solid contribution from house building helped to drive up overall construction activity in June, while a lack of new work to replace completed civil engineering projects continued to hold back growth. I\u00e2\u20ac\ufffdll pull together some reaction now. The DoJ subpoena means problems are mounting up for Glencore. Bloomberg\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Thomas Biesheuvel explains: It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been a tumultuous year for Glencore, mostly due to challenges linked to its business in the Congo, where it operates giant copper and cobalt mines. The Swiss company trader and miner is already facing the possibility of a bribery investigation by U.K. prosecutors over its work with Dan Gertler, an Israeli billionaire and close friend of Congo President Joseph Kabila, people familiar with the situation said in May. Last November, the Paradise Papers expose showed Glencore\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s links to Israeli mining billionaire Dan Gertler in Africa, including in the DRC. Wow. Around \u00c2\u00a35bn has been wiped off Glencore\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s value by today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s selloff. Newsflash: The world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest commodity trading firm is caught up in a US investigation. Glencore told the City that it has received a subpoena from the US Department of Justice, asking for documents covering its activities in Nigeria, the Democratic Republic of Congo and Venezuela. The investigation relates to US laws covering money-laundering and bribery of foreign officials. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the statement: Glencore Ltd, a subsidiary of Glencore plc, has received a subpoena dated 2 July, 2018 from the US Department of Justice to produce documents and other records with respect to compliance with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and United States money laundering statutes. The requested documents relate to the Glencore Group\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s business in Nigeria, the Democratic Republic of Congo and Venezuela from 2007 to present. Glencore is reviewing the subpoena and will provide further information in due course as appropriate. Glencore shares have tumbled by 9% as City traders digest the news, hitting their lowest level in almost a year: China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s top central banker has blamed America for the yuan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s weakness. In a statement, Yi Gang, governor of the People\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Bank of China (PBOC), says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Recently, there have been some fluctuations in the foreign exchange market. We are paying close attention to this, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This is mainly due to factors such as the strengthening of the U.S. dollar and external uncertainties.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Yi does have a point - emerging market currencies are all suffering from the dollar\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s revival. The Vietnamese dong has also been under pressure, hitting an all-time low against the dollar today. The People\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Bank of China has launched an attempt to reassure Chinese investors and prevent the yuan falling further. In a statement released a few minutes ago, PBOC says it is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153closely watching\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd moves in the foreign exchange markets. Importantly, the Bank is also pledging to keep the yuan \u00e2\u20ac\u0153stable\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd at a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153reasonable, equilibrium\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd level. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also promising to maintain prudent and neutral monetary policy. This \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcverbal operation\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 seems to be having an effect - the yuan is dragging itself back off the mat, recovering some (but not all!) of its losses today. ING\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s China economist Iris Pang also blames Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tariffs for causing the yuan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decline, saying: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s depreciation is market-driven, reflecting the risks of a trade war. This implies that the central bank is allowing market forces to dictate the speed of the depreciation when there is room to do so.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Chinese banks scrambled to prop up the yuan after it fell through the 6.7 level against the US dollar this morning. Bloomberg explains: Chinese banks were seen selling dollars after the yuan weakened past a key level, stoking speculation that authorities were seeking to slow the losses. The yuan was 0.5% lower at 6.6981 per dollar at 11:31 a.m. in Shanghai after earlier falling to 6.7204. Some Chinese major banks sold the dollar in the swaps market, according to four traders. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no escape from trade war fears today. Asian stock markets have fallen to their lowest levels since last autumn, after Donald Trump refused to cave into international pressure over his tariffs. A volatile day\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trading saw China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Shanghai Composite index shed another 1.9% to a 28-month low, before rebounding in a late rally. The Chinese yuan also had a bad day, sliding against the dollar to its weakest level in almost a year. Both the onshore and offshore yuan have fallen through the 6.7 per dollar level for the first time since August 2017. The selloff suggests that Asian investors have been badly shaken by the looming tit-for-tat tariffs between China and America. US tariffs on $34 billion of Chinese products are due to kick in on July 6, with China set to retaliate with duties of its own on the same value of American goods. A trade was could hurt China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy badly, at a time when Beijing is trying to tackle its shadow banking sector and continue the evolution from a manufacturing-driven economy to a services-led one. Hussein Sayed, Chief Market Strategist at FXTM, says the sharp depreciation in the Chinese currency is worrying investors. He reminds us that a similar slump three years ago spooked the global markets: In August 2015, USD-CNY appreciated from 6.21 to 6.44, a two-day gain of 3.85%. As a result, global stock markets sold off sharply as investors feared the beginning of a currency war. With trade tensions increasing day by day, Beijing might be playing this game as a tool in its trade war with the U.S. However, such a strategy will be a double-edged sword as it might also lead to a flight of capital which the PBoC is well aware of. Although the Chinese currency depreciated 3.23% in June, it didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t sound quite so alarming, given that the Dollar appreciated against most major currencies in May and June. Going forward it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s going to be about the pace and magnitude of the currency moves that will drive equity markets. CNYUSD traded at 6.70 at the time of writing and will keep a close eye on 6.96, the lowest level reached in January 2017. The White House is pressing on with its plans to penalise trading partners unless they give America a better deal. Yesterday, president Trump insisted that the World Trade Organisation must reform, after \u00e2\u20ac\u0153treating us very badly for many, many years.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Also coming up today: A new healthcheck on Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s builders is published this morning. The construction PMI is expected to show another month of slow growth, as the collapse of Carillion in January continues to ripple through the sector European stock markets are expected to rise, after Angela Merkel reached a deal on migration with interior minister, Horst Seehofer that should prevent her coalition from collapsing. We also get new eurozone retail sales and US manufacturing orders data, which will show whether trade war fears are having an impact. The agenda 9.30am BST: UK construction PMI for June 10am BST: Eurozone retail sales for June 3pm BST: UK factory orders for May",
