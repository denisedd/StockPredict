Unlike controversial \u201clab-grown\u201d meats being developed in the US, the Beyond burger is made entirely from plants, does not use animal stem-cells in production, and is not tested on animals.

Reuters reports:</p> <blockquote> <p>Powell, questioned by members of a House congressional committee, repeated on Wednesday that rising world protectionism would over time pose a risk to a U.S. and global expansion that appears largely on track to continue.</p> <p>\u201cIf this process leads to a world of higher tariffs on a wide range of goods and services that are traded and those are sustained for a longer period of time, if it results in a more protectionist world, that would be bad for our economy,\u201d Powell told the House Financial Services Committee. \u201cIt isn\u2019t up to us to criticise (administration) policies. But the evidence is clear that countries that remain open to trade have higher productivity. They have higher incomes.\u201d</p> <p>Powell\u2019s appearance largely retraced the testimony and questioning from a Tuesday hearing with the Senate Banking Committee.</p> <p>In prepared testimony and an accompanying report Powell depicted a U.S. economy poised for perhaps years more continued growth, with the central bank close to its goals of maximum employment and inflation stable at around 2 percent.</p> <p>But as with senators the day before, House members zeroed in on the possible economic consequences of the Trump administration\u2019s imposition of tariffs, with threats of more to come, in the name of cutting better trade deals with both allies like Canada and rivals like China.</p> <p>Powell has tried to walk a fine line in his responses, at once steering clear of direct criticism of the president who appointed him, while also making the economic consequences clear.</p> <p>Powell said he thought the administration\u2019s aim was to ultimately lower tariffs worldwide, and if there was disruption in the meantime \u201cit might be worth paying a bit of a short-term price to get to a better place.\u201d</p> <p>At the same time, he and other Fed officials have been clear that businesses are telling them that they already are changing spending and investment plans because of the risks and uncertainties around a possible trade conflict.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5b4f68e5e4b0afc5fe58276d\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-07-18T16:23:31.204Z\">5.23pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Troubled UK outsourcer Capita has seen its shares fall around 2.5% after it said its finance director is stepping down.</p> <p>It said Nick Greatorex would stay with the company for the next few months as it searched for a replacement.

Fiona Cincotta, senior market analyst at City Index, said: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The pound tumbled to a 10-month low versus the dollar after inflation in June failed to tick high...</p> <p>These figures could give the BoE reasons to pause for thought over an August rate hike. With inflation steady at a one year low and average wages slipping, the central bank could have problems justifying the need for a rate hike. Policy makers could use the argument of recovering economic growth over the last few months, however the inflation figures show that growth is not at levels where it is starting to push up inflation. From whichever angle you look at this the data so far this week has not been supportive of an interest rate rise. Instead we are in danger of seeing a repeat of May, where weak data leading up to the MPC meeting prevented the widely expected rate hike. The market expectations of a rate hike slipped to 72% from 77% prior to the release.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2018-07-18T15:52:51.273Z\">at 4.52pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5b4f53cae4b0a426f7db4b53\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-07-18T14:51:33.877Z\">3.51pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Back with Google, and Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>In a way Google has become a victim of its own success in terms of its search and marketing capabilities, with little in the way of alternative search and browser options available.

The bigger issue here may be the obvious benefits to Amazon (and potentially Apple) from the ruling; first, even though Amazon already generates ~50% of commerce and product-related searches, the EC will require Android users to take another step before they can access an alternative product search engine. Secondly, to force Google to support distribution of forked-versions of Android (which Google does not control) could directly benefit Amazon\u2019s Fire devices. To use the example cited by Margrethe Vestager in the press conference, the EC argues that Fire smartphones were not commercially successful because Google did not allow manufacturers to pre-install Google apps on those devices (forget the fact that the apps wouldn\u2019t work as well, or at all, on a modified OS.)</p> <p>In order to make an anti-trust argument, the EC needed to argue that Apple iOS (25% market share in Europe) is not a direct competitor to Android, and that Amazon is not a competitor to Google in search. In fact, the EC specifically cites Google/Android having 95% mobile OS market share (outside of China.) While convenient for an anti-trust ruling, we think these assumptions do not reflect the reality of the marketplace. In fact, as others have pointed out numerous times, Apple puts far more restrictions on network operators than Google does, including requirements to pre-install at least 3x as many apps as Google does, while Amazon continues to take share of product search. </p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5b4f41a1e4b0afc5fe5824da\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-07-18T13:39:44.912Z\">2.39pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Google parent Alphabet has said it will accrue the EC fine in the second quarter of 2018, in <a href=\"https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1652044/000119312518220240/d552608d8k.htm\">a filing to the Securities and Exchange Commission.</a></p> <p>Meanwhile its shares have edged marginally higher - up 0.18% - after an initial dip.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5b4f3f76e4b0a426f7db4a14\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-07-18T13:25:20.527Z\">2.25pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Investors will be watching shares in Google parent Alphabet when Wall Street opens shortly.

Last year, over 94 billion apps were downloaded globally from our Play app store; browsers such as Opera Mini and Firefox have been downloaded more than 100 million times, UC Browser more than 500 million times.</p> <p>This is in stark contrast to how things used to be in the 1990s and early 2000s\u2014the dial-up age.

Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell gave his second day of testimony to Congress, including a discussion on the current trade situation following President Trump\u2019s tariffs. Reuters reports: Powell, questioned by members of a House congressional committee, repeated on Wednesday that rising world protectionism would over time pose a risk to a U.S. and global expansion that appears largely on track to continue. \u201cIf this process leads to a world of higher tariffs on a wide range of goods and services that are traded and those are sustained for a longer period of time, if it results in a more protectionist world, that would be bad for our economy,\u201d Powell told the House Financial Services Committee. \u201cIt isn\u2019t up to us to criticise (administration) policies. But the evidence is clear that countries that remain open to trade have higher productivity. They have higher incomes.\u201d Powell\u2019s appearance largely retraced the testimony and questioning from a Tuesday hearing with the Senate Banking Committee. In prepared testimony and an accompanying report Powell depicted a U.S. economy poised for perhaps years more continued growth, with the central bank close to its goals of maximum employment and inflation stable at around 2 percent. But as with senators the day before, House members zeroed in on the possible economic consequences of the Trump administration\u2019s imposition of tariffs, with threats of more to come, in the name of cutting better trade deals with both allies like Canada and rivals like China. Powell has tried to walk a fine line in his responses, at once steering clear of direct criticism of the president who appointed him, while also making the economic consequences clear. Powell said he thought the administration\u2019s aim was to ultimately lower tariffs worldwide, and if there was disruption in the meantime \u201cit might be worth paying a bit of a short-term price to get to a better place.\u201d At the same time, he and other Fed officials have been clear that businesses are telling them that they already are changing spending and investment plans because of the risks and uncertainties around a possible trade conflict. Troubled UK outsourcer Capita has seen its shares fall around 2.5% after it said its finance director is stepping down. It said Nick Greatorex would stay with the company for the next few months as it searched for a replacement. Capita, which is cutting costs as it attempts to cut its debt levels, appointed a new chief executive, Jon Lewis, in December. The pound has pulled back from its lowest levels but is still down on the day. Immediately following the unchanged UK inflation figures, which cast doubt on whether the Bank of England would indeed raise interest rates next month, sterling slid to a 10 month low against the dollar of $1.3011. It is now at $1.3042, still down more than 0.5% on the day. Fiona Cincotta, senior market analyst at City Index, said: The pound tumbled to a 10-month low versus the dollar after inflation in June failed to tick high... These figures could give the BoE reasons to pause for thought over an August rate hike. With inflation steady at a one year low and average wages slipping, the central bank could have problems justifying the need for a rate hike. Policy makers could use the argument of recovering economic growth over the last few months, however the inflation figures show that growth is not at levels where it is starting to push up inflation. From whichever angle you look at this the data so far this week has not been supportive of an interest rate rise. Instead we are in danger of seeing a repeat of May, where weak data leading up to the MPC meeting prevented the widely expected rate hike. The market expectations of a rate hike slipped to 72% from 77% prior to the release. Back with Google, and Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK, said: In a way Google has become a victim of its own success in terms of its search and marketing capabilities, with little in the way of alternative search and browser options available. In terms of browsing there is Firefox, Opera and Microsoft Edge, however search options are more limited, with Yahoo and Bing the more well-known names. The solution is likely to be something similar to the solution which Microsoft implemented a few years ago when it had to unbundle Internet Explorer from its operating system to comply with similar EU antitrust rules, allowing the user to choose their own search and browse options. With Donald Trump\u2019s visit to Nato and Russia hogging the headlines, his trade battle with China seemed to have gone a bit quiet. Now one of his advisors has been talking trade again. Reuters reports: U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s top economic adviser said on Wednesday that Chinese President Xi Jinping was \u201cholding up\u201d a deal to resolve a \u201csignificant trade dispute\u201d between the United States and China. Larry Kudlow, head of the White House Economic Council, also said that he expects European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker to bring a \u201csignificant\u201d trade offer to Trump when he visits Washington next week. The comments were made to CNBC: Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell gave his latest testimony to the US Senate yesterday, and shortly he will be up before the House of Representatives. His testimony is the same to both committees and can be found here. On yesterday\u2019s comments Jasper Lawler, head of research at London Capital Group, said: In his appearance in front of the Senate Banking Committee Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell was unequivocal in his upbeat assessment of the US economy. [He] continued with the Fed\u2019s message to continue raising rates gradually as he sees several years of the jobs market remaining strong and inflation steady around 2%. This was music to the ears of the dollar, providing the greenback a welcome distraction from the trade war noise over recent weeks. Overall US markets have edged ahead in early trading. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is up 19 points or 0.06%, while the S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite are both showing similar percentage gains. Positive results from United Airlines and Morgan Stanley are helping to support industrial and banking shares. The EC ruling on Google is \u201ca bit misguided\u201d but is likely to be a minor inconvenience in the short and medium term, says Colin Sebastian, senior analyst at investment bank Baird. (Given the muted reaction from the company\u2019s share price, the market seems to agree). Sebastian adds: Longer term, we see modest (but not unexpected) added risk from requirements to support forked versions of Android, and secondly, from the direct and/or indirect benefits of this ruling for Apple and Amazon. Overall, this ruling should have a limited direct impact on Google since it ostensibly does not force a change to the Google search algorithm, and it also seems relatively straight-forward for Google to comply. The bigger issue here may be the obvious benefits to Amazon (and potentially Apple) from the ruling; first, even though Amazon already generates ~50% of commerce and product-related searches, the EC will require Android users to take another step before they can access an alternative product search engine. Secondly, to force Google to support distribution of forked-versions of Android (which Google does not control) could directly benefit Amazon\u2019s Fire devices. To use the example cited by Margrethe Vestager in the press conference, the EC argues that Fire smartphones were not commercially successful because Google did not allow manufacturers to pre-install Google apps on those devices (forget the fact that the apps wouldn\u2019t work as well, or at all, on a modified OS.) In order to make an anti-trust argument, the EC needed to argue that Apple iOS (25% market share in Europe) is not a direct competitor to Android, and that Amazon is not a competitor to Google in search. In fact, the EC specifically cites Google/Android having 95% mobile OS market share (outside of China.) While convenient for an anti-trust ruling, we think these assumptions do not reflect the reality of the marketplace. In fact, as others have pointed out numerous times, Apple puts far more restrictions on network operators than Google does, including requirements to pre-install at least 3x as many apps as Google does, while Amazon continues to take share of product search. Google parent Alphabet has said it will accrue the EC fine in the second quarter of 2018, in a filing to the Securities and Exchange Commission. Meanwhile its shares have edged marginally higher - up 0.18% - after an initial dip. Investors will be watching shares in Google parent Alphabet when Wall Street opens shortly. At the moment the pre-market price is showing limited damage from the EC fine, down just 0.25%. Sundar Pichai, Google\u2019s CEO, has issued a statement decrying the EC\u2019s decision, and confirming that the company plans to appeal against its fine. Pichai argues that Google\u2019s open source model (which allows manufacturers to modify Android to their purposes) has been good for competition. He also accuses the Commission of favouring proprietary rivals (such as Apple, which keeps a tight hold on its own operating system). Significantly, Pichai states that Google offers phone makers \u201cthe option of pre-loading a suite of popular Google apps\u201d. The EC, though, accuses Google of using \u201ctying practices\u201d and \u201cexclusivity payments\u201d to prevent rivals app-makers getting a foothold on Android. That\u2019s at the heart of today\u2019s fine. Pichai writes: Today, because of Android, a typical phone comes preloaded with as many as 40 apps from multiple developers, not just the company you bought the phone from. If you prefer other apps\u2014or browsers, or search engines\u2014to the preloaded ones, you can easily disable or delete them, and choose other apps instead, including apps made by some of the 1.6 million Europeans who make a living as app developers. In fact, a typical Android phone user will install around 50 apps themselves. Last year, over 94 billion apps were downloaded globally from our Play app store; browsers such as Opera Mini and Firefox have been downloaded more than 100 million times, UC Browser more than 500 million times. This is in stark contrast to how things used to be in the 1990s and early 2000s\u2014the dial-up age. Back then, changing the pre-installed applications on your computer, or adding new ones, was technically difficult and time-consuming. The Commission\u2019s Android decision ignores the new breadth of choice and clear evidence about how people use their phones today. Here\u2019s the full statement. The EC have created this graphic to explain how Google has been unfairly keeping a grip on its Android operating system, hurting rival search engine and browser makers. The French government has welcomed the EC\u2019s move. Government spokesman Benjamin Griveaux told reporters in Paris that it was a \u2018excellent decision\u2019, adding: \u201cNo-one is above the laws that have been laid down in common for all....Not Google, nor any other entity.\u201d US tech entrepreneur Jason Kint has calculated that the EC has basically fined Google 4% of its annual revenues. That happens to be the maximum penalty available under Europe\u2019s new data privacy rules (even though this isn\u2019t a data violation). Here\u2019s a video clip of Margrethe Vestager denying she has a vendetta against America during today\u2019s press conference: Our news story about Google\u2019s record fine for breaking Europe\u2019s competition rules is now live. Our Brussels correspondent Jennifer Rankin writes: Google has been hit with a record \u20ac4.34bn (\u00a33.8bn) fine by the European Union for abusing its market dominance in mobile phone operating systems. The EU imposed the multibillion-euro penalty after finding that the US tech firm required smartphone manufacturers to pre-instal Google\u2019s search and browser apps devices using its Android operating system, otherwise they would not be allowed to use its Google Play online store and streaming service. Margrethe Vestager, the EU\u2019s competition commissioner, said Google has used its Android mobile phone operating system \u201cto cement its dominance as a search engine\u201d, preventing rivals from innovating and competing \u201cand this is illegal under EU antitrust rules\u201d. Vestager added: \u201cThe vast majority of users simply take what comes with their device and don\u2019t download competing apps. \u201cOr to slightly paraphrase what [US free market economist] Milton Friedman has said \u2018there ain\u2019t no such thing as a free search.\u2019\u201d Here\u2019s Jennifer\u2019s story: Today\u2019s ruling comes too late to affect the mobile phone market, my colleague Sam Gibbs says: Here\u2019s a flavour of his analysis: The EC is demanding that Google cede some control over Android in its licensing. The EC is demanding that manufacturers should be free to use Android and include the Google Play Store without having to pre-install the Google Search app and Chrome. It\u2019s a similar strategy to that employed by the EC in 2004, when it forced Microsoft to release a version of Windows without Windows Media Player and later offer a browser choice screen, which allowed users to select a web browser other than Internet Explorer. But as with the Media Player-free version of Windows, Windows XP N, for which there was no demand, consumers are unlikely to buy a version of Android without Google\u2019s services. \u201cThe EU\u2019s stance is arguably six to eight years too late,\u201d said Geoff Blaber from analyst firm CCS Insight. \u201cAndroid has already helped establish Google apps and services as essentials for consumers in the western world. More here: Q: Why does Google get fined in Europe, but not in the US and Canada? Commissioner Vestager insists that the EC has been fair - it has investigated complaints and taken evidence in order to reach its decisions. Q: Was today\u2019s decision really taken outside the context of the political situation? [a reference to Donald Trump\u2019s attacks on the EU\u2019s trade policies, and threats to impose tariffs on European exports, I think] People more insightful than me say that the world is becoming more and more unpredictable, Vestager replies. That means it\u2019s important to do predictable things -- so if you breach antitrust rules you pay the penalty, she adds. The press conference is now over. Q: Currently, the mobile phone operating system is dominated either by Android or Apple. Do you really think that is going to change? Commissioner Vestager says she isn\u2019t going to guess how the mobile sector will develop. But she insists that competition will develop, if the market is fair. She says that Amazon developed a fork which they were very keen to roll out to manufacturers, but \u201cit wasn\u2019t possible because of Google\u2019s illegal restrictions\u201d. Q: This is the biggest fine ever for antitrust violations, so is Google guilty of the biggest ever antitrust breach? Vestager jokes that she loves all her children equally, so it\u2019s not fair to make her choose which company has been the worst sinner against competition in the EU. Q: Wouldn\u2019t breaking up Google address these antitrust concerns? Vestager denies that breaking up a company would be a \u2018silver bullet\u2019 to deliver competition. Q: Was Donald Trump right when he told Jean-Claude Juncker last week that \u201cYour tax lady really hates the US\u201d? Vestager says she has fact-checked this statement. It\u2019s true that she\u2019s a woman, and that she deals with tax. But after that point, the US president\u2019s claim becomes less accurate. \u201cI very much like the US\u201d, Vestager insists, pointing out that she\u2019s from Denmark, where people often have American friends and appreciate US culture and travel. Q: Why is today\u2019s fine twice as big as the one imposed on Google in 2017? The fine reflects the scale of Google\u2019s \u201cvery serious illegal behaviour\u201d, Vestager replies. Q: Do you think Google needs to be broken up to improve competition? Vestager says she doesn\u2019t know whether that would improve the situation. The EC really wants Google to allow proper competition at the mobile phone operating system level. Q: Does the length of time these cases take limit their impact, as the market has moved on by the time the EU acts? Vestager says that the case began in 2015, following a number of complaints. The EC sticks to \u2018due process\u2019, which limits how fast these cases can be wrapped up, she explains. Q: What remedies will be available to existing Android phone users? Could Google be forced to send out a notification to customers, telling them they can change their search engine or browser? Vestager says the EC is making a classical \u2018cease and desist\u2019 decision. It\u2019s now up to Google to decide how to make amends in the future. [I think that means that existing Android users won\u2019t see any difference on their handset] Q: Google now has an entrenched position in the mobile sector (with four-fifths of devices), so how can you enforce changes now? Vestager says Google needs to take away the contractual restrictions that have held back competition on Android. Q: Did you examine whether Google blocked rivals from collecting data on Android users? Vestager says that rival search engines \u201cnever really\u201d got a foothold on Android, due to Google\u2019s restrictions (ie, the company didn\u2019t have to actively block its rivals, as they weren\u2019t there in the first place). Q: Could your decision drive up the cost of mobile phone handsets? Vestager says there are still various ways in which Google can monetising the Android operating system, rather than simply hiking prices. Q: What will happen to the money (assuming Google pays up). Vestager says that the fine will be returned to EU member states, based on how much each country pays into the EU budget. But that could take a while, if Google files an appeal. Commissioner Vestager is taking questions about the Google fine now. Q: Could this decision affect next week\u2019s meeting between EC president Juncker and US president Trump? Vestager says that the US competition authorities want fair competition, just as Europe does. As such, they expect the EC to do its job. Q: Should Google apologise? We want Google to end its illegal behaviour, Vestager replies. This isn\u2019t a moral endeavour - we just want Google to play by the rules. The size of Google\u2019s fine reflects the \u201cseriousness\u201d and sustained natures of its violation of the EC\u2019s antitrust rules, commissioner Margrethe Vestager tells reporters in Brussels. The company must end its \u2018illegal conduct\u2019 within 90 days, by ending the restrictions it has imposed on mobile phone makers (as outlined here), Vestager explains. Our decision stops Google from controlling which search and browser apps manufacturers can install, or which android operating system they can use, she says. And if Google doesn\u2019t comply, its parent company Alphabet could be fined up to 5% of its daily turnover each day. Newsflash: Google says it will appeal against the EC\u2019s fine. Google spokesman Al Verney argues that its Android operating system [which is used on 80% of phones worldwide] has been good for consumers. Verney says: Android has created more choice for everyone, not less. A vibrant ecosystem, rapid innovation and lower prices are classic hallmarks of robust consequences. We will appeal the Commission\u2019s decision. The EC says that Google has been abusing its market position for seven years. Today\u2019s ruling states: Google has prevented device manufacturers from using any alternative version of Android that was not approved by Google (Android forks). In order to be able to pre-install on their devices Google\u2019s proprietary apps, including the Play Store and Google Search, manufacturers had to commit not to develop or sell even a single device running on an Android fork. The Commission found that this conduct was abusive as of 2011, which is the date Google became dominant in the market for app stores for the Android mobile operating system. Commissioner Vestager is now outlining how Google restricts manufacturers from creating rival \u2018forks\u2019 of its Android operating system. In theory, a manufacturer can used the Android source code to create their own platform, as Google makes it openly accessible. But in practice, Vestager says, device manufacturers who wish to obtain Google\u2019s proprietary Android apps and services need to enter into contracts with Google, as part of which Google imposes a number of restrictions. Commissioner Margrethe Vestager adds: Google has used Android as a vehicle to cement its dominance as a search engine. These practices have denied rivals a chance to innovate and to compete on the merits. They have denied European consumers the benefit of effective competition in the very important mobile sphere. And this is illegal under EU antitrust rules. Vestager is outlining the case against Google. She says: Google required manufacturers to pre-install the Google search and browser apps on Android phones, otherwise they wouldn\u2019t be allowed to use Google Play (its app service)/. Google paid manufacturers and network operators to make sure that only the Google search app was installed on devices Google has restricted the development of competing mobile phone operating systems, which could have provided a platform for rival search engines. Commissioner Vestager says Google must make amends within 90 days, or the company will incur penalty payments. NEWSFLASH: The European Commission has fined Google \u20ac4.34bn for breaching EU antitrust rules. The tech giant is being sanctioned for abusing its dominant position in the Android operating system for mobile phones. The EC says Google unfairly took advantage of the popularity of its Android mobile phone operating system, and forced phonemakers to pre-install Google services such as its flagship search product. Competition commissioner Margrethe Vestager is outlining the decision now. More to follow! Margrethe Vestager, the EC\u2019s Competition Commissioner for Competition, is about to give a press conference in Brussels. Presumably this is to announce the Google fine. It will be streamed online here. Over in Brussels, antitrust regulators are preparing to hit Google with a multi-billion euro fine. My colleague Jennifer Rankin explains: Google could be hit with a record fine by the European Union\u2019s competition authorities on Wednesday for abusing its market dominance in mobile phone operating systems. The company risks a multibillion-euro penalty for making the Google search engine the default on most phones using its Android operating system. Citing people familiar with the case, the Financial Times reported that the fine is likely to exceed the \u20ac2.4bn (\u00a32.1bn) penalty imposed by the European commission in 2017 when Google was found to have used its dominant search engine to build its internet shopping service. Google is appealing against that decision. The EU regulator could fine Google up to 10% of its turnover, or some \u20ac11bn. Reuters is reporting that Google could be fined around \u20ac4.3bn, or $5bn. The decision could be just minutes away.... Britain\u2019s retail sector has suffered another blow \u2013 meaty restaurant chain Gaucho is expected to file for administration today. The move will threaten around 1,500 jobs, adding to the thousands being cut at high street chains such as House of Fraser, Poundworld, Marks &amp; Spencer and Mothercare. UK house price inflation has hit a five-year low. House prices across the UK rose by 3.0% in the year to May, which is the slowest growth since August 2013. Once again, falling house prices in London dragged the national average down. The Office for National Statistics explains: The lowest annual growth was in London, where prices decreased by 0.4% over the year. London has shown a general slowdown in its annual growth rate since mid-2016. This is the fourth consecutive month that London house prices have fallen over the year. Political uncertainty (ie Brexit) is hurting prices in the capital, says Guy Bradshaw, Director of Central London Sales and Lettings at UK Sotheby\u2019s International Realty: \u201cAs annual growth in the UK has continued to decline to the lowest rate we have seen since August 2013, it is unsurprising to see the London market has also followed suit. We were never expecting to see a particularly buoyant market this year, with political uncertainty and stamp duty continuing to dampen sales. The \u2018Spring Bounce\u2019 is undeniably modest in comparison to previous years and whilst this may be due to the poor weather we encountered late into the year this may very well be setting the scene for the summer market. Here\u2019s our economics correspondent Richard Partington on today\u2019s inflation figures: The chances of a rise in interest rates in August have dipped after British inflation remained at a one-year low last month. Confounding expectations for the return of higher rates of inflation in June fuelled by the rising price of petrol, the Office for National Statistics said the consumer price index remained unchanged at 2.4% from the previous month. Although the cost of gas and electricity prices increased and the price at the pump hit the highest level for nearly four years, consumers benefited from the falling cost of computer games and the summer clothing sales. House prices across the UK also rose at the slowest pace in nearly five years. Faced with falling wage growth, the latest snapshot from the ONS poses the Bank of England with limited grounds for raising interest rates next month. Sterling slid to a 10-month low against the dollar on foreign exchanges after the data was released. More here: The Resolution Foundation has warned that inflation could overtake earnings growth soon, which would mean real wages would start falling again: Here\u2019s the government\u2019s response to today\u2019s inflation data, from Financial Secretary to the Treasury and Paymaster General, Mel Stride: \u201cInflation has fallen from its peak last year but we recognise the cost of living is still a challenge for some families. That is why we are freezing fuel duty saving drivers \u00a3160 a year, cutting income taxes for 31 million people and increasing the National Living Wage to \u00a37.83 an hour.\u201d The pound is acting more like the \u2018Great British Peso\u2019 right now, as it is buffeted by political tensions as well as economic data. So says Bart Hordijk, Market Analyst at Monex Europe, who believes sterling is behaving increasingly like an emerging market currency. Hordijk explains: \u201cAs the dust settles on yesterday\u2019s \u2018Wild West\u2019 style standoff in Parliament, UK macroeconomic data comes back into the spotlight ahead of the Bank of England rate decision in August..... Sterling\u2019s knee jerk reaction [to the inflation data], carving lows not seen since September 2017, evidences how over-inflated expectations were on the Bank of England\u2019s upcoming decision. Today\u2019s soft inflation reading will do little to knock the Bank of England off of their implied course, but tail risk of the \u2018unreliable boyfriend\u2019 resurfacing has increased. Sterling looks to be in for a bleak day, especially as Theresa May will have to fend off grilling during today\u2019s Prime Minister\u2019s Questions.\u201d Professor Costas Milas of the University of Liverpool predicts that the Bank of England will hike borrowing next month, even though inflationary pressures are less intense than feared. He thinks the BoE will be keen to get an interest rate rise through before Brexit becomes even more tense. Despite inflation getting stuck at 2.4%, I sense that early August is a very convenient time for the MPC members to hike. Why? UK inflation, at 2.4% in the second quarter of 2018, is fully in line with their 2.43% forecast recorded in the May Inflation report. So no surprises there. This, together with the widespread expectation that GDP growth in 2018 Q2 will be higher than the previous quarter figure will encourage MPC members to raise the policy rate. At the same time, with the Parliament moving in recess in less than a week\u2019s time, May\u2019s government will get a much needed \u2018breathing space\u2019 in terms of Brexit-related tensions. All this implies a very short \u2018time window of opportunity\u2019 for MPC members to hike in August rather than kicking the \u2018interest-rate can\u2019 down the road. Inflation is still taking a big chunk out of UK workers\u2019 pay cheques. At 2.4% in June, consumer prices are rising nearly as fast as earnings, meaning real wages are only up around 0.3%. Andrew Sentance, senior economic adviser at PwC, explains: \u201dUK CPI inflation remains steady at 2.4%, but it is still above the 2% target and is likely to be stuck close to 2.5% over the summer. The gap between wage growth (2.7%) and inflation remains narrow - just 0.3%. So consumers are likely to remain cautious while their living standards are still rising very slowly. Tej Parikh, Senior Economist at the Institute of Directors, warns that wages are unlikely to rise sharply this year. \u201cThe unchanged inflation rate offers some reprieve for households at a time when wage growth remains uninspiring. \u201cDespite higher utility bills and petrol costs, consumers may have benefitted from offsetting seasonal discounts, particularly on clothing. The good news should however be taken with a pinch of salt. With the recent weak performance in pay packets, and high street bargains only temporary, the cost of living still remains high. \u201cThe stickiness in prices will reduce pressure on the Bank of England to hike interest rates in August. The decision is certainly not set in stone, particularly as wage growth is a key component of inflation, and the recent data shows little promise of a sustained rise in salaries.\u201d UK inflation is still over the Bank of England\u2019s target of 2%, meaning prices are rising much faster than the saving rates on offer from the banks. Kate Smith, head of pensions at life insurance firm Aegon, says household budgets are still being squeezed. \u201cFinancial pressure created by rising prices will continue to hit people on fixed incomes, such as pensioners, the hardest. As people live longer, with more years spent in retirement, it\u2019s vital they protect their savings from the erosive effects of inflation. Even at relatively low levels of inflation the spending power of \u00a3100 in today\u2019s money could be halved in 20 years\u2019 time. June\u2019s unchanged inflation rate is a huge surprise, says Tom Stevenson, investment director for Personal Investing at Fidelity International. Inflation had been expected to bounce back up to 2.6% or even 2.7% on the back of higher fuel and energy prices. While these came through, they were offset by falling prices for clothes and games. Inflation remained at 2.4% for the third month in a row. Faster rising prices would have given the Bank of England cover for an interest rate hike next month. Now it looks odds-on that the MPC will hold fire yet again. That\u2019s particularly the case after yesterday\u2019s wage growth data emerged weaker than expected at 2.5% including bonuses. Stevenson suspects that the Bank of England will hold off raising interest rates until November, or maybe until 2019.... Economist Philip Shaw of City firm Investec says the pound is suffering from \u2018political trauma\u2019, as well as today\u2019s weaker-than-expected inflation data. Jamie McGeever of Reuters predicts that sterling could fall through the $1.30 mark (which would be a new 10-month low) Simon French of Panmure Gordon says that an August interest rate rise looks less likely, especially after UK wage growth slowed to a six-month low yesterday. The pound has hit its lowest level in 10 months, as traders react to this morning\u2019s unexpectedly weak inflation data. Sterling has dropped to $1.3011, its weakest level since September 2017. The City is calculating that an August interest rate rise is now less likely, as there is less sign that inflationary pressures are building. Michael Hewson of CMC Markets says the \u201cpolitical shenanigans in Westminster\u201d are also weighing on the pound, following last night\u2019s narrow victory for Theresa May over her customs plan (see earlier post). This chart shows how Britain\u2019s household heating bills, and petrol costs, drove the cost of living up last month. Clothing, toys and computer games got cheaper, though, meaning inflation was flat month-on-month (rising by 2.4% year-on-year). Men\u2019s clothing prices fell sharply last month, also helped to keep inflation pegged last month. The ONS says: Prices of clothing fell by 2.3% between May and June this year compared with a fall of 1.1% between the same two months a year ago. Prices usually fall between May and June as the summer sales season begins, but the fall in 2018 is the largest since 2012. The effect came mainly from men\u2019s clothing. The Office for National Statistics says that recreation got cheaper last month, making up for more expensive energy and fuel. Rising prices for motor fuels and domestic gas and electricity produced the largest upward contributions to change in the rate between May and June 2018. Falling prices for clothing and games, toys and hobbies provided the largest downward effects. At just 2.4%, UK inflation remains at its joint-lowest level in 14 months. Newsflash: Britain\u2019s inflation rate remained at 2.4% in June, defying expectations that it would rise to 2.6%. That\u2019s good news for households, given the slowdown in wage growth in the last quarter. It also takes some pressure off the Bank of England to raise interest rates next month. More to follow! UK engineering group Smiths is having a bad morning. Smiths shares are down 7%, after it told the City that some of its medical products have lost certification under the EU\u2019s new Medical Device Regulations. In London, the FTSE 100 has gained 35 points in early trading, partly thanks to easyJet. The budget airline\u2019s shares have jumped by 3%, after it reported a 14% jump in revenues in the last quarter and also raised its profit forecast. Richard Hunter, Head of Markets at interactive investor, says easyJet is benefiting from falling competition: The demise of competitors such as Monarch, Air Berlin and Alitalia has opened up the field, ancillary revenue has increased due to a change in passenger behaviour (increasingly paying for additional baggage and allocated seating) and load factors remain high. European stock markets have hit a one-month high this morning, led by technology stocks. The Stoxx 600 has risen by 0.6% today, with the tech sector gaining over 2%. Semiconductor firm ASML and telecoms equipment maker Ericsson are leading the rally, after both beating analyst forecasts this morning. That follows a solid day in Wall Street yesterday, where the Nasdaq hit another record high. With Amazon hitting new peaks, and Netflix recovering from disappointing results earlier this week, the tech boom doesn\u2019t appear to have ended yet. The pound has dipped below $1.31 against the US dollar this morning, close to its lowest level of 2018. Sterling slumped yesterday when the unemployment figures showed wages growth slowing, potentially making an August interest rate rise less likely. The pound is also being dragged down by Brexit anxiety, after prime minister Theresa May was forced to threaten her own MPs with a general election to force them to back her Brexit plan. Although May won a crucial vote on the customs union last night, she lost on a separate amendment which demanded that the UK remained under EU medicines regulation after leaving the bloc. Given the PM\u2019s precarious position, City investors aren\u2019t convinced that May can drive her plans through the Commons. Kallum Pickering of Berenberg Bank says the PM\u2019s challenge is \u201cLike herding cats\u201d. Once again, the Brexiteers have laid bare how difficult it is for UK Prime Minister Theresa May to hold her Conservative government together. Although May had turned her plan for a semi-soft Brexit into the official line of her Cabinet last week, causing prominent dissenters to quit, Brexiteers led by MP Jacob Rees-Mogg forced her on Monday to accept an amendment that would make it even more difficult for the EU to endorse her proposed customs arrangement. The strongly pro-EU House of Lords will probably reject the amendment. After the House of Commons barely passed it anyway (305 for, 302 against), the amendment may not survive a second vote. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Britain may be facing a new cost of living squeeze. Inflation figures due out this morning are expected to show that prices rose at a faster rate in June, hitting consumers in the pocket. Economists predict that the consumer prices index rose by around 2.6% in June, up from 2.4% in May, partly due to rising energy prices. Sue Trinh of Royal Bank of Canada says: The rise in petrol prices in June should ensure that the transport category continued to make a strong positive contribution to UK inflation. Added to that, a number of pre-announced utility price increases kicked in last month, including a 5.5% rise from the largest energy provider British Gas which came into effect at the end of May. This comes as UK wage growth slows. Yesterday we learned that basic pay only rose by 2.7% in the three months to May, the weakest in six months. If you include bonuses, then total earnings only rose by 2.5%. Today\u2019s inflation figures will help to influence whether the Bank of England feels confident enough to raise interest rates next month. If prices are rising faster, then the hawks at the BoE will push for borrowing costs to be hiked. But dovish colleagues may worry that wage growth isn\u2019t strong enough. It\u2019s also inflation day in the eurozone. Consumer prices in the euro area are expected to have risen by 2% in the last year, up from 1.9% in May. Also coming up today Google is bracing for a record fine from the European Commission today, over claims it has abused its dominant position in the mobile phone operating system market. America\u2019s top central banker, Jerome Powell, is returning to Capitol Hill later for a second day of questioning. Yesterday he told senators that the US economy was growing strongly, adding: \u201cThe unemployment rate is low and expected to fall further. Americans who want jobs have a good chance of finding them.\u201d The agenda 9.30am BST: UK inflation date for June 9.30am BST: UK house price data for May 10am BST: Eurozone inflation data for June 3pm BST: Fed chair Jerome Powell testifying to the US House of Representatives",

Stock markets in Europe would probably be hit even harder than they have been so far too.</p> \n   <p>Meanwhile, although the S&amp;P 500 has proved fairly resilient to trade worries so far, and has actually risen since they resurfaced in June, we doubt that this will last.</p> \n   <p>The retaliation by other countries to US protectionism so far has mostly been aimed at US farmers, not US multinationals. But that could change. In particular, we suspect that China will start to target US multinationals operating in China directly rather than imposing more tariffs of its own.</p> \n   <p>What\u2019s more, even if this latest escalation in the trade war is somehow averted, we think that there are other reasons to be pessimistic about the outlook for equities in both the US and the rest of the world. Regardless of the direction of US trade policy, we think that China\u2019s economy will lose more momentum over the rest of this year, and forecast that the US economy will slow sharply in 2019 as the cumulative effects of Fed tightening and the fading fiscal boost start to bite.</p> \n   <p>With this in mind, we forecast that the S&amp;P 500 will fall to 2,300 by the end of next year, compared to just over 2,800 now, and think that equities in the rest of the world will fall sharply too.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5b51f98fe4b0b9a0a347e2fe\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-07-20T15:04:16.208Z\">4.04pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Stock markets are off their worst levels, although European indices are struggling compared with the UK and Wall Street. Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at IG, said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>After a few days without trade war headlines the topic has come back to life, as Trump turns the trade war rhetoric all the way up to 11 with his announcement that $500 billion of Chinese goods could suffer penalties. Having come away from the NATO summit with an apparent win using his strong-arm negotiating tactics, this move appears designed to bring the Chinese to the table. Markets have recovered from their initial shock, perhaps indicating that this kind of newflash is starting to lose its power. </p> \n   <p>The news spoiled the FTSE 100\u2019s attempt to move above the 7700 zone, which has held back progress for over a month now, while once again the Dax is taking the news on the chin, shedding 150 points as the week winds down and wiping out most of the progress made over the past few days.</p> \n   <p> Another trend undergoing a reversal is that of the US dollar, which has fallen back today after weeks of gains. The dollar index has seen some outflows, with the safe-haven yen a beneficiary as investors cut back on risk thanks to the trade war rhetoric. However, the ongoing rally is not finished yet it seems, Jerome Powell\u2019s comments this week having made it clear that the Fed has no intention of deviating from current policy, regardless of the views of the White House.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5b51f1d3e4b0f7abbc8f02b8\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-07-20T14:32:24.301Z\">3.32pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>The dollar remains in the doldrums as the US currency continues to react to Donald Trump\u2019s complaints about its current strength, along with investor concerns about the escalating trade war tensions with China.</p> \n  <p>The dollar index, a measure of its value against a basket of other major currencies, is down 0.6% after it reached a one year high on Thursday.</p> \n  <p>The weakness of the dollar has benefited the pound, which is up 0.73% to $1.3107 against the US currency, despite the continuing uncertainties over Brexit.</p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5b51eba8e4b0f7abbc8f0262\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-07-20T14:06:05.202Z\">3.06pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>One of the US central bank\u2019s members has responded to Donald Trump\u2019s comments.

However, today\u2019s sharp escalation makes sense in such a context, particularly with the midterm campaign trail on the horizon - The White House needs to force their opponents to swerve first in this game of trade chicken. On the other side, the political nature of the tariffs threatened to date, such as soybeans, suggests that the Chinese administration see a potential weakness in the President\u2019s approaching moment of indirect electoral accountability.</p> \n   <p>As November\u2019s US midterm elections loom larger, we see economic and political self-interest helping to de-escalate the scrap. In the meantime, the potential for capital markets to be dragged into a disciplinary role suggests investors will again need to call upon their stores of composure to see this through.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5b51d196e4b09bbd5297aace\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-07-20T12:15:21.048Z\">1.15pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"057901703f9027fae62b5f878c96f07329ba77a5\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/057901703f9027fae62b5f878c96f07329ba77a5/52_161_2961_2273/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Poker chips\" width=\"1000\" height=\"768\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n  </figure> \n  <p><strong>Olaf </strong><strong>van den Heuvel, </strong>chief investment officer at <strong>Aegon Asset Management, </strong>warns that the US president risks destabilising the global economy, and the financial markets:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>\u201cSo far the Trump trade policy has been more about creating leverage in a negotiation than about levying actual tariffs.

                "bodyText":"President Trump\u2019s controversial comments that the Federal Reserve is wrong to raise US interest rates and his new threats to impose tariffs on $500bn worth of Chinese imports have unsettled investors as the trading week winds to a close. The dollar was damaged by the remarks, giving some support to Wall Street. But European markets likely to be hit by any escalation of trade tensions, Germany in particular, came under pressure. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished down 0.07% or 5.18 points at 7678.79 Germany\u2019s Dax dropped 0.98% to 12,561.42 France\u2019s Cac closed 0.35% lower at 5398.32 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB fell 0.41% to 21,794.60 Spain\u2019s Ibex edged up 0.04% to 9724.8 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 29 points or 0.12%. On that note, it\u2019s time to close for the day. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back next week. Stock markets are likely to remain under pressure even if this latest trade dispute blows over, says Oliver Jones at Capital Economics: We suspect that equities across Emerging Asia would slump once more if President Trump followed through with his latest tariff threat. Stock markets in Europe would probably be hit even harder than they have been so far too. Meanwhile, although the S&amp;P 500 has proved fairly resilient to trade worries so far, and has actually risen since they resurfaced in June, we doubt that this will last. The retaliation by other countries to US protectionism so far has mostly been aimed at US farmers, not US multinationals. But that could change. In particular, we suspect that China will start to target US multinationals operating in China directly rather than imposing more tariffs of its own. What\u2019s more, even if this latest escalation in the trade war is somehow averted, we think that there are other reasons to be pessimistic about the outlook for equities in both the US and the rest of the world. Regardless of the direction of US trade policy, we think that China\u2019s economy will lose more momentum over the rest of this year, and forecast that the US economy will slow sharply in 2019 as the cumulative effects of Fed tightening and the fading fiscal boost start to bite. With this in mind, we forecast that the S&amp;P 500 will fall to 2,300 by the end of next year, compared to just over 2,800 now, and think that equities in the rest of the world will fall sharply too. Stock markets are off their worst levels, although European indices are struggling compared with the UK and Wall Street. Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at IG, said: After a few days without trade war headlines the topic has come back to life, as Trump turns the trade war rhetoric all the way up to 11 with his announcement that $500 billion of Chinese goods could suffer penalties. Having come away from the NATO summit with an apparent win using his strong-arm negotiating tactics, this move appears designed to bring the Chinese to the table. Markets have recovered from their initial shock, perhaps indicating that this kind of newflash is starting to lose its power. The news spoiled the FTSE 100\u2019s attempt to move above the 7700 zone, which has held back progress for over a month now, while once again the Dax is taking the news on the chin, shedding 150 points as the week winds down and wiping out most of the progress made over the past few days. Another trend undergoing a reversal is that of the US dollar, which has fallen back today after weeks of gains. The dollar index has seen some outflows, with the safe-haven yen a beneficiary as investors cut back on risk thanks to the trade war rhetoric. However, the ongoing rally is not finished yet it seems, Jerome Powell\u2019s comments this week having made it clear that the Fed has no intention of deviating from current policy, regardless of the views of the White House. The dollar remains in the doldrums as the US currency continues to react to Donald Trump\u2019s complaints about its current strength, along with investor concerns about the escalating trade war tensions with China. The dollar index, a measure of its value against a basket of other major currencies, is down 0.6% after it reached a one year high on Thursday. The weakness of the dollar has benefited the pound, which is up 0.73% to $1.3107 against the US currency, despite the continuing uncertainties over Brexit. One of the US central bank\u2019s members has responded to Donald Trump\u2019s comments. Reuters reports: The Federal Reserve will remain unaffected by President Donald Trump\u2019s comments on U.S. monetary policy and is focused on achieving the goals set for it by Congress, St. Louis Federal Reserve Bank President James Bullard said on Friday. \u201cThe (Fed\u2019s policy-setting) committee has a mandate to keep inflation low and stable and obtain maximum employment for the U.S. economy, so people can comment, including the president and other politicians, but it\u2019s up to the committee to try to take the best action we can to achieve those objectives,\u201d Bullard told reporters following an event in Glasgow, Kentucky. US markets have made a nervous start but the falls are not as bad as had been feared earlier. Investors are of course concerned about the latest threats from Donald Trump about imposing tariffs on $500bn worth of Chinese imports to the US, but there is some support for markets from Microsoft\u2019s forecast beating results. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 26 points while the S&amp;P 500 opened just 0.06% lower. The Nasdaq Composite managed to edge up slightly, up 0.19% at the start of trading. Still with trade, and German chancellor Angela Merkel said in her annual news conference that US complaints only take into account the trade in good. When trade in services and repatriation of profits are included the figures favour the US, she said. She criticised the tit for tat tariffs imposed or threatened by the US and China: We see these potential tariffs both as a breach of WTO rules and also as a danger to the prosperity of many in the world. Back with the US, and Trump is continuing his attack on \u201cterrible\u201d trade deals: Over in Canada, inflation figures came in higher than forecast. The annual rate rose to 2.5% in June from 2.2% the previous month, more than the expected figure of 2.3%. This is the highest figure since February 2012. And so does the Federal Reserve again: Trump has now turned from trade wars back to currency wars, and this time Europe is getting it too. The latest Trump tariff attack on China at least keeps Europe on the sidelines for the moment, sayd Edward Rumble, co-manager of the RWC Continental European Equity fund. He said: The potential for more restrictive trade between nations may be a serious threat to global growth, and the steady increase in rhetoric and retaliatory actions was already worrying prior to today\u2019s latest comments. One thing for European investors to consider is that, if Trump is obsessed with China, it does at least temporarily keep his sights off Germany and other European nations. However, given Germany has a \u20ac100bn trade surplus with the US, at some stage he will likely come for them as well. Such actions represent a reversal of a 50-year trend to more liberal trade that has helped fuel economic prosperity around the world for decades. Not surprisingly, many companies are not well prepared for such a scenario, indeed they have been taking advantage of the open environment to optimise manufacturing efficiency on a global basis. In many cases, the current structure will not be optimal if trade barriers require local production in end markets to ensure competitiveness. The current escalation in trade war rhetoric makes sense in the context of November\u2019s mid=term elections, says Will Hobbs, head of investment Strategy at Barclays Smart Investor. He said: We cannot pretend to know for sure that this is all part of a crude negotiating strategy on the part of the US administration. However, today\u2019s sharp escalation makes sense in such a context, particularly with the midterm campaign trail on the horizon - The White House needs to force their opponents to swerve first in this game of trade chicken. On the other side, the political nature of the tariffs threatened to date, such as soybeans, suggests that the Chinese administration see a potential weakness in the President\u2019s approaching moment of indirect electoral accountability. As November\u2019s US midterm elections loom larger, we see economic and political self-interest helping to de-escalate the scrap. In the meantime, the potential for capital markets to be dragged into a disciplinary role suggests investors will again need to call upon their stores of composure to see this through. Olaf van den Heuvel, chief investment officer at Aegon Asset Management, warns that the US president risks destabilising the global economy, and the financial markets: \u201cSo far the Trump trade policy has been more about creating leverage in a negotiation than about levying actual tariffs. Of course, as in a game of poker, you sometimes have to up the ante. The risks are high at this level. The impact on world economic growth of a levy of this magnitude will be severe and will likely have a strong negative impact on markets.\u201d Donald Trump is adamant that he won\u2019t be knocked off course by stock market volatility. Wall Street is up around 30% since the 2016 presidential election, which Trump says gives him a cushion to challenge China et al on trade. He put it to CNBC: This is the time. You know the expression we\u2019re playing with the bank\u2019s money.\u201d Investor, though, will consider that it\u2019s their money, and fear that a trade war will wipe out their recent gains. European car shares are falling sharply, following president Trump\u2019s threat to deepen the trade dispute with China. Volkswagen are down 2.3%, and BMW have lost 1.5%, on fears that the US could impose tariffs on EU car imports soon. Artjom Hatsaturjants, research analyst at Accendo Markets, says market sentiment has \u201csoured\u201d since Trump threatened to go \u2018whole hog\u2019 and impose tariffs on all $500B of Chinese imports to the US. Here\u2019s another clip, of Donald Trump explaining why he\u2019s \u201cnot thrilled\u201d that the US Federal Reserve keeps raising American interest rates: CNBC have now released a video clip of their interview with president Trump. In it, Trump claims that America is being \u201ctaken advantage of\u201d by China, the EU, Mexico, and Japan, because they all run trade surpluses with the US. Specifically on China, Trump says America is \u201cdown a tremendous amount\u201d - with a trade deficit of at least $375bn - and he\u2019s going to fix it. The president then threatens to put tariffs on all China\u2019s $500bn of imports, because Beijing retaliated against America\u2019s initial tariffs on $50bn of goods earlier this year. And he batted away the prospect that Wall Street might plunge if a trade war broke out. Here\u2019s the key quotes: Trump: \u201cI raised 50, and they matched us. I said: \u2018you don\u2019t match us, you can\u2019t match us because otherwise we\u2019re always gonna be behind the A ball\u2019.\u201d CNBC: \u201cWould you ever get to 500, though?\u201d Trump: \u201cI\u2019m ready to go to 500\u201d CNBC: With the mid-terms on the horizon? What if the stock market were to go down? Trump: If it does it does. CNBC: [what if it falls] 20%? Trump: I\u2019m doing this to do the right thing for our country. We have been ripped off by China for a long time. Here\u2019s the video clip: Trump\u2019s threat to launch a full-blooded trade war with China has alarmed investors. US stock market futures are falling, suggesting that shares will drop when trading begins in three hours. In London, the FTSE 100 is now in the red, down 30 points at 7652, having been slightly higher earlier. NEWSFLASH: CNBC are now broadcasting their full interview with president Trump (they only released the snippet attacking the Federal Reserve yesterday). The new top line? Trump is threatening to hit China with a new wave of tariffs, which would drive up the cost of ALL Chinese imports into America, worth around $500bn per year. Trump told CNBC\u2019s Squawk Box show that \u201cI\u2019m ready to go to 500\u201d, if China doesn\u2019t bow to America\u2019s complaints about its trade policies. He added: I\u2019m not doing this for politics, I\u2019m doing this to do the right thing for our country..... We have been ripped off by China for a long time.\u201d Trump denied that he is acting maliciously towards China, saying: \u201cI don\u2019t want them to be scared. I want them to do well...I really like President Xi a lot, but it was very unfair.\u201d So far, America has imposed 10% tariffs on $34bn of Chinese imports (which could soon rise to $50bn). Another $200bn of goods (including food, chemicals and consumer goods) could be hit by 10% levies in September. So far, China has announced reciprocal tariffs on America\u2019s first wave of penalties. However, it couldn\u2019t retaliate if Trump \u201cgoes to 500\u201d, as it only buys less than $200bn of US goods each year. Donald Trump should blame himself, not the Federal Reserve, for the strengthening dollar, argues Craig Erlam of City firm OANDA. Erlam writes that Trump\u2019s recent tax cuts have stimulated the US economy, at a time when it was doing pretty well anyway...... It\u2019s quite clear to most people that part of the reason for the Fed raising rates at the current pace is the tax reform measures passed at the end of last year, when the economy was already running hot. This is also partially responsible for the dollar rising against other currencies, particularly the yuan and euro, which has suffered further as the President has sought to start a trade war with both. Trump is not one to accept responsibility for such events and now appears to be actively trying to push the blame onto others in a clear attempt to halt the rise in the greenback, the strengthening of which could weigh on the economy and soften the impact of the trade measures he is taking against other countries. Reuters points out that Donald Trump has made several public comments about the dollar\u2019s strength since taking office....something most US leaders have avoided. Back in the UK, the long task of fixing the public finances continues. New figures show that Britain borrowed \u00a35.4bn to balance the books in June 2018, \u00a3800m less than in June 2017. So far this financial year, the UK has borrowed \u00a316.8bn; \u00a35.4bn less than in the same period in 2017, and the lowest April-June borrowing since 2007 (before the financial crisis). Mike Jakeman of PwC reckons this gives the government some ammunition to cut taxes or boost spending in the autumn Budget. Paul Donovan of UBS Wealth Management has a deliciously acerbic take on Trump\u2019s attack on the Fed: US President Trump signalled unhappiness with Federal Reserve rate increases. This was in a TV interview, not a tweet, so it is not official administration policy. The decline of global inflation in the past quarter century was nothing to do with globalization, and nothing to do with technology. It was due mainly to central bank independence. Challenging independence is high risk. The Fed, even when run by a lawyer rather than a properly qualified economist, is not likely to alter policy direction. The Fed should tighten because deficit-financed tax cuts at a time of strong growth are unnecessary and need to be offset. However, US President Trump\u2019s recent consumer tax increases [tariffs] may slow the economy and reduce the need for rapid rate rises. It\u2019s important to emphasise that Trump\u2019s criticism of the Federal Reserve is pretty unusual. The whole point of central bank independence is that interest rates can rise or fall without political interference. That prevents governments from slashing borrowing costs to get a pre-election boom, creating an inflationary spike, forcing rates to go up again, slowing the economy, creating a recession.... Bart Hordijk, market analyst at Monex Europe, says Trump is acting more like the leader of an emerging market economy when he declares that he\u2019s \u201cnot thrilled\u201d by US interest rate rises. Hordijk writes: The US dollar sold off across the globe [after Trump\u2019s attack] and the question on every FX trader\u2019s mind is; is the US becoming the new Turkey? \u201cThe answer seems, \u201cno, but....\u201d. The Turkish lira lost almost 30% of its value this year mostly because Turkish President Recep Erdo\u011fan is firmly set against higher rates (just like Trump) and is attacking the independence of the central bank (just like Trump). Erdo\u011fan is notorious for criticising Turkey\u2019s central bank, and calling for lower interest rates. Earlier this month he even put his son-in-law in charge of Turkey\u2019s Ministry of Finance and Treasury. Trump hasn\u2019t reached that point (Jared Kushner has other duties, anyway). Hordijk says: The big difference however is that the institutions in both countries widely differ and there are miles more of legal obstacles and checks and balances in place before Trump even gets close to have a direct say in the Fed\u2019s interest rate policy. Additionally Erdogan seems surrounded by a group of yes men, while Trump\u2019s team sometimes still keep him in check, as evidenced by Deputy Press Secretary Sarah Sanders who went into damage control mode after the comments were made and reconfirmed Trump respects the independence of the Fed. But even so, Trump\u2019s decision to fire a warning shot at the Fed should worry the markets... After starting a trade war, giving tax hand outs to the rich that will likely blow up the US fiscal deficit and antagonizing NATO allies while befriending despotic leaders, this latest action of Trump further establishes the pattern of his capricious, often short term focus. That in itself is a scary observation and an understandable reason why the dollar sold off.\u201d President Trump has set \u201cmore cats among even more pigeons\u201d with his comments about interest rates and the dollar yesterday. So says Kit Juckes, foreign exchange expert at French bank Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale. Juckes doesn\u2019t believe the Federal Reserve\u2019s independence is now in doubt. And as long as [Fed chair] Jay Powell &amp; Co respond to a strong economy and easy fiscal policy with measured policy tightening, they aren\u2019t going to send bond yields or the dollar down on their own. However, he also expects more fireworks if China allows its currency to keep sliding: As long as the renminbi is falling in an orderly manner, there is little urgency for the Chinese authorities to counter it. Whether or not China is wittingly undertaking a depreciation policy, the question will increasingly be on investors\u2019 minds as the slide deepens. And the Trump Administration is unlikely to keep quiet for long either The Trump administration is determined to push down their currency, says Neil Wilson of Markets.com. A cheaper dollar would help US companies compete abroad, a key plank of Trump\u2019s attempt to make trade \u2018fairer\u2019. Wilson writes: A clear pattern is emerging \u2013 Donald Trump wants a weaker dollar. Prior to his inauguration he said the dollar was \u2018too strong\u2019. Then earlier this year Treasury secretary Mnuchin echoed those comments when he openly questioned the strong dollar policy. The Mnuchin effect lasted until the middle of April, but since then the dollar has been on the rise again, with the dollar index hitting 95, a level not seen since November last year. When you look at the trade policies he\u2019s pursuing, a weaker dollar makes sense. The only problem is that an all-out trade war, by making dollars scarcer, will force up the greenback against its peers. Trump\u2019s intervention raises the dangers of a full-blown currency war, says Jasper Lawler of London Capital Group. He says China\u2019s response - letting the yuan weaken sharply - is significant. As Trump moaned about the strength of the dollar, the PBOC devalued the yuan by the most since 2016, sending a chill through the markets. Interpreted as China\u2019s response to the US trade war \u2013 the starting of a currency war- risk off is prevailing with traders selling out of equities sending Asian markets and European futures sharply lower. It was only a month ago when China denied that they would start a currency war following Trump\u2019s action. A lot can change in a month under Trump. Donald Trump\u2019s criticism of the Fed came after the US dollar hit a one-year high against a basket of other major currencies. The dollar has strengthened thanks to several US interest rate rises, and the prospect of more to come. US interest rates are now 2% - up from just 0.25% after the financial crisis - with the Fed likely to push through two more quarter-point increases this year. In contrast, eurozone interest rates are zero, while the UK Bank Rate is just 0.5%. Trump singled out China for particular criticism last night, saying it was letting the yuan drop \u201clike a rock\u201d. So he won\u2019t be pleased by Beijing\u2019s response \u2013 the People\u2019s Bank of China let the yuan hit a new one-year low today, fixing the currency at 6.7671 per dollar. That\u2019s nearly 1% weaker than Thursday\u2019s fix. The yuan then tumbled lower in nervous trading, hitting 6.812 to the dollar. That prompted a reaction; Chinese banks began buying the yuan and selling dollars, apparently in an attempt to prop the currency up. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. With trade war fears mounting and Brexit looming, investors already have plenty to worry about. But Donald Trump has added a new anxiety -- currency wars. Overnight, the US president launched a rare attack on America\u2019s central bankers, revealing that he wasn\u2019t happy with their plans to raise US interest rates. Trump claimed that the Federal Reserve risked undermining all his good work strengthening the economy. He told CNBC that higher borrowing costs would drive up the dollar, especially as other central banks are keeping policy loose. \u201cI don\u2019t really \u2014 I am not happy about it.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t like all of this work that we\u2019re putting into the economy and then I see rates going up.\u201d You could almost hear Fed chair Jerome Powell\u2019s eyebrows rising sharply as Trump\u2019s comments hit the wires. Central bank independence is a serious issue - policymakers are meant to navigate the economic squalls and storms free from political interference. But Trump clearly doesn\u2019t play by the rules, so traders now have to calculate whether White House pressure is going to influence the path of interest rates. And if so, is that going to set off a currency war? Powell may feel Trump\u2019s criticism is particularly misplaced, as the president\u2019s tax-cutting agenda is putting pressure on the Fed to act, to prevent a dangerous inflationary bubble. Trump insisted that Powell was a \u201cvery good man\u201d, but even so the president \u201cwasn\u2019t thrilled\u201d about the prospect of further interest rate hikes. The White House tried to row back on Trump\u2019s comments, insisting that he respected the independence of the Fed. But still, his intervention hit the markets, as CNBC explains: Financial markets across the globe whipsawed on Trump\u2019s comments. The dollar index, which tracks the dollar\u2019s performance against a basket of six other currencies, fell from a one-year high and traded just below breakeven. U.S. equities edged off their session lows, but remained lower on the day. Also coming up today June\u2019s UK public finances are released this morning. The City predicts that Britain borrowed around \u00a35bn to balance the books last month, much the same as in May. 9.30am BST: UK public finances for June 1.30pm BST: Canadian inflation figures",
