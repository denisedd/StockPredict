Soon it will be transported a few hundred metres down the road in downtown Manhattan to confront another symbol of entrenched masculinity: the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE). Stacey Cunningham says she couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be more delighted.</p> <p>\u00e2\u20ac\u0153I think she\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fantastic,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd says Cunningham, the 67th president of the NYSE and <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/may/25/stacey-cunningham-nyse-first-female-president-wall-street\">the first woman to head the male-dominated institution in its 226-year history</a>. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153For me, she is a message to individuals, though. I think we need to call ourselves to action, especially as women, not to hold ourselves back.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd</p> <p>Cunningham may be a fan of Fearless Girl, but she is not as happy with the gender-focused attention drawn by her elevation to one of the most high-profile jobs in finance. She gives a small, hard smile when asked about the coverage.</p> <p>She should not really be surprised. The number of women running businesses, let alone institutions of the stature of the NYSE, is still small. And the number of women running the US\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s top 500 companies \u00e2\u20ac\u201c many listed on the NYSE \u00e2\u20ac\u201c <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://fortune.com/2018/05/21/women-fortune-500-2018/\">fell this year.</a></p> <p>The floor of the stock exchange itself is also still a sausage fest. It is less male than it has been in the past, but that is because the number of men has been hacked away by technology, not diversity. The majority of the women on the exchange\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s floor seem to be working for the 30-plus media outlets based there.</p> <p>Cunningham, 43, has been at the exchange on and off (and mostly on) since the 1990s.

She first entered the NYSE in 1994 as an intern, when she was one of about 30 women among 1,000 men. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I walked in and right away I fell in love with the place,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd she says. The \u00e2\u20ac\u0153energy and the pace\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd reminded her of her family. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153What struck me right away was the sense of community.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd</p> <p>After she graduated, she came back to the NYSE, working on the trading floor until 2005, when she took time off to complete a culinary training course. She then worked at a rival stock exchange, the Nasdaq, as director of capital markets, before rejoining the NYSE and becoming the exchange\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chief operating officer in 2015.</p> <p>She acknowledges that things have changed for women at the NYSE in the decades since she first worked here. For one, they have proper bathrooms. When she started, women had to make do with one tiny bathroom converted from a phone booth, while the men\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bathrooms had a palatial lounge area.</p> <p>But she never experienced <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jan/24/sexism-in-banking-its-happening-and-its-complicated\">the rampant sexism other women in finance have complained about</a>, she says. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153When you walked through a trading floor 20 years ago as a woman, there was a little bit of you that could feel the room looking at you,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd she says.

The bronze sculpture of a little girl defiantly facing off against Wall Street\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Charging Bull launched a million selfies and became an unlikely avatar of the #MeToo movement. Soon it will be transported a few hundred metres down the road in downtown Manhattan to confront another symbol of entrenched masculinity: the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE). Stacey Cunningham says she couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be more delighted. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I think she\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fantastic,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd says Cunningham, the 67th president of the NYSE and the first woman to head the male-dominated institution in its 226-year history. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153For me, she is a message to individuals, though. I think we need to call ourselves to action, especially as women, not to hold ourselves back.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Cunningham may be a fan of Fearless Girl, but she is not as happy with the gender-focused attention drawn by her elevation to one of the most high-profile jobs in finance. She gives a small, hard smile when asked about the coverage. She should not really be surprised. The number of women running businesses, let alone institutions of the stature of the NYSE, is still small. And the number of women running the US\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s top 500 companies \u00e2\u20ac\u201c many listed on the NYSE \u00e2\u20ac\u201c fell this year. The floor of the stock exchange itself is also still a sausage fest. It is less male than it has been in the past, but that is because the number of men has been hacked away by technology, not diversity. The majority of the women on the exchange\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s floor seem to be working for the 30-plus media outlets based there. Cunningham, 43, has been at the exchange on and off (and mostly on) since the 1990s.

                "bodyText":"European stock markets have closed higher tonight, swept up by Google\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s strong performance and optimism over China. Mining stocks led the rally in London, on hopes that Beijing\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new stimulus package will protect China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy from a crash. BHP Billiton, Anglo American and Glencore all surged over 5% to the top of the Footsie leaderboard, as commodity prices were lifted. Tech stocks also gained ground in Europe, as traders watched the Nasdaq hit today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s record high. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the closing prices: Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE 100: Up 53 points or 0.7% at 7709 German DAX: Up 120 points or 1.1% at 12,689 French CAC: Up 55 points or 1% at 5,434 Fiona Cincotta, senior market analyst at City Index, says China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new stimulus package has calmed some anxiety over the trade dispute with America, boostings sentiment across the globe. A package of tax cuts, research spending, special bonds, infrastructure spending and a pledge to use tax policy to stimulate growth shows that the authorities in China are concerned over the impact that the developing trade war will have on growth and are taking measures to counteract a weakening economy. Traders are also hopeful about the Q2 earnings season, which is getting into full swing; Earning season is off to a strong start, of the 21% of S&amp;P firms that have reported, 80.6% has beaten expectations for Q2 earnings, whilst 74% have surpassed expectations on earnings. These are the fundamental figures which are going to keep the equity rally alive given they offer the perfect distraction to trade war headlines. Until those trade war headlines are reflected in the data, these strong fundamentals will keep the bulls in charge. Over in New York, the Nasdaq remains at record levels. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s up 45 points at 7412. Alphabet is the second-top riser, up 4%, behind biotechnology company Biogen whcih also smashed profit forecasts today. PayPal (+2.1%) and Facebook (+1.3) are also among the top risers. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s probably all for today. Thanks for reading and commenting. GW Newsflash from Lancashire: Shale gas firm Cuadrilla has been given the green light by government to start fracking at a well between Blackpool and Preston. This is the first permit granted under the government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new regulatory regime, and comes despite protests from local residents and anti-fracking campaigners. Energy minister Claire Perry said shale gas was an important potential new energy source, and she was satisfied Cuadrilla had met the government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s conditions for granting a hydraulic fracturing permit. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Our world class regulations will ensure that shale exploration will maintain robust environmental standards and meet the expectations of local communities.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Some in the local community, though, fear that injecting liquid at high pressures into the rock to split it and release hydrocarbons could cause earthquakes and pollute the water supply. The IMF\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s cure for the global economy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s imbalances includes cutting pensions in countries who are borrowing too much. On the other wide of the coin, it wants saver countries to keep older citizens in the jobs market for longer. Newsflash: The International Monetary Fund has warned that the global economy is being destabilised by current account imbalances. In a new report, the IMF flags up that some countries are simply saving too much (such as Germany), while others are running persistent deficits (Britain and America). And over time, this is creating dangerous instability. The Fun warns: From a global perspective, excess surpluses have been especially large and persistent in a small group of countries, most prominently in Germany and China, and to a lesser extent, in Korea, Netherlands, Sweden and Singapore Excess deficits remain mainly in the United States and the United Kingdom, some euro area debtor countries, and a few vulnerable emerging market and developing economies (e.g. Argentina, Turkey). Donald Trump would surely agree, having made \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcfair trade\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 a key plank of his administration. But the IMF aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t endorsing the White House\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade war. Instead, it warns that protectionist measures will back fire. Chief economist Maurice Obstfeld says: The persistence of global imbalances and mounting perceptions of an uneven playing field for trade are fueling protectionist sentiment. These impulses are misguided. An escalation of protectionist policies would mainly hurt domestic and global growth, without much of an effect on current account imbalances, as this year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s report also finds. The Fund also warns that Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tax cuts could make the things worse: The fiscal easing currently underway in the United States is leading to a tightening in monetary conditions, a stronger US dollar, and a larger US current account deficit. In the near term, these trends risk aggravating trade tensions, and the resulting faster tightening of global financing conditions, which could prove even more disruptive for emerging market economies, especially those with weak external positions Most of the famous FAANG stocks are bursting ahead today. Google/Alphabet is leading the way (+4%), followed by Facebook (+2%), Amazon (+1.7%) and Apple (+0.9%). Investors are wagering that Alphabet\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s strong results bode well for the current results season (Facebook reports tomorrow, followed by Amazon on Thursday and Apple early next week). Netflix, which missed Wall Street forecasts last week, is lagging behind though. Breaking: The Nasdaq stock index has hit a fresh record high at the start of trading in New York. Tech giant Alphabet is driving the rally, up 4%, after smashing Wall Street forecasts last night. This helped send the Nasdaq Composite Index up 70 points, or, 0.9%, to 7,912 in early trading. Traders are cheered by the strong earnings from its Google operations (see opening post), which delivered earnings per share of $11.75, compared to forecasts of $9.59 per share. The broader S&amp;P 500 index has gained 0.75%, while the benchmark Dow Jones industrial average is 0.6% higher. Investors in Europe are also putting their worries about trade wars behind them, pushing shares up in London, Frankfurt and Paris: Traders are also cheering China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new stimulus measures. Beijing\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s plan to cut R&amp;D taxes and spur local investment is bolstering optimism in the markets. David Madden, market analyst at CMC Markets, says: European stock markets are higher in the wake of Beijing\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s plans to stimulate the economy. The Chinese government unveiled plans to boost domestic demand in the face of heightened trade tensions. The second-largest economy in the world has been slowing down in recent years, and the tariffs imposed by the US are making matters worse. The proactive move by the Chinese authorities has lifted investor confidence around the global. Bitcoin is also on a tear this morning, as cryptocurrencies rally sharply. The Bitcoin price has jumped by 6% this morning to $8,175 on the Luxembourg Bitstamp exchange, extending its recent rally. The digital currency has now surged by a third in the last 10 days, having fallen sharply from around $20,000 at the start of the year. Lukman Otunuga, research analyst at FXTM, suggests that the Bitcoin bulls have been lured out of hibernation, and could push bitcoin towards $10,000 An inflow of positive news over the past few weeks regarding cryptocurrencies has revived investor appetite for Bitcoin and this can be reflected in the bullish price action. Goldman Sachs and BlackRock have expressed interest in the cryptocurrency markets while the Financial Services Board declared that they do not pose a threat to the global financial system. With this renewed sense of optimism over cryptocurrencies attracting investors from all directions, further upside could be on the cards in the near term. Alphabet shares are expected to jump around 4% when Wall Street trading begin in 45 minutes, after the tech giant beat revenue and earnings targets last night. In the old days, world leaders would prepare for a visiting politician by getting the red carpet swept, and perhaps organising a banquet. Times change, though (and not always for the better). So president Trump has limbered up for his meeting with EC president Jean-Claude Juncker tomorrow with another blast about trade. Tomorrow\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meeting between Juncker and Trump could be heated. The EC would like to dial down the trade tensions with the US, which has already threatened to impose tariffs on European car imports. But Juncker may struggle to persuade his host that tariffs are counter-productive, and will hurt US consumers and cost jobs. The two sides have already fired shots in the trade wars; America hit Europe with 25% tariffs on steel imports, prompting new levies on US goods such as jeans and orange juice. But despite all the noise, the two sides actually have fairly low trade barriers. As Chris Giles wrote in the Financial Times today: Even though some trade is deterred by specific high tariffs on both sides of the Atlantic, the average weighted tariffs applied by the EU on US goods were 3 per cent in 2015, a little lower than the US equivalent of 3.3 per cent in the same year. City economist Timothy Ash thinks the Turkish central bank blundered today by not hiking interest rates: Yikes! The Turkish lira is tumbling after the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s central bank surprisingly left interest rates on hold. The financial markets had widely expected a rate hike today, of at least one percentage point. Instead, the Turkish central bank left borrowing costs unchanged at 17.75%, despite concerns over high inflation and the weak currency. The move dealt the lira another blow, wiping 3% off its value against the US dollar. The decision will fuel concerns that president Erdogan is undermining central bank independence, as he pushes for lower interest rates. He has just promoted his son-in-law to a top role overseeing the Turkish economy. London\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s taxi drivers have been pushing back against ride-hail app Uber for years, holding protests and demanding for tighter regulation. But now, they are taking their fight to a higher level - considering suing Uber for more than a billion pounds of lost earnings. Sky News\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Mark Kleinman has the details: London\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s army of black cab drivers are drawing up a stunning plot to sue Uber for more than \u00c2\u00a31bn weeks after the ride-hailing app won a 15-month extension to its licence to operate in the capital. Sky News has learnt that the Licensed Taxi Drivers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Association (LTDA), which has 11,000 members in London, has engaged the leading law firm Mishcon de Reya to explore the potential for a massive legal claim against Uber. Sources said on Tuesday that if the case proceeded, the LTDA was expected to argue that all 25,000 black cab drivers in London had suffered lost earnings averaging around \u00c2\u00a310,000 for at least five years as a consequence of failings in the way Uber had operated. At that level, the overall compensation bill could total \u00c2\u00a31.25bn. Last September, Uber learned it was losing its licence after Transport for London concluded it wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153fit and proper\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 operator. That forced the firm to tighten up its practices, including the reporting of criminal offences and carrying out background checks on drivers. TfL then granted Uber a new probationary licence last month, after the firm passed several inspections. Back in the markets, and Chinese stocks have surged after Beijing announced new fiscal measures to stimulate its economy. Overnight, China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s government rolled out a mixture of tax cuts and infrastructure spending to tackle the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153uncertainty\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd hurting its economy. The People\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Bank of China also acted, pumping $74bn into China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s banking system to prevent credit drying up. Premier Li Keqiang said it was important to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153preserve economic activity within a reasonable range\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, as the cabinet agreed tax cuts for company research and development projects. China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s government will also accelerate the issuance of new bonds to finance local government building projects, and promote privately funded transport, oil and gas, and telecommunications projects. ANZ economists Raymond Yeung and Betty Wang said in a note. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The government is sending a clear signal that it is preparing to defend growth, ... Premier Li may be concerned about the negative impact of deleveraging on growth,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The move comes just days after China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s growth rate dipped. It follows rising trade tensions with America, and Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s threat to impose tariffs on all Chinese imports. After months of losses, investors hailed the news. Shares jumped in Shanghai, sending the benchmark index up 1.5% - making its best three-day run in two years. Just in: Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s factories kept growing last month, but bosses are slashing some investment plans as trade war and Brexit fears grow. The CBI has reported that UK manufacturing output rose in the last quarter. Around 35% of businesses reported an increase in new orders, and 20% reported a decrease, giving a balance of +15%. Firms reported that new orders continued to expand \u00e2\u20ac\u0153at a brisk pace\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, with stronger demand from domestic customers making up for a slowdown in exports. However, firms are cautious; 18% of firms said they were more optimistic about the general business situation than three months ago and 21% were less optimistic, giving a balance of -3%. Tom Crotty, Group Director of Ineos and Chair of CBI Manufacturing Council, says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s great to see the manufacturing sector firing on all cylinders, with production revving up again after the slowdown earlier this year. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153But rising trade tensions and ongoing uncertainty over our future trade and customs arrangements are clearly taking their toll on manufacturers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 confidence and investment.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd With Donald Trump hiking tariffs, and Britain possibly heading for a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcno-deal\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 exit from the EU, firms are axing their spending on \u00e2\u20ac\u0153intangible\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd assets, such as product &amp; process innovation and training and re-training. Investment in this area is expected to fall at a pace unseen since the global financial crisis, the CBI warns. Newsflash: Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Serious Fraud Office has launched a new attempt to prosecute Barclays bank over its emergency fundraising from Qatar during the 2008 financial crisis. The SFO has applied to the High Court to get charges against Barclays PLC and Barclays Bank (which holds its banking licence to operate in different countries) reinstated. Barclays says it will defend the application brought by the SFO. Two months ago, the Crown Court dismissed charges that Barclays had conspired to commit fraud by false representations, and provided \u00e2\u20ac\u0153unlawful financial assistance\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to Qatar over the fund-raising. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s some reaction to this month\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s eurozone slowdown, from Oxford Economics\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Angel Talavera: ...and from Piet Christiansen of Danske Bank: Trader Marc-Andr\u00c3\u00a9 Fongern points out how Germany is outperforming the rest of the eurozone this month: Growth across Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s private sector is slowing this month, according to a new survey of purchasing managers across the region. Data firm Markit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u02dccomposite output\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 index has fallen to 54.3, from 54.9 in June, due to a slowdown in growth at service sector companies. Its manufacturing PMI index held steady at 54.2, but factory bosses reported the slowest growth in export orders in almost two years. Markit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chief business economist, Chris Williamson, says Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy has entered July on a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153soft footing\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd - amid worries about trade disputes. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Given the waning growth of new business and further slide in business optimism, the outlook has also deteriorated, notably in manufacturing, where the surveys saw worries about trade wars intensify markedly in July. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153While there are signs that improving domestic demand in many countries is helping drive robust service sector expansion and support manufacturing, a worsening picture for export growth is clearly having an increasingly detrimental effect on manufacturing. Much of the growth came from Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest two members. Markit adds. Growth in the periphery hit its lowest level since autumn 2016, though. By country, faster growth in Germany contrasted with a slight slowing in France. Elsewhere, growth was the weakest for 21 months, slipping lower in both manufacturing and services. The rate of growth of Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s private sector economy rebounded from a 20-month low in May to a five-month high, driven by a stronger increase in manufacturing output. But France saw the second- weakest expansion in 18 months, stymied in particular by near-stagnant manufacturing. European stock markets have all opened higher, as Alphabet gives the technology sector a boost. The Europe-wide Stoxx 600 index has gained 0.4%, with the mining sector up 1% and tech gaining 0.5%. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s love for a (properly mixed) gin and tonic has swept mixer maker Fever-Tree\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shares to a fresh record high. They surged to \u00c2\u00a339.87 in early trading, up from $34.60 last night, after Fever-Tree posted a 45% jump in revenues this year. The company has also landed a deal with America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest wine and spirits distribution company, leaving it optimistic about the future. CEO Tim Warrillow declared: Given the strong performance in the first half of the year, the Board anticipates that the outcome for the full year will be comfortably ahead of its expectations.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Anyone who had the foresight to buy Fever-Tree\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shares in 2014, when they were worth below \u00c2\u00a32, can afford a cheeky double G&amp;T tonight. Back in the UK, supermarkets are rubbing their hands after enjoying a boost from England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s World Cup run. Data firm Kantar reports that sales of alcohol at supermarkets surged to \u00c2\u00a3287 million during the week that the England football team played (and beat!) Colombia and Sweden. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a record, if you exclude Christmas and Easter. Fraser McKevitt, head of retail and consumer insight at Kantar Worldpanel, explains: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153England may not have won the World Cup \u00e2\u20ac\u201c but its journey to the semi-finals not only helped to kickstart the summer, but supermarket sales to boot. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Over the past month, football-frenzied customers visited supermarkets an extra 13 million times as they hurried to stock up on World Cup-viewing essentials, with alcohol in particular the stand-out winner. Supermarkets also saw strong demand for BBQ products and sun cream: McKevitt adds: With the hot and sunny weather showing no signs of letting up, al fresco dining has continued to tempt shoppers. Over the past month, sales of firelighters and fresh burgers rocketed by 47% and 30% as customers honed their barbecuing skills. Meanwhile, sun care products and painkillers were both in demand: sales of sun creams jumped by 38%, while nearly a third of all households picked up pain-killing tablets over the past month. [Those pain killers might have something to do with those alcohol sales....] Financial analysts are impressed by the ability of Google\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s parent company to keep growing fast, even with an EU antitrust case hanging over it. As Richard Kramer of Arete Research puts it: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153There was never a question about Google\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s dominance of a buoyant digital ads market\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd JMP Securities analyst Ron Josey agrees that Google\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s core revenue stream, web adverts, remains strong: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153First and foremost, Google Sites revenue has continued to grow, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the fourth quarter in a row of accelerating growth rates. The company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s continued ability to reinvent or launch new ad products that have been adopted by advertisers, and that drives return on investment.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Forrester Research\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Collin Colburn said the $5bn fine imposed by commissioner Margrethe Vestager last week was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153pretty big\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd for most companies, but only a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153slap on the wrist\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to Google. But Naeem Aslam of Think Markets argues that Google must avoid further financial penalties, for the sake of its reputation: Today, it is all about Alphabet; Google is the king of the advertisement and its ad business is in full throttle. The message is clear for its investors that the company is a monster in this arena and the EU regulatory backlash hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t been able to damage its number in any significant way. The internet giant reported its earning number last night and it smashed all the estimates. The crown jewel, its ads business experienced growth of 24% and its second most important lucrative business; cloud services also added a strong number. The growth in the cloud services was 37%. When we look at the Alphabet\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s earning, it makes us comfortable that there is a moderate slowdown in spending. This means that the user acquisition cost is going down. This creates a more efficient environment for revenue growth. Having said this, the company cannot afford to have reputation damage and it still needs to bring fines under-control because eventually this would add go against Google\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s values. Last night, Google CEO Sundar Pichai reported that the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s self-driving car division is making progress. He told investors: Waymo expanded its partnership with Fiat Chrysler with the option to add up to 62,000 Chrysler Pacifica minivans to its self-driving fleet. And lastly Waymo announced that it has driven more than 8 million fully autonomous miles with most of those on city streets. Pichai also revealed that Google Translate got a boost during the World Cup. Pichai told investors he was: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153...extremely proud to see the positive feedback on how useful Google Translate was for people who traveled to Russia\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd In these simple moments, when you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re in an unfamiliar place or you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know the language, Google is there to help with the right information at the right time.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. European investors are in cheerier mood today, after Google\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s parent company smashed expectations last night. Alphabet shrugged off the impact of its penalty for breaking European competition rules, by posting revenues of $26.24bn in just the last three months, beating expectations of $25.5bn. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s up from $20.9bn a year earlier. Profits dipped to $2.8bn from $4.1bn, but they would have been a sparkling $7.8bn but for the $5bn fine imposed by the EU last week. Chief financial officer Ruth Porat declared the company had delivered \u00e2\u20ac\u0153another quarter of very strong performance\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Wall Street agreed - Google\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shares jumped by 4% in after-hours trading following the results. This is feeding through to Europe this morning, with shares rising in London: The results showed that Google\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s grip on Web advertising remains extremely strong, with 58% more \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcclicks\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 on its mobile and YouTube adverts than a year ago. Non-advertising revenues (such as mobile apps, cloud computing and Google Home speakers) jumped to $4.4bn, up from around $3bn a year ago. Tech shares are expected to be in demand today after Alphabet\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcimpressive set of results\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, says Jasper Lawler of London Capital Group: It wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t just the headline figures impressing traders, but also a surprise drop in costs reported by Alphabet. Costs had been increasing at a concerning rate over previous quarters as Alphabet played catch up in areas such as developing its cloud business and consumer business. These higher costs had been squeezing margins causing concern particularly among short term traders. Unexpectedly lower costs have eased these fears, boosting demand for the stock in the process. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our news story on the results: Also coming up today There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a flurry of corporate news today, as companies clear the decks before the summer holidays. Swiss Bank UBS posted a 12% rise in pre-tax profits in the last quarter, thanks to its investment banking arm. European carmaker PSA has reported record earnings, after the takeover of Opel-Vauxhall last year. But UK energy producer Drax\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s profits fell 15% in the first half of the year, following various outages. And among the the smaller companies, tonic and mixer-maker Fevertree has posted another big jump in profits - adjusted earnings rose 35% in the last six months, to \u00c2\u00a334m. More on all hose shortly... On the economics side, we find out how Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s companies are faring this month when Markit releases its \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcflash\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Purchasing Managers Survey for July.

The departure of the group\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s EMEA head, Alfredo Altavilla, on Monday will make his job that bit harder, as will the escalating global trade war. As a Chrysler insider and the head of Jeep, Mr Manley is unlikely to want to follow through on previous rumours that FCA would spin off Jeep, or even sell the whole company.</p> <p>Instead, he will probably continue to put Jeep at the centre of the group\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s global strategy, and cement the overall group\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shift away from small cars towards sports utility vehicles.

Trump and Juncker appear amiable at meeting aimed to avert trade war \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We agree today, first of all, to work together toward zero tariffs, zero, non-tariff barriers, and zero subsidies on non-auto industrial goods,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Trump told reporters. The statement came after Trump had threatened tariffs on car imports and reports that the EU is planning retaliatory measures. Trump said the US and EU will set up an executive working group to work on trade and assess existing tariffs \u00e2\u20ac\u0153to the betterment of both\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. He added: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re starting the negotiation right now but we know very much where it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s going.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Juncker said it his \u00e2\u20ac\u0153intention to make a deal\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd that would work towards zero tariffs on industrial goods. Trump added: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This was a very big day for free and fair trade, a very big day indeed.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be back in the morning to see how the European stock markets react. You might expect a rally.... however, the news that Facebook\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shares have tanked in afterhours trading (it missed Wall Street forecasts and lowered its outlook) could weigh on investors. Goodnight! GW Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s commitment to import a lot more liquified natural gas from America is quite interesting. During his visit to Europe this month, Donald Trump blasted Germany for signing up to a new natural gas pipeline link with Russia called Nord Stream 2. Trump claimed the deal made Europe dangerously reliant on Russia for its energy needs - a concern echoed by some experts. So does today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s deal fix that problem? Not according to former US ambassador Anthony Gardner, who doubts whether much more LNG will actually cross the Atlantic... I came, I talked, I got a deal, says Juncker on Twitter: Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a video clip of presidents Juncker and Trump announcing they have agreed to work together on trade: European trade commissioner Cecilia Malmstrom says Washington and Brussels have \u00e2\u20ac\u0153turned a page\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in their relationship. Beijing may be looking at tonight\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s deal nervously, says Reuters Noah Barkin: China, of course, is being threatened with tariffs on ALL its US sales, unless it makes concessions on trade. European Commission vice-president Jyrki Katainen has hailed the apparent breakthrough: Professor Steve Peers points out that the two sides have primarily agreed to negotiate on trade, rather than reach a concrete agreement (yet). The BBC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Andrew Neil isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t impressed by Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s approach Investor Christian Gagnon thinks Juncker has played his cards well: Jean-Claude Juncker told reporters that he had a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153good and constructive meeting\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd with Donald Trump. He added that the two sides had agreed not to impose any new tariffs while talks were taking place. That might mean that the threat of punitive tariffs being imposed on EU car sales into America may have receded.... Donald Trump also sounds optimistic following his talks with Juncker today. He tells reporters in Washington that the two side have agreed to work together to lower trade barriers Trump declares: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This was a very big day for free and fair trade, a very big day indeed.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Trump points out that the negotiations are only just starting, but both sides know where they want to get to. That includes working towards \u00e2\u20ac\u0153zero tariffs, zero non-tariff barriers, and zero subsidies on non-auto industrial goods,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd says the US president. He adds: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We will also work to reduce barriers and increase trade in services, chemicals, pharmaceuticals, medical products, as well as soybeans; soybeans is a big deal, Europe would also become \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a massive buyer\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd of liquefied natural gas from the United States, Trump adds proudly. The EC says it has launched a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153new phase\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in its relationship with the US today. It is: ....a phase of close friendship, of strong trade relations in which both of us will win, of working better together for global security and prosperity, and of fighting jointly against terrorism. The EC adds that it hopes to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153resolve the steel and aluminum tariff issues\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd -- the levies imposed by Donald Trump on European metal imports earlier this year. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s official: The European Union and the United States have reached an agreement that may calm fears of a trade war between the two sides. The breakthrough was reached during Jean-Claude Juncker\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s talks with Donald Trump at the White House. The two side have agreed to work together to lower trade barriers, and towards eliminating some tariffs. It will see Europe import more energy, and soy beans, from America. In a statement, the EU says it agreed four key points with the US today: First of all, to work together toward zero tariffs, zero non-tariff barriers, and zero subsidies on non-auto industrial goods. We will also work to reduce barriers and increase trade in services, chemicals, pharmaceuticals, medical products, as well as soybeans. This will open markets for farmers and workers, increase investment, and lead to greater prosperity in both the United States and the European Union. It will also make trade fairer and more reciprocal. Secondly, we agreed today to strengthen our strategic cooperation with respect to energy. The European Union wants to import more liquefied natural gas (LNG) from the United States to diversify its energy supply. Thirdly, we agreed today to launch a close dialogue on standards in order to ease trade, reduce bureaucratic obstacles, and slash costs. Fourthly, we agreed today to join forces to protect American and European companies better from unfair global trade practices. We will therefore work closely together with like-minded partners to reform the WTO and to address unfair trading practices, including intellectual property theft, forced technology transfer, industrial subsidies, distortions created by state owned enterprises, and overcapacity. More to follow! US shares have jumped in late trading, following the report that Europe has made some trade concessions. The Dow surged by 150 points, on hopes that a trade war can be averted. NEWSFLASH: The Dow Jones newswire is reporting that Jean-Claude Juncker has proposed some concessions to Donald Trump at their talks today. It says the Europeans have \u00e2\u20ac\u0153agreed to lower industrial tariffs\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and also to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153iimport more U.S. soybeans\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. We don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have more details, or confirmation yet.... Sky News have a video clip of Donald Trump and Jean-Claude Juncker\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s remarks at the White House earlier: Donald Trump and Jean-Claude Juncker have now vanished off for their trade talks. The two leaders appeared quite friendly as they sat side by side in the Oval Office. At one stage, Trump even reached over to give Juncker a friendly tap on the thigh. The optimistic noises from the two men have also helped to push shares higher on Wall Street, dragging the Dow Jones industrial average away from its earlier losses. President Juncker thanks Donald Trump for inviting him to the White House for talks on trade. America and Europe are close partners and allies, not enemies, he says, so we have to work together. [reminder, Trump recently claimed the EU was a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcfoe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 when it comes to trade]. Juncker says that he believes talks should focus on decreasing tariffs, not increasing them. Trump says he agrees! The US would be very pleased if there were no tariffs, barriers or subsidies. We want reciprocal trade at a minimum, he insists, and \u00e2\u20ac\u0153we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re making tremendous strides\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd towards it. We hope to achieve something good, and when we do you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be the first to know, Trump concludes. The assembled press pack then shout questions. Some are on trade, but at least one was about the secret recording of Trump discussing buying the rights to former Playboy model Karen McDougal\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s story about her alleged affair with the president. None of the questions are answered. Donald Trump began by complimenting Jean-Claude Juncker on the way he represents EU citizens. We are looking for a fair trade deal, and hopefully we can sort something out, Trump tells reporters at the White House. The president then claims that America has been losing \u00e2\u20ac\u0153hundreds of billions of dollars\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to the EU over recent years [because it runs a trade deficit with Europe]. We just want a level playing field for American companies and farmers, Trump continues. Something that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s good for everybody, that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s what we are going to discuss. Newsflash: European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker has declared that America and Europe are \u00e2\u20ac\u0153friends, not enemies\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, as he sits down with Donald Trump for talks on trade. In response, Trump has told reporters at the White House that Juncker is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153very smart\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and \u00e2\u20ac\u0153tough\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, as they prepare to lock horns about tariffs. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a media scrum at the White House as reporters prepare to hear from presidents Juncker and Trump. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re expecting the two men will hold a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153pool spray\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd* in the Oval Office (* - a chance for journalists to ask questions, not a refreshing blast from a hose) Donald Trump limbered up for his talks with Jean-Claude Juncker over trade today, by declaring he would show \u00e2\u20ac\u0153No weakness\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. As explained in the introduction, the EU hope to talk Trump away from imposing tariffs on European car imports, but there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not much hope of a big breakthrough today. Now this is interesting... Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s top economic advisor, Larry Kudlow, has told Fox News he held constructive talks with EU officials over trade yesterday. That could be an encouraging sign for the Trump-Juncker talks, which are due to start soon in Washington. In London, the FTSE 100 index of top shares has fallen 50 points, or 0.66% today, to close at 7658. Chinese president Xi has fired a warning to the White House not to launch a global trade war. Speaking at the annual summit of BRICS (emerging market) economies in Johannesburg, Xi warned that countries who pursue \u00e2\u20ac\u0153economic hegemony\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd will end up hurting themselves Xi declared that leaders must choose between cooperation and confrontation, adding. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Unilateralism and protectionism are mounting, dealing a severe blow to multilateralism and the multilateral trading regime\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Trump, meanwhile has accused China of being \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcvicious\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, by imposing retaliatory tariffs in response to his push for freer trade. Motor racing chief Jean Todt, who ran the Ferrari Formula 1 team for several years, says Sergio Marchionne was a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153visionary leader\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Todt, now president of the FIA (F\u00c3\u00a9d\u00c3\u00a9ration Internationale de l\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Automobile), writes: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It is with great sadness that I learned that Sergio Marchionne tragically and unexpectedly passed away. Sergio achieved a colossal amount for the automotive industry and motor sport worldwide. He dedicated himself fully to turn around the FIAT-Chrysler group and put all his energy to bring Scuderia Ferrari back to the top. He was an endearing, upstanding and brave man, an unconventional and visionary leader. He was an eminent member of the FIA F1 Strategy Group and of the FIA High-Level Panel for Road Safety. His death is a considerable loss. On behalf of the entire FIA community, all my thoughts go out to his family, his friends and his Ferrari and Fiat-Chrysler group teams\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Another carmarker, General Motors, has spooked the markets by slashing its profit forecasts. GM blamed rising commodity costs -- following Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision to impose 25% tariffs on steel imports, and 10% on aluminium. That has pushed up GM\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s raw materials bill, hitting profitability. Chuck Stevens, GM\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s executive vice president and CFO says: Our operating performance was impacted by significant headwinds from commodity costs and currency devaluations in South America. For the rest of the year we will focus on flawlessly executing our full-size truck launches and continue managing the business with discipline in a more challenging environment.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd GM now expects to make between $5.80 to $6.20 per share this year, down from $6.30 to $6.60 previously. This makes GM one of the biggest companies to warn that Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade disputes are hurting business. The warning comes just a few hours before the president sits down with EC president Jean-Claude Juncker for talks to (possibly) stave off a trade war. Wall Street has taken the news badly; shares in GM are down almost 7% today. Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cgil union has given a guarded tribute to Sergio Marchionne, reports Associated Press: The Cgil union, Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s most powerful, praised Marchionne for having \u00e2\u20ac\u0153saved a dying company.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd But it faulted him for having failed to negotiate with \u00e2\u20ac\u0153an important sector of Italian workers,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd which it said created conflict and divisions that are still being felt. Cgil\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Fiom metalworkers union clashed with Marchionne over changes he brought to Italian plants to increase productivity. Ford\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s executive chairman, Bill Ford, says the auto industry will miss Sergio Marchionne badly: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Sergio Marchionne was one of the most respected leaders in the industry whose creativity and bold determination helped to restore Chrysler to financial health and grow Fiat Chrysler into a profitable global automaker. His extraordinary leadership, candor and passion for the industry will be missed by everyone who knew him. Our thoughts and prayers go out to his family at this difficult time.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The plunge in Fiat Chrysler\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s share price can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be directly attributed to Sergio Marchionne\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s death. His long stint as CEO actually ended last weekend, when the company announced his resignation following complications after shoulder surgery. Plus, Marchionne was already expected to step down next year. But..by lowering its profit and revenue forecasts today, FCA has reminded the markets that the auto sector is a tough place for new CEO Mike Manley to navigate. Shares in Fiat Chrysler have tumbled almost 10% at the start of trading in New York, after the firm cut its profit and revenue forecasts for this year. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our news story on Sergio Marchionne\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s death: Over in Turin, Fiat Chrysler has lowered its flags to half-mast today, as a sign of respect to Sergio Marchionne. Workers at Fiat\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s plant in Pomigliano, Italy, where the popular Panda car is produced, stopped production for 10 minutes, Associated Press reports. Ana Nicholls, Director of Industry Operations at the Economist Intelligence Unit, says the business world has lost one of its \u00e2\u20ac\u0153greatest turnaround managers\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The death of Sergio Marchionne marks the passing of one of the greatest turnaround managers of the past century. His legacy is impressive: in saving both Fiat and Chrysler through clever deal-making and sheer hard work he not only ensured the survival two of the most venerable names in the auto industry, but also saved the jobs of tens of thousands of people. Mike Manley has a lot on his place, as he tries to step into Sergio Marchionne\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shoes, she adds: The difficulty is understanding what comes next for FCA. Mr Marchionne famously said there was no script for after his departure and the new CEO, Mike Manley, is having to start improvising more quickly than expected. The departure of the group\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s EMEA head, Alfredo Altavilla, on Monday will make his job that bit harder, as will the escalating global trade war. As a Chrysler insider and the head of Jeep, Mr Manley is unlikely to want to follow through on previous rumours that FCA would spin off Jeep, or even sell the whole company. Instead, he will probably continue to put Jeep at the centre of the group\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s global strategy, and cement the overall group\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shift away from small cars towards sports utility vehicles. But if tariff barriers continue to rise, he will have to find a way to re-engineer the group\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s product line-up so that fewer vehicles and parts need to cross borders, without undermining the savings the group was getting from greater global integration. That may mean fewer big deals and a lot more small-scale restructuring, but either way he will find Mr Marchionne a hard act to follow.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The New York stock exchange have tweeted a nice picture of Sergio Marchionne on the day he floated Ferrari, a key milestone during his time at FCA. Here are a few more photos from the archive: \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 This block was amended on 26 July 2018 because an earlier version misnamed Sergio Marchionne as Silvio. Fiat Chrysler Automobile\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new CEO, Mike Manley, has paid tribute to his predecessor, as he presents the car maker\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new financial results to analysts. Manley says FCA learned this morning that Sergio Marchionne had passed away. Clearly this is a very sad and difficult time. Our thoughts and prayers go out to his family, friends and colleagues. Manley explains that he worked with Marchionne for many years, so his death is heartbreaking on a personal level. There is no doubt that Sergio was a very special, unique man, and no doubt he will be sorely missed. Manley thanks the analysts for their warm messages and comments since Marchionne\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s surgery last week, and then held a minute\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s silence. He then confirms that FCA has cut its guidance for this year, following a tougher time in China: Another top automobile boss, Mary Barra of General Motors, says Marchionne created a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153remarkable legacy\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Fiat Chrysler\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s results show the challenging facing Sergio Marchionne\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s successor, Mike Manley. FCA, whose brands include Jeep, Ram, Alfa Romeo, Dodge and Maserati, is aiming to double its profits over the next four years - and also make a bigger splash in the electric car sector. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s downgraded forecasts mean that will be a little bit harder. Manley, who took over last weekend after Marchionne\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s surgery, will present the results to analysts shortly. Newsflash: Fiat Chrysler shares have just tumbled, after the carmaker released its latest financial results to the markets. The company has reported that earnings shrank by 35% in the second quarter of 2018 (which turned out to be Sergio Marchionne\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s final period in charge). Net profits fell to \u00e2\u201a\u00ac754m, down from \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.155bn a year earlier. The company says that sales in China fell, partly due to increased competition from domestic brands. Fiat-Chrysler has also cut its forecasts for 2018. It now expects net revenues of between \u00e2\u201a\u00ac115bn and \u00e2\u201a\u00ac118bn, down from \u00e2\u201a\u00ac125bn previously. It has also slashed its profit forecasts, predicting adjusted EBIT of between \u00e2\u201a\u00ac7.5bn and \u00e2\u201a\u00ac8.0bn, down from \u00e2\u201a\u00ac8.7bn. This has alarmed investors; Fiat Chrysler shares have slumped by 10%: (The company was scheduled to release its results today, so this isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t related to Sergio Marchionne\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sad death). ActivTrades analyst Carlo Alberto De Casa says Marchionne turned an \u00e2\u20ac\u0153almost bankrupt Fiat\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd into an international powerhouse. His heritage could be described in just a few numbers: in 2004 when Marchionne took over, Fiat\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s revenue was close to \u00e2\u201a\u00ac47bn, today it exceeds \u00e2\u201a\u00ac140bn. The company profit almost trebled in the same period. Loved or hated Marchionne is the man who made FCA as we know it today: more successful and a little less Italian. It is still difficult to imagine FCA and Ferrari without the man and his unique style. He wore a sweater rather than the traditional suite and a tie as his everyday business attire and with is unconventional leadership style he managed to turnaround one of Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and often most troubled - industrial realities. The FT\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Henry Foy points out just how much value Sergio Marchionne created at Fiat Chrysler: Back in January, Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas made the same point to Marchionne on a conference call: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We hadn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t seen anything like you. You took $2 billion, roughly, and you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve turned it into around $72 billion, and more important than that, there are many hundreds of thousands of families across many nations that are better off because of you and your team and you beat the sceptics every step of the way. So, I just had to say god bless you, Sergio. Chrysler workers should be grateful that Marchionne took the risk of helping the stricken auto company out of bankruptcy protection in 2009, says Autotrader.com analyst Michelle Krebs: It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s highly unlikely that Chrysler would exist today had he not taken that gamble. The company was in such bad shape, being stripped of any kind of resources by the previous owners.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Anand Mahindra, chairman of Mahindra Group (the Indian conglomerate), has tweeted his admiration for Sergio Marchionne: There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a lot of affection for Sergio Marchionne on social media, including from fans of Ferrari (which he chaired until last weekend). Associated Press have dubbed Sergio Marchionne a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153charismatic and demanding leader\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. The manager, known for his folksy, colourful turns of phrase and for his dark cashmere sweaters no matter the occasion, was the darling of the automotive analyst community. Even when expressing doubts at his audacious targets, they expressed admiration for his adept deal-making. That included getting GM to pay $2 billion to sever ties with Fiat, key to relaunching the long-struggling Italian carmaker, and the deal with the U.S. government to take Chrysler without a penny down in exchange for Fiat\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s small-car technology. Marchionne joined Fiat after being tapped by the Agnelli family to save the company. Fiat had for generations been a family-run enterprise, and having someone at the helm from outside Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s clubby management circles even a dynamo like Marchionne was an enormous change. Other key corporate moves included the spinoff of the heavy industrial vehicle and truck maker CNH and of the Ferrari supercar maker. Both deals unlocked considerable shareholder value for Agnelli family heirs led by John Elkann. Elkann came into his own under Marchionne\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stewardship, taking over as chairman in 2010 having been tapped more than a decade earlier by his grandfather, the late Gianni Agnelli, to run the family business. Fiat Chrysler\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chairman, John Elkann, has told staff to build on Sergio Marchionne\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s legacy, saying: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The best way to honour his memory is to build on the legacy he left us, continuing to develop the human values of responsibility and openness of which he was the most ardent champion.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Marchionne was one of the boldest business leaders of his generation, says the Financial Times. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a flavour of the FT\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s obituary, just published: The 66-year-old, who died from complications following surgery, was a consummate dealmaker, known for his nonstop work habit and razor sharp mind. A poker player, his entourage told of sleepless transatlantic flights where their chain-smoking boss always wanted to play \u00e2\u20ac\u201d and win \u00e2\u20ac\u201d another hand of cards. The same passion defined his improbable rescue of Fiat via an audacious merger with Chrysler that saved both companies and created the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s seventh largest car group. He persuaded General Motors to pay $2bn to escape its alliance with a near bankrupt Fiat in 2005 before swooping on a distressed Chrysler in 2009 and executing a full takeover of the group in 2014. The FT also points out that Marchionne enraged Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s unions by slashing costs, and jobs, as he pushed to return Fiat to profitability: He was demonised by Beppe Grillo, founder of the anti-establishment Five Star Movement for his closure of plants and job cuts. At one political rally in Milan, Grillo led the crowd in a chant: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153F**k you, Marchionne\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. In private, Marchionne was acutely aware of the ravages that globalisation had on those left behind. Sergio Marchionne deserves great credit for his work rescuing Fiat since becoming its CEO 14 years ago, says Bloomberg: Marchionne was handed an automaker that lost more than \u00e2\u201a\u00ac6bn ($7bn) in 2003. By 2005, he had returned the company to a profit by wringing some $2 billion from an alliance with General Motors Co., laying off thousands of workers, introducing new models, and slashing the time it took to get a new car to market to just 18 months, from four years. In 2009, U.S. President Barack Obama\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s administration announced that Fiat would take control of Chrysler LLC, rescuing the American company from bankruptcy. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t care what a tough guy he was to work for, he saved our company,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Cass Burch, a Chrysler and Jeep dealer in Georgia. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153He deserves a bronze statue.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Newsflash: Sergio Marchionne, one of the titans of the global car industry, has died. This very sad news comes just four days after Marchionne, aged 66, suddenly resigned from Fiat Chrysler, the company he had run for 14 years, last weekend. He reportedly suffered an embolism while undergoing shoulder surgery. FCA Chairman John Elkann said in a statement: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Unfortunately, what we feared has come to pass. Sergio Marchionne, man and friend, is gone. During a highly successful career, Marchionne turned Fiat around - including a merger with America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Chrysler following the financial crisis. He was known as a passionate workaholic who turned two struggling carmakers into the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s seventh largest automaker, through relentless negotiating and cost-cutting. As Bernstein analyst Max Warburton put it earlier this year. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Sergio Marchionne\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time as CEO of Fiat is already the stuff of legend.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Evercore analyst George Galliers agreed that Marchionne was a real talent, saying: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Marchionne is good at execution, strategy and gamesmanship.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock market has slipped into the red this morning, as investors await the Trump-Juncker meeting in Washington DC. The blue-chip FTSE 100 has dropped by over 40 points, or 0.55%, wiping out much of yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rally. Mining stocks are among the top fallers, reflecting worries that global growth (and demand for commodities) will suffer from a trade war. Trade concerns are still prevalent in the markets, says Mike van Dulken of Accendo Markets, adding: In focus today will be the Trump/Juncker US-EU meeting in Washington, an attempt to resolve the recent trade confrontation. Trump is looking for concessions on EU exports to the US (especially cars). Juncker wants a full suspension of US tariffs before any deal can be agreed. Trade commissioner Cecilia Malmstrom has tweeted that she had \u00e2\u20ac\u0153good discussions\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd with various US politicians. She met with Republican house senator Paul Ryan, and Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi, yesterday to press Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s case, ahead of today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s crunch meeting with the president. Former officials expect today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s White House meeting between Trump and Juncker to be tense, says Politico. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The negotiating view of Donald Trump is unconditional surrender of the other side,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Ivo Daalder, who served as the U.S. ambassador to NATO during the Obama administration. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153If you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re a betting person, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not going to be a great meeting.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Paul Donovan of investment bank UBS has a game to play at home: try completing the phrase \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Tariffs are the greatest... He explains: Yesterday US President Trump tweeted \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Tariffs are the greatest\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. The president may have been muddled, forgetting to finish the sentence. If implemented, tariffs are the greatest tax increase US consumers face this year. Tariffs are the greatest risk to US employment growth. Tariffs are the greatest threat to US and global economic growth. Trade war fears are already hurting German companies, according to a new survey just released. The IFO think tank reports that optimism among bosses fell this month, pulling down its \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcexpectations index\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 to 98.2 this month, from 98.6 in June. That suggests Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade policies are damaging Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest economy. Ifo chief Clemens Fuest said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Companies were slightly more satisfied with their current business situation, but scaled back their business expectations slightly. The German economy continues to expand, but at a slower pace.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Expectations of car exports have fallen \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcsignificantly\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, IFO adds. This pulled IFO\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s business climate index down to 101.7, from 101.8. However its current economic assessment rose to 105.3, from June\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 105.1. German broadcaster ZDF reckons there are three ways the Trump-Juncker talks can play out. Scenario 1: The EU proposes renegotiating all tariffs with the EU, alongside reform of the World Trade Organisation. In return, president Trump would drop his threat to tax EU cars. That would lead to lengthy negotiations, and isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t the radical solution Trump would favour. Scenario 2: Juncker proposes a new plurilateral deal just on car sales, which would lower or even abolish all auto tariffs. However it would probably have to include other countries, such as Korea and Japan - complicating the chances of a quick deal. Scenario 3: No deal is reached, so Trump presses on with tariffs on EU car sales, and the EU retaliates. That would take the global economy closer to a full-blown trade war. We shouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t expect a big breakthrough on trade today, says Simon French of City firm Panmure Gordon. He writes: Today represents an important test case for the breadth and sustainability of trade frictions as European Commissioner Jean-Claude Juncker meets with US president Trump. We do not expect a positive read-out and retain our base case that trade frictions will continue to expand all the way to the US mid-term elections in November. Newsflash: Europe is preparing to impose tariffs on $20bn of US imports, EU trade commissioner Cecilia Malmstrom has revealed. These tariffs would be brought in if Donald Trump follows through on his threat to hit European car imports with new tariffs, says Malmstrom, as she raises the heat ahead of today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meeting. Malmstrom told Swedish daily Dagens Nyheteron (via Reuters). \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We hope that it doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t come to that and that we can a solution. If not, the EU Commission is preparing a rather long list of many of American goods. It would be around $20 billion.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not a very diplomatic approach to today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s White House meeting. But perhaps it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a good way of getting Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s attention... Maybe Malmstrom has been reading Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Art Of The Deal, which recommended taking a tough attitude in negotiations: The worst thing you can possibly do in a deal is seem desperate to make it. That makes the other guy smell blood, and then you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re dead.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Shawn Donnan, the FT\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s world trade editor, isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t convinced by Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s suggestion of abolishing all US-EU tariffs. He points out that some American farmers might be unhappy about a surge of imports from overseas, especially as China is now imposing new tariffs on US goods. Dutch MEP Marietje Schaake agrees that the idea is a stretch... Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. They may need to lay out sponges and towels at the White House today, as Donald Trump hosts European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker for trade talks. It could be a bruising meeting. Juncker and trade commissioner Cecilia Malmstr\u00c3\u00b6m hope to dial down the rising tensions in the global economy, and ward off the threat of a full-blown trade war. The talks will centre on the car industry, with Trump threatening to impose tariffs on $50bn of EU car imports. That would hurt the German auto industry hard, and prompt retaliatory action from Brussels. Juncker could propose some concessions; there is talk that a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153plurilateral car deal\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd could lower tariffs could address Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s concerns. However, that would be politically tricky, for both sides -- America currently has a 25% levy on European trucks coming into the country, to protect jobs in its rust belt. Juncker has said his goal is to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153explain and find out how to prevent a trade war\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. But the signs aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t great. Earlier this week, Trump tweeted that tariffs are \u00e2\u20ac\u0153great\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, and claimed America is being treated as a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153piggy bank\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd by countries who run a trade surplus with it. Overnight, the president has called for both sides to completely abolish tariffs, subsidies and other trade barriers. That would certainly shake globe trade up - but is hardly something that Juncker can sign off during a quick chat in the Oval Office. The stakes are high, though. Trump has already angered Europe by imposing tariffs on steel and aluminium, which led to Europe putting 25% tariffs on bourbon whiskey, peanut butter, motorcycles and blue jeans. A rocky meeting could shake the financial markets, warns Lukman Otunuga, Research Analyst at FXTM: With escalating trade tensions between the European Union and the United States still a key theme that continues to weigh on global sentiment, the outcome of today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meeting could leave a lasting impact on the markets. If the talks prove unsuccessful and trade tensions end up escalating further, risk sentiment is likely to be negatively impacted. Market players should be prepared to expect the unexpected from the talks, especially when considering how highly unpredictable the Trump administration can be.

The market seems to be questioning the quality of growth seen in the past as Facebook spends more to address many of the concerns surrounding abuses on its platform and makes changes on the back of the GDPR regulations in Europe.

First, even with the lowered guidance, revenue is still most likely to grow in the mid to high 30% range going forward. The guide higher in expenses (and lower in margins) reflects an increase in predominantly fixed costs that will scale nicely as revenue continues to grow, so margins\u00e2\u20ac\u201deven though they will be lower over the next several years as these expenses ramp\u00e2\u20ac\u201dshould not be permanently impaired.

                "bodyText":"Amazon\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sparkling-looking results also includes a flurry of new achievements and milestones, from new Fire smart TVs and tablets to a French Alexa, Amazon Prime\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 22 Emmy nominations and some new cloud computing kit. But analysts really care about the guidance -- which shows that Amazon expects sales and profits to keep surging. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the details: Net sales are expected to be between $54.0 billion and $57.5 billion, or to grow between 23% and 31% compared with third quarter 2017. This guidance anticipates an unfavorable impact of approximately 30 basis points from foreign exchange rates. Operating income is expected to be between $1.4 billion and $2.4 billion, compared with $347 million in third quarter 2017. The results are online here. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s another big earnings night. Amazon has just posted a record quarter, with revenues up 39% to $52.9bn. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a huge sales performance, but actually $500m less than expected. But earnings per share have beaten forecasts. Shares have jumped in after hours trading. Boom! It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s official, Facebook has suffered the biggest loss of stock market value in a single day, ever. Shares in the social media giant just closed down almost 19%. That leaves them at $176.26, down $41.24 in a single painful session. That wipes more than $119bn off the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s value, I think, and roughly $15bn off Mark Zuckerberg\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stake. It means Facebook has (reluctantly) taken the crown of the biggest one-day fall away from Intel. The news that Facebook missed Wall Street\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s revenue and user growth targets last night, and slashed its forecasts, has clearly given traders a jolt. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no relief for Facebook shares, which are now down 19.5% - wiping around $120bn off the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s value. Still, for every seller there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a buyer. So some investors think this is a good opportunity to snaffle a stake in Facebook. Jeff Henriksen, Founder and Managing Partner, Thorpe Abbotts Capital, explains why: First, the bad news. The market seems to be questioning the quality of growth seen in the past as Facebook spends more to address many of the concerns surrounding abuses on its platform and makes changes on the back of the GDPR regulations in Europe. This has had a negative effect on both costs and revenue growth and caused the market to question Facebook\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s long-term prospects and the quality of its past performance. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153That said, I think the market is missing the larger picture here. First, even with the lowered guidance, revenue is still most likely to grow in the mid to high 30% range going forward. The guide higher in expenses (and lower in margins) reflects an increase in predominantly fixed costs that will scale nicely as revenue continues to grow, so margins\u00e2\u20ac\u201deven though they will be lower over the next several years as these expenses ramp\u00e2\u20ac\u201dshould not be permanently impaired. Ultimately these expenses will improve earnings quality and the sustainability of the business model. We believe that it is more likely than not that Facebook\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s earnings will double over the next 5 years and provide a very satisfactory return for long term investors.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Facebook is still on track to set an unwanted record tonight: After a very bruising morning, Facebook shares are still down over 18% in New York. This has pulled the Nasdaq index into the red too; it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s down around 1%, having hit record highs earlier this week. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s still a case for investing in Facebook, despite its setbacks and the challenges ahead. Ben Barringer, equity research analyst at Quilter Cheviot, explains: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Facebook is making the changes to ensure that its place as the leading social media network is maintained following considerable scrutiny in the press and on Capitol Hill. Facebook\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s user base remains large with over 2bn monthly active users and over 1.4bn daily active users. Ahead of the mid-term elections it is vital that it takes action on fake news, any political advertising on Facebook and of course data security. This involves considerable investment in staff and artificial intelligence and these costs will grow faster than revenue for the next 2 to 3 years. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153However for advertisers, the size and targeting offered by Facebook and increasingly Instagram, is highly attractive and this will continue to drive the growth of revenues and profits.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg has suffered a staggering hit today. The value of Zuckerberg\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stake in Facebook has fallen by around $15bn today, or \u00c2\u00a311bn. That still leaves him with a personal fortune of around $72bn, due to his stake in the social media firm. This chart from Bloomberg shows how Facebook is facing the biggest loss of market value in cash terms ever: That $151bn loss is based on Facebook\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shares dropping 24% (their worst point overnight). Currently they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re still down 18%, which is a loss of around $113bn - so still the biggest rout in history (although that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not adjusted for inflation). Wall Street analysts are worried that Facebook suffered a slowdown in user growth last quarter. The number of North American daily active users on the site remained flat, while the European user base actually shrank -- following the Cambridge Analytics scandal, and new data protection rules. Bloomberg point out that several Facebook executives have been selling shares in recent months. A canny move, given today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rout.... As you can see, Facebook missed several forecasts last night (although earnings per share were better than estimated) Facebook shareholders are suffering a historic loss of value today: Colin J Sebastian, analyst at Baird, says Facebook\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s share price has been struck by two self-inflicted blows. Facebook dropped two \u00e2\u20ac\u0153bombshells\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd on the Q2 earnings call, a significant slowdown in revenue growth for Q3/Q4, followed by operating margin declines over the next 3+ years. Importantly, these are \u00e2\u20ac\u0153self-inflicted\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd issues to a large degree, as Facebook sacrifices core app monetization to drive usage/engagement of Stories. Lower margins will result from continuing large-scale investments in computing infrastructure and headcount, but without meaningful related revenue streams. While shares are moving to the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153penalty box,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd we believe after-hours trading already embeds model changes. Maintain Outperform rating. At one stage, Facebook\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shares were down a hefty 20% - wiping around $125bn off its value. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s basically the value of fast food chain McDonalds . Facebook\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u0153nightmare\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd guidance of lower revenue growth and higher costs is causing the rout, says GBH Insights head of technology research Daniel Ives said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153If you look at their forecast for the second half of the year in terms of user growth, and the expense profile, it refuels the fundamental worries about Facebook post-Cambridge Analytica.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Facebook is tumbling in early trading on Wall Street, after the social network giant revealed the true cost of its data scandal last night. Shares in Facebook have plunged by 18% - an astonishing fall for a company of this size. They have fallen to $178.40 each, down from $217.50 before the company released its results last night. Bloomberg reckons this is Facebook\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s record one-day fall (unless shares recover during today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s session). Investors are unfriending the company after it missed revenue and user numbers in the last three months. But the real concern is that Facebook expects to be less profitable in the coming years, as it strives to clean up its network following the Cambridge Analytica revelations. David Wehner, Facebook\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chief financial officer, spooked investors yesterday by predicting that the revenue slowdown will continue for some time. Facebook basically admitted that the cost of improving security, and driving out fake news, will make a big dent in profitability. Crucially, Wehner warned that Facebook\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s operating margins will stop from their current rate of 44% (very tasty!) by around 10 percentage points. These quotes did the damage: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Our total revenue-growth rates will continue to decelerate in the second half of 2018, and we expect our revenue-growth rates to decline by high-single-digit percentages from prior quarters sequentially in both Q3 and Q4.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Looking beyond 2018, we anticipate that total expense growth will exceed revenue growth in 2019,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Over the next several years, we would anticipate that our operating margins will trend towards the mid-thirties on a percentage basis.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Reaction to follow! Facebook shares have been hammered in pre-market trading....as traders prepare for the open of Wall Street.... Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at IG Group, argues that investors shouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t totally lose faith in Facebook, despite yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s disappointment. He writes: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Perhaps the data scandal is at last beginning to bite in Facebook\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s earnings. Certainly, the frequent references to the other platforms available such as Instagram and the new revenue metric of how many people use at least one of the FB apps each month send a message that this is a company looking to find ways of becoming more than just a social media platform. High expectations can be a remarkable burden, and the reaction is often brutal when they are missed, but the revenue miss was slight, and $13.2 billion is not to be sniffed at. Facebook might have its wings clipped, but it is still a remarkable money-making machine. Fortune\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s David Meyer has a pithy explanation for how Facebook\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s latest results disappointed Wall Street last night: The company announced revenues and daily active user numbers that fell short of analyst estimates ($13.04 billion vs. $13.32 billion for the quarter, and 1.47 billion rather than 1.48 billion) and, more worryingly for investors, it warned that its increasing privacy efforts would hit its growth rate further in the second half of this year. Indeed, user numbers in North America are flat and those in Europe have actually fallen. So the expectation that Facebook was just going to shrug off Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hard-hitting new General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), as well as the privacy scandals that have plagued it through much of the year so far, was way off the mark. These things are making a difference, and they will continue to do so. More here: Facebook\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock market woes could go down in stock market history, says CNBC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Michael Santoli. Newsflash: The European Central Bank has left eurozone interest rates unchanged, at its meeting today. That means the headline borrowing rate remains at zero, an all-time low. Banks still face a negative interest rate (-0.4%) for leaving cash at the ECB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s vaults rather than lending it. The ECB says it expects to leave interest rates on hold until the summer of 2019. It also affirmed that it intends to halt its asset-purchase stimulus scheme at the end of 2018 (a decision it took at its previous meeting). So no surprises here. President Mario Draghi will face the press in 45 minutes. He can expect questions about when summer starts and ends exactly (a tricky call if we get another heat wave next year). Market analyst David Jones points out that Facebook\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shares hit record highs yesterday, before the company gave Wall Street a nasty shock after trading ended. Facebook shares remain on track for a massive slide when trading begins in New York, in less than two hours time. The stock is down around 20% in pre-market trading, after it missed Wall Street expectations last night and warned that profit margins will be thinner than expected in the years ahead. This would eliminate all Facebook\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s gains this year: Such a staggering selloff would wipe around $125bn off Facebook\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s value, and drag founder Mark Zuckerberg down the list of the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s top billionaires. The French government has weighed in, seeking \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcclarification\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 on the agreement reached between Juncker and Trump yesterday. Finance minister Bruno Le Maire sounds concerned that France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s farmers could suffer, declaring firmly that agriculture should \u00e2\u20ac\u0153be kept outside the scope of the discussions\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd on lowering trade barriers. Le Maire says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We have high sanitary, food and environmental standards as well as rules of production to which we are attached and that guarantee the protection and safety of our consumers. Europe will not compromise on these norms.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Writing in the New Statesman, Stephen Bush argues that Jean-Claude Juncker outplayed Donald Trump yesterday: In reality, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a remarkable coup for Juncker. The EU is already seeking to buy more gas as part of the Commission\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s long-term efforts to wean the continent off Russian energy. The EU already has zero tariffs on soy in place, and American soybeans are currently at a low price thanks to Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade war with China making them attractive to European farmers anyway. But.... that might also threaten the agreement\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s viability. The president might rip it up, if he decides he got the rough end of the deal. One reason why Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s White House is so erratic is that the president\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s mind changes depending on which advisor is currently in favour: those wanting to avoid a trade war are currently on the up, but that could change. And that Juncker has conceded very little that the EU hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t already conceded in practice may mean that Trump decides he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been had and that the whole mess is re-opened in the not too distant future. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Department for International Trade is hoping that America will soon lift its tariffs on EU steel and aluminium. In a statement, it says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We welcome the agreement by the U.S. and the EU to work together to reduce barriers to trade and to further increase trade and investment,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We look forward to progress towards the removal of steel and aluminium tariffs and de-escalation of the tit-for-tat action that could harm businesses and jobs on both sides of the Atlantic.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Overnight, China has escalated its trade dispute with America by thwarting a $44bn takeover deal. Beijing regulators sunk chipmaker Qualcomm\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s attempted takeover of Dutch rival NXP, by declining to approve the deal. Without a green light from China, the deal expired as the clocks struck midday in Beijing (midnight in New York) - even though eight other regulators around the globe had signed it off. This makes Qualcomm the biggest casualty yet of the Trump trade wars. It launched its takeover of NXP in October 2016, so the collapse of the deal is a serious blow. Qualcomm CEO Steve Mollenkopf admitted last night that the tensions between America and China were scuppering the deal, telling Bloomberg: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t see anything in the near-term that would make it worthwhile to change the timing. There were probably bigger forces at play here than just us.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a reminder to the White House that China can make things difficult for US companies if president Trump continues to impose tariffs on their imports. The Frankfurt stock market is leading the charge this morning, as trade war relief ripples through the trading floors. The German DAX has jumped by 1.4% this morning, or 172 points, to 12,751 . Automakers are continuing to rally, thanks to Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pledge not to impose tariffs on car imports (in the near future, anyway). The Paris market is also upbeat, pushing France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s CAC index up by 0.7%. Traders are pleased that the Juncker-Trump talk went rather better than expected, says Connor Campbell of SpreadEx: While there isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t exactly much substance to what was announced, with the fact the relationship didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t worsen being more notable than the plans to negotiate, it was enough to lift the spirits of the previously fearful markets. Alan Beattie of the Financial Times makes some good points about the EU-US trade announcement in this thread: Paul Donovan of UBS isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t convinced by Juncker\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pledge to buy more American soybeans.... US President Trump tweeted that EU officials were going to buy more US soybeans. EU officials cannot do that. The US is already the largest exporter of soybeans to the EU. There are no subsidies, trade taxes or quotas on soybeans in the EU. Private farmers decide whether to buy more soybeans or not. Not everyone is cheering the news that America and Europe will co-operate on trade. Others noted that while the announcement marks a change in tone, it won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t necessarily stop Trump from moving forward with auto tariffs later this year if he changes his mind. Phil Levy, a senior fellow at the Chicago Council on Global Affairs, has pointed out that Donald Trump reached similar agreements with China in 2017 - only to hit them with tariffs months later. Levy explained (via Politico) that the agreement is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153better than nothing\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, but.... \u00e2\u20ac\u0153it doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t seem to solve any of the problems the president flagged \u00e2\u20ac\u201c trade deficits, tariffs, subsidies.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It looks a lot like deals struck with China last year, which of course were a prelude to a full-blown trade war. Shares in European car makers are jumping sharply, as the threat of punitive tariffs fades away. Porsche, BMW, Fiat Chrysler and Volkswagen have all surged by at least 4% in early trading. Investors are relieved that Donald Trump has agreed not to slap any more tariffs on European imports - at least while officials try to hammer out closer trade ties. Before yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meeting, manufacturers was bracing for America to impose 20% tariffs on European car imports, which would have made them much less competitive in the US. Naeem Aslam of Think Markets says the US and EU presidents managed to stave off a transatlantic trade war yesterday. Traders do have every right to celebrate Juncker and Trump meeting because the tensions were high before the meeting as it was pretty much clear that we are heading towards a real trade war. But thanks to common sense which prevailed last night, and it eased tensions stoked by threats coming from both side. Under the agreement, both sides would hold off on other tariffs as the negotiation process continues. The joint statement by leaders did look like a fairy tale, both sides agreed to work towards zero tariffs. For Trump it does not matter what the final deal would like, but for now, it is enough for him to show the world that he delivered on his promise and he brought the Europeans to a point where he thinks that things are fair. European officials were pleasantly surprised by Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s attitude last night, reports the Financial Times: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I think it was another Trump we saw in there,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said one senior EU official. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153He was different from the tweets and the noise, different from all that brouhaha. He was focused and engaged and clearly looking for something to help with the markets.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Another person familiar with the discussions said Mr Trump was eager to find a solution to what had become a growing problem for both sides. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Anyone who knows Donald Trump knows that he wants to make deals,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said the person. European stock market have opened higher, as traders welcome the warming of relations between Washington and Brussels over trade. The Trump-Juncker agreement isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t really a deal, but it could turn into a game changer. So says Holger Schmieding of Berenberg Bank, who is reassured that America won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t impose tariffs on EU car imports while negotiations continue. He writes that the two sides have taken \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a step away from the brink\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. The US-EU agreement to talk rather than to slug it out in a tit-for-tat escalation of trade barriers strengthens our base case: despite all the noise, the US will not levy new tariffs on car imports from the EU in the end. Instead, the trade tensions stoked by Trump will ease somewhat as the two sides either strike a deal fast (25%probability) or at least engage in serious negotiations (55% probability). If so, Eurozone business confidence can recover this autumn. This should allow the Eurozone to overcome its current soft patch with a return to annualised growth rates of around 2% from Q4 2018 onwards. According to Juncker, he and Trump agreed that the US and the EU should strive in their negotiations to: remove mutual tariffs on industrial goods, reform the World Trade Organization (WTO), and intensify trade in services. While the EU pledged to import more soybeans and liquefied natural gas from the US, the US will re-assess the tariffs it has already imposed on steel and aluminium imports from the EU. The EU would then lift its retaliatory measures. However, Trump isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t \u00e2\u20ac\u0153exactly known for consistency\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, so the upcoming negotiations could still founder, Schmieding adds. The IMF\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s managing director, Christine Lagarde, has welcomed Trump and Juncker\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s agreement: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I am pleased to learn that the United States and European Union reached agreement today to work jointly to reduce trade barriers and, together with other partners, strengthen the WTO. The global economy can only benefit when countries engage constructively to resolve trade and investment disagreements without resort to exceptional measures.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a sense of relief in the markets today, after America and the European Union stepped away from a trade war. Following talks at the White House, Donald Trump and Jean-Claude Juncker emerged to announce they had agreed to work together towards \u00e2\u20ac\u0153zero\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd tariffs, barriers and subsidies. Trump declared it was a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153very big\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd day, after Europe agreed to buy more soya beans and natural gas from America. The two sides have also agreed to work together to reform the international rules on trade. In truth, details are a bit scant -- as we covered in last night\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s liveblog, the two sides have mainly agreed to negotiate. But that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s an improvement on threats being fired across the Atlantic over social media. Importantly, the two sides have agreed not to impose any more tariffs while they keep talking. That removes the threat of new punitive levies on European car imports. The two men even shared one of Juncker\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s famous kisses in the Oval Office - a fitting way to seal the d\u00c3\u00a9tente. Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economic affairs minister, Peter Altmaier, has cheered the move, saying it will save jobs. Analysts are also optimistic, with Adam Cole of Royal Bank of Canada saying: This is more positive outcome than many had expected. Also coming up today Facebook\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shares will get slammed when Wall Street opened, after the social media giant missed forecasts last night. It also warned that profitability will be hit by the cost of cleaning up its platform and fighting election interference. Wall Street threw something of a wobbly last night, sending Facebook\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shares plunging in after-hours trading. The European Central Bank is meeting to set monetary policy. No fireworks are expected. The ECB has already agreed a plan to wind down its stimulus programme, and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s far from ready to raise interest rates. But still, president Mario Draghi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s press conference could be interesting. Plus, there are new US trade figures - they might show whether Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tariffs have had an impact. The agenda 12.45pm BST: ECB interest rate decision 1.30pm BST: ECB press conference with Mario Draghi 1.30pm BST: US trade balance figures",

At any other large consumer-facing company \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a retailer, a consumer goods firm or an old-fashioned media outfit \u00e2\u20ac\u201c investors would be asking if the first major shift in the financial weather heralds a storm to come.</p> <p>In Facebook\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s case, there are extra reasons for caution.

The initial reaction to the Cambridge Analytica scandal, revealed in the Observer, was slow and cackhanded.</p> <p>Yes, it is possible that, in a year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time, Wednesday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s statement will appear as a mere blip. Yet the shares are priced at 30 times earnings. One could call that low by whizzy technology yardsticks but, by normal standards, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s an optimistic rating for a company where so many medium and long-term uncertainties have arrived at once. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sounds odd to say, but $110bn off the market cap looks about right.</p> <h2>Intu boss departs after Hammerson deal falls through</h2> <p>Chief executive David Fischel is heading outta Intu and you can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t blame him. His <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/apr/18/hammerson-abandons-planned-34bn-buyout-of-rival-intu\">big \u00c2\u00a33.4bn deal to sell the shopping centre group</a> \u00e2\u20ac\u201c owner of the Trafford Centre, Lakeside and Metrocentre \u00e2\u20ac\u201c fell apart when would-be buyer Hammerson\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shareholders said no. Someone else can have the job of living up to the brave boast that Intu is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153strongly placed to prosper as a standalone business\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd.</p> <p>That assessment is not shared by the stock market, where Intu\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shares fell 8% on Thursday as the group said its properties are worth \u00c2\u00a3650m, or 6%, less than six months ago. Intu\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shares now trade at roughly half net asset value, expressing the fear that there is more pain in store for owners of shopping centres in the era of internet shopping.</p> <p>Intu\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s writedown should heap more embarrassment on Hammerson\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chairman, David Tyler, and chief executive, David Atkins. Six months ago they were willing to pay 254p for Intu versus the new all-time low for the share price of 165p. The gulf is enormous, and rather proves the revolting shareholders\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 point that doubling-down on UK shopping centres would have been a bad mistake. Atkins this week tried to repair the damage with a strategic revamp. Good try, but the post-Intu credibility deficit in Hammerson\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s boardroom remains.</p> <h2>Coaches are the better route for National Express</h2> <p>Dean Finch, the chief executive of National Express, says his board should take him outside and shoot him if he ever proposes getting back into UK rail franchising.</p> <p>You can see his point. National Express was big in UK rail until it got thrown off the east coast mainline in 2009 under old management, at which point the share price fell below 100p. Finch completed the exit, selling the last franchises when he judged that bidding was getting too hot and political hassles too great. Subsequent expansion has concentrated on school buses in north America and buses and coaches in Spain, which is proving easier territory. After record half-year profits, the share price is now 421p.</p> <p>That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s good news for National Express investors, but Chris Grayling may not agree. Somehow the transport secretary has to entice capital into the poorly defined world of public-private rail partnerships and the hell of <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/jul/18/government-urged-strip-govia-thameslink-railway-franchise-timetable-chaos\">timetable revisions</a>.

Yes, it is possible that, in a year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time, Wednesday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s statement will appear as a mere blip. Yet the shares are priced at 30 times earnings. One could call that low by whizzy technology yardsticks but, by normal standards, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s an optimistic rating for a company where so many medium and long-term uncertainties have arrived at once. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sounds odd to say, but $110bn off the market cap looks about right. Intu boss departs after Hammerson deal falls through Chief executive David Fischel is heading outta Intu and you can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t blame him. His big \u00c2\u00a33.4bn deal to sell the shopping centre group \u00e2\u20ac\u201c owner of the Trafford Centre, Lakeside and Metrocentre \u00e2\u20ac\u201c fell apart when would-be buyer Hammerson\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shareholders said no. Someone else can have the job of living up to the brave boast that Intu is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153strongly placed to prosper as a standalone business\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. That assessment is not shared by the stock market, where Intu\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shares fell 8% on Thursday as the group said its properties are worth \u00c2\u00a3650m, or 6%, less than six months ago. Intu\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shares now trade at roughly half net asset value, expressing the fear that there is more pain in store for owners of shopping centres in the era of internet shopping. Intu\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s writedown should heap more embarrassment on Hammerson\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chairman, David Tyler, and chief executive, David Atkins. Six months ago they were willing to pay 254p for Intu versus the new all-time low for the share price of 165p. The gulf is enormous, and rather proves the revolting shareholders\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 point that doubling-down on UK shopping centres would have been a bad mistake. Atkins this week tried to repair the damage with a strategic revamp. Good try, but the post-Intu credibility deficit in Hammerson\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s boardroom remains. Coaches are the better route for National Express Dean Finch, the chief executive of National Express, says his board should take him outside and shoot him if he ever proposes getting back into UK rail franchising. You can see his point. National Express was big in UK rail until it got thrown off the east coast mainline in 2009 under old management, at which point the share price fell below 100p. Finch completed the exit, selling the last franchises when he judged that bidding was getting too hot and political hassles too great. Subsequent expansion has concentrated on school buses in north America and buses and coaches in Spain, which is proving easier territory. After record half-year profits, the share price is now 421p. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s good news for National Express investors, but Chris Grayling may not agree. Somehow the transport secretary has to entice capital into the poorly defined world of public-private rail partnerships and the hell of timetable revisions. More than a few investors may take the National Express approach and give it a miss.",

                "bodyText":"And finally, here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a clip of president Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s comments on the US economy: That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a good moment to wrap up. Have a good weekend. GW Snap verdict: president Trump is clearly taking today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s growth figure as vindication of his economic policies. That means we can expect more of the same from the White House on trade, tax and spending. Larry Kudlow, the president\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s top economic advisor, now speaks -- and he backs up Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s claim that the US economy will keep growing strongly. Kudlow insists: This is a boom that will be sustainable. Turning away from the economy, president Trump says that the remains of 55 Americans killed in the Korean war are returning to the US. He thanks Kim Jong-Un for sticking to his commitment. Onto trade...and president Trump criticises other countries for stealing US jobs and plundering its wealth. Our tariffs are bringing tariffs back to the US, he continues, saying that the burly steel workers he met in Illinois yesterday were in tears (of joy, presumably). Trump is insisting that his hard line on trade will bring jobs back to America (reminder: his administration is working on a $12bn bailout for US farmers hurt by the row with China) Giving his own trumpet a hearty toot, president Trump now says that his administration have achieved an \u00e2\u20ac\u0153economic turnaround of historic proportions\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. We are the envy of the entire world, he adds, saying that other world leaders are regularly congratulating him on the state of the US economy. President Trump is speaking on the economy now at the White House. He says today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s numbers are \u00e2\u20ac\u0153great\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, and that America is going to go a lot higher. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re on track for the fastest growth rate in 13 years, the president declares. The US economy is growing much faster than under the previous two administrations, Trump continues. If the current growth rate is maintained, the US economy will double in size 10 years faster than it would have done under presidents Bush or Obama, Trump claims. He also points out that the trade deficit has dropped by over $50bn. Trump insists that the current growth rate is sustainable, and not a single shot boost (some analysts disagree, though) We have the official thumbs up from the White House: Even if this pacey growth doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t last, it gives Donald Trump a boost going into the mid-term election this autumn. However, the feelgood factor could face if trade wars hurt the US economy in the coming months. Balraj Sroya, Sales Trader at Foenix Partners, explains: The words \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcMake America Great Again\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 can be heard echoing from across the Atlantic this afternoon as the US economy grew 4.1% in the second quarter of 2018, which is the most robust pace in nearly 4-years. Strong export figures, aided by soybean exports in addition to consumer spending, helped the surge in the GDP print. Over the next quarter GDP figures will be scrutinised, as the threat of upcoming tariffs on US exports could dampen the next print. However, it gives Republicans a firm footing ahead of the Midterm elections, as GDP sitting above 3% has been a core pledge for the Trump administration since the beginning of his campaign. Our US business editor, Dominic Rushe, writes: The growth will be a major boon for the Trump administration, which pushed through $1.5tn in tax cuts at the start of the year with a promise that they would be paid for by economic growth. Ahead of the announcement on Thursday, Donald Trump teased that good news could be coming. Breaking with a tradition of presidents refraining from commenting on market sensitive government releases ahead of their release, the president told a rally in Illinois: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Somebody actually predicted today 5.3 [percent growth]. I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s going to happen ... if it has a four in front of it, we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re happy.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd But economists warned the growth spurt may be unsustainable and the evidence so far is that the benefits of the mini-boom have disproportionately gone to the wealthiest Americans. The last time the economy expanded at a comparable pace was in 2014, when growth hit 5.2% in the third quarter. The economic boost was driven by rising consumer spending, exports and business investment over the quarter. More here: Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Rob Hodgson, Senior Wealth Manager at GWM Investment Management, on the US GDP figures: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Chief Economic Adviser told us it was going to be \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcbig\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fair to say that analysts were projecting some exciting figures. A 4.1% growth rate in Q2 is the strongest since the third quarter of 2014. Projections were ranging between 3 and 5 percent and business confidence remains upbeat so we were expecting a strong quarter of growth. We would suggest that 4.1% overstates the underlying pace of activity, but the tax cuts and impacts of deregulation are likely to keep economic growth accelerating from this point.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd As this chart shows, America has just posted its strongest quarter since Donald Trump became president. However, growth was still stronger in the middle of 2014, during Barack Obama\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s second term. Nancy Curtin, chief investment officer at Close Brothers Asset Management, says Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tax reforms have spurred US growth in recent months: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The US economy is showing the fastest growth since 2014. A strong labour market, benign inflation and strong corporate investment have contributed to this positive landscape for growth. The economy was already on the up before Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tax cuts added further fiscal fuel. The tax cuts are now filtering through to the real economy as companies have been empowered to increase investment spend, the lion share of which is going into technology and automation. Pablo Shah, economist at the CEBR think tank, says America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s growth rate was impressive in the last quarter: While much of the resurgence in US growth can be attributed to somewhat transitory factors, today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s figures remain impressive. A strong labour market coupled with accommodative fiscal and monetary policies are set to sustain solid growth throughout the remainder of the year. However, he also suspects growth will fade over time: The US economy is likely to come off the boil in the coming quarters, as the boost to growth delivered by the tax cuts begins to wear off, trade restrictions and an overall slowing of the global economy start to weigh on exports, and further interest rate hikes tighten financial conditions. The dollar has dipped slightly, despite America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s growth rate jumping. That suggests investors don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think this growth rate is sustainable. US consumers drove America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s US economic growth in the last three months. Consumer spending grew at an annual rate of 4% in the last quarter, up from just 0.5% in January-March. Business investment was 7.3% higher. Exports grew by 9.3%, while exports only expanded by 0.5% -- that will please the White House. NEWSFLASH: America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy grew at an annual rate of 4.1% in the last three months, as growth accelerated. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the fastest growth rate since 2014, and a very solid result (although not as high as some economists had hoped). It may show that Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tax cuts have given the economy a boost. US growth in January-March has also been revised up, to an annual rate of 2.2% from 2%. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a lot stronger than France, which grew at an annualised rate of 0.8% in the last quarter (or 0.2% quarter-on-quarter) More to follow! It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s nearly time to discover how fast America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy grew in the last quarter. Forecast range from an annualised growth rate of 2.6% all the way up to 4.8%, which would be very pacy. First Facebook\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shares tumble after missing Wall Street forecasts, then Twitter follows suit. So has the social media boom hit a roadblock, or are investors simply over-reacting? Arguably, Wall Street should welcome signs that these companies are getting serious about tackling abuse, fake accounts and disinformation, even if it hits the bottom line. Neil Wilson of Markets.com says there are two theories why shares are tumbling: One, expectations for revenue growth are being fundamentally reset in the social media space. Two, today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s reaction is maybe overdone as investors have been spooked by the horrid earnings call from Facebook. Everyone knew that Twitter was full of fake accounts \u00e2\u20ac\u201c why their removal should be impacting the share price in the way is unclear \u00e2\u20ac\u201c investors may be better advised to keep a check on earnings and revenue growth instead. Both Facebook and Twitter have been affected badly by fake news, fake accounts and accusations of Russian meddling. But arguably Twitter looks in better shape as the efforts to monetise the platform are working, whilst we see fundamental concerns about Facebook\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s advertising model.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Twitter says it is determined to tackle \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcproblem behaviour\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, even if it does hurt user numers. It tells shareholders: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We are making active decisions to prioritize health initiatives over near-term product improvements that may drive more usage of Twitter as a daily utility.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Some snap reaction to Twitter\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s results: NEWSFLASH: Twitter has just reported that its user numbers have fallen, as it got to grips with fake accounts. The social media/micro-blogging site says monthly users fell by one million in the last three months, to 353 million. Wall Street had expected a rise of one million. Twitter took steps to weed out abusive content providers, and so-called \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcbots\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, to (finally) address concerns from regulators, politicians and the public. But investors aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t impressed, even though twitter also posted earnings of around $100m or $0.17 per share, in line with forecasts. Shares have slumped by 18% in pre-market trading, matching Facebook\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tumble earlier this week. City traders, mortgage holders, savers and borrowers all need to be alert for a UK interest rate rise next week. The Bank of England sets monetary policy next Thursday, and a rate rise is possible - but not certain. There are arguments to hike, but also to sit tight a bit longer. As Nicholas Wall of Old Mutual Global Investors puts it: For a nation that has endured the trials and tribulations of Love Island over the summer, the original unreliable boyfriend returns next week. Will the Bank of England governor Mark Carney deliver the 0.25% rate hike that the market expects? Here are Wall\u00e2\u20ac\u2122sa rguments for a rate hike: Growth may not be that strong, but is reasonable considering the reduced growth potential post-crisis Strong retail sales and manufacturing data (PMIs) High job creation While here are three reasons not to: Brexit uncertainty, which is likely to intensify this autumn Trade war fears - as America threatens China with new tariffs Weak real wages, with earnings only slightly ahead of inflation France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s weak growth this year could mean Paris misses its deficit reduction targets, and push the national debt higher, says economist Emanuele Canegrati: That would be problematic for president Macron as he tries to push for eurozone reforms. Germany will be less receptive of more risk-sharing between euro members if the bloc\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s second-largest member is struggling. Global stock markets remain upbeat, as traders count down to 1.30pm BST...when we learn how America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy fared in the last quarter. Ken Odeluga of City Index says Wednesday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s peach deal between the US and EU on trade is helping, as are recent financial results. In Europe the stream of earnings is picking up, with a set of pleasing if not spectacular reports on Friday. The car sector remains in sharp focus as an epicentre of the trade conflict on this side of the Atlantic and after the apparent stay of execution due to EU-U.S. rapprochement. With Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE, Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s DAX, Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s MIB all just slightly higher and Paris\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s CAC slightly soft, the atmosphere is constructive for further potential strength though lacks catalysts. In the currency markets, the pound has dropped back below $1.31 against the dollar. Sterling weakened after Brussels\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 negotiator Michel Barnier gave Theresa May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcChequers Plan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 a punch in the solar plexus. Barnier rejected the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s idea of collecting tariffs and duties on goods entering Britain and heading into the European Union, saying that the EU must keep control of its money and borders (sound familiar?....) France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy has been a tale of two halves in the last year, as economist Shaun Richards points out. Christopher Dembik of Saxo Bank fears the French economy is facing a negative shock: Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our energy correspondent, Adam Vaughan, explaining why BP will be pleased to have acquired BHP\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Billiton\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s US shale assets... The deal gives BP a much bigger footprint in oil-rich onshore basins and was described by its chief executive, Bob Dudley, as a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153transformational acquisition\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd ...and why BHP will be delighted to have got rid of them: BHP first acquired shale assets in 2011 for more than $20bn with the takeover of Petrohawk Energy and shale gas interests from Chesapeake Energy Corp, but suffered as gas prices collapsed, forcing it to book massive writedowns. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It was the wrong environment to have bought the assets when they did but this is the right market to have sold them in,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Craig Evans, the co-portfolio manager of the Tribeca Global Natural Resources Fund, said. This chart, from INSEE, shows how France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s growth rate slowed in the last six months, after a solid 2017: The IT meltdown at Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s TSB bank has hurt its parent company, Sabadell, rather badly. Sabadell reported this morning that it tumbled into the red in the last quarter, losing \u00e2\u201a\u00ac138.7m in April-June. That period was a nightmare for TSB, and its customers, when an IT migration to a new platform went disastrously wrong, locking customers out of their accounts for days (and in some cases weeks). Sabadell has taken a one-off charge of \u00e2\u201a\u00ac203m for the outage, a bigger hit than expected, to cover compensation and lost business. TSB CEO Paul Pester was heavily criticised for his handling of the crisis. He has told reporters this morning that he plans to stay at the bank, and is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153100 percent focused\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd on putting things right. France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s weak growth figures haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t alarmed investors. European stocks have opened higher with the FTSE 100 gaining almost 0.3%. The French CAC is 0.2% higher too. In London, consumer goods group Reckitt Benckiser has surged by 9%. It raised its annual revenue growth target on Friday, following strong growth in its child nutrition business. Telecoms group BT is also leading the risers, up 3% after posting a 3% rise in adjusted profits. European stocks are benefiting from the drop in the euro on Thursday. It shed almost 1% to $1.164, after the European Central Bank sounded dovish about interest rate hike prospects. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Claus Vistesen of Pantheon Macroeconomic on the French GDP figures: Bloomberg says those French growth figures are a disappointment: The euro area\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s second largest economy had a rough start to the year, when it, along with much of Europe, saw output strangled by bad weather and snowstorms. While there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been a general loss of momentum across many economies this year, France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s slowdown was exacerbated when rail workers staged industrial action to protest President Emmanuel Macron\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s reform plans. The continued sluggishness in France is a handicap for the euro area amid a period of uncertainty marked by global trade tensions and the prospect of European Central Bank paring back its vast monetary stimulus. Important energy news: oil giant BP is buying US shale oil and gas assets from mining group BHP Billiton, in a $10.5bn deal. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a major deal for BP - its biggest in around two decades, giving it a much more powerful position in the US energy sector. CEO Bob Dudley says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This is a transformational acquisition for our Lower 48 business, a major step in delivering our upstream strategy and a world-class addition to BP\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s distinctive portfolio. Effectively BP is catching up the ground it lost after the Deepwater Horizon disaster, in which 11 workers died when their rig in the Gulf of Mexico caught fire. Shares in BHP Billiton have jumped over 2% at the start of trading in London -- analysts had only expected these assets to sell for $8-$10bn. BP are down 2%. Economist Philippe Waechter of Ostrum Asset Management says France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s GDP new figures are disappointing. It may mean Emmanuel Macron\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s government will fail to hit its growth targets this year. French factories had a lacklustre quarter, with goods production falling in the last three months. INSEE says: Production in goods and services barely accelerated in Q2 2018 (+0.2% after +0.1%). It fell back again in goods (\u00e2\u02c6\u20190.3% after \u00e2\u02c6\u20190.6%) while it continued to grow in services (+0.4% after +0.3%). Output in manufactured goods fell back again (\u00e2\u02c6\u20190.2% after \u00e2\u02c6\u20191.0%). Production in refinery stepped back (\u00e2\u02c6\u20199.9% after \u00e2\u02c6\u20191.6%) due to technical maintenance; production in electricity and gas dropped too (\u00e2\u02c6\u20191.7% after +1.9%). However, construction bounced back (+0.6% after \u00e2\u02c6\u20190.3%). A wave of strikes by French railway workers and Air France employees hurt growth in the last quarter, it seems. Stats body INSEE blames industrial action across the French transport system for a big drop in transport spending. It says: In services, the slow down was notably driven by the downturn in transport expenses (\u00e2\u02c6\u20193.2% after +1.0%), mainly in rail transport as a result of strikes. French rail workers walked out for 26 days between April and June, as part of protest against reforms to the SNCF rail company. This caused disruption to national services, and routes within Paris. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy has failed to accelerate. New growth figures show that the eurozone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s second-largest economy only grew by 0.2% in the second quarter of 2018. That only matches the slow performance seen in the first three months of 2018, and is weaker than the 0.3% which economists expected. The data highlights how Europe has lost momentum this year, after a rollicking 2017. INSEE, the statistics body, says household spending fell in the last quarter. Trade also held back growth, with imports growing faster than exports: Household consumption expenditures faltered slightly (\u00e2\u02c6\u20190.1% after +0.2%), whereas total gross fixed capital formation recovered sharply (GFCF: +0.7% after +0.1%). Overall, final domestic demand excluding inventory changes contributed as much to GDP growth as in Q1 (+0.2 points). Imports bounced back this quarter (+1.7% after \u00e2\u02c6\u20190.3%) as did exports to a lesser extent (+0.6% after \u00e2\u02c6\u20190.4%). All in all, foreign trade balance contributed negatively to GDP growth, \u00e2\u02c6\u20190.3 points, after a neutral contribution in Q1. Conversely, changes in inventories drove GDP on (+0.3 points after 0.0 points). More details to follow... Investors are also desperate to learn how well America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy performed in the last quarter. US GDP, due at 1.30pm UK time is likely to show impressive growth, as president Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tax cuts stimulate the economy. White House economic adviser Lawrence Kudlow told the markets to expecting a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153very good\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd number - that could mean an annual growth rate over 4%. Also coming up today Amazon has brought some calm to the markets last night by beating profit forecasts. The e-commerce giant racked up record revenues in the quarter, and made twice as large a profit as investors expected. On a conference call with investors, Brian Olsavsky, the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chief financial officer, cited growth in Amazon\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u0153most profitable areas\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, particularly the cloud-computing division, Amazon Web Services (AWS). Olsavsky also pointed to the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s advertising products as contributing to gross profit while \u00e2\u20ac\u0153growing at a rapid clip\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd That made up for Facebook\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shocking performance a day earlier, which prompted the biggest one-day loss in Wall Street history.

Measured by the harmonized European consumer price index, headline inflation remained unchanged at 2.1%, suggesting that headline inflation in the entire Eurozone (to be released tomorrow) could have hit the 2%-mark for the fourth time in the last five years.<br></p> <p>Returning to Germany, headline inflation at around 2% YoY, however, is still less the result of the ECB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ultra-loose monetary policy but rather the result of higher energy prices. In fact, where available, regional core inflation measures remained broadly unchanged and only slightly above 1%, indicating that underlying inflationary pressures in the German economy remain low. Judging from the available components, German inflation data still tells a two-sided story: while prices for consumer goods have gradually accelerated in recent months, inflation on services has slowed down and has even been negative for a couple of months for communication. Also, whether it was the World Cup effect or just the ordinary sales season is hard to tell, but prices for clothing and shoes were the biggest drag on headline inflation.</p> <p>Looking ahead, there are still little signs supporting the ECB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s general optimism that underlying inflation in the entire Eurozone is picking up. Despite a very long economic cycle, low unemployment and rising wages, the German economy shows little sign of overheating, not even a significant pick-up in underlying inflation. Instead, headline inflation is mainly dominated by external and one-off factors. In this regard, the current heatwave could push up food prices and hence headline inflation in the coming months. But with little upside pressure on underlying inflation, chances that headline inflation will fall back under 2% towards the end of the year are much higher than staying at, or closely above, the 2%-mark.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5b5ef322e4b09ef967470779\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-07-30T11:17:23.589Z\">12.17pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Oil prices are moving higher, helped by last week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s strong growth figures from the US.</p> <p>The prospects of sanctions on Iran denting supply is also supporting the market, although the continuing trade tensions between the US and China are a dampening influence.</p> <p>Brent crude is currently up 0.75% at $74.85 a barrel while West Texas Intermediate - the US benchmark - is 1.76% better at $69.9. <br></p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5b5ee9d2e4b0a09780004cd7\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-07-30T10:36:18.726Z\">11.36am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the Press Association on the UK lending figures:</p> <blockquote> <p>The number of mortgage approvals made to home-buyers jumped to a five-month high in June, Bank of England figures show.</p> <p>Some 65,619 mortgages got the green light for house purchase - the highest monthly total since January.</p> <p>Re-mortgage approvals fell by 7.3% month on month, with 47,895 loans approved in June.

Economic sentiment decreased slightly in July, adding to the view that the current pace of 0.4% GDP growth QoQ is more or less the cruising speed for 2018. The PMI and ESI sent differing signals about the performance of industry and services. The PMI saw a decline in the services index, while the ESI saw improvements and while the PMI indicated stable manufacturing conditions, the ESI industry indicator dropped. Overall, the picture was less positive from a business perspective for both surveys, while the ESI indicated stable consumer confidence.</p> <p>While disappointment with current economic conditions seems to be par for the course at the moment, growth concerns seem to be overstating the current situation somewhat. The outlook for domestic demand remains quite bright with continued employment recovery and some improvements in wage growth. The outlook for the external environment remains uncertain thanks to trade war concerns, although recent developments have been more positive. Even though a trade war has far from been avoided, last week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meeting between US President Trump and European Commission President Juncker at least cleared the air for the moment and could be positive for Eurozone sentiment.

                "bodyText":"Markets remain edgy after technology shares remain unloved in the wake of disappointing updates last week from Facebook and Twitter. Investors are also cautious ahead of a raft of central bank meetings this week, including the Bank of Japan, the US Federal Reserve and the Bank of England. The FTSE 100 is virtually flat while Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax is down 0.29% and France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac has slipped 0.18%. On Wall Street the Dow Jones Industrial Average is up 0.12% while the technology heavy Nasdaq index is down 0.49%. On the economics front, confidence across the European Union held up this month with the European Commission figures showing a pick-up in sentiment in the UK. Still with the UK, mortgage approvals hit a five month high while in Germany, inflation was steady in July. On that note, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time to close for the day. Thanks for your comments, and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be back tomorrow. Better than expected second quarter earnings from industrial giant Caterpillar have given some support to struggling US markets. The heavy equipment maker raised its outlook for the full year, easing fears that the continuing trade dispute between the US and China would badly damage corporate profits. The Dow Jones Industrial Average has edged up 13 points or 0.07% in early trading while the S&amp;P 500 is up 0.01%. But last week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tech sell-off continues to undermine the Nasdaq Composite, which has dipped 0.27%. Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s inflation rate remained steady in July, above the European Central Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s target of 2%. Consumer prices rose 2.1% year on year, the same as the previous month, according to the Federal Statistics Office. That was the figure harmonised with the rest of the European Union - without that it was within the 2% target and down from 2.1% the previous month. Economist Carsten Brzeski at ING Bank said the figures provided little evidence of a sustainable increase in underlying inflation: Based on the results of seven regional states, German headline inflation recorded another marginal drop and slowed down to 2.0% year on year in July, from 2.1.% YoY in June and 2.2% YoY in May. Measured by the harmonized European consumer price index, headline inflation remained unchanged at 2.1%, suggesting that headline inflation in the entire Eurozone (to be released tomorrow) could have hit the 2%-mark for the fourth time in the last five years. Returning to Germany, headline inflation at around 2% YoY, however, is still less the result of the ECB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ultra-loose monetary policy but rather the result of higher energy prices. In fact, where available, regional core inflation measures remained broadly unchanged and only slightly above 1%, indicating that underlying inflationary pressures in the German economy remain low. Judging from the available components, German inflation data still tells a two-sided story: while prices for consumer goods have gradually accelerated in recent months, inflation on services has slowed down and has even been negative for a couple of months for communication. Also, whether it was the World Cup effect or just the ordinary sales season is hard to tell, but prices for clothing and shoes were the biggest drag on headline inflation. Looking ahead, there are still little signs supporting the ECB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s general optimism that underlying inflation in the entire Eurozone is picking up. Despite a very long economic cycle, low unemployment and rising wages, the German economy shows little sign of overheating, not even a significant pick-up in underlying inflation. Instead, headline inflation is mainly dominated by external and one-off factors. In this regard, the current heatwave could push up food prices and hence headline inflation in the coming months. But with little upside pressure on underlying inflation, chances that headline inflation will fall back under 2% towards the end of the year are much higher than staying at, or closely above, the 2%-mark. Oil prices are moving higher, helped by last week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s strong growth figures from the US. The prospects of sanctions on Iran denting supply is also supporting the market, although the continuing trade tensions between the US and China are a dampening influence. Brent crude is currently up 0.75% at $74.85 a barrel while West Texas Intermediate - the US benchmark - is 1.76% better at $69.9. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the Press Association on the UK lending figures: The number of mortgage approvals made to home-buyers jumped to a five-month high in June, Bank of England figures show. Some 65,619 mortgages got the green light for house purchase - the highest monthly total since January. Re-mortgage approvals fell by 7.3% month on month, with 47,895 loans approved in June. Despite the drop-off, the Bank said \u00e2\u20ac\u0153re-mortgaging approvals remain broadly in line with the average over 2018 so far\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd... The Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Money and Credit report also said that, excluding mortgages, households\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 annual growth in borrowing \u00e2\u20ac\u0153remained stable\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd at 8.8% in June. It said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Credit cards have been accounting for an increasing share of consumer credit growth over the past couple of years and the growth rate of credit card lending has exceeded that of other loans and advances (which includes personal loans, overdrafts and car finance) since January 2018.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Annual credit card growth stood at 9.5% in June, compared with 8.5% annual growth in other loans and advances. Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said the continued strength in non-mortgage borrowing \u00e2\u20ac\u0153is symptomatic of the pressure on consumers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 finances, rather than rising confidence about the outlook for their incomes\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. The recent volatility in tech shares could herald a tricky summer for markets, says David Cheetham, chief market analyst at online trading platform XTB: The summer months are often seen as doldrums as far as the markets are concerned with the perception dating back several centuries and characterised succinctly with the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153sell-in-May\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd trading adage. However, there have been some large moves in recent years and there are growing signs that we could be set for another turbulent August as we saw in 2011 and 2015. The root causes of those plunges were the Eurozone debt crisis and fears of a Chinese slowdown, and while the latter of the two could in particular resurface in the not too distant future the early signs this time around, should another plunge occur, seem to be in US tech stocks. Last week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stunning drop in Facebook caught many off guard and serves as a timely reminder that the latest leg higher in US markets has come on a narrowing breadth and increasingly ambitious price multiples. There remains much to occur before we even get anywhere near the panic seen in previous August\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s but there are a growing set of circumstance arising which may spark a period of heightened volatility. Speaking of the Bank of England rate-setting meeting on Thursday, Stefan Koopman, market economist at Rabobank, says: This meeting is Mark Carney\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s leap of faith. He has led the markets to expect a rate rise, so he now has little choice but to follow through or risk losing credibility. The good news is that after disappointing economic data earlier in the year, we expect to see 0.4% GDP growth this quarter. With there being evidence to show that the Q1 dip was weather-related rather than a structural, the Bank appears to have the platform to push through a hike. The only plausible reason we could see behind interest rates remaining flat would be the ongoing uncertainty around Brexit. But if rates do stay at 0.5% this time, we wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t expect another rise until there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s more clarity around the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s departure from the European Union. The pound is having an uncertain time as investors try to decide whether or not an interest rate rise is coming this week. Against the dollar it has edged up 0.15% to $1.3122 while against the euro it is down 0.18% at \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.1226. Sterling is of course being influenced not only by the prospect of a rate rise but the continuing Brexit discussions and the progress (or lack of it) being made by the government. Ahead of the latest eurozone GDP figures due on Tuesday, ING economist Bert Colijn said: We don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t expect tomorrow\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s GDP data for Q2 to have improved from the disappointing Q1 and it does not look like Q3 has started on a stronger footing. Economic sentiment decreased slightly in July, adding to the view that the current pace of 0.4% GDP growth QoQ is more or less the cruising speed for 2018. The PMI and ESI sent differing signals about the performance of industry and services. The PMI saw a decline in the services index, while the ESI saw improvements and while the PMI indicated stable manufacturing conditions, the ESI industry indicator dropped. Overall, the picture was less positive from a business perspective for both surveys, while the ESI indicated stable consumer confidence. While disappointment with current economic conditions seems to be par for the course at the moment, growth concerns seem to be overstating the current situation somewhat. The outlook for domestic demand remains quite bright with continued employment recovery and some improvements in wage growth. The outlook for the external environment remains uncertain thanks to trade war concerns, although recent developments have been more positive. Even though a trade war has far from been avoided, last week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meeting between US President Trump and European Commission President Juncker at least cleared the air for the moment and could be positive for Eurozone sentiment. The Eurozone economy has shifted into a lower gear for now, but the expansion does not seem to be at risk. Business confidence across Europe remained fairly stable in July with a particularly strong performance from the UK, according to the latest figures. The EC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economic sentiment indicator for the eurozone was down just 0.2 points at 112.1 while for the wider European Union it edged up 0.1 points to 112.3. The commission said: Broadly unchanged euro-area sentiment resulted from decreases in industry and retail trade confidence, which were offset by an increase in the services sector. Confidence in construction remained broadly stable while it stayed unchanged among consumers. The marginally better outcome of the headline indicator for the EU (+0.1) was mainly due to the marked improvement of sentiment in the largest non-euro area EU economy, the UK (+1.6) More on the UK borrowing figures: Signs of life in the UK housing market, as mortgage approvals picked up last month. Bank of England figures showed approvals rising from 64,684 in May to 65,619, slightly better than expected and hitting a five month high. Net mortgage lending rose by \u00c2\u00a33.851bn while consumer lending increased by \u00c2\u00a31.567bn. Some bad news from Heineken, the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s second-largest beer maker. Reuters reports: [The company] cut its full-year margin forecasts due to currency weakness in some more profitable markets and expansion in Brazil, knocking its shares on Monday. The brewer of Heineken lager, Tiger, Sol and Strongbow cider reported first-half earnings below market expectations and said its operating margin would decline by 20 basis points in 2018, compared with a previous forecast of a 25 basis point increase, after it fell sharply in the first six months. Overall, the brewer sold more beer in the first six months of 2018 than expected, with growth rose steepest in its two most profitable markets, Vietnam and Mexico, along with Brazil, Cambodia, South Africa, Ethiopia and Russia. Heineken shares traded down 6.0 percent at 86.84 euros, by far the weakest performers in the FTSEurofirst index of leading European shares. The Dutch brewer, whose Heineken lager is the top seller in Europe, said the new guidance was because of the negative translational hit from currencies concentrated more in its higher margin countries, such as Vietnam, and a larger dilutive effect of its expanding Brazilian business. Heineken acquired the loss-making Brazilian operations of Japan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Kirin in 2017 to become the number two player in the South America country, and had previously warned of an impact on its margins. The latest Twitter comments from the US president have moved away from trade disputes for the moments, which may give some relief to investors, says Paul Donovan, chief economist at UBS Global Wealth Management: US President Trump has been active on Twitter. Most of the tweets are about media and the Mueller investigation, and do not matter to markets. However, there was also a threat of shutting down the US government if US President Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u0153big, beautiful wall\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd is not approved by Congress. There is a 30 September budget deadline. Markets may be somewhat relieved that the political focus of the Trump Twitter Feed has shifted from trade to immigration. Both matter as long-term economic topics, but trade is a bigger threat to investors in the near term. The downbeat mood continues although it is by no means a rout. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said: The markets got off to a negative start on what is going to be a crazy busy week, with investors caught between last Friday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s US tech-sell-off and the Fed and Bank of England meetings on Wednesday and Thursday respectively. The FTSE \u00e2\u20ac\u201c which is not only facing the much-awaited BoE decision, but the latest PMIs AND updates from nearly a fifth of its constituents \u00e2\u20ac\u201c fell 0.4% after the bell. That dragged the index back under 7700, a level it has struggled to substantially break beyond for most of July. Once again its commodity stocks proved to be an issue, especially its miners, led lower by a 1% drop from copper. While the FTSE struggled, the pound \u00e2\u20ac\u201c for which Thursday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s BoE interest rate decision could be a make or break event \u00e2\u20ac\u201c was fairly serene. Against both the dollar and the euro sterling rose around 0.1%, hitting $1.312 against the former and \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.125 against the latter. As for the Eurozone indices, there were in a similar mood to their UK counterpart. The DAX dipped 35 points, taking it back under 12850, with the CAC slipping 20 points to slip below 5500. In comparison to the UK and US the region doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have a huge amount going on this week, meaning its trading could be driven by the euro\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s relationship to the dollar and pound. GVC, the owner of bookmakers Ladbrokes and Coral, is topping the FTSE 100 risers after confirming a $200m deal with MGM Resorts, the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest casino operator. GVC is currently up more than 5%. Our full story on the deal is here: As expected, European markets have begun the week on a downbeat note, following the tech sell-off on Wall Street on Friady. The FTSE 100 has fallen 25 points or 0.33%, Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax is down 0.27%, France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac has lost 0.4% and Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB is 0.42% lower. On the results front, London focused estate agency Foxtons has slumped into loss as the capital\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s property market continues to struggle. It lost \u00c2\u00a32.5m in the first half compared to a \u00c2\u00a33.8m profit this time last year, and said the outlook was mixed with a subdued sales market. Neil Wilson, chief market analyst at Markets.com, said: Sales are the real problem as the exodus of buyers in the wake of the Brexit vote continues, while higher stamp duty is biting. Sales revenues fell 23% to \u00c2\u00a317.2m. Chief executive Nic Budden finds comfort in London\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcstrong fundamentals as a global hub\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. So he won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be pleased to see Deutsche Bank moving half of its euro clearing out of the capital to Germany. Deutsche is reported by the Financial Times to be moving almost half its euro clearing activities from London to Frankfurt (\u00c2\u00a3). Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Stock markets are expected to open lower after a tech sell-off on Wall Street at the end of last week. Investors are beginning to wonder if the relentless rise of the FAANG companies - Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix and Google (now owned by Alphabet) - could be over. More likely is that there will be increasing divergence between them. Amazon reported stellar results once more and Alphabet easily shook off the effects of a European Commission fine, but Facebook recorded the biggest ever one day loss in value on Thursday after its outlook statement unnerved the market. This followed disappointing results from Netflix a few days earlier. Meanwhile Twitter\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s user numbers saw a 1m fall and its shares plummeted 20% on Friday. So the tech heavy Nasdaq Compositie index lost nearly 1.5% on Friday, which has already fed through into declines in Asian markets. Europe, which on the whole put in a reasonable performance last week after Donald Trump and EC president Jean-Claude Juncker eased trade war fears after a better than expected meeting, is also on course for early losses. The falls in the US came despite news that the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy had grown by 4.1% on an annualised basis. Jasper Lawler, head of research at London Capital Group, said: The US session at the end of last week left traders digesting 4.1% yoy economic growth in the US in addition to another round of tech stocks reporting. After Facebook\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s disappointing update and record breaking sell off, Twitter quickly followed suit. A beat in revenue but a drop off in user activity sent the stock plunging 12% on fears that the platform\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s user growth could be limited. Earnings season had set off to a good start, however tech stock headlines have quickly dominated, transforming perceptions and raising questions over valuations of FAANG stocks. With Netflix, Facebook and now Twitter disappointing with results, investors are seriously questioning these advertising revenues based or subscription-based models. On the other hand, Amazon beat earnings expectations comfortably, whilst Alphabet shrugged off a \u00e2\u201a\u00ac5 billion fine. This original FAANG trade, which petty much guaranteed impressive returns across previous years, suddenly looks a lot more complicated. Whilst prior to the year these stocks could do no wrong, suddenly that is no longer the case. Investors will now be looking ahead to Apple\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s results on Tuesday, with the iPhone maker expected to be closer to the Amazon end of the scale than Facebook, This week also sees a number of central bank meetings. The Bank of England is expected to sanction an interest rate rise on Thursday, but the US Federal Reserve is likely to hold fire a day earlier, albeit it could well give further hints at a September increase. Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK, said: It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the turn of the Bank of Japan, US Federal Reserve and the Bank of England to guide on monetary policy, and while no surprises are expected from the FOMC, we could get some policy tweaks from the Bank of Japan after last week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s interventions in the JGB market. We could also get a rate rise from the Bank of England on Thursday when they meet to run the rule over the UK economy and the latest inflation report. Back to today, and there are a few economic numbers to look out for.

Where you have personal guarantees for example \u00e2\u20ac\u201c small business owners putting personal assets on the line to secure a loan \u00e2\u20ac\u201c then surely that should be deemed consumer, regulated lending. </p> <p>The FCA\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision follows the announcement that RBS is shutting its redress scheme for GRG customers in the coming months.

Any \u00e2\u20ac\u0153behind the curve\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd thoughts that may have surfaced earlier this year can be parked.</p> <p>Whereas the decline in growth in Q1 was considered to be due to one-offs, it seems like excuses are running out to explain the even weaker Q2 reading. Perhaps still temporary, but factors with a longer shelf life seem to have brought Eurozone GDP growth down to a lower cruising speed for the moment. The confidence impact of a trade row and weaker real household income growth seem to be spoiling the European party for the moment.</p> <p>Trade uncertainty seems to have already had a significant effect on the Eurozone economy in Q2. While the impact on real export growth has likely been small over the second quarter, the confidence factor has been more important. With lower confidence among businesses and consumers, concerns have likely translated into somewhat weaker domestic demand growth. In an economy in which capacity constraints abound and credit conditions remain favourable, confidence is the likely factor keeping investment down.</p> <p>Lower consumer confidence has taken some of the wind out of the sails from consumption growth. This comes on the back of trade concerns, but also slowing growth in real household income per capita since mid-2017. The second quarter has added to this trend because the rapid pickup in fuel prices has likely outstripped wage growth. French data - the breakdown of GDP is already available in France - confirms that private consumption performed poorly as it declined by 0.1%.</p> <p>Inflation remained high despite the weaker growth path that the Eurozone economy is on in 2018 but mainly driven by higher energy prices. The energy index increased by 9.4% YoY. These effects will weaken over the coming months, bringing the inflation rate more in line with core inflation. The core rate picked up to 1.1%, which is where it was in May as well. This is still weak and very much in line with ECB expectations. As the energy effects are temporary, the high inflation rate should be taken with a grain of salt from a policy perspective at the moment, so will the ECB.</p> <p>The implications of the lower cruising speed of the Eurozone economy are quite clear. The weaker cyclical picture and low core inflation provide little reason for the ECB to increase rates before autumn next year.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5b602c38e4b0b2d8950df82e\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-07-31T09:32:57.307Z\">10.32am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Royal Bank of Scotland has welcomed (unsurprisingly) the FCA statement.

Taking action was therefore always going to be difficult and challenging but after carefully considering all the evidence we have concluded that our powers to discipline for misconduct do not apply and that an action in relation to senior management for lack of fitness and propriety would not have reasonable prospects of success. </p> <p>We have consulted with independent, external leading counsel who has confirmed that the FCA\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s conclusions are correct and reasonable. </p> <p>I appreciate that many GRG customers will be frustrated by this decision but we have explored all the options available to us before arriving at this conclusion. </p> <p>The fact that we can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t take action in no way condones the behaviour of RBS.

                "bodyText":"It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been a busy day for economic and corporate news. And a good one for relieved executives at Royal Bank of Scotland, who have been told that the City watchdog does not have the powers to take action against them over the mistreatment of business customers by the bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s GRG division. The chair of the Treasury Select Committee said it was bewildering the Financial Conduct Authority could not act. Not such a good day for some Dixons Carphone customers. The company has admitted that a data breach means around data from around 10m accounts may have been accessed without authority. On the economic front, eurozone GDP grew more slowly than expected in the second quarter but headline inflation was higher than forecast. The Bank of Japan tweaked its economic stimulus package and said interest rates would remain low for an extended period of time. Results from British Gas owner Centrica and DIY group Travis Perkins were badly received, while overall it was a mixed day for European stock markets. The FTSE 100 is currently up 0.95% while Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax has dipped 0.19%. On Wall Street the Dow Jones Industrial Average is up nearly 100 points in early trading. On that note, it is time to close for the day. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be back tomorrow. US markets have made a positive start to the trading day, helped by a rebound in technology stocks and the upbeat consumer spending figures. Shares were also supported by talk that the US and China were looking to re-start discussions about the current trade dispute. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 95 points or 0.36% while the S&amp;P 500 opened up 0.33% and the tech heavy Nasdaq Composite added 0.37%. US consumers are continuing to spend, especially on restaurants and accommodation. The commerce department said consumer spending rose by 0.4% in June, in line with expectations. The May increase was revised upwards from 0.2% to 0.5%. The personal consumption expenditures price index - excluding food and energy - rose by 0.1%, compared to a 0.2% rise in May. Another call for the Financial Conduct Authority to publish its full report on the Royal Bank of Scotland/GRG scandal, this time from the Federation of Small Businesses. Its chairman Mike Cherry said: There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s nothing in the current legislative framework to stop another GRG-type scenario. As long as commercial lending remains unregulated, small firms will be vulnerable. The hope is that \u00e2\u20ac\u201c as the FCA claims \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the new Senior Managers Regime will lead to a more responsible lending climate in future. Too often, the regulator doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t recognise that small business owners have far more in common with consumers than big corporations. Where you have personal guarantees for example \u00e2\u20ac\u201c small business owners putting personal assets on the line to secure a loan \u00e2\u20ac\u201c then surely that should be deemed consumer, regulated lending. The FCA\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision follows the announcement that RBS is shutting its redress scheme for GRG customers in the coming months. If you have 16,000 customers who are eligible to use the scheme and only 1,230 have complained, common sense dictates that the scheme needs to stay open for a good while yet, particularly as the bank is still receiving six GRG complaints a week. The FCA needs to publish its full findings as swiftly as possible. The only way to restore trust between small firms and the big banks is to show that the wrongs of the past are being put right, and real change is happening to prevent unfair treatment in the future. The All Party Parliamentary Group on Fair Business Banking, which includes members from both the House of Commons and the House of Lords, said the City watchdog should release all its information about the GRG case. In a statement, the group said: At the APPG we are extremely disappointed, but largely unsurprised, by [the FCA] announcement. It is simply not good enough from a regulatory perspective to say that the powers to hold individuals to account simply do not exist. Kevin Hollinrake MP, Co-Chair of the APPG, said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The FCA should release all findings and evidence they have obtained in their investigation of RBS GRG, unredacted so that the individuals who are responsible for this misconduct are in the public domain. The FCA have an obligation to release this information so that politicians can have a say in whether it is truly the case that no further actions can be applied. As lawmakers we have an obligation to the public to ensure that those who are responsible are accountable and not untouchable, as indeed is the case now where the individuals responsible are protected by the regulatory inadequacy of our current system\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. He also stated: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The FCA should release all of their findings so that the untouchable senior managers at RBS GRG, many who remain working in the banking sector, are held to account. The public, the press and indeed the financial sector themselves have a right to know who is responsible for this misconduct\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. What has to be made absolutely clear is that this is not the FCA giving RBS an innocent verdict in relation to their GRG unit. It is clear that the FCA do not have the powers to adequately investigate and discipline instances of misconduct to a degree which gives victims any confidence. In the wake of the Financial Conduct Authority saying it does not have sufficient powers to disciple Royal Bank of Scotland executives over the GRG scandal, the head of the Treasury Select Committee has called for a review into whether new legislation is needed. MP Nicky Morgan MP said: It will be disappointing and bewildering for those who got caught up in GRG\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s actions that the FCA is not able to act. This demonstrates the need for a change in how lending for SMEs is regulated. The Government should stand ready to introduce any legislation required when it sees the outcome of current reports on redress and should also urgently consider what additional powers the FCA requires to act in cases such as GRG. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Reuters wrapping up the day\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s eurozone economic news: The euro zone economy grew more slowly than expected in the second quarter, preliminary data showed on Tuesday, but headline and core inflation accelerated with unemployment stabilizing at a lower level. The European Union\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s statistics office Eurostat estimated that gross domestic product in the 19 countries sharing the euro expanded 0.3 percent quarter-on-quarter in the April-June period and was 2.1 percent higher against the same period of 2017. Economists polled by Reuters had expected a 0.4 percent quarterly expansion and a 2.2 percent year-on-year rise. Headline consumer inflation accelerated to 2.1 percent year-on-year in July from 2.0 percent in June, mainly because of a spike in the cost of energy. Core inflation, which excludes energy costs as well as unprocessed food and which the European Central Bank looks at in policy decisions, also rose to 1.3 percent year-on-year from 1.2 percent in June, beating economists expectations. An even narrower core inflation measure that economists pay attention to, which excludes also the costs of alcohol and tobacco, also rose to 1.1 percent from 0.9 percent in July \u00e2\u20ac\u201d again, above expectations. The ECB wants to keep headline inflation below, but close to, 2 percent over the medium term. Separately, Eurostat said unemployment in the euro zone was at 8.3 percent in June, unchanged from a downwardly revised 8.3 percent in May. Commenting on the eurozone inflation figures, Joshua Mahony, market analyst at IG said: Eurozone inflation data has pushed pressure back onto Mario Draghi &amp; co, with headline CPI breaching the 2% target for the first time since 2012. While much of the rise in inflation can be attributed to the incredible 9.4% annual rise in the energy component, the fact that we have also seen core inflation jump 0.2% means that many of the underlying components are also being affected. With the ECB set to end their QE programme by the end of the year, markets will be keen to see Draghi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s response should inflation continue to push higher. The weaker than expected eurozone growth figures mean the European Central Bank is unlikely to raise rates before next autumn, says ING Bank senior economist Bert Colijn: The Eurozone economy grew by just 0.3% QoQ in the second quarter with inflation increasing to above 2%. Any \u00e2\u20ac\u0153behind the curve\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd thoughts that may have surfaced earlier this year can be parked. Whereas the decline in growth in Q1 was considered to be due to one-offs, it seems like excuses are running out to explain the even weaker Q2 reading. Perhaps still temporary, but factors with a longer shelf life seem to have brought Eurozone GDP growth down to a lower cruising speed for the moment. The confidence impact of a trade row and weaker real household income growth seem to be spoiling the European party for the moment. Trade uncertainty seems to have already had a significant effect on the Eurozone economy in Q2. While the impact on real export growth has likely been small over the second quarter, the confidence factor has been more important. With lower confidence among businesses and consumers, concerns have likely translated into somewhat weaker domestic demand growth. In an economy in which capacity constraints abound and credit conditions remain favourable, confidence is the likely factor keeping investment down. Lower consumer confidence has taken some of the wind out of the sails from consumption growth. This comes on the back of trade concerns, but also slowing growth in real household income per capita since mid-2017. The second quarter has added to this trend because the rapid pickup in fuel prices has likely outstripped wage growth. French data - the breakdown of GDP is already available in France - confirms that private consumption performed poorly as it declined by 0.1%. Inflation remained high despite the weaker growth path that the Eurozone economy is on in 2018 but mainly driven by higher energy prices. The energy index increased by 9.4% YoY. These effects will weaken over the coming months, bringing the inflation rate more in line with core inflation. The core rate picked up to 1.1%, which is where it was in May as well. This is still weak and very much in line with ECB expectations. As the energy effects are temporary, the high inflation rate should be taken with a grain of salt from a policy perspective at the moment, so will the ECB. The implications of the lower cruising speed of the Eurozone economy are quite clear. The weaker cyclical picture and low core inflation provide little reason for the ECB to increase rates before autumn next year. Royal Bank of Scotland has welcomed (unsurprisingly) the FCA statement. Chairman Howard Davies said: The Board welcomes the FCA\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s confirmation that it has concluded its investigation into the bank and that no further action will be taken. We await the publication of the FCA\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s full account and will reflect carefully on its findings to learn any further lessons from what was a hugely challenging time for the bank, its customers and the wider economy. The Board continues to focus on putting things right for customers through our complaints process and ensuring that past mistakes cannot be repeated. The way the bank deals with business customers in financial difficulty is fundamentally different now. As a reminder, here is our story from February which includes details of how RBS mistreated its business customers: Elsewhere, the Financial Conduct Authority has said it can take no action to discipline Royal Bank of Scotland management over the mistreatment of small and medium sized businesses through its Global Restructuring Group subsidiary. Andrew Bailey, FCA chief executive said: Given the serious concerns that were identified in the independent review it was only right that we launched a comprehensive and forensic investigation to see if there was any action that could be taken against senior management or RBS. It is important to recognise that the business of GRG was largely unregulated and the FCA\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s powers to take action in such circumstances, even where the mistreatment of customers has been identified and accepted, are very limited. Taking action was therefore always going to be difficult and challenging but after carefully considering all the evidence we have concluded that our powers to discipline for misconduct do not apply and that an action in relation to senior management for lack of fitness and propriety would not have reasonable prospects of success. We have consulted with independent, external leading counsel who has confirmed that the FCA\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s conclusions are correct and reasonable. I appreciate that many GRG customers will be frustrated by this decision but we have explored all the options available to us before arriving at this conclusion. The fact that we can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t take action in no way condones the behaviour of RBS. We expect high standards from the firms we regulate and RBS fell well short in its treatment of GRG customers. We feel strongly that those companies that have suffered loss as a result of how they were treated whilst in GRG must be appropriately compensated. We are closely monitoring the complaints process overseen by Sir William Blackburne, an independent third party, to ensure that things are put right. Meanwhile eurozone inflation has come in higher than forecast. The headline figure rose by 2.1% year on year in July compared to 2% the month before and expectations of an unchanged number. Eurozone GDP grew by 2.1% year on year in the second quarter, down from 2.5% and lower than the forecast 2.2%. On a quarter by quarter basis it grew by 0.3%, compared to expectations of a 0.4% rise. Two more big fallers after updates, this time in the mid-cap FTSE 250. Building materials group Travis Perkins is down nearly 10% after it warned 2018 operating profits would be at the lower end of expectations. The company, which owns the Wickes chain, blamed weak demand in the home DIY market. Meanwhile Games Workshop, whose shares have been strong performers recently, is down more than 6% despite reporting a near doubling of full year profits to \u00c2\u00a374.5m. Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s jobless total fell by 6,000 in July to 2.338m, compared to expectations of a 10,000 decline. The unemployment rate was steady at 5.2%, as forecast. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our story on the Dixons Carphone data breach: Dixons Carphone said an investigation into a massive data breach has found personal data belonging to 10 million customers may have been accessed last year, nearly 10 times as many as initially thought. The electronics retailer had estimated the attack involved unauthorised access to 1.2m personal records, when it first reported the breach in June. It said there was no evidence of any fraud. Alex Baldock, chief executive, said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Since our data security review uncovered last year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s breach, we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve been working around the clock to put it right. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s included closing off the unauthorised access, adding new security measures and launching an immediate investigation, which has allowed us to build a fuller understanding of the incident that we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re updating on today. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Again, we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re disappointed in having fallen short here, and very sorry for any distress we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve caused our customers. I want to assure them that we remain fully committed to making their personal data safe with us.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The company said records containing personal data such as names, addresses or email addresses had been accessed, but not financial information. It is writing to customers to apologise for the data breach, but does not plan to pay compensation as there is no evidence that anyone has suffered any financial loss. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153While there is no evidence that some of this data may have left our systems, these records do not contain payment card or bank account details and there is no evidence that any fraud has resulted,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Dixons said. The full report is here: Some big falls on the FTSE 100 from company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s reporting results. Rentokil Initial is down 4.4% after half year profits dropped 81.5% although last year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s figure included a one off \u00c2\u00a3462m profit on the disposal of its workwear business. Revenues fell 4.7%. Standard Chartered is 3.4% lower despite a 34% rise in profits, as worries about a trade war unsettle investors. And British Gas owner Centrica is down 3.5% as it reported a 20% fall in profits at its consumer division and announced the loss of another 226,000 customers or 1% in the first half. Neil Wilson, chief market analyst at Markets.com said: Centrica results make for some grim reading again but management does sound a little more confident than the talk of \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcmaterial uncertainty\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 we got at the start of the year... The UK Consumer division is leaking cash and customers. Although the customer churn has slowed with accounts down just 1%, profits there fell 20%. The cold snap could have been good for Centrica but higher wholesale costs, fewer customer accounts and the prepayment cap all weighed on profits. And while it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s slowing, the loss of customers needs to be arrested fast \u00e2\u20ac\u201c cutting costs is working for now but is not sustainable longer term. Centrica lost 226,000 customers in the first half and the fact that this is flagged as a better performance than previously shows just how bad the situation is. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a cautious opening for European markets, with a raft of company results, some key economic data ahead and continuing concerns about valuations in the technology sector after major falls for Facebook and Twitter. The FTSE 100 is up 0.07%, while Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax edged 0.1% higher but France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac fell 0.1% and Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB dipped 0.04%. The Bank of Japan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s actions today continue its dovish tendencies. Viraj Patel, foreign exchange strategist at ING Bank said: When it comes to the July BoJ meeting, there was more than meets the eye \u00e2\u20ac\u201c with the central bank making subtle, yet curious, tweaks to its unconventional policy artillery. But if anyone was in doubt, the super-easy BoJ policy is still very much in place; while officials will allow for greater flexibility in long-term yields, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s important to stress the two-way flexibility here (not just upwards, but also downwards). In fact, by firmly restating the annual \u00c2\u00a580trn JGB purchase target, the BoJ are showing no real appetite for a rapid rise in long-term yields (there was explicit aversion to this in the statement). What sealed the dovish deal was the guidance that the BoJ will \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcmaintain very low rate levels for an extended period of time\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c which is not too dissimilar to what the ECB stated last month. Back in the UK, and Dixons Carphone had previously announced it had found unauthorised access to some of its data. Now it says that around 10m records containing personal data may have been affected in 2017. It says there is evidence some of this data may have left its systems but it maintains these records did not contain payment card or bank account details and there is no evidence of any fraud being committed. It is now contacting all of its customers to apologise and advise them of the steps they need to take to minimise the risk of fraud. German consumers are spending freely according to the latest retail sales figures. They rose 3% year on year in June, up from a 1.2% rise in May and much better than the 1.5% increase expected by analysts. The month on month figure showed a 1.2% increase, compared to a 1.5% decline in May. Here are the opening calls for the European markets from IG: In Asia the Hang Seng is down 0.53% while the Nikkei 225 is up 0.039%. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Investors will be anticipating another nervy day on the markets after a weak start to the week. The technology drop which followed last week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s poor results from Facebook and Twitter continued on Monday, with the Nasdaq Composite recording its third decline of more than 1% in a row. Will Apple, which reports later, be able to turn the tide? Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK, said: Apple shares managed to outperform [on Monday], only declining 0.5%, but only because investors are looking ahead to tonight\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Q3 earnings announcement, but even here there may be cause for concern. Lower average selling prices at its Q2 update suggested that buyers were opting for cheaper models, perhaps indicating that iPhone X sales may have peaked. Whether this is true or not is likely to be difficult to determine given that Q3 tends to be a weak quarter in any case, as it tends to be a precursor to a range of new product launches or updates, which tend to happen in Q4. Of more importance will be its burgeoning services business, which includes music, games, apps and Apple pay fees, and which has slowly grown in importance, and has seen revenues rise consistently since 2012. It is a busy day for company results ahead of the start of the summer lull, with BP already reporting its first dividend hike since 2014. On the economic front we have eurozone GDP figures, with the second quarter expected to show a dip from 2.5% to 2.2% on an annualised basis. Initial July inflation figures for the bloc are forecast to remain at 2% on a headline basis, with the core number edging back to 1%. Hewson said: Last week the European Central Bank signed off for its summer break by playing down expectations that we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d see a rate rise much before the end of Q3 next year, and this candour from President Mario Draghi went some way to help push the euro down towards the bottom end of its recent range. Since then we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve seen it start to edge back up again despite a strong US Q2 GDP number, which has seen US rates edge back up again, and today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s latest preliminary flash EU CPI number for July could well prompt a further recovery towards the 1.1800 area. Inflation pressures have popped higher in recent months, helped by rising energy prices, however these do appear to have stalled a little, particularly given that core prices dropped below 1% in June to 0.9%.
