FTSE, European gauges and Dow futures were also not spared with the heavily export-oriented DAX losing 1.5%.</p> <p>Tech stocks in Asia were the hardest hit, in particular Samsung, Tokyo Electron, TDK and Tencent, pulling down Asian indexes. The US already has a low-key conflict simmering with the Chinese tech giant and has, alongside New Zealand, already blocked Huawei from selling their 5G technology in the country for fear that it could be used for malicious purposes. The latest arrest will be seen as a heavy slap in the face in China as the arrested executive, Meng Wanzhou, is the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s CFO and the daughter of Huawei\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s founder.

Ironically, Mrs May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chances could now lie in the hands of the Brexiteers. If they realise the game for a hard Brexit is up, they might prefer the deal to the other options of a softer Brexit or no Brexit at all. But this is a long shot.

That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a drop of just 0.3% - barely worth mentioning on a normal day. The tech-focused Nasdaq actually closed 0.4% higher.

Wall Street was on course for a second day of heavy losses following news of the detention of Meng Wanzhou, chief global finance officer for the Chinese telecoms company Huawei by Canadian authorities and the request by the US for her extradition to face reported cyber espionage and sanction-breaking charges. Reports of Wanzhou\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s arrest \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s demand for her release \u00e2\u20ac\u201c led to falls of 2% in the Shanghai and Tokyo markets overnight and the sell-off spread to Europe, where all the main bourses saw losses in their main indices of more than 3%.

Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the full piece: Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a reminder of the size and scale of today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s market selloff - big losses across Europe and the America.... ..., after Asia was rocked by the arrest of Huawei\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Meng Wanzhou. Jamie Dimon, the CEO of JP Morgan, believes the US-China trade dispute is the primary issue hurting markets. He told CNBC that investors are worried about how bad the situation will get [a good question, now that Huawei\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s CFO is facing extradition to the US]. CNBC explains: The U.S. under the Trump administration has engaged in an escalating trade war with China, though the two sides are talking and set a 90 day time frame from Dec. 1 to get an agreement. Dimon called it a trade \u00e2\u20ac\u0153skirmish.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd But it is forcing business leaders to find new supply lines, rethink investments or hold off on investments. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Those things are just causing uncertainty, which causes volatility.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd With one hour to go until Wall Street closes for the day, the Dow Jones industrial average is solidly in the red. The Dow is down 350 points - with almost every share still down today. Boeing and JP Morgan lead the fallers Ian King, Sky News\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s business editor, reckon president Trump must take responsibility for the falling stock markets. He writes that Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade war with China has alarmed investors, and weakened shares: Mr Trump, who tweeted regularly when the stock market was breaking new records earlier this year, has had very little to say about these recent falls. However, if he is being honest with himself, he will know he is to blame. US equities were euphoric earlier this year on the back of his corporate tax cuts. However, the sugar rush has now worn off and, in the eyes of company executives, good Trump who cut taxes for companies has been replaced by bad Trump, who erects tariffs and introduces other protectionist measures. So while there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s still time for the traditional \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcSanta rally\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 in the run-up to Christmas, investors shouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t bank on it this year..... Back in New York, shares are bouncing back from their earlier lows. The Dow is now only down 330 points, or 1.3% -- a chunky fall, but less severe than the 700-point slump earlier. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s turning into another volatile day.... Fears of a global downturn have hit markets today, says Patrick Schaffer, global investment specialist at J.P. Morgan Private Bank. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The market seems right now to be focused on increased risks for a 2020 recession. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a very hard market to buy when you see really strong signals that we are indeed late (in the economic) cycle.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The market mayhem may bring some relief to hard-pressed US consumers. The odds of American interest rates being hiked in 2019 have fallen sharply. The big picture is that most global stock markets have lost ground this year. The FTSE 100 was already down more than 10% since the start of January, before today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rout. The German DAX was down 16%, while China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s market has plunged by a fifth. America has done better, mainly due to the impact of Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tax cuts (which have boosted corporate profits). Sky News have a good take on the selloff: A global share sell-off has seen the FTSE 100 slump on the same scale as the day after the Brexit referendum in 2016. The decline of 3.15%, or 218 points - wiping \u00c2\u00a356bn off the value of the FTSE\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s constituent companies - came after the arrest of a top Chinese executive on behalf of the US triggered renewed fears of a trade war. That helped unleash simmering worries about a broad cocktail of worldwide tensions, including a potential recession in the US, turning trading screens red from New York and London to Paris and Frankfurt. A slide in the oil price - with Brent crude falling by more than 3% to less than $60 a barrel - also weighed on sentiment. Back in New York, Wall Street continues to suffer its own day of losses. The Dow Jones industrial average is currently down 500-ish points, or 2%, at 24,517. That means the benchmark index has lost all its gains for 2018. The broader S&amp;P 500 index has shed 1.5%, which means it is also in the red for 2018. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sell-off also means the FTSE 100 is actually below its level on 30th December 1999, the final day of the last millennium. However, there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a bit more to it than that. For starters, the FTSE 100 is still almost double its nadir in March 2009, when the financial crisis had driven Britain into recession. Secondly, the raw points value of the Footsie doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t include the dividends paid out to shareholders from company profits. According to Laith Khalaf of financial services firm Hargreaves Lansdown, you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d actually have doubled your money if you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d invested at the end of the dot-com boom. He also puts some of the blame for the losses on the Brexit crisis.... Today, sentiment is vastly different from the end of the 1990s. Animal spirits were out of control in 1999, which led to the substantial overvaluation of the UK stock market. Now the Footsie is desperately unloved because Brexit means many investors want to put a good-sized bargepole between themselves and the UK stock market. Despite the headline value of the FTSE 100 today being close to its 1999 peak, investors in the UK stock market are putting money to work at a much cheaper level, once you take company profits into account. In 1999 the UK stock market was valued at 27 times earnings, today it stands at around 15 times earnings. While in the short term it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s entirely plausible the UK market could fall further, a lower valuation suggests better long term returns are on offer. Mohamed El-Erian of Allianz reckons that shares took a dive today as investors raced to sell riskier assets, fearing more turmoil ahead. Fiona Cincotta, senior market analyst at City Index, says the shock arrest of Huawei\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s CFO was a big factor behind today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s market meltdown. For China the Huawei arrest will add insult to injury as the arrested executive, Meng Wangzhou, is not only the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s CFO but also the Huawei founder\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s daughter and the prospective company successor and concerns are growing that the country could retaliate with arrests of US executives. Although Meng Wangzhou was detained in Canada on suspicions of breaching sanctions against Iran the arrest highlights a different set of tensions between the US and China \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the issue of cybersecurity. The US has long suspected Huawei of foul play in cybersecurity and has restricted the sale of its 5G equipment in the US for fears that it might be used for dubious purposes. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sell-off has driven the FTSE 100 index down to its lowest close in over two years. If you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re just tuning in, there are three reasons why markets are falling sharply today. 1) News broke last night that the chief financial officer of one of China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest companies, Meng Wanzhou of Huawei, has been arrested in Canada. Meng faces extradition to the US, reportedly on charges of cyber-espionage and breaking sanctions preventing trade with Iran. Her shock detention has panicked investors, who fear that it will destabilise negotiations between the US and China over trade policies. 2) Global slowdown fears are growing. Economic data this week has shown that Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s companies have slowed, while the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s services sector also ran out of steam last month. 3) Ructions in the bond markets. Nervous investors are now demanding a greater return for buying short-term US government debt, rather than longer dated. This \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcyield curve inversion\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 could be a sign that America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy is heading for recession. In points terms, the FTSE 100 has suffered its biggest drop in over three years. A reminder that all European markets suffered a bad day: Nearly every company on the FTSE 100 fell today, apart from precious metals producers (who benefitted from a dash into gold and silver). Energy firms slumped by 4.5%, mining companies fell 4%, banks lost 3.9%, and industrial groups lost 2.7%. After a day of wild selling, and deepening losses, London\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock market has just posted its biggest one-day loss since the UK voted to leave the European Union. The FTSE 100 has just closed down 217 points, a fall of 3.15%, at 6704. That matches the 3.15% decline suffered in the aftermath of the EU referendum, on 24 June 2016. By my maths, it wipes \u00c2\u00a356bn off the value of the companies on the Footsie. More to follow! European stock markets have suffered their worst day since Britain voted to leave the EU. The Stoxx 600 index, which includes Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest stocks, has just closed for the night, down 3.3%. Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s DAX has provisionally closed down 3.9%, which I think puts it in an official bear market (down more than a fifth on its record high). Amid panicky selling, the French CAC has lost 3.7% and Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s IBEX shed 3.2%. The selloff on Wall Street is deepening, fast. The Dow has now tumbled by 760 points, as the rout accelerates. Each of the 30 members of the Dow is in the red. Aircraft-maker Boeing has lost 6.6%, chemicals firm DowDuPont has lost 4.4%, investment bank JP Morgan has dropped by 3.8% and construction equipment maker Caterpillar has lost 3.3%. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock market has just endured one of its worst days in several years.... Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s David Madden, market analyst at CMC Markets UK, on today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s market mayhem: Equity markets suffered severe losses as investors are worried the relationship between the US and China has been strained by the arrest of Meng Wanzhou, the CFO of Huawei. The Chinese businesswomen faces possible extradition to the US as the company is alleged to have breached sanctions in relation to Iran. The US-China relationship was moving in the right direction after the G20 summit, and now dealers feel all the good work could be undone. It is a broad based sell-off that we are seeing in London, as mining, energy, financial and consumer stocks are all lower. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the scene on the New York stock exchange today, as traders reel from another heavy sell-off: There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no respite on Wall Street. Instead, the Dow is now down by 525 points, or 2.1%. Over in Frankfurt, the DAX index has slumped by over 3%. That takes the index of leading German companies into a full-blown bear market, more than 20% below its recent peak. Carmaker Daimler is the biggest faller, down 5.3%. Industrial giant Thyssenkrupp have lost 4.5% and pharmaceuticals company Bayer has lost 3.6%. They would all be big casualties from a deep global trade war. Back in London, shares are hitting new two-year lows. The FTSE 100 index has now slumped by 2.8%, or 196 points, to 6724. Mining giant Antofagasta has now slumped by 7%, reflecting concerns that the US-China trade truce may not hold. Financial stocks such as Prudential(-6.7%), Schroders (-5.7%), Legal &amp; General (-4.8%) and Royal Bank of Scotland (-4%) are also among the top fallers. America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s banks are also being pummelled in early trading, on fears of an economic slowdown. Bank of America has shed 4%, while JP Morgan has lost over 3%. Traders are alarmed by recent moves in the US bond market. The yield, or interest rate, on US two-year bonds has risen above the yields on longer-dated five-year bonds. Technically, that means the yield curve has \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcinverted\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, and that investors are demanding a higher interest rate to hold short-dated bonds. Why does THAT matter? Because it suggests there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a greater risk that the US economy is heading towards a recession (making shorter-dated bonds riskier). Now, the curve is only just inverted. According to my Reuters machine, the two-year Treasury bills are yielding 2.713%, while 5-year Treasuries are yielding 2.708%. But that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s enough to worry Wall Street, who remember that an inverted yield curve has preceded a downturn in the past... Shares in US semiconductor-makers are leading the selloff on Wall Street. Broadcom, Micron, Intel and AMD are all in the red; they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d suffer badly if the US-China trade dispute intensifies, as so many tech products are assembled in Chinese factories. Apple\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shares have fallen 2%.... and the smaller tech firms which supply chips and other components for iPads, iPhones and Macs are also suffering. DING DING! The Wall Street opening bell is being rung, kicking off what could be a brutal trading session. The Dow Jones industrial average has dropped by 1.85%, or 466 points, to 24,560. The S&amp;P 500 (a broader measure of US stocks) is also down 1.7%, meaning it is now in the red for 2018. The tech-focused Nasdaq has lost almost 2%, as traders fear that the arrest of Huawei\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s CFO will hurt the technology sector, and trigger a deeper trade war between the US and China. More to follow! Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at Spartan Capital Securities, says traders need their best tin hats today: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The indices are headed for another tumble as the previous steep sell-off extends itself on a host of negative news. The arrest of Huawei CFO is putting in doubt the trade truce between the U.S. and China.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Unless Wall Street traders recover their nerve very quickly, we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re heading into a hefty selloff at the open. The Dow Jones industrial average is expected to drop by more than more than 1.5%, which would be 400 point-plus plunge. Time for a a quick catch-up on the markets, as we brace for a bruising Wall Street open in under 30 minute\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE 100 is still wallowing at a two-year low, down 172 points or 2.5% at 6748. The German DAX and the French CAC are both also down 2.5%, dragging the Europe-wide Stoxx 600 down to its own two-year low. That follows the selloff in Asia, which saw China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Shanghai Composite index slide by 2%. Mihir Kapadia, CEO of Sun Global Investments, blames the arrest of Huwaei\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Chief Financial Officer, Meng Wanzhou. This is likely to escalate the tense relationship between China and the US further. Both tech and automotive stocks have been the biggest fallers - the events emphasise the vulnerability of markets to any issues, particularly political ones, involving the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s two largest economies. This has sent shockwaves not only across European stock markets but around the world with Asia the worst affected as investors\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 early optimism about the weekend developments in trade talks dissipates. This is likely to set up a turbulent end to the year for markets and will leave investors anxiously awaiting the next development.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Newsflash: America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade gap with China has hit a record high; news that may send Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s blood pressure rising too. According to the Commerce Department, the deficit swelled by 1.7% last month to $55.5bn, the highest since October 2008. The gap was driven by a surge in imports and a drop in soybean exports (which have been hit by the trade war.) This means that despite (or indeed thanks to) Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s efforts, America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade gap has expanded for the last five months. Crucially, the goods trade deficit with China surged 7.1% to a record $43.1bn. So much for Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s claim that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Trade wars are good, and easy to win\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd...... The latest US jobs data isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t too encouraging. American companies hired 179,000 new workers last month, according to payroll firm ADP. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 16,000 fewer than expected, and may show that the US labor market has peaked. How big is Meng Wanzhou\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s arrest? Massive, argues Politico\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Marty Kady: Brad Bechtel of US investment bank Jefferies thinks Meng Wanzhou\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s arrest could trigger a new front in the US-China trade war. He writes: Everyone is focused on the Hauwei CFO\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s arrest in Canada on allegations that Hauwei violated Iran sanctions. The arrest was ordered by the US and extradition is expected. Concern of course that the arrest will damage the fragile trade truce between the two nations. If anything it tells you the administration\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s willingness to continue to toe the hard line on this issue and to not back down. It leads me to believe we will have a rocky road on this for the next few months and that the game has not yet begun. This was my initial reaction after the weekend\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s G20 and the Trump / Xi dinner and last night\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s price action and reaction to the arrest confirms it. The fireworks will continue straight through our winter time. Shortly after news of Mang Wanzhou\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shock arrest broke, China announced that it will immediately start implementing its side of the trade truce with America. Commerce ministry spokesman Gao Feng told reporters that: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153China will immediately implement the consensus both sides already reached on agricultural products, energy, autos and other specific items.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Gao added that two sides would also discuss intellectual property protection, technology cooperation, market access and fair trade. These measures were agreed between president Trump and President Xi on Saturday night, but there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been no official joint announcement of what they actually are. More here: China expert George Magnus has tweeted about why the arrest of Huawei\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chief financial officer last weekend matters: The European technology sector has slumped by 3.3% today, helping to drag markets down to two-year lows. The arrest of Huawei\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Meng Wanzhou is fuelling fears that the US-China trade war will flare up again. Any additional tariffs on Chinese exports would hurt tech companies -- last week, Donald Trump mused about slapping new tariffs on iPhones, for example. Energy shares are down 3.2%, reflecting the drop in the oil price as Opec ministers wrestle in Vienna. Mining stocks have dropped by 3% - demand for iron ore, copper, nickel and other commodities will be hit if the global economy stumbles over a trade war. Banks are down 2.7% on average -- they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d incur more bad debts in a global recession. Industrial companies have lost 2.7%, reflecting worries that order books could shrivel in a trade war. America is waking up to the news that markets are sliding.... The sell-off is turning into a full-blown slump! European stocks have plunged to their lowest level since December 2016, as investors become increasingly panicky. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE 100 continues to bear a lot of damage - down around 2.5% this morning at its lowest level since December 2016. The German DAX has shed 2.4%, with France, Italy and Spain also under the cosh. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the damage: There are several reasons for the slump: 1) The shock arrest of Huawei\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chief financial officer could trigger a new clash in the US-China trade war, undermining hopes of a peace deal. Fiona Cincotta of City Index explains: Asian markets were knocked sideways by the arrest of a senior Huawei official in Canada as the move sparked fears that tensions between the US and China would yet again intensify. FTSE, European gauges and Dow futures were also not spared with the heavily export-oriented DAX losing 1.5%. Tech stocks in Asia were the hardest hit, in particular Samsung, Tokyo Electron, TDK and Tencent, pulling down Asian indexes. The US already has a low-key conflict simmering with the Chinese tech giant and has, alongside New Zealand, already blocked Huawei from selling their 5G technology in the country for fear that it could be used for malicious purposes. The latest arrest will be seen as a heavy slap in the face in China as the arrested executive, Meng Wanzhou, is the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s CFO and the daughter of Huawei\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s founder. She was detained in Canada and could end up being extradited to the US as the company is suspected of breaching sanctions against Iran. 2) The Brexit crisis is alarming the City, as Theresa May struggles to persuade MPs to back her withdrawal agreement. Kallum Pickering of Berenberg Bank says: For different reasons, a majority of MPs in parliament seem set to vote down Mrs May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s deal on the first attempt. With the lower risk of a hard Brexit, Conservative Remainers might feel less compelled now to back the deal in a second vote. Ironically, Mrs May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chances could now lie in the hands of the Brexiteers. If they realise the game for a hard Brexit is up, they might prefer the deal to the other options of a softer Brexit or no Brexit at all. But this is a long shot. We cut the chances for Mrs May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s deal to 25% from 45%. We now see: a 20% chance that the UK will sign up to the EU customs union and single market for goods (up from 10%); a 20% chance that the UK will remain in the European Economic Area via entry into the European Free Trade Association (the Norway option, up from 12.5%); and a 25% chance that Brexit is reversed (up from 12.5%) 3) The oil price is suddenly slumping, as Opec ministers meet in Vienna today. City traders are losing confidence that Opec will agree a sharp output cut to prop up crude prices. This has sent Brent crude slumping by 5% to below $59 per barrel. Wall Street is heading for heavy losses in four hours time. The Dow Jones industrial average is currently expected to plunge by around 500 points, adding to its 800-point lurch on Tuesday (Wall Street was closed yesterday). Anxiety over Brexit is pushing shares down, compounding trade war fears, says Vincent-Fre\u00c4\u203ade\u00c4\u203aric Mivelaz of Swissquote Bank. Asian shares continue down, after Canadian authorities confirmed the arrest of Huawei Technologies\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 CFO Wanzhou Meng on charges of violating the USA\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sanctions on exports to Iran. Japan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Nikkei 225 dropped by 1.91% while Hong Kong\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Hang Seng and China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s CSI 300 declined 2.47% and 2.16%, their most in two weeks. European shares are also dropping, as the UK Parliament mutinies over the Prime Minister May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Brexit plan. The Euro Stoxx 600 has hit a 2-year low while Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s DAX and France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s CAC 40 slid 1.90% and 1.85%. Trade discussions between the USA and China officially started this week and are expected to continue for the coming 3 months. Investors are worried, especially about semiconductor manufacturers being hard hit. The FTSE 250 index, which contains smaller, UK-focused companies, is also taking a bath. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s currently on track for its biggest one-day fall since the rout after the EU referendum - currently down 460 points, or 2.5%, at 17809. This takes the FTSE 200 down to its lowest level since December 2016. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s turning into a rout in London. The FTSE 100 has now slumped by 176 points, or 2.5% -- on track for its worst daily performance since February! Although Meng Wanzhou\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s arrest is a shock, Huawei has been facing growing criticism for several years. The Financial Times points out that the US intelligence services have been concerned about the security implications of using Huawei\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hardware: Huawei has been in the sights of US security officials, and the latest move comes as the Trump administration takes an aggressive stance towards China. In a speech in October, Mike Pence, the US vice-president, put China on notice that Mr Trump was prepared to take a harder stance against Beijing than his predecessors. The Shenzhen-based group has long been a lightning rod for concern about corporate espionage and cyber security. Western intelligence officials worry that reliance on Huawei by other countries could allow China to penetrate foreign telecom networks. Huawei has repeatedly denied having any connection to the Chinese security services or military, insisting it is a privately owned company. But it has struggled to erase doubts because [founder] Mr Ren is a former People\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Liberation Army officer. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s security service also have concerns. On Monday the head of MI6 said ministers had to decide whether to use Huawei in Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new 5G networks. BT has already decided to removing Huawei equipment from key areas of its 4G network, as part of an infrastructure overhaul. Emerging economy stock markets are having a particularly bad week: Worries over global economic growth, rising interest rates and the US/China trade war are all driving markets down, says Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell. He agrees that the arrest of Huawei\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s CFO has alarmed investors, who fear it will \u00e2\u20ac\u0153stir up tensions between China and the US.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Nearly every share on the FTSE 100 is down -- apart from Imperial Brands, British American Tobacco, Diageo, Severn Trent and National Grid. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153All these are considered to be defensive stocks, offering goods and services people would buy regardless of economic conditions. Diageo is perhaps an exception as an alcohol seller yet investors often turn to large, robust business in times of strife. That may also explain why Unilever and Compass declined much less than the broader market. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The fallers were led by mining stocks which are always sensitive to any fears over the global economy and China. This chart shows how the FTSE 100 is back below its level at the end of the last millennium, just before the dot-com boom ended. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not the full story, of course, as this doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t show the dividends paid out in the last 18 years. But even then, the picture isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t sparkling - especially once you look in dollar terms: The selloff in London is gathering pace! The FTSE 100 has now shed 1.5%, or 110 points, leaving it firmly slumped at a two-year low. Most stocks are down, with financial stocks, miners and energy company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s losing the most. Industrial group Melrose is the biggest faller, with major mining companies such as Glencore and Antofagasta close behind. Stocks are down across Europe too. The Stoxx 600 index has hit a six-week low, dragged down by technology stocks and car makers (who would both suffer from a US-China war). The City is reeling from the fallout following the arrest of Huawei\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Meng Wanzhou, says Connor Campbell of SpreadEx: Jeez it has been an intense week for US-China relations. The post-G20 trade truce is starting to feel like a distant memory, with Tariff Man Donald Trump, and now the arrest of Huawei\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Meng Wanzhou, serving to undermine whatever (na\u00c3\u00afve) hopes of progress had built up on Monday. Wanzhou, global chief financial officer of telecoms equipment at the Shenzen-based smartphone firm and daughter of its founder, was detained in Canada last Saturday and is now facing extradition to the USA, relating to an investigation into whether or not she violated sanctions against Iran. Ouch! Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE 100 has fallen by over 80 points at the start of trading, a drop of 1.2%. That takes the blue-chip index of top shares in the City down to 6840 points, its lowest level in two years. The arrest of Huawei\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Meng Wanzhou has spooked traders, who are already unsettled by Brexit uncertainty, and the prospect that the global economy is slowing. Mike van Dulken of Accendo Markets writes: The latest bout of anxiety stems from the arrest and planned extradition from Canada to the US of the CFO (and founder\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Daughter) of Chinese telecom giant Huawei, on allegations of breaching Iran sanctions and suspicions of cyber-espionage. Having swung between optimism and scepticism about a US-China trade war truce through February, and we note Chinese diplomats making positive noise overnight (\u00e2\u20ac\u0153friendly and candid atmosphere\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd between Xi and Trump), traders are understandably cautious. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s losses also take the FTSE 100 below its level at the end of the last millennium! (when the FTSE 100 closed at 6,930 points). Huawei is insisting on Meng Wanzhou\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s release, insisting they aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t away of any misconduct: Technology stocks have been hit particularly hard in Asia today. In Hong Kong, Tencent was off more than 4%, while AAC and Sunny Optical each fell around 6%. South Korea\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Samsung Electronics shed 2%. Meng Wanzhou\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s arrest will probably exacerbate tensions between the US and China, my colleague Lily Kuo reports: US authorities have been investigating Huawei since at least 2016 for allegedly shipping US-origin products to Iran and other countries in violation of US export and sanctions laws, sources told Reuters in April. Huawei, one of the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest makers of telecommunications network equipment, said in a statement that Meng had been \u00e2\u20ac\u0153temporarily detained\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and faced unspecified allegations\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in the Eastern district of New York. The company said it had complied with \u00e2\u20ac\u0153all applicable laws and regulations where it operates,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd including sanction laws. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153There has been very little information provided to Huawei on the specific allegations. Huawei is not aware of any misconduct by Ms. Meng,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Guo Ping, rotating CEO of the company said in a statement posted on his Wechat account on Thursday. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The company believes the Canadian and US legal systems will ultimately reach a just conclusion,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. A chilly wave of fear is rippling through the markets today, after a leading Chinese executive was arrested in Canada. Meng Wanzhou, the global chief financial officer of telecoms equipment Huawei, is facing extradition to the US -- reportedly to face charges of violating sanctions against Iran. The arrest of Meng -- who\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also the daughter of Huawei\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s founder -- has rocked Asia-Pacific markets, and is likely to spark fresh jitters in Europe and the US. It threatens to reignite the trade war clashes between Washington and Beijing, just days after the two country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s leaders agreed a truce. The Chinese stock market has slumped by 2%, and there are heavy losses in Tokyo and Hong Kong too: Jasper Lawler of London Capital Group says sentiment has been \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcsmashed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 this morning. Asian markets and US futures plummeted overnight as news broke that Huawei\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s CFO had been arrested in Canada to be extradited back to the US. The CFO, Wanzhou Meng, was arrested for allegedly breaching Iran sanctions. China criticized the US and Canada for the arrest, demanding her immediate release. Traders have quickly moved out of riskier assets reflecting nerves that the arrest is likely to escalate tensions between the US and China once again. The timing is fascinating, incidentally. Meng was apparently arrested 1 December, the very day that Donald Trump and Xi Jinping were enjoying dinner together at the G20 meeting in Buenos Aires. Investors will fear that the shock detention of such a significant business figure could easily anger the Chinese government, and potentially scupper plans to buy more US goods. Also coming up today Oil ministers are gathering in Vienna for an Opec meeting, where the cartel is widely expected to agree a production cut. A chunky reduction to output might push oil prices higher....on the other hand, investors may already have priced it in! Brent crude is trading around $61 per barrel this morning, around 20% lower than two months ago. Donald Trump has already chipped in: Plus, we get new manufacturing and employment data from the US. The agenda 9am GMT: Opec meeting scheduled to begin 1.30pm GMT: US weekly jobless figures 3pm GMT: US factory orders",

                "bodyText":"And finally, Wall Street has closed a little higher, but with plenty of jitters around. The Dow gained 83 points, or 0.35%, to 23,675 -- only a small recovery from its 2% losses on Monday, and last Friday. Global growth worries, as reflected in the oil price\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s drop to a 15-month low, abounded. Investors are also edgy about what the US Federal Reserve will announce tomorrow, at its final policy meeting of the year. Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s latest blast towards the Fed has only intensified the pressure, as the central bank tries to normalise policy without choking off growth. A tricky task, with Wall Street suffering one of its worst December\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ever.... Goodnight! GW US treasury secretary Stephen Mnuchin has a theory -- the market turmoil is due to two factors -- high-frequency trading, and regulations brought in after the last financial crisis. Mnuchin singled out the Volcker Rule, which prevents banks from banks from taking risky bets with their own money, or pumping it into hedge funds. This, Mnuchin claims, is removing liquidity and making market moves more abrupt. He told Bloomberg: In my opinion, market structure has led to a lot more volatility. Part of this is a combination of the market presence of high-frequency traders combined with the Volcker Rule.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a theory... however, HFT and the Volcker Rule have both been around for years, so they can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be the only cause. Plus, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no secret that the White House want to roll back the Dodd-Frank rules (of which Volcker is part), despite concerns it could lead to more reckless behaviour. Get caught up on the markets: The US stock market is clinging onto its gains, with the S&amp;P 500 still up almost 1% today. Oil, though, continues to wallow at 15-month lows as traders anticipate weak demand in 2019. Stock market analyst Ronnie Chopra suspects that some UK companies are now vulnerable to a takeover bid, following recent stock market losses.... Newsflash: Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s blue-chip stock index has just hit its lowest closing level in over two years. Amid worries over the global economy, and Brexit, the FTSE 100 has closed 71 points lower at 6701. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s its lowest closing level since November 2016 (although it fell below 6700 earlier this month in intraday trading). National Grid is the biggest faller, down 9%, after energy regulator Ofgem announced a shake-up that could cut bills. Energy firms BP and Royal Dutch Shell are also among the big fallers, tracking the slump in the oil price today. Technology, healthcare, and telecoms firms also had a bad day, while consumer-focused stocks also lost ground. European stock markets also fell today; the Stoxx 600 lost 0.6% as investors worry that the global economy is weakening. The Brent crude oil price has also slumped to its lowest level in over a year. Brent, sourced from the North Sea, is down almost 4% at $57.28, the lowest since October 2018. Despite today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s small recovery, this month is turning into one of the worst December\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s in Wall Street\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s history. Indeed, Reuters has calculated that it could be the worst December since the Great Depression.... Global growth fears are sending the oil price sliding again. US crude has dropped below $48 per barrel for the first time since mid-September, 2017, extending recent losses. That indicates traders believe excessive supply, and lacklustre growth, will keep crude prices down in 2019. Back in London, the FTSE 100 is falling close to a two-year low. The blue-chip index is now down 52 points, or 0.75%, at 6,721. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s less than 20 points away from the 25-month low struck earlier this month. Although Wall Street is still up, a 1% rise isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t anything to shout about - given the Dow lost 2% on both Friday and Monday. David Madden of CMC Markets thinks the rally lacks conviction, despite the welcome pick-up in US house-building reported today. Equity markets have bounced back today, but the upward move hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t been driven by anything, and that is a little worrying, as it might just be a mixture of short covering and bargain hunting. The severe sell-off that was endured yesterday is still fresh in traders\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 minds, and there is a sense that dealers want to get tomorrows Fed announcement out of the way, before formulating their next move. For a change, there was some upbeat housing data from the US. Building permits ticked up to 1.32 million in November, which topped the forecast of 1.25 million. Keep in mind, the October reading was 1.26 million. The housing starts reading was 1.25 million, which was an improvement on the 1.21 million in October. Admittedly, these figure weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t amazing, but they are a bright spot on a largely bleak housing figures. The Wall Street rally is being led by consumer-focused companies including Nike (+2.4%), and Visa (+1%). Industrial firms such as Boeing (+3.75%) and General Electric (+3.6%) are also up, as are financial stocks such as JP Morgan (+1.8%). The dollar, meanwhile, is dipping as investors brace for the Federal Reserve meeting tomorrow night. Fawad Razaqzada of FXTM explains: The greenback has been undermined by growing speculation that, at best, the Federal Reserve will deliver a dovish rate hike, while there is a possibility \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a small possibility, but a possibility nonetheless \u00e2\u20ac\u201c that it could even hold off hiking altogether. Most sectors of the US stock market are up, as traders try to shake off the pessimism gripping the markets. Bank share are rallying, after several tough weeks. But still, the overall picture is gloomy: Ding Ding! Wall Street is open, and shares are trying to recover after yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rout. The Dow Jones industrial average has gained 197 points at the open, or 0.85%. The broader S&amp;P 500 has gained 0.75%, after hitting a 14-month low yesterday. The Nasdaq index, focused on tech stocks, has gained almost 1%. Economist Ian Shepherdson makes a good point about the US housing stats: Just in: Home construction in America accelerated last month, in a sign that the economy can handle higher interest rates (whatever Donald Trump tweets). New housing starts jumped by 3.2% last month to an annual rate of 1.256 million, the Commerce Department says. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a seven-month high. The number of permits handed out for future housing projects also rose, up 5% compared with October. However... construction of single-family homes dropped to an 18-month low; the rise in housing starts was mainly due to more multi-family housing projects. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s some snap reaction: Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s CNBC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s take: Investors are fleeing stocks and buying bonds in record numbers amid the global sell-off in equities, according to a December survey of fund managers released on Tuesday. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Investors are approaching extreme bearishness ... this month\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s survey [found] the biggest ever one-month rotation into the asset class\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd of bonds, Bank of America Merrill Lynch said in the survey. The research report is one of the most widely-followed surveys of investors on Wall Street. Phew! After two days of serious losses, Wall Street is expected to rally when trading begins in 80 minutes time. The Dow is predicted to rise by over 200 points, having shed more than 500 on Monday. The Financial Times (PAYWALL) is concerned by BAML\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s survey of investor confidence, showing they are the gloomiest since 2008. Their Adam Samson writes: Investors have made the largest-ever shift into bonds this month, according to a widely-watched survey that also showed bets on global equities falling to the lowest in two years as concern over the economic outlook increases. Global investors\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 net underweight position in bonds tumbled 23 percentage points in December to 35%, according to data released on Tuesday by Bank of America Merrill Lynch. It was the biggest change in the history of the survey and brings the underweight position to the lowest level since the Brexit vote in June 2016. BAML\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Michael Hartnett is also anxious, saying: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Investors are close to extreme bearishness.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Newsflash: Donald Trump has launched another broadside at the Federal Reserve, as America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s central bank begins its two-day policy meeting. Once again, Trump is urging the Fed not to raise interest rates on Wednesday. He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also unhappy about its \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcquantitative tightening\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 programme, which is currently taking $50bn out of the economy each month as the Fed unwinds its stimulus. Aviva Investors are also gloomy. Michael Grady, their chief economist, has predict that risk assets will give weaker returns in 2019, as global growth moderates. He writes: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153In a slowing growth environment, investors tend to focus more on downside risks. Although the economic backdrop continues to provide a basis for positive returns for risk assets, expectations of more moderate growth and tighter global liquidity, and the impact of those risks, justify more restrained positioning. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We prefer to be overweight in US and emerging market equities because of the expected relative growth outperformance. Valuations in Europe look more attractive in some areas, but downside risks such as Brexit and the Italian budget continue to weigh on the outlook. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We are moderately underweight government bonds as yields will continue to move higher on expectations that central banks will tighten policy in 2019. With spreads relatively tight by historical standards, we have a bigger underweight with regard to credit, including duration. Our preference is for European over US high yield due to its lower leverage and reduced sensitivity to oil prices. We have a slight preference for being long US dollars, with the main underweight against Australia on domestic challenges and Chinese growth risks.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Sound the alarm bells! Global investors are their gloomiest since the financial crisis, according to a new survey from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. BAML\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s monthly check on investor sentiment shows that 53% expect global growth to weaken over the next 12 months. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the worst outlook for the global economy since October 2008 (when the wheels were coming off the financial system). The survey shows that investors have been piling into the US dollar, and into bonds, rather than crowding into tech stocks. BAML also found that investors are shunning UK stocks. A net 39% of investors are \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcunderweight\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 on the UK, as they try to protect themselves from Brexit. Given the recent selloff, are stocks now actually cheap? Or just low, and heading lower? The City\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s finest minds are wrestling with this question as 2019 approaches. On some measures, shares are offering plenty of value, as this charts shows: The FTSE 100, for example, has lost 12% in 2018, meaning that many stocks are yielding more than a year ago (unless they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve slashed their dividend, or are going to...) Major US companies like Amazon, Apple and Facebook are offering better value than three months ago, having fallen by around 20% since September. But... that sort of thinking is scrambled, if the world economy is really cooling -- and today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s IFO data doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t do much for confidence. Back in January, investors were being criticised for holding onto cash..... but it doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t look such a bad call now. Financial experts are concerned that German business morale has fallen again this month, according to the IFO thinktank. IFO president Clemens Fuest says Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy appears to be cooling, with most industries sending \u00e2\u20ac\u0153bad signals\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd about their prospects (sending its business expectations measure to a 25-month low). Fuest told Bloomberg TV that: We think it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a permanent slowdown. Not a downturn, we still expect growth next year. Teis Knuthsen, CFI at Kirk Kapital (managing the wealth of descendants of the creator of Lego), fears that Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t rebound from its summer contraction. Joumanna Bercetche of CNBC is also concerned: Just in: German business morale has fallen, in another sign that Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest economy is struggling. IFO, the Munich-based thinktank, says its business climate index has dropped to just 101.0 this month, down from 102 in November. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s weaker than expected, and the fourth decline in a row. IFO\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s business expectations measure slumped to just 97.3, from 98.7. That may indicate that growth will be subdued in 2019. Last night\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Wall Street rout dragged even more US companies into \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcbear market territory\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 - more than 20% off their all-time high. Companies suffering this grizzly fate include tech giants such as Apple, Amazon, IBM, Netflix and Facebook, as this chart from Marketwatch shows. More here. Kit Juckes of Soci\u00c3\u00a9t\u00c3\u00a9 G\u00c3\u00a9n\u00c3\u00a9rale also blames president Xi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s speech for today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s gloom: There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s snow on the ground and gluhwein everywhere but the Christmas spirit is absent in financial markets. After a miserable afternoon for US equities, this morning actually started in a bright mood on the other side of the world, before President Xi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s lack of any encouragement for expectations of further reform gave markets the jitters. No white beard, no sleigh, not much bowing to external pressure\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no Christmas cheer in the markets today, says Hussein Sayed, chief market strategist at FXTM: December 2018 has so far been one of the ugliest Decembers in U.S. stock market history. The S&amp;P 500 declined 7.8% in 10 trading days and experienced the worst two-day selloff since October. Cheaper valuations, the U.S.-China trade truce, and dovish Fed commentary were not enough to put an end to falling stock markets. Santa Clause seems to have lost his way this year, defying hopes that stocks will rally towards the year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s end. Instead, institutional investors appear to be pulling out, taking whatever profits they have accumulated throughout this year. Splat! European stock markets have fallen in unison at the start of trading. Traders are taking their cue from Wall Street; last night\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s selloff continues to reverberate around the markets. The FTSE 100 is down 52 points, or 0.7%. David Madden of CMC Markets says growth concerns are \u00e2\u20ac\u0153festering\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. US stocks sold-off yesterday as dealers were concerned about the world economy, and there is also a fear the Federal Reserve are tightening their monetary policy too fast. The S&amp;P 500 fell to a new 2018 low, while the Russell 2000 entered a bear market. Asian equity markets sold-off overnight on the back of the negative move on Wall Street. Growth fears are also weighing on the oil price today. Brent crude has dropped by almost 2% this morning, to $58.51 per barrel. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s near November\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 14-month low. China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s president has disappointed the markets today. Xi Jinging launched a robust attack on other nations who demand Chines policy changes (yes you, America), in a high-profile speech marking 40 years of economic reform. Xi declared: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153No one is in a position to dictate to the Chinese people what should or should not be done. We must resolutely reform what should and can be changed, we must resolutely not reform what shouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t and can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be changed.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd However, he didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t match this tough talk with any firm details of new reforms to stimulate China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy, or open it up to competition. My colleague Lily Yuo explains: Xi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s speech comes as the Chinese leadership is facing criticism over slowing growth and confrontation with the US. Observers hoped his speech would lay out new directions or reforms needed to help the Chinese economy, weighed down by debt and lagging consumption, and an overly dominant state sector. Instead, Xi stressed that the Party\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s leadership and strategy up to now have been \u00e2\u20ac\u0153absolutely correct.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd He promised to support the state sector while continuing reforms in appropriate areas. His remarks lacked any detail about new policies and failed to inspire confidence in Asian markets. Hong Kong and Shanghai both dropped sharply during the speech. They are now off 1% for the day while losses have deepened to 1.8% in Tokyo and more than 1% in Sydney. More here: Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcTis the season to be jolly nervous! Global stock markets are being buffeted by worries over global growth and trade wars, while in the UK Brexit fears are causing serious angst in the retail sector. Last night, the US stock markets suffered yet another bruising selloff. The Dow Jones industrial average shed 507 points, or 2%, while the S&amp;P 500 lurched to a 14-month low. Wall Street has now suffered the worst start to a December since 1980. Markets in Asia-Pacific have followed suit, with Japan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Nikkei slumping by 1.8% and Australia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s S&amp;P/ASX 200 down 1.2%. Europe is also heading for a chilly bath at the open. The FTSE 100 is being called down 50 points, adding to yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 70-points slide, taking the Footsie close to last week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s two-year low. Investors seem to be badly worried that the world economy is slowing, and that China and the US won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t resolve their trade dispute. But the number 1 issue is whether America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Federal Reserve raises interest rates tomorrow night, and how hawkish or dovish it sounds about next year. US president Donald Trump piled even more pressure on the Fed on Monday, arguing it would be madness to raise interest rates. However, the Fed may feel that not hiking would cause more turmoil than hiking -- as the markets are expecting borrowing costs to go up again. Jasper Lawler of London Capital Group explains: The market\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s overriding fear is that the Fed will press ahead with plans to raise interest rates, which could be too much for the US economy to handle. An indication from the Fed that they will slow their pace of hikes could calm these jittery markets. However, until the Fed have confirmed that as a course of action, investors will remain skittish. The volatility index, also known as the fear gauge lifted 2.27 points to a seven-week high. The markets remain anxious about China too, following data last week showing that Chinese retail sales growth has hit a 15-year low, as industrial output growth softens. UK retailers, meanwhile, will be desperately hoping that shoppers come out in force this week. The sector has been rocked by yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s profit warning from online clothing group Asos, after a slump in trading in November.

This isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t going to end in a quick fashion.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The latest fall in US markets comes as Donald Trump is threatening a government shutdown unless Congress agrees to fund his border wall with Mexico. Trump has appeared to back away from a shutdown but is now indicating he will not sign off on a stopgap budget unless there is funding for the wall. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153At this moment, the president does not want to go further without border security, which includes steel slats or a wall,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd the White House press secretary, Sarah Sanders, said. Trump \u00e2\u20ac\u0153is continuing to weigh his options\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, she added. Disappointing earnings reports added to the US sell-off. Shares of Walgreens Boots Alliance dropped 3.55% as the drugstore chain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s same-store sales missed estimates. Conagra Brands tumbled 11.33%, the most on the S&amp;P, after the packaged foods maker missed sales estimates on delayed shipments and weak demand. Accenture fell 4.3% as its full-year revenue and profit outlook were largely below estimates.",

Its chairman, <strong>Keith Cochrane</strong>, chief executive, <strong>Richard Howson</strong><strong>,</strong> and former finance directors <strong>Zaf</strong><strong>ar Khan</strong> and <strong>Emma Mercer</strong> were eventually <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/feb/06/carillion-director-mp-executives-collapse\">branded \u00e2\u20ac\u0153delusional\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd by MPs</a> as the full extent of the failings at the company became clear in bruising hearings. The bankruptcy is estimated to have cost the taxpayer \u00c2\u00a3150m.</p> <p>\u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 <strong>Julian Dunkerton</strong>, the founder of Superdry, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/jan/29/superdry-founder-brexit-profits-julian-dunkerton\">cashed out \u00c2\u00a318m in shares</a> of the fashion retailer shortly before he quit the brand he started in 2003. Those shares are worth about one-quarter of that now, after a torrid year for British retailers, affected by shoppers moving online, Brexit uncertainty and unseasonable weather. The sale might have been good timing \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 but the value of his remaining 18% stake has since been hammered and is down more than \u00c2\u00a3230m. The former boss \u00e2\u20ac\u201c who quit the company in March \u00e2\u20ac\u201c is not happy. Dunkerton reckons he could do a better job than its chief executive, Euan Sutherland, and has launched a comeback campaign.</p> <p>\u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 <strong>Bruce Ritchie</strong>, a Mayfair property developer who founded Residential Land, and <strong>David Meller</strong>, from the luxury good specialist Meller Group, are now better known as the men behind the Presidents Club.

In February, the committee <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/feb/20/mps-publish-full-unredacted-report-into-rbs-small-business-scandal\">made public a confidential report</a> by the Financial Conduct Authority into misconduct at Royal Bank of Scotland\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s global restructuring group.</p> <h2>March</h2> <p>\u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 <strong>Michael Spencer</strong>, the City financier and former Conservative party treasurer, netted \u00c2\u00a3670m when the company he founded, Nex Group, was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/mar/29/michael-spencer-nex-takeover-cme-group\">bought by CME Group</a>, the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest exchange.</p> <p>\u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 <strong>Barbara Judge</strong> was chairwoman of the Institute of Directors and known as the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/mar/08/barbara-judge-profile-the-best-connected-woman-in-britain\">best-connected woman in Britain</a> until March. She had prestigious roles before becoming the IoD\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s first female head, but this ended in ignominy after allegations of racism and bullying within the organisation, which focuses on promoting good corporate governance.</p> <h2>April</h2> <p>\u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 <strong>Mike Coupe</strong>, the chief executive of Sainsbury\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s, shocked the retail world when the FTSE 100 company and its Walmart-owned rival Asda announced plans for a merger to create the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest supermarket. Coupe was then filmed, ahead of an interview on ITV, singing <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/apr/30/sainsburys-mike-coupe-sings-were-in-the-money-itv-asda-merger\">\u00e2\u20ac\u0153</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/apr/30/sainsburys-mike-coupe-sings-were-in-the-money-itv-asda-merger\">We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re in the </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/apr/30/sainsburys-mike-coupe-sings-were-in-the-money-itv-asda-merger\">money\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd</a>. The deal and his song, Sainsbury\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s insisted, were unconnected.</p> <p>\u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 <strong>Jeff Fairburn</strong>, a former chief executive of Persimmon, was handed a pay packet that was more like a lottery win, with a \u00c2\u00a3110m bonus after the housebuilder\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s profits were pumped up, in part by the government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s help-to-buy subsidy. In April, despite widespread outrage, investors <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/apr/25/persimmon-investors-revolt-bonus-pay-vote\">voted 51% to approve it</a> . Persimmon eventually cut Fairburn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bonus to \u00c2\u00a375m and he promised to set up a charitable foundation. Fairburn finally lost his job in November after a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/nov/07/persimmon-boss-asked-to-leave-amid-ongoing-outrage-over-bonus\">disastrous local TV interview</a>, but he keeps the money \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and there is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/dec/21/persimmons-former-ceo-jeff-fairburn-fails-to-set-up-charity-after-pledging-portion-of-75-million-bonus\">still no sign</a> of that charitable foundation.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a5023dcd0074dd223a191fc56f7fc0c0d65fa08b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a5023dcd0074dd223a191fc56f7fc0c0d65fa08b/0_978_4480_2688/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Liv Garfield, chief executive officer of Severn Trent.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Liv Garfield, the chief executive of Severn Trent.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bloomberg/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>May</h2> <p>\u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 <strong>Liv Garfield</strong>, the chief executive of Severn Trent and the FTSE 100\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s youngest female boss at 43, picked up Veuve \u00c2\u00adClicquot\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s prestigious Business Woman of the Year award. Garfield\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rapid ascent started at BT and she joined the water utility in 2014. But her biggest challenge could lie ahead: if Labour wins the next election, the water companies are top of John McDonnell\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/sep/24/john-mcdonnell-targets-water-bosses-in-renationalisation-plan\">list for nationalisation</a>.</p> <p>\u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 As chief executive of TSB, <strong>Paul Pester</strong> had big plans to make the high-street challenger a real force in British banking. But then came a massive computer glitch, which resulted in millions of customers being locked out of their bank accounts, some for several weeks. Pester did not react well to questioning by MPs, and was forced to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/may/02/tsb-hires-law-firm-slaughter-and-may-to-investigate-it-chaos\">forfeit his bonus</a> in May. By September he was an ex-chief executive. </p> <h2>June</h2> <p>\u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 <strong>Sir Martin Sorrell</strong>, the former chief executive of WPP, had quite a year. He <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/apr/14/martin-sorrell-steps-down-as-head-of-wpp-advertising-agency\">resigned abruptly in April</a> from the company he transformed from a wire shopping basket manufacturer into a global marketing and advertising group. His departure came after allegations of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153personal misconduct\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, which he denied. In June came allegations that he had been spotted by colleagues entering premises in Mayfair <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2018/jun/12/the-allegations-against-wpps-former-chief-martin-sorrell-pile-up\">used by sex workers</a>. An investigation found there was no proof of misuse of company money and Sorrell, 73, has since bounced back with a new advertising company.</p> <p>\u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 <strong>Richard Branson</strong>, the billionaire owner of the Virgin empire, enjoyed a healthy bump in his already considerable wealth in June as CYBG, the owner of the Clydesdale and Yorkshire Bank brands, swooped for Virgin Money in a \u00c2\u00a31.7bn deal to create the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/jun/18/virgin-money-bought-clydesdale-bank-cybg\">UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sixth-largest lender</a>. Branson owned a 35% stake, and will continue to earn licensing revenues as the Virgin brand is extended across the UK.</p> <h2>July</h2> <p>\u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 <strong>Jeff Bezos</strong>, the founder and chief executive of Amazon, became the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/jul/27/amazon-founder-jeff-bezos-worlds-richest-man-bill-gates\">world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s richest person</a> as a result of rising technology share prices. By September, the company was worth $1tn (\u00c2\u00a3790bn) and Bezos was worth more than $160bn. Since then, tech stocks have fallen sharply.</p> <p>\u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 <strong>Sundar Pichai</strong>, Google\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chief executive, has had a tough year at the helm of the company whose motto used to be \u00e2\u20ac\u0153don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be evil\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd.

Since then, there have been internal sexual harassment protests and a row over plans to produce a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/dec/11/google-ceo-sundar-pichai-congress\">censored search engine</a> for China.</p> <h2>August</h2> <p>\u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 <strong>Tim Cook</strong>, the chief executive of Apple, will for ever be the man who led the first listed company to a valuation of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/aug/02/apple-becomes-worlds-first-trillion-dollar-company\">more than $1tn</a>.

In October, the US Securities and Exchange Commission forced him to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/sep/29/elon-musk-tesla-40m-sec-case-tweets\">resign the role of chairman</a> (though not chief executive) and fined the billionaire $20m.

Murdoch is also in the process of a separate $71.3bn <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/jun/20/disney-raises-offer-for-21st-century-fox-to-713bn-and-outflanks-comcast\">sale of Fox to Disney</a>.

                "bodyText":"January \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Days into 2018, the government outsourcing and construction business Carillion collapsed into bankruptcy. Its chairman, Keith Cochrane, chief executive, Richard Howson, and former finance directors Zafar Khan and Emma Mercer were eventually branded \u00e2\u20ac\u0153delusional\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd by MPs as the full extent of the failings at the company became clear in bruising hearings. The bankruptcy is estimated to have cost the taxpayer \u00c2\u00a3150m. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Julian Dunkerton, the founder of Superdry, cashed out \u00c2\u00a318m in shares of the fashion retailer shortly before he quit the brand he started in 2003. Those shares are worth about one-quarter of that now, after a torrid year for British retailers, affected by shoppers moving online, Brexit uncertainty and unseasonable weather. The sale might have been good timing \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 but the value of his remaining 18% stake has since been hammered and is down more than \u00c2\u00a3230m. The former boss \u00e2\u20ac\u201c who quit the company in March \u00e2\u20ac\u201c is not happy. Dunkerton reckons he could do a better job than its chief executive, Euan Sutherland, and has launched a comeback campaign. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Bruce Ritchie, a Mayfair property developer who founded Residential Land, and David Meller, from the luxury good specialist Meller Group, are now better known as the men behind the Presidents Club. The all-male event was shut down after the Financial Times revealed alleged sexual harassment at a black-tie dinner, and shone a light on sexism in the City. Meller was forced to resign from the board of the Department for Education in the aftermath. February \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 The Conservative MP Nicky Morgan has set about chairing the Treasury select committee in the same spirit as her predecessors, holding the government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s feet to the fire on Brexit and keeping the financial sector on its toes. In February, the committee made public a confidential report by the Financial Conduct Authority into misconduct at Royal Bank of Scotland\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s global restructuring group. March \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Michael Spencer, the City financier and former Conservative party treasurer, netted \u00c2\u00a3670m when the company he founded, Nex Group, was bought by CME Group, the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest exchange. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Barbara Judge was chairwoman of the Institute of Directors and known as the best-connected woman in Britain until March. She had prestigious roles before becoming the IoD\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s first female head, but this ended in ignominy after allegations of racism and bullying within the organisation, which focuses on promoting good corporate governance. April \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Mike Coupe, the chief executive of Sainsbury\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s, shocked the retail world when the FTSE 100 company and its Walmart-owned rival Asda announced plans for a merger to create the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest supermarket. Coupe was then filmed, ahead of an interview on ITV, singing \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re in the money\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. The deal and his song, Sainsbury\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s insisted, were unconnected. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Jeff Fairburn, a former chief executive of Persimmon, was handed a pay packet that was more like a lottery win, with a \u00c2\u00a3110m bonus after the housebuilder\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s profits were pumped up, in part by the government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s help-to-buy subsidy. In April, despite widespread outrage, investors voted 51% to approve it . Persimmon eventually cut Fairburn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bonus to \u00c2\u00a375m and he promised to set up a charitable foundation. Fairburn finally lost his job in November after a disastrous local TV interview, but he keeps the money \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and there is still no sign of that charitable foundation. May \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Liv Garfield, the chief executive of Severn Trent and the FTSE 100\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s youngest female boss at 43, picked up Veuve Clicquot\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s prestigious Business Woman of the Year award. Garfield\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rapid ascent started at BT and she joined the water utility in 2014. But her biggest challenge could lie ahead: if Labour wins the next election, the water companies are top of John McDonnell\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s list for nationalisation. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 As chief executive of TSB, Paul Pester had big plans to make the high-street challenger a real force in British banking. But then came a massive computer glitch, which resulted in millions of customers being locked out of their bank accounts, some for several weeks. Pester did not react well to questioning by MPs, and was forced to forfeit his bonus in May. By September he was an ex-chief executive. June \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Sir Martin Sorrell, the former chief executive of WPP, had quite a year. He resigned abruptly in April from the company he transformed from a wire shopping basket manufacturer into a global marketing and advertising group. His departure came after allegations of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153personal misconduct\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, which he denied. In June came allegations that he had been spotted by colleagues entering premises in Mayfair used by sex workers. An investigation found there was no proof of misuse of company money and Sorrell, 73, has since bounced back with a new advertising company. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Richard Branson, the billionaire owner of the Virgin empire, enjoyed a healthy bump in his already considerable wealth in June as CYBG, the owner of the Clydesdale and Yorkshire Bank brands, swooped for Virgin Money in a \u00c2\u00a31.7bn deal to create the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sixth-largest lender. Branson owned a 35% stake, and will continue to earn licensing revenues as the Virgin brand is extended across the UK. July \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Jeff Bezos, the founder and chief executive of Amazon, became the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s richest person as a result of rising technology share prices. By September, the company was worth $1tn (\u00c2\u00a3790bn) and Bezos was worth more than $160bn. Since then, tech stocks have fallen sharply. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Sundar Pichai, Google\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chief executive, has had a tough year at the helm of the company whose motto used to be \u00e2\u20ac\u0153don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be evil\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. In July, Pichai had to contend with a \u00c2\u00a33.8bn fine and dressing down from the European commission after competition concerns on its Android operating system. Since then, there have been internal sexual harassment protests and a row over plans to produce a censored search engine for China. August \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Tim Cook, the chief executive of Apple, will for ever be the man who led the first listed company to a valuation of more than $1tn. However, the trillion-dollar landmark did not last long amid a deep market sell-off in October and concerns that iPhone sales growth was waning \u00e2\u20ac\u201c with particular attention on the troublesome Chinese market. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Elon Musk, the founder of Tesla, is hailed by many as a visionary, but even visionaries have to abide by market abuse rules. So when he tweeted in August \u00e2\u20ac\u201c reportedly while driving himself to work \u00e2\u20ac\u201c that he had \u00e2\u20ac\u0153funding secured\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd for a private buyout of the electric carmaker, an immediate investigation was launched. In October, the US Securities and Exchange Commission forced him to resign the role of chairman (though not chief executive) and fined the billionaire $20m. It was not Musk\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s only controversial moment this year \u00e2\u20ac\u201c he also called a British cave diver trying to rescue trapped Thai boys a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153pedo\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd (prompting a defamation lawsuit) and was pictured smoking marijuana while recording a podcast. September \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Rupert Murdoch, the billionaire owner of News Corporation, may have failed in his aim to take over the broadcaster Sky, but the \u00c2\u00a312bn payday for 21st Century Fox when it sold shares will probably sweeten the pill. Murdoch is also in the process of a separate $71.3bn sale of Fox to Disney. Comcast ended up paying \u00c2\u00a330bn for Sky, significantly more than the \u00c2\u00a318bn bid made by Fox in December 2016. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Dara Khosrowshahi, the chief executive of Uber, has tried to take a different path from its founder, Travis Kalanick, and his abrasive manner since taking over in August 2017. However, changing the ride-hailing company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s culture has proved to be no easy feat: Khosrowshahi was forced to apologise for the app\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s mistakes in London in September, a year after Transport for London moved to remove its licence in the capital. October \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 The former deputy prime minister Nick Clegg once said he was not very impressed by Facebook. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m not especially bedazzled by Facebook,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he wrote in 2016. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I actually find the messianic, Californian new-worldy, touchy-feely culture of Facebook a little grating.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd But then he lost his parliamentary seat and his career trajectory started to head south \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and took a new job in the US as global head of communications at Facebook. One of his top priorities will be to avoid a regulatory showdown with Brussels at a time when Facebook\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s policies and behaviour are under scrutiny, not least after Sheryl Sandberg was accused of condoning a smear campaign against the financier George Soros. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Sir Philip Green, the owner of Topshop\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s parent company, Arcadia, is no stranger to controversy, but this autumn he was named in parliament as the man behind multiple non-disclosure agreements. The NDAs still hold, but Green has denied \u00e2\u20ac\u0153unlawful sexual or racist behaviour\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. November \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Denise Coates, the chief executive of Bet365, is the best-paid woman in Stoke, and the rest of the world, for that matter. Coates turned her father\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bookmaker into one of the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest online gambling businesses. Her record \u00c2\u00a3265m annual pay packet provoked criticism, but it is a private, family owned company and she controls it. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Carlos Ghosn, the chief executive of Renault, apparently had little idea that he was about to be arrested and detained when he arrived in Tokyo in November. The Lebanese-Brazilian executive, who forged an alliance between France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Renault and Japan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Nissan and Mitsubishi, was shopped by Nissan for allegedly underreporting his income. The Japanese carmakers quickly ousted him from their boards, leaving the alliance \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and Ghosn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s freedom \u00e2\u20ac\u201c in the balance. December \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Ray Kelvin was probably the biggest name in retail no one had heard of \u00e2\u20ac\u201c until 300 former and current employees of his Ted Baker fashion business signed a petition on the campaigning website Organise complaining about his behaviour, including \u00e2\u20ac\u0153forced hugs\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and ear kissing. The company said Kelvin\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hugs were \u00e2\u20ac\u0153part of Ted Baker\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s culture, but are absolutely not insisted upon\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. But then details of an office brawl emerged \u00e2\u20ac\u201c which had earned Kelvin a formal warning \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and \u00e2\u20ac\u0153further serious allegations\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd eventually prompted the rag trade multimillionaire to take a leave of absence while an independent investigation is carried out. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 It has not been such a great year for Nick Robertson, the co-founder of Asos. He has watched the value of his stake in the online fashion retailer fall by about 70% \u00e2\u20ac\u201c or \u00c2\u00a3275m \u00e2\u20ac\u201c between its peak in March and the aftermath of a shock profit warning in December. The British retail sector laboured during 2018, but analysts were taken aback by declining margins online at a time when most eyes were on the travails of the high street.",

                "bodyText":"This year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s awards were judged in the humble Observer offices, despite a temptation to hold a gala dinner at London\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dorchester hotel on the date previously occupied by the now disgraced Presidents Club charity event. The Observer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s only hat-tip to the defunct fundraiser, where men were the only guests and waitresses were forced to wear tight cocktail dresses, was that participants were permitted to sport a few skimpy little black numbers of their own \u00e2\u20ac\u201c although they related solely to profit figures of nominated retailers. So, without further ado \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 The Fred Goodwin cup for the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s most despised businessman This ended up as a straight shootout between two famous retailers. First was Sir Philip Green, who was looking to add another victory in this category, having trashed his own image in previous years with his actions leading to the demise of BHS. His 2018 entry concerned his alleged involvement in a #MeToo scandal. Green \u00e2\u20ac\u0153categorically and wholly denies\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd any suggestion that he was guilty of unlawful behaviour regarding the allegations, all the judges noted. Second on the list was Ray Kelvin, the founder and boss of the fashion brand Ted Baker, who is in similar trouble regarding his alleged fondness for forced hugging as a form of corporate bonding. The judges were split and the pair are being forced to share a hug \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and the gong. His and hers matching pewter money clips for gender equality So with the old sexist business hierarchy finally looking like it might crumble, what the world of commerce needed was someone to show just how much better it would be if women were in charge. You know, a person to prove the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Lehman Brothers wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have happened if it was Lehman Sisters\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd type narrative. Sadly, the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s most famous female corporate executive during 2018 was Sheryl Sandberg, who as chief operating officer of Facebook is in day-to-day charge of a company that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s invaded more personal space than Ray Kelvin at a Halloween party. Still, her plan to turn around a difficult year for Facebook \u00e2\u20ac\u201c by hiring, er, the former deputy prime minister Sir Nick Clegg \u00e2\u20ac\u201c did at least show there are no insurmountable barriers to rising to the pinnacle of business. So Sandberg got the nod from the judges. The Blankety Blank chequebook and pen for corporate excess Despite a late run from Bet365\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Denise Coates (total pay of \u00c2\u00a3265m last year, but it is her company), there could only be one winner. Jeff Fairburn, the former boss of housebuilder Persimmon, will now be forever remembered for not only trousering a \u00c2\u00a375m bonus, but also being so clueless about how he might attempt to defend it that he terminated a local television interview when quizzed on the topic. All of which rather suggests that Fairburn was both (a) outrageously overpaid and (b) has no sense of humour. The stainless steel cake slice for humble pie One person who cannot be described as lacking a sense of humour is Luke Johnson, the entrepreneur-cum-business guru. His newspaper columns telling other people how to run their businesses have always seemed preachy, but this year he revealed them to be a rather good pre-emptive joke about his own business shortcomings, after a crisis at his cafe and cakes business Patisserie Valerie.

Johnson ended up having to stump up \u00c2\u00a320m of his own fortune to plug a black hole he had managed to miss while penning advice to fans about how to spot them.

But this year the committee thought there was a standout winner \u00e2\u20ac\u201c who not only missed an impending catastrophe he was paid to spot but did so while so many in the financial industry saw it coming. Philip Green \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the other one, former chairman of the now bust construction and outsourcing group Carillion \u00e2\u20ac\u201c appeared oblivious to what was happening to the company, despite the City openly betting that its shares would crash.

My central expectation \u00e2\u20ac\u201c amidst a range of possible outcomes \u00e2\u20ac\u201c is that an extension to Article 50 will be requested to allow time for a second referendum as Parliament fails to coalesce around any outcome to deliver Brexit and instead abdicates its responsibility back to the people clothed in the claims that this presents the most democratic resolution of the issues. This will then likely lead to a vote to Remain, likely followed by a General Election.</p> <p>\u00e2\u20ac\u0153If that happens I believe the markets will continue to be volatile in early 2019 but will rally on the prospect of no Brexit.

It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s actually been a pretty poor year for markets globally though; Europe, Japan and Emerging Markets are all sharply down on the beginning of the year, and while the US has held up better, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s still in negative territory, and has witnessed a pretty dramatic fall in the last three months.We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re unlikely to see the gloom lift in January. Brexit looks set to reach a parliamentary crescendo, and a swathe of trading updates from the UK high street isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t likely to lighten the mood.</p> <p> Despite the negative sentiment, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s unwise to bet on the direction of the stock market in the short term, as it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s prone to defy expectations, sometimes for the better, sometimes for the worse. The appeal of putting long term savings to work in the stock market still remains, though investors who are concerned about its immediate prospects should consider drip-feeding money in gradually, to take advantage of any dips.\u00e2\u20ac\u2122</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5c2a36fde4b02fb91ff0bf6c\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-12-31T15:40:45.302Z\">3.40pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Over in New York, investors are attempting to inject some New Year jollity into proceedings.</strong></p> <p>The Dow Jones industrial average is up around 0.6%, or 150 points, at 23212 points, as Wall Street\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s worst December since 1931 heads towards the exit.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5c2a330ce4b02fb91ff0bf3f\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/richard-partington\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-12-31T15:22:30.939Z\">3.22pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2018/dec/31/markets-2018-worst-year-ftse-100-china-business-live?page=with:block-5c2a0dede4b02fb91ff0be0e#block-5c2a0dede4b02fb91ff0be0e\">After 2018\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s losses</a>, what might next year have in store for investors, and everyone else?</strong></p> <p>Andrew Milligan, Head of Global Strategy at Aberdeen Standard Investments, believes 2019 will be a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153middling year from an economic point of view\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd.</p> <p>He told us:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\u00e2\u20ac\u0153The world economy is not in a bad place at the start of 2019.

                "bodyText":"Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the full story about the markets\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 bad year: Best wishes for 2019!! GW With the Dow up more than 200 points today, Wall Street could yet end a rough month on a moderately high note. As MarketWatch puts it: The Dow Jones Industrial Average (+0.84% today) has declined 9.7% thus far in December, while the S&amp;P 500 index (+0.5%) is down 9.9% during the period, and the Nasdaq Composite Index (+0.55%) is off 10.2% through Friday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s close. Those declines would represent the worst monthly drops since October 2008, according to FactSet data. For the year, the Dow is in line for a 6.7% loss, with the S&amp;P 500 down 7% and the Nasdaq Composite on pace for a 4.6% fall. Trading on Monday, however, was looking up after investors saw reasons to buy in recent tweets from President Donald Trump about putative trade-negotiation progress between himself and Chinese leader Xi Jinping via weekend phone conversations. At the risk of flattening your NYE fizz, there are plenty of reasons to fret about 2019. Weak retail spending, falling house prices, a new chapter in the eurozone crisis or a deeper US-China trade war could all herald a recession. As could Brexit....... Richard Stone, chief executive at The Share Centre, says Brexit is the key factor determining if the FTSE 100 recovers, or stumbles, in 2019. He writes: No one really knows how that is going to resolve itself and it would be a brave (or untruthful) person who said they did! My central expectation \u00e2\u20ac\u201c amidst a range of possible outcomes \u00e2\u20ac\u201c is that an extension to Article 50 will be requested to allow time for a second referendum as Parliament fails to coalesce around any outcome to deliver Brexit and instead abdicates its responsibility back to the people clothed in the claims that this presents the most democratic resolution of the issues. This will then likely lead to a vote to Remain, likely followed by a General Election. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153If that happens I believe the markets will continue to be volatile in early 2019 but will rally on the prospect of no Brexit. This will also likely result in a bounce in the value of Sterling which will temper the rise, or at least the pace of the rise, in the FTSE 100 slightly due to the overseas earnings component of many of the FTSE\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s constituents. The other factor, of course, is Donald Trump: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Away from Brexit more volatile US politics and potentially increased trade tensions as President Trump continues to promote an \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcAmerica First\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 agenda as he starts his re-election campaign will likely weigh on US markets or at the very least cause them to be more volatile. We have already seen some of this since the mid-term elections in November 2018. Plus, the FAANG stocks (Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix, and Google/Alphabet) face a crunch year: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Finally, the drive towards greater regulation and taxation of the tech giants will likely weigh on some of their performance. Personal investors will need to be alive to trying to identify the new emerging companies or trends. On Twitter, the economics team at ACS Hillingdon International School are asking whether this year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s losses are a buying opportunity. I certainly don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t give investment advice #CaveatEmptor . But here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Laith Khalaf, senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown: \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcThe UK stock market has definitely felt the heat of the Brexit burn in 2018, with domestically-focused UK companies finding themselves under pressure as politicians seem unable to agree on the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s withdrawal from the EU. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s actually been a pretty poor year for markets globally though; Europe, Japan and Emerging Markets are all sharply down on the beginning of the year, and while the US has held up better, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s still in negative territory, and has witnessed a pretty dramatic fall in the last three months.We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re unlikely to see the gloom lift in January. Brexit looks set to reach a parliamentary crescendo, and a swathe of trading updates from the UK high street isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t likely to lighten the mood. Despite the negative sentiment, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s unwise to bet on the direction of the stock market in the short term, as it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s prone to defy expectations, sometimes for the better, sometimes for the worse. The appeal of putting long term savings to work in the stock market still remains, though investors who are concerned about its immediate prospects should consider drip-feeding money in gradually, to take advantage of any dips.\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Over in New York, investors are attempting to inject some New Year jollity into proceedings. The Dow Jones industrial average is up around 0.6%, or 150 points, at 23212 points, as Wall Street\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s worst December since 1931 heads towards the exit. After 2018\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s losses, what might next year have in store for investors, and everyone else? Andrew Milligan, Head of Global Strategy at Aberdeen Standard Investments, believes 2019 will be a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153middling year from an economic point of view\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. He told us: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The world economy is not in a bad place at the start of 2019. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve talked of the slowdown in Europe and China, but it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s still trend growth. America is above trend and will decelerate during the course of this year, but there are very few signs, currently, of any major economic problems in the immediate future. The oil price is lower, which helps. The Fed has hinted that it will not be as aggressive. Inflation is not a concern. There are debt issues out there. China remains the most worrying one. Housing markets in some countries are stretched. There is emerging market debt in some countries.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Milligan said a potential downside could be a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153negative feedback loop\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd caused by falling share prices, discouraging companies and consumers from spending. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Confidence and sentiment do matter. One can just see people being more cautious about spending and investing and the economies, just as we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve seen in Europe this year, slow and slow. That would be an adverse headwind.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd He added that potential upside could come from Trump and Xi coming to agreements to resolve the US-China trade dispute. The US stock market may manage a last-ditch rally, after Donald Trump tweeted that he was making progress over trade talks with China. UK housebuilders also had a rough 2018, hit by Brexit worries. Taylor Wimpey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s market capitalisation has slumped by a third, while Berkeley Group are down 17%. Shares in tobacco firms went up in smoke this year. British American Tobacco lost half its value during 2018, tumbling in November when US regulators proposed a major crackdown on menthol cigarette sales. But online grocery retailer Ocado bucked the gloom, almost doubling in value this year after securing deals to supply its technology to overseas supermarkets. Stock markets across Europe have had a torrid year, with all the main indices shedding at least 10%. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the damage: UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE 100: down 12.5% in 2018 German DAX: down 18% French CAC: down 11% Italian FTSE MIB: down 16% Spanish IBEX: down 14.9% The London stock exchange have confirmed that \u00c2\u00a3242bn was wiped off the companies which make up the FTSE 100 during 2018. Here are some more facts from the LSE: FTSE 100 highest point in 2018 was 7877.45 on 22 May 2018 FTSE 100 lowest point in 2018 was 6585.91 on 27 December 2018 Last time FTSE 100 closed down at year end was 31 December 2015: -4.93% Highest % daily rise in 2018 was on 5 April: +2.35% Highest % daily fall in 2018 was on 6 December: -3.15% Newsflash: Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock market has suffered its worst year since the financial crisis. The FTSE 100, which tracks the biggest companies listed in London, has shed 12.5% of its value this year -- or more than \u00c2\u00a3240bn (by my maths). The Footsie has just closed down 5 points at 6,728 points. It started this year at 7,687 points, before being rocked by fears over the global economy, fuelled by trade wars anxiety, and Brexit uncertainty. The FTSE\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s poor performance has helped to drag global markets deep into the red too. As explained earlier, the MSCI index of global stocks has fallen by around 11% during 2018, while the Chinese market has tanked by a quarter. The pound is ending the year with a small rally. Sterling is up 0.5% against the US dollar at $1.277, and 0.6% higher against the euro at \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.116. These are the highest levels since Theresa May was forced to postpone the parliamentary vote on her Brexit deal, to avoid a huge defeat. The government continues to push for improvements to May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s deal, to assuage MP\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s concerns over the Irish backstop. But there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s still no breakthrough. What a difference a year makes! On the last trading day of 2017, City traders were celebrating the news that the FTSE 100 had hit a new all-time high. As we blogged at the time, the blue-chip index gained over 7% during the year to finish at 7,687 points. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s more than 12% higher than today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s levels. Other countries did even better, helping to drive globe stocks up by a sizzling $9 trillion during the year. Analysts at Mizuho Bank have cautioned against getting carried away by Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s claim that he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s held \u00e2\u20ac\u0153very good\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd talks with Chinese president Xi Jinping. They told clients: Whilst President Trump has lauded \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcbig progress\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 in trade talks with China following a phone call with Xi during the weekend, it remains to be seen how much this can boost investor confidence given that market reaction on recent positive development has largely been muted. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve seen plenty of dramatic scenes at the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock exchanges this year, with traders wallowing in gloom as shares crash, or beaming with delight as shares recovered. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s delivered a bumper crop of photos from the trading floors, and no-one sums up the mood better than veteran trader Peter Tuchman - who has a real knack for capturing the state of play. My colleague Dominic Rushe caught up with Tuchman, and reports: Like most celebrities in real life, Tuchman is smaller than he looks. Twin clouds of white hair, echoed by snowy facial fuzz, frame a bald pate that slopes gently down to expressive eyes on a face that seems perpetually in motion, as are his hands and feet. Tuchman is a human emoji, a one-man metaphor for the mood of the market. But don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be fooled by the clowning \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Tuchman is a cool cat. What you are seeing is not necessarily what he is thinking. Tuchman, 60, came late to fame. The born-and-bred New Yorker had already been working on the floor of the NYSE for some 20 years when he first made the front pages. It was 2007 and the financial crisis was dominating the news cycle. On another day of wild swings Tuchman, snapped mouth agog, appeared on the front of the New York Post. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I had just received the bill for my son\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s barmitzvah and it was way more money than I anticipated,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd jokes Tuchman. But Tuchman\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s jollity has a serious side too: His sangfroid, Tuchman says, comes from his parents. Marcel and Shoshana Tuchman were Holocaust survivors who were imprisoned in Auschwitz and Bergen-Belsen. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153My father was a slave laborer for Siemens Corporation, which is still a public company here,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he says, nodding ruefully at the trading floor. His grandmother was murdered in front of his father, most of whose family were also murdered by the Nazis. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153As was my mother\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he says. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153My father went up against Josef Mengele, the death doctor [who performed deadly experiments on Auschwitz prisoners], as did my mother. My mother\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s whole family was gassed. They could have come out of that, you know, being angry and depressed, negative-minded people; they didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t. There are two options in this thing. You can come out of challenges trying to devour every day and looking at life as if the cup is half-full or you come from a negative point of view that you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re a victim and the cup is half-empty. I vote for the former.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Marcel Tuchman, who worked until he was 93 teaching medicine, died earlier this month aged 97. His son was back at work the next day. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153My father always said: \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcWhen I die, cry and go to work.\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 That was his advice.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the full piece: Fiona Cincotta of City Index points out that UK-focused companies are having a decent morning (after a pretty ropey year). The FTSE opened the last trading day of the year a touch higher with a mixture of consumer, property and mining companies making moderate gains. With the pound firmer against the euro and the dollar, FTSE gainers were mostly companies with a strong domestic focus except for miners which were helped by stronger copper and oil prices. Unless Wall Street manages the mother of all rallies today, it will suffer its worst December since the Great Depression. With less than two hours trading to go in London, the FTSE 100 is up 17 points at 6751. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 12% lower than this time last year.... Holger Schmieding of German bank Berenberg suggests there are four \u00e2\u20ac\u0153extraordinary political mistakes\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd which might trigger fresh market mayhem in 2019. They are: for Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s radical government to plunge their country into a genuine Greek-style debt crisis; for Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s mostly pro-EU political class to simply let the train roll towards and then over the hard Brexit cliff instead of using the ten weeks between the likely death of May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Brexit deal and Brexit day on 29 March 2019 to stop it through a softer Brexit option or a new vote to stay in the EU; for Donald Trump to hurt the US economy and impair his chances of re-election in late 2020 by going too far in his costly trade wars in 2019; for China to let a hard landing happen instead of using its ample policy toolbox to smooth the inevitable slowdown in cyclical momentum and trend growth. Now the good news. He doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re particularly likely... For example, Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s budget passed last night, showing that the EU and markets have imposed some rudimentary discipline on Rome. Separately, Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s latest musings on progress in talks with China support hopes that both sides will try to strike some deal in coming months even if some of the thorny issues between the geostrategic rivals will probably not be fully resolved for many years. So, Schmieding suspects that markets may pick up during 2019: Chances are that, after a rocky start to the New Year, a less negative narrative can unfold later in 2019. That we have finally put an unexpectedly difficult 2018 behind us need not remain the only reason to celebrate the advent of a New Year tonight. Hong Kong\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock exchange managed a last-minute rally today. The Hang Seng jumped by 1.3%, lifted by Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s latest optimistic tweet about the trade negotiations with China. But that still leaves the index down 13.6% for 2018, its worst year since 2011. The last 12 months have proved difficult for investors in stock markets around the world as fears over global growth mount up, and for many owners of commodities 2018 has proven equally tricky, my colleague Jasper Jolly writes: Prices for oil and gold, two of the most traded commodities, are both set to fall for the first calendar year since 2015. Futures for Brent crude oil, the North Sea benchmark, gained a dollar in value today, but that has not been enough to recover losses for 2018, which currently stand at around 18%. Fears of a supply glut amid weakening growth in China and other major economies depressed prices to just over $54 per barrel. Losses for West Texas Intermediate, the American benchmark, have been steeper, at 23%. Gold is seen as the financial safe haven par excellence, but it is on course to suffer its first annual decline in three years. Gold futures prices slumped from above $1,350 per troy ounce in the spring to below $1,200 in the late summer. They have since recovered for a 2% fall during 2018 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c stronger than the performance of silver, prices of which have fallen by 9%. Cocoa was the top gainer among major traded commodities in 2018, leading a field of strong performances from a select group of agricultural commodities. Cocoa futures prices have gained more than 27%. Speculators looking further afield at cryptocurrencies \u00e2\u20ac\u201c which share some characteristics with commodities \u00e2\u20ac\u201c would not have been rewarded. Those who had bought bitcoin at the end of 2017, near the height of the cryptocurrency mania, would have lost almost three-quarters of their money. Naeem Aslam of Think Markets blames monetary policy tightening by the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s central banks for this year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s losses. The Fed stopped printing easy money a few years back and increased the interest rates four times this year. The European Central Bank also ended up its quantitative easing program and there has been several discussion on the topic of the ECB normalising the interest rates. All in all, almost all the European indices are down more than 10 percent over this year and some of them are down over 15% (DAX) for this year. The Euro Stoxx 500 index is down by 13% this year\u00e2\u20ac\u201dthe biggest loss since 2008. The fact is that things aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t looking really any brighter in 2019 as well because there are plenty of risk events which are going to keep investors on their toes. For instance, at the beginning of the year, the first thing which investors will have to deal with is the Brexit chaos the UK leaving the European union. Then we have the US trade war with China and the ongoing struggle about securing the funds to build the wall. Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s claim that he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s making \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcbig progress\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 in the trade negotiations with China may be giving world markets a small boost today. Wall Street is expected to open higher in a few hours time, following the news that presidents Trump and Xi spoke over the weekend. European stock markets have started trading, but there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s little drama yet. In London the FTSE 100 index has gained 10 points, led by online supermarket Ocado (+2.1%), budget airline easyJet (1.7%) and web estate agent RightMove (1.5%). The French CAC has gained 0.5%, with Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s IBEC up 0.4% and the Netherland\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s AEX up 0.3%. So with trading thin, and little news about, European stocks seem certain to suffer their worst year since 2008, as this chart shows. Australia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock exchange has closed for the year, after yet another day of losses. The S&amp;P/ASX200 index dipped by 0.14%, taking its combined losses in 2018 to over 9% - the worst year since 2011. Another reason to worry about China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy: In a worrying signal for 2019, China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s manufacturing sector is now contracting. The official factory Purchasing Managers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Index (PMI) fell to 49.4 in December, official data shows, a two-year low. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s below the 50-point mark that shows if activity rose or fell. Manufacturers were hit by falling orders, with new export orders dropping for the seventh month in a row. That suggests the tariffs imposed on Chinese goods at the US border are hitting demand. Mike Van Dulken of City firm Accendo Markets says this data \u00e2\u20ac\u0153may fan the flames of concern about slowing global growth\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. More here. China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock markets have suffered a particularly bleak 2018. The Shanghai composite index has crashed by 25% this year, leaving investors suffering very heavy losses. The trade war with the US has acted like a lead weight on many stocks, of course, but there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also concern that China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy is weakening. My colleague Lily Kuo explains: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153People have started to reduce or even stop spending money because they don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t expect the economy will perform well,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Ye Tan, an independent economist based in Shanghai. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Companies and individuals are wary about the economy.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Going into 2019, China faces not just a slowing economy but also a protracted trade war with the US, a pile of debt that threatens the world economy along with the Chinese financial system, and a populace demanding better environmental, labour, and health protections. Shanghai is closed today, as China prepares for the New Year celebrations. Investors deserve the break. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the final day of the year, and many investors will forgiven for wishing \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcgoodbye and good riddance\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 to 2018. The last 12 months have been pretty tough in the markets. Global stocks have suffered their worst losses since the financial crisis of 2008, wiping around 11% off the MSCI All Country World Index of stocks. In London, the FTSE 100 is limping towards the end of a rough year. The blue-chip index has shed 12% of its value since the start of January, hitting a series of two-year lows -- in a blow to pension funds and savers big and small. The big worry is that the long bull market, which reared up after the great recession ended in 2009, is now over. Anxiety over trade wars, a slowing global economy, Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s increasingly erratic behaviour and US interest rate hikes have all hurt stocks this year. In Europe, the tortuous Brexit negotiations and the long-running row between Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s populist government and Brussels have also worried investors. Trevor Greetham of Royal London Asset Management explains: We were surprised at the ferocity of the selloff in December which we put down to rising nervousness about the US-China trade dispute, an ill-judged and poorly communicated rate hike from the US Federal Reserve and an increasingly erratic pattern of behaviour from President Trump as the Mueller investigation into Russian collusion enters its final stages. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The last couple of weeks have seen a surprise unilateral decision to pull all US troops out of Syria, threats of a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153very long\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd government shutdown if Congress refuses to fund the Mexican border wall and a counterproductive attempt to blame the Fed for market weakness when it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the trade war that investors are most worried about. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Elsewhere in the world Theresa May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chaotic postponement of the meaningful vote on the EU Withdrawal Bill has added to the jittery mood in markets, raising as it does the risk of a No Deal Brexit that would damage both the UK and euro area economies. But perhaps investors are too gloomy. Over the weekend, Donald Trump and Xi Jinping both made positive noises about a breakthrough in their trade talks, offering hope that deeper tariffs can be avoided. That is likely to give traders some much-needed optimism today. European markets are expected to open higher today, in a shortened trading session (although Germany and Italy will be closed).",
