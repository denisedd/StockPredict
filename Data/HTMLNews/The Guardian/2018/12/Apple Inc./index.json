                "bodyText":"Nissan is seeking to block its former chairman Carlos Ghosn\u2019s access to an apartment in Rio de Janeiro, citing a risk that he may remove or destroy evidence after being arrested for financial misconduct last month. Brazil-born Ghosn has been detained in Tokyo since his arrest on suspicion of conspiring with the former Nissan director Greg Kelly of underreporting his income by about 5bn yen (\u00a335m). A Brazilian court has granted Ghosn access to the Nissan-owned property in the Copacabana neighbourhood, but the company said in a statement on Sunday that it was now petitioning a higher court to reverse the decision. Ghosn has denied allegations that he used company funds to pay for his luxury lifestyle, claiming he had no intention of making false financial statements. Kelly also denies the allegations, saying Ghosn\u2019s salaries were paid appropriately. Ghosn, who was sacked as Nissan chairman last month, is at the centre of a corruption investigation that has stunned the business world and put in doubt one of the most successful car alliances of the last 20 years. The scandal has also been viewed as a battle between Nissan and Renault, the French car company that Ghosn also runs and which has a controlling share in the Japanese carmaker. Renault has defied Nissan, its board retaining Ghosn as Renault chairman. Nissan is almost 60% bigger than Renault by sales, but remains the junior partner in the shareholding structure. \u201cNissan has been cooperating with authorities to investigate misconduct on the part of its former chairman, and is working to prevent the destruction of any potential evidence that could occur by allowing access to residences in question,\u201d a Nissan spokesman said.

                "bodyText":"Prosecutors in Japan have charged the former Nissan chairman Carlos Ghosn with underreporting his income by tens of millions of pounds, as the fallout from the scandal threatened to engulf other senior executives. Ghosn, whose arrest on 19 November rocked the Japanese car industry and cast doubts over the future of Nissan\u2019s alliance with Renault, is facing another 20 days in detention after prosecutors added to the charges against him and another Nissan executive, Greg Kelly. With Kelly\u2019s help, Ghosn, who was sacked as Nissan chairman days after his arrest, allegedly hid about 5bn yen (\u00a335m) in income over a five-year-period up to March 2015. But on Monday, prosecutors served fresh arrest warrants alleging that the pair continued to underreport Ghosn\u2019s income through to March this year, increasing the overall amount by 4bn yen. Both men could remain in custody at least until the end of the month, a move that could add to international criticism of the aggressive tactics being employed by Japan\u2019s powerful public prosecutors. The scandal took a further twist on Monday when prosecutors also indicted Nissan for filing false financial statements, in what some described as a shift in focus towards Hiroto Saikawa, the firm\u2019s chief executive and an outspoken critic of Ghosn\u2019s management methods. Nissan will find it difficult to avoid blame for the scandal, given the possibility that other executives had knowledge of Ghosn\u2019s misconduct or that the firm\u2019s internal controls failed to spot the misreported income. \u201cNormally, if it\u2019s falsifying the financial filings, the company as well as the perpetrator is charged.

                "bodyText":"A Japanese court has unexpectedly turned down a request from prosecutors to extend Carlos Ghosn\u2019s period of detention over financial misconduct allegations. The Tokyo district court said it had rejected the request to keep the former Nissan chairman in custody for a further 10 days \u2013 an unusual move that came amid international criticism of the power of Japanese investigative authorities. Ghosn has spent a month at a detention centre in the Japanese capital after his arrest on 19 November for allegedly underreporting his pay by about five billion yen (\u00a335m) between 2011 and 2015. Prosecutors had requested the extension over an additional allegation that Ghosn, along with the former Nissan executive Greg Kelly, continued to underreport his income through to March this year, increasing the overall amount by four billion yen. They have not been formally charged over the second allegation. Ghosn\u2019s immediate future is uncertain, however. If a court accepts a bail request by his lawyers, he could be released as early as Friday. But prosecutors are expected to appeal against the court decision and could attempt to rearrest him on a new charge. Experts said the court\u2019s refusal to grant the prosecutors\u2019 request could mark a shift in Japanese legal authorities\u2019 attitude towards detaining suspects for long periods, during which they are interrogated without their lawyers present. \u201cThey are very nervous about criticism of their approach toward detention,\u201d said Masashi Akita, a defence lawyer. \u201cI think this case has had a big impact on the practice of Japanese justice.\u201d Ghosn faces up to 10 years in prison, a fine of 10 million yen, or both, if he is found guilty. The conviction rate in Japan is above 99%. The scandal raised questions about the state of corporate governance in Japan and cast doubt on the future of Nissan\u2019s alliance with Renault. Ghosn, 64, was lauded as Nissan\u2019s saviour after he rescued the carmaker from near bankruptcy two decades ago. Nissan sacked him as chairman five days after his arrest but this week said it had yet to decide on a replacement. He remains head of Renault, which has said his compensation package had complied with law and governance guidelines. Reuters said it had seen documents showing executives at both companies were involved in discussions about compensating Ghosn out of the public eye. The allegations aside, Ghosn is alleged to have misused Nissan money to fund his lavish lifestyle, including luxury homes in Rio de Janeiro, Beirut, Paris and Amsterdam. Ghosn and Kelly have not issued statements during their detention, but media reports said both men have denied the allegations.",

                "bodyText":"Prosecutors in Japan have re-arrested Carlos Ghosn, possibly ending any hopes the former Nissan chairman had of an early release from detention over financial misconduct allegations. . Ghosn, who has been detained for more than a month, was re-arrested on Friday morning on suspicion of aggravated breach of trust and could face another 10 days in detention. Speculation had been building that he could be released on bail after a court unexpectedly rejected a prosecution request to extend his detention for further questioning. But in the latest twist to a saga that has gripped Japan, Ghosn was instead re-arrested, this time on suspicion of using Nissan funds to cover losses of 1.85bn yen ($16.6m) he incurred from derivatives trading in 2008. Prosecutors, whose prolonged detention of Ghosn has attracted international criticism, said: \u201cThe accused was responsible for managing Nissan\u2019s overall operations and for dutifully fulfilling his role as chief executive not to cause damage to Nissan and its subsidiaries ... but he took action that betrayed his role and caused financial damage to Nissan.\u201d Ghosn was first arrested on 19 November for allegedly underreporting his pay by about 5bn yen between 2011 and 2015. In addition he and former Nissan executive Greg Kelly, who is also being detained, are alleged to have continued to underreport Ghosn\u2019s income through to March this year, increasing the overall underreported amount by 4bn yen. Public broadcaster NHK said the 64-year-old had denied the latest allegation. He and Kelly have also denied two other charges of financial misconduct in relation to Ghosn\u2019s salary. Prosecutors now have 48 hours to question Ghosn over the latest allegation, and can then apply to detain him for 10 days, with the option of requesting a further 10-day extension. Kelly, who was not re-arrested on Friday, is seeking bail, according to a court statement. Ghosn, however, faces spending Christmas and possibly the start of next year in his tiny cell at a Tokyo detention centre. Friday\u2019s dramatic turn of events came just hours after Ghosn vowed to clear his name. \u201cThings as they stand are absolutely unacceptable,\u201d he said through his lawyer, according to NHK. \u201cI want to have my position heard and restore my honour in court.\u201d The justice minister, Takashi Yamashita, said foreign criticism of the length of Ghosn\u2019s detention, during which he has been interrogated without his lawyers present, was \u201cunwarranted\u201d. But experts said the prosecutors\u2019 decision to re-arrest him reflected poorly on the country\u2019s criminal justice system. \u201cThe Japanese penal system has been revealed to the wider world.

Nissan and Mitsubishi sacked Ghosn as chairman soon after his arrest, but Renault has kept him on as chairman. Japanese media said Ghosn had admitted signing documents to defer part of his salary until after retirement but said the amount did not need to be declared as it had not yet been definitively fixed.
