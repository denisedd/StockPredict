Murdoch is also in the process of a separate $71.3bn sale of Fox to Disney. Comcast ended up paying \u00a330bn for Sky, significantly more than the \u00a318bn bid made by Fox in December 2016. \u2022 Dara Khosrowshahi, the chief executive of Uber, has tried to take a different path from its founder, Travis Kalanick, and his abrasive manner since taking over in August 2017. However, changing the ride-hailing company\u2019s culture has proved to be no easy feat: Khosrowshahi was forced to apologise for the app\u2019s mistakes in London in September, a year after Transport for London moved to remove its licence in the capital. October \u2022 The former deputy prime minister Nick Clegg once said he was not very impressed by Facebook. \u201cI\u2019m not especially bedazzled by Facebook,\u201d he wrote in 2016. \u201cI actually find the messianic, Californian new-worldy, touchy-feely culture of Facebook a little grating.\u201d But then he lost his parliamentary seat and his career trajectory started to head south \u2013 and took a new job in the US as global head of communications at Facebook. One of his top priorities will be to avoid a regulatory showdown with Brussels at a time when Facebook\u2019s policies and behaviour are under scrutiny, not least after Sheryl Sandberg was accused of condoning a smear campaign against the financier George Soros. \u2022 Sir Philip Green, the owner of Topshop\u2019s parent company, Arcadia, is no stranger to controversy, but this autumn he was named in parliament as the man behind multiple non-disclosure agreements. The NDAs still hold, but Green has denied \u201cunlawful sexual or racist behaviour\u201d. November \u2022 Denise Coates, the chief executive of Bet365, is the best-paid woman in Stoke, and the rest of the world, for that matter. Coates turned her father\u2019s bookmaker into one of the world\u2019s biggest online gambling businesses. Her record \u00a3265m annual pay packet provoked criticism, but it is a private, family owned company and she controls it. \u2022 Carlos Ghosn, the chief executive of Renault, apparently had little idea that he was about to be arrested and detained when he arrived in Tokyo in November. The Lebanese-Brazilian executive, who forged an alliance between France\u2019s Renault and Japan\u2019s Nissan and Mitsubishi, was shopped by Nissan for allegedly underreporting his income. The Japanese carmakers quickly ousted him from their boards, leaving the alliance \u2013 and Ghosn\u2019s freedom \u2013 in the balance. December \u2022 Ray Kelvin was probably the biggest name in retail no one had heard of \u2013 until 300 former and current employees of his Ted Baker fashion business signed a petition on the campaigning website Organise complaining about his behaviour, including \u201cforced hugs\u201d and ear kissing. The company said Kelvin\u2019s hugs were \u201cpart of Ted Baker\u2019s culture, but are absolutely not insisted upon\u201d. But then details of an office brawl emerged \u2013 which had earned Kelvin a formal warning \u2013 and \u201cfurther serious allegations\u201d eventually prompted the rag trade multimillionaire to take a leave of absence while an independent investigation is carried out. \u2022 It has not been such a great year for Nick Robertson, the co-founder of Asos. He has watched the value of his stake in the online fashion retailer fall by about 70% \u2013 or \u00a3275m \u2013 between its peak in March and the aftermath of a shock profit warning in December. The British retail sector laboured during 2018, but analysts were taken aback by declining margins online at a time when most eyes were on the travails of the high street.",
