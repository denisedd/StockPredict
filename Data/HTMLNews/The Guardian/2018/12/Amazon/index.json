That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s all for today. Thank you for reading the blog and please join us again on Monday. A reminder of how the pound has fared against the dollar since just before the EU referendum on 23 June 2016: US retail sales rose 0.2% in November, as expected. October\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s number was revised up, to show growth of 1.1%, versus an initial estimate of 0.8%. The brief press conference is over and the pound is off a little more since the Prime Minister stood up. She was in defiant mood, insisting EU leaders are committed to seeing her deal get over the line in parliament. Theresa May is giving a press conference in Brussels. For all the details follow our politics live blog: A quick recap on the pound, which is still having a bad day: Down 0.7% against the dollar at $1.2561 Down 0.7% against the euro at \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.1286 George Osborne, the former Tory Chancellor who was sacked by Theresa May, has landed another job. Not satisfied with eight, he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s taking on a ninth role. Osborne, editor of the London\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Evening Standard newspaper, is joining his brother\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Silicon Valley venture capital fund - 9Yards Capital - as an adviser, adding yet another string to his bow. Here are his nine roles: Editor, Evening Standard Adviser, 9Yards Capital Adviser, Blackrock Adviser, Exor Chair, Northern Powerhouse Fellow, McCain Institute Honorary Professor, University of Manchester Distinguished visiting fellow, Stanford\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Hoover Institution Dean\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fellow, Stanford\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s graduate business school Full story here: A couple of details from the Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s expenses policy.. Nightly hotel rate limits for employees away on business: UK: \u00c2\u00a3125 Europe: \u00e2\u201a\u00ac200 North America: $275 Rest of the world: \u00c2\u00a3185 London: \u00c2\u00a3200 New York: $325 Washington: $325 Tokyo: JPY 40,000 Hong Kong: HKD 2,200 Meals: \u00c2\u00a340 per day for the cost of meals, when on a overnight stay for business. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This includes the cost of reasonable alcoholic drinks, tax and gratuities.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd If working on evenings and weekends, up to \u00c2\u00a312.50 can be claimed for a meal eaten on Bank premises. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The meal must be for personal consumption on Bank premises and can be purchased from any vendor.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The Bank of England has published an updated expenses policy, six months after some fairly shocking details emerged of huge expense claims. At that time, MPs on the Treasury select committee criticised travel expenses amassed by two officials of almost \u00c2\u00a3400,000, huge subsidies for the Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s staff at its south London sports club and a Christmas party costing \u00c2\u00a3100,000. Mark Carney, the Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s governor, revealed that his own expenses bill topped \u00c2\u00a3300,000 over a two-year period. Commenting on the new policy on Friday, Nicky Morgan, chair of the select committee, said: Given the staggeringly high level of expenses claimed by some members of the Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s policy committees, the review of its expenses policy is welcome. The Bank must now ensure that the new rules are followed in both letter and spirit by all staff across the organisation. The Treasury Committee will examine the Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s expenses, as well as the review itself, in detail when we take evidence from the Court of the Bank of England in the New Year. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the background to the story: Feeling festive? Why not have a go at our annual business Christmas quiz? Jack Allen, senior European economist at Capital Economics, says that although disruption caused by the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcgilets jaunes\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 protests was a drag on the wider eurozone economy in December, the underlying picture is also weakening: December\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fall in the eurozone composite PMI was almost entirely driven by a sharp drop in France, perhaps suggesting that the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcgilets jaunes\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 protests have had a serious economic effect. But even if France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s PMI bounces back as the effects of the protests fade, the eurozone economy has clearly shifted down a gear and looks set to grow at a more moderate pace next year. Let\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s take a look at how European markets are faring now. With little in the way of good news - either politically or in terms of economic data - it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a sea of red this morning: FTSE 100: -0.8% at 6,823 Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s DAX: -1.5% at 10,763 France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s CAC: -1.3% at 4,833 Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB: -1.1% at 18,838 Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s IBEX: -1.3% at 8,808 Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s STOXX 600: -1.2% at 345 The pound is now down 0.6% against the dollar, at $1.2583, and 0.6% against the euro at \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.1292. Travellers heading off for a festive break are finding their sterling isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t stretching so far at some airports. As the BBC reports, people changing money at Heathrow are being offered as little as $1.05 for \u00c2\u00a31. Ouch. French private sector output contracted for the first time in two-and-a-half years in December as activity at firms was disrupted by the so-called \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcgilets jaunes\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 protests. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s according to the IHS Markit flash PMI for France, which came in at 49.3 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c below the crucial 50 mark which separates expansion from contraction. It was the first time output across the manufacturing and services sectors fell in France since June 2016. IHS Markit said the weaker French performance was a drag on business growth in the wider eurozone in December: Disruptions to business and travel in France arising from the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcgilets jaunes\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 protests added to the weaker demand environment, contributing to the first fall in French business activity for two-and- a-half years. Output fell in both manufacturing and services. The eurozone \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcflash\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 PMI survey for December is in and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s much weaker than expected, signalling a weak end to 2018 for the region\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy. The headline index on the composite index - which combines activity at manufacturing and services firms - fell to 51.3 in December from 52.7 in November, where anything above 50 indicates growth. It signalled the weakest rate of growth since November 2014, and was below economists\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 expectations of 52.8. New business in the single currency bloc almost stalled in December, job creation slipped to a two-year low, and firms grew more pessimistic about the outlook. Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit \u00e2\u20ac\u201c which compiles the survey - said: The Eurozone economy saw a disappointing end to 2018, with growth slowing to the weakest for four years. Companies are worried about the global economic and political climate, with trade wars and Brexit adding to increased political tensions within the euro area. The surveys also point to further signs that the struggling autos sector continued to act as a drag on the region\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy. Data from China overnight has spooked investors in Asia and is now having a similar effect in Europe where a sell-off is underway. Retail sales grew by 8.1% in November, compared with a year earlier, the slowest since May 2003 and missing forecasts of an 8.8% rise. Industrial production also disappointed, increasing by 5.4% year-on-year and not the 5.9% predicted by economists. Stephen Innes, Oanda\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s head of trading at Asia Pacific, said: Investors are right to be worried about global growth as China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy continues to sputter. The weaker than expected retails sales print, a more significant part of the Chinese economy than exports, was weaker than expected. The data lend support to the market\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s view that things will get worse in China before they get better, this despite investment rising. Indeed, the data was bad enough to trigger a rapid sugar-coated response from China National Bureau of Statistics official, and predictably equity markets and risk assets are reacting poorly. The pound is having a bad morning, after Theresa May failed to make progress on Brexit during her trip to Brussels on Thursday. The pound is down 0.5% against the dollar at $1.2594, and down 0.3% against the euro at \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.1330. Bad news for Brits planning a festive break in the US and Europe. Trading is underway in Europe and all major indices have opened lower. It follows earlier falls in Asia, with the Hang Seng down -1.7% and the Nikkei falling 2%. Investors have been spooked by data from China this morning, which showed retail sales grew at the slowest rate in 15 years in November, prompting fears of a slowdown in the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s second largest economy. Opening scores in Europe: FTSE 100: -0.9% Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s DAX: -1% France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s CAC: -1% Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB: -0.9% Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s IBEX: -0.7% Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s STOXX 600: -0.7% Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. November was another poor month for European car manufacturers, with sales of new cars down 8% - the third monthly fall in a row. There were 1.1m new cars registered last month, compared with 1.2m in November 2017 according to European Automobile Manufacturers Association. The November drop followed a 7.3% fall in October and a 23.5% fall in September. Major disruption to production has been caused by tougher emissions tests, introduced from September. What is less clear is to what extent weaker consumer confidence might also be weighing on car sales in the EU. Renault suffered the biggest drop in sales in November, down 16%, followed by Volkswagen Group which was down 10.9%. Sales were down in all five of the EU\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest markets: Spain (-12.6%); Germany (-9.9%); Italy (-6.3%); France (-4.7%); and the UK (-3%).

Kingman\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s call for \u00e2\u20ac\u0153new leadership\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd is just as important as his demand for \u00e2\u20ac\u0153new powers\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a new mandate\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. A cosmetic exercise won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t do.</p> <p>Proposals from the Competition and Markets Authority, examining market structure, could be more far-reaching. The CMA did not recommend a breakup of the big four auditors, which is probably sensible given the complexity of these international networks of firms. But an internal operational split between audit and non-audit activities is overdue.</p> <p>And an insistence of joint audits at FTSE 350 companies \u00e2\u20ac\u201c with one firm being drawn from outside the big four \u00e2\u20ac\u201c could have long-lasting benefits. In about a decade\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time, one could imagine a top league of eight auditing outfits, with underperformers at risk of relegation.</p> <p>That, at least, is the hope.

Profit margins, which had been running at 7%-8%, would have to be lowered to 4%-ish for a while, the company said, reassuring shareholders that a dose of short-term financial pain was necessary to pursue the main prize of becoming the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest online fashion retailer for twentysomethings. The important thing was to build more warehouses and distribution infrastructure. The share price tanked at the time, but 4% was meant to be the low point for margins.

It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a huge turnaround from the confident outlook in October, when Asos unveiled pre-tax profits above \u00c2\u00a3100m for the first time. On the latest forecast, the group will slide to \u00c2\u00a352m, which was roughly the return in 2014, when turnover was less than half the current level. Asos seems to be very good at selling more clothes to more people, but less effective at turning extra sales into extra profits.</p> <p>For true believers, the long-term will still look lovely. Didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t Amazon run with negligible profit margins for years? Doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t the US, where a first warehouse has been opened in Atlanta, represent a huge opportunity? It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s clearly possible that life will turn out so happily since, even in a soggy year, Asos still expects to grow sales by 15%. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s just that financial success, in terms of hard profits and meaningful margins, forever seems to lie over the horizon.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/dec/17/six-reasons-why-uk-retailers-have-the-christmas-jitters\">The horrible retailing climate</a> doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t help, but the specific worry about Asos is that the competition is catching up. Its online world suddenly seems overpopulated with companies with an equal willingness to invest first and worry about profit margins later. Black Friday was a case in point. Asos pursued its usual \u00e2\u20ac\u015320% off\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd approach, but found others \u00e2\u20ac\u201c by which it may mean big German group Zalando \u00e2\u20ac\u201c going lower.

Even on the lower forecasts, it will shift \u00c2\u00a32.7bn worth of fast fashion items this year. In that context, a 2% profit margin looks extremely thin.

For this reform to be convincing, however, the FRC can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t simply be rewired as the Audit, Reporting and Governance Authority. Kingman\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s call for \u00e2\u20ac\u0153new leadership\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd is just as important as his demand for \u00e2\u20ac\u0153new powers\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a new mandate\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. A cosmetic exercise won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t do. Proposals from the Competition and Markets Authority, examining market structure, could be more far-reaching. The CMA did not recommend a breakup of the big four auditors, which is probably sensible given the complexity of these international networks of firms. But an internal operational split between audit and non-audit activities is overdue. And an insistence of joint audits at FTSE 350 companies \u00e2\u20ac\u201c with one firm being drawn from outside the big four \u00e2\u20ac\u201c could have long-lasting benefits. In about a decade\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time, one could imagine a top league of eight auditing outfits, with underperformers at risk of relegation. That, at least, is the hope. It is now vital that the government does not go limp in the face of the inevitable criticism that reform, and more intrusive regulation, will be expensive. Better-quality audits are worth paying for. Asos\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 margins should match its size Asos\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s heavy profits warning is merely \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a bump in the road\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and the ambitions for the business remain intact, declared chief executive Nick Beighton. He scores top marks for optimism, but Asos investors may feel the refrain is alarmingly familiar. Back in 2014, Asos hit a similar bump. Profit margins, which had been running at 7%-8%, would have to be lowered to 4%-ish for a while, the company said, reassuring shareholders that a dose of short-term financial pain was necessary to pursue the main prize of becoming the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest online fashion retailer for twentysomethings. The important thing was to build more warehouses and distribution infrastructure. The share price tanked at the time, but 4% was meant to be the low point for margins. The market trusted that it was. Now, after only three months of Asos\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s latest financial year, Beighton says margins of just 2% are on the cards this time. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a huge turnaround from the confident outlook in October, when Asos unveiled pre-tax profits above \u00c2\u00a3100m for the first time. On the latest forecast, the group will slide to \u00c2\u00a352m, which was roughly the return in 2014, when turnover was less than half the current level. Asos seems to be very good at selling more clothes to more people, but less effective at turning extra sales into extra profits. For true believers, the long-term will still look lovely. Didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t Amazon run with negligible profit margins for years? Doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t the US, where a first warehouse has been opened in Atlanta, represent a huge opportunity? It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s clearly possible that life will turn out so happily since, even in a soggy year, Asos still expects to grow sales by 15%. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s just that financial success, in terms of hard profits and meaningful margins, forever seems to lie over the horizon. The horrible retailing climate doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t help, but the specific worry about Asos is that the competition is catching up. Its online world suddenly seems overpopulated with companies with an equal willingness to invest first and worry about profit margins later. Black Friday was a case in point. Asos pursued its usual \u00e2\u20ac\u015320% off\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd approach, but found others \u00e2\u20ac\u201c by which it may mean big German group Zalando \u00e2\u20ac\u201c going lower. Nor is it only a UK problem that could pinned on Brexit. France and Germany were also weaker than expected. Asos has little choice but to keep running down the same road, whatever the bumps. Maybe the prize at the end isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t mega-returns, but a permanent state of low-margin attrition. Asos is no longer a small company. Even on the lower forecasts, it will shift \u00c2\u00a32.7bn worth of fast fashion items this year. In that context, a 2% profit margin looks extremely thin. Shouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t a few economies of scale have arrived by now?",

                "bodyText":"Finally, after a very rocky day, ASOS shares have closed at \u00c2\u00a326.14, a slump of 37.5%. That wipes \u00c2\u00a31.3bn off its value, sending it slumping from \u00c2\u00a33.5bn to \u00c2\u00a32.2bn. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a reminder of why: Asos has issued an unexpected profit warning after a poor November, becoming the latest retailer to be hit by weak consumer confidence, increased discounting and unusually mild weather. The downturn suggests the high street malaise is spreading to online retailers, with consumers worried about what Brexit will mean for their finances. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the full story: Goodnight. GW David Madden, market analyst at CMC Markets UK, says Asos\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s profits warning at 7am today has hurt the retail sector badly today: The UK retail sector took a knock today after well-known ASOS shares were battered on the back of an earnings warning. ASOS shares have slumped after the online fashion house announced a profit warning. The group said that sales from September to November jumped by 14%, but there was a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcsignificant deterioration\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 in November. The company previously predicted full-year sales growth of 20-25%, and now it anticipates just 15%. Profit margins have been revised down to 2% from 4%. Nick Beighton, the CEO, warned that the sector is experiencing \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcunprecedented levels of discounting\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. Online companies have a major cost advantage over high street retailers, and it is worrying when they are concerned about consumer spending. UK retailers aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t the only people feeling gloomy -- America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s builders are also feeling a chill. Back in the City, UK retailers are being hit even harder. Next are down 6.5%, Marks &amp; Spencer have lost 5%, Dunelm (home furnishings) has slumped by 10%, and Games Workshop (small metal figurines) are down 5.7%. JD Sports has tumbled by 8.4%, despite putting out a statement confirming that its Christmas trading statement is scheduled for 14 January 2019 (ie: they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re not expecting a profits warning...) This is dragging London stock market deeper into the read, with the FTSE 100 down 1.1% and the FTSE 250 shedding 1.4%. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not just Asos\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fault, though. Investors are also being spooked by a bad start to trading on Wall Street. Steve Dresser is continuing to spot examples of retailers taking, er, liberties with their Christmas gift pricing... Asos\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shares are still being thumped today; still down 40% at \u00c2\u00a325,47, a loss of over \u00c2\u00a316 today. That has wiped almost \u00c2\u00a31.4bn off its market value today, down from \u00c2\u00a33.5bn to \u00c2\u00a32.1bn. It has also helped pull the AIM index (where Asos is listed) down to its lowest level in almost two years. Spice Girl turned fashion designer/businesswoman Victoria Beckham is also suffering from the tough retail environment. Losses at Beckham\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s luxury fashion label rose to \u00c2\u00a310.2m last year, new figures show, up from \u00c2\u00a38.2m in the previous 12 months. The bad news keeps coming.... home furnishings and womenswear chain Laura Ashley is closing 40 stores. Laura Ashley blames the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153challenging environment\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in the UK, and warned things could get worse... Retail analyst Steve Dresser has spotted that UK retailer Fat Face is now offering cash off sales in the 2019, if shoppers will only buy something today.... With discounting rampant this year, some stores are being forced to cut prices to more realistic levels... George Salmon, equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, reckons Asos is particularly vulnerable to Brexit gloom because it targets younger shoppers: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The uncertainty around Brexit will be playing a major role, and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s probably no coincidence Asos\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s key demographic of 20-somethings generally harbour more concerns over the future of the economy post-Brexit than their parents.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Julie Palmer, partner at consultancy Begbies Traynor, points out that many smaller online shops have hit trouble this autumn. Asos is not alone, although this morning\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shock profits warning has obviously caused alarm... Palmer explains: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Seeing this goliath of the online retail world start to wobble shows that it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not just the physical high street that needs to take a look at its model and resilience. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153In fact, our own Red Flag Alert revealed that there has been a creeping undercurrent of online retailers suffering in the challenging climate this year with more than 8,000 online retailers in significant financial distress during Q3 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c an increase of 8% since the same time in 2017. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153A retailer issuing a profit warning this close to Christmas is never a good thing, but seeing one as big as ASOS issuing a profit is quite a clubbing for an industry that has already taken a battering.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Retailers across Europe are reeling from Asos\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s profits warning: Brexit uncertainty has left many people too frightened to spend, says Hannah Maundrell, Editor in Chief of money.co.uk. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a blow to high street shops, web retailers such as ASOS, and other customer-facing firms, she explains: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t waste time stressing about what Brexit might mean for your finances, focus instead on getting on top of them so you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re in the best possible place to enjoy whatever happens down the road. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s as simple as keeping track of what cash you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve got coming in and going out, looking for easy ways to pay big companies less \u00e2\u20ac\u201c like switching your mortgage - paying off expensive borrowing and squirrelling away any spare cash you can afford so you have an emergency fund to fall back on just in case times get tight.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Ouch: If Asos is struggling, then many other retailers will be doing even worse, reckons Andrea Felsted of Bloomberg. She argues: To some extent, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a surprise that the first seasonal shocker has come from Asos. It specializes in fast fashion. The conventional wisdom goes that internet retailers should be in a better position that beleaguered bricks and mortar stores when a squeeze on shopping comes. But the clothing sector has been hit by the double whammy of warm weather and rocky consumer confidence. While Brexit looks like it might become the next convenient excuse for poor trading, senior retailers say the downturn since October has been real. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s as if someone switched the lights off. Asos\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s problems show that the UK retail sector is in a serious fix, says Russ Mould, investment director at stockbrokers AJ Bell. He writes: It is not just that we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve stopped shopping on the high street, it is that we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re spending less overall. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Everyone knew bricks and mortar retail was in trouble; after all, why struggle out to the shops and battle the crowds when everything you want is available at the click of a button from the comfort of your own home? \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The read-through from ASOS\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s results is that consumers are feeling sufficiently nervous to put off purchases no matter how they make them. This will strike fear into other internet-based retailers and more traditional rivals who were banking on their web-based portals to get them out of trouble. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The alternative, which seems unlikely but can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be ruled out entirely, is that this is more of an ASOS-specific issue. Fashion is fickle and perhaps ASOS was not quite as on top of what its shoppers want as it has been historically. Interestingly, BooHoo has put out a statement which says its own trading remains strong (see here). \u00e2\u20ac\u0153With just a week left of crucial Christmas trading we should have our answer to whether this is a micro or macro issue as January trading updates trickle in from across the sector.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Kate Heseltine, analyst at Edison Investment Research, says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The significance of the warning by ASOS, one of the leading online retailers, could hardly be higher for the consumer sector. Coming at the end of its first quarter, it entails a substantial judgment call for the rest of the year to August 2019 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a call that management has made negatively. It seems that Mike Ashley is not the only retailer to have experienced an \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcunbelievably bad\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 November with online giant, ASOS, issuing a major profit warning in its Q1 trading update this morning. Asos\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s CEO Nick Beighton has held a conference call with journalists, and explained that the company lost out during last month\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Black Friday sales. Beighton said Asos knocked 20% off everything on Black Friday, the same promotion as in previous years, but its rivals offered much bigger price cuts \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and this means Asos will need to think about its approach to Black Friday. But he insisted that Asos had not lost any market share, saying overall consumer spending was down. The online fashion retailer has been struggling to sell higher-priced clothing such as womens\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 jackets along with men\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s branded sneakers, with customers preferring to buy cheaper items. Beighton noted that the disposable incomes of Asos\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 20-something customers were still below the levels they were at a decade ago. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s more than just the Brexit-related factors.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Indeed, consumer confidence is also fragile in Germany and France, where Asos generates 60% of its EU sales, he added. In another blow to the UK economy, people\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s confidence in their finances has slumped to a six-month low -- one of the reasons behind Asos\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s problems? Data firm IHS Markit says its Household Finance Index has dropped to 43.9 in December, its lowest since June, from 44.4 in November. Markit warned that households are particularly worried about financial prospects in 2019, as they face rising costs and the uncertainty over Brexit. Economist Joe Hayes says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153(The) data demonstrate the negative impact that political and economic uncertainty is having on households. If sentiment continues to decline, the effect on the real economy may become more apparent in hard data if households begin to alter consumption behaviour.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The survey also found that Londoners are particularly gloomy about house prices. Asos\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s profit warning is a clear sign that this Christmas will be tough for many retailers, warns business journalist Declan Curry: Asos\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shares are plumbing new depths. They\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re now down 42% at \u00c2\u00a324.24, from \u00c2\u00a341.86 on Friday night. Other retailers are also being hammered, with Next and Marks &amp; Spencer plunging to the bottom of the FTSE 100 index this morning: It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a similar picture on the FTSE 250 index (which includes smaller companies than the FTSE 100). JD Sports, Sports Direct and Dixons Carphone are all among the top fallers Several commentators are blaming Brexit for at least some of Asos\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s woes. Matthew Vincent of the Financial Times says: Asos did not mention Brexit, but when it notes that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153consumer confidence is increasingly fragile\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd it can only be talking about one factor. Why else would it have to resort to so much discounting and promotional activity that it expects to halve its operating margin? Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s warning comes after consultancy Springboard said that the number of people visiting British shops in November was the worst since the 2008 recession, with so-called footfall at retail parks and high streets down 3.2 per cent on the year before. But, clearly, it is not just bricks and mortar shops any more. Anyone trying to blame the web alone for the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153hollowing out\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd of Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s high streets needs to look further afield than the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153web boys\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd... the Westminster boys would be a place to start. Asset manager Trevor Greetham also blames the deadlock over the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s exit from the EU: Overnight, retail analysts at Springboard predicted that consumer spending is unlikely to pick up this week. Diane Wehrle, insights director at Springboard, predicted that sales will be 3% lower than last year, warning: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We are not anticipating it will be a bumper week by any means,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Consumers are feeling nervous about what might happen in the new year, particularly around Brexit. So people are not prepared to splash out this Christmas and are reining back on spending. More here: As an online-only retailer, Asos should be protected from the well-known problems hitting Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s high streets. But today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s profits warning suggest that e-commerce is also struggling. Weak consumer confidence must be a factor, thanks to Brexit, the US-China trade war, and the slowing eurozone economy. The recent mild weather has also hurt retailers; a warm autumn cuts the need for a new winter coat. Neil Wilson of Markets.com explains: We do note softer consumer confidence in general \u00e2\u20ac\u201c this is not just about the high street creaking under the weight of rising wage costs and legacy store portfolios. There has also been a weather factor \u00e2\u20ac\u201c every retailer that ever existed blames the weather but to a degree we must accept it has been a factor this year..... Online businesses have seemed immune but the warning from Asos today suggests they too are at risk from the cyclical slowdown. We must stress that the Asos warning is indicative of a cyclical slowdown rather than being suggestive of the structural problems facing the high street. Retail analyst Nick Bubb says analysts are \u00e2\u20ac\u0153shell-shocked\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd by Asos\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s profits warning this morning: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The share price of Asos has been under some pressure recently, as if the City sensed that something might be amiss, but we certainly weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t expecting the online fashion giant to issue a huge profit warning today,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Boohoo has just issue a statement to the City, insisting that it is not suffering from Asos\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s woes. The company says: Boohoo group plc, a leading online fashion group, is pleased to confirm that the group\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trading performance remains strong, with record Black Friday sales across the group and continues to trade comfortably in line with market expectations. The group will provide an update for the four month trading period to December 31st on January 15th 2019. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s only providing limited comfort - Boohoo shares are down 9% this morning, having crashed by almost 20% at the open. Asos\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s market capitalisation (the value of the company) has slumped from \u00c2\u00a33.5bn to \u00c2\u00a32.2bn Shares in Asos have plunged by 35% at the start of trading in London. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s an absolute rout, and shows that its profits warning has really worried the City. They\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve fallen to \u00c2\u00a326.73, from \u00c2\u00a341.86 on Friday night. That looks to be their lowest level since February 2016. Shares in high street chain Next have slumped by 5%, as Asos\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pessimism chills the retail sector The London stock market is open, and investors are racing to sell shares in clothing and retail companies. In early trading: JD Sports has lost 4.3% Marks &amp; Spencer shares are down 3% Associated British Foods, which owns Primark, are down 1.2%. Ted Baker has lost 3.6% We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re waiting for Asos shares to start trading.... Asos\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s problems aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t confined to the UK. It explains: Trading conditions across our two largest markets of Germany and France, which account for c.60% of EU sales, have become significantly more challenging. Financial analyst and journalist Louise Cooper points out that Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy shrank in the last quarter: Asos isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t pinning its hopes on a late surge in Christmas spending.... Men have been buying fewer sneakers, apparently.... Asos\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chief executive is speaking to City analysts now. Nick Beighton is blaming an \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcunprecedented\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 surge in price cuts this autumn, which has badly hurt profits. Beighton also says that trading in continental Europe has also weakened: Shares in Boohoo, a rival online fashion chain, are expected to fall by 5% this morning, as investors digest Asos\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s profit warning. You can see Asos\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s profits warning online, here. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the top line: Asos reckons it is still outperforming the wider UK retail sector, as weak consumer confidence hits shops hard. It says: In the UK, ASOS continues to materially outperform in its home market with sales growth in the year-to-date (1 September through 30 November) of +19% (cc: 19%), although this has been achieved at the cost of more promotional activity than initially planned and consumers buying into lower priced product. Consumer confidence is increasingly fragile as evidenced by the most recent BRC data. City traders are predicting that Asos\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shares will tumble by 15% to 20% when trading begins, in under half an hour. Asos has been one of the leading lights in the UK retail sector for years, so today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s profits warning is a serious issue. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s some early reaction: Asos\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s CEO Nick Beighton says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We achieved 14% sales growth in a difficult market, but in the light of a significant downturn in November, we think it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s prudent to recalibrate our expectations for the full year. We are taking all appropriate actions and our ambitions for ASOS have not changed\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. ASOS has slashed its forecasts for sales growth and earnings, following weak trading in November. Gross profit margins will be narrower than last year, as the company is forced to discount its clothing. The company is also trimming its capital spending plans, as it hunkers down. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s revised guidance: Sales growth: c.15% (previously +20-25%) Retail gross margin: c.-150bps (previously flat at 49.9%) EBIT margin: c.2% (previously c.4%) Capital expenditure re-phased down to c.\u00c2\u00a3200m Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Online fashion store Asos has rocked the UK retail sector by issuing a profits warning, and warning that trading has taken a nasty plunge in the run-up to Christmas. In an unscheduled announcement, Asos has told the City that it experienced a significant deterioration in November - a crucial trading month for the company (and the rest of the retail sector too!). The company also warns that current trading remains \u00e2\u20ac\u0153challenging\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd - with just one week to go until Christmas Day. Asos says: Whilst trading in September and October was broadly in line with our expectations, November, a very material month for us from both a sales and cash margin perspective, was significantly behind expectations. The current backdrop of economic uncertainty across many of our major markets together with a weakening in consumer confidence has led to the weakest growth in online clothing sales in recent years. We have recalibrated our expectations for the current year accordingly. This comes just days after Sports Direct\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Mike Ashley warned that last month was the worst November for the retail sector in living memory. It will fuel concerns that consumers are cutting back in the face of economic uncertainty, and anxiety over how Brexit is playing out. More to follow....",

                "bodyText":"And finally, Wall Street has closed a little higher, but with plenty of jitters around. The Dow gained 83 points, or 0.35%, to 23,675 -- only a small recovery from its 2% losses on Monday, and last Friday. Global growth worries, as reflected in the oil price\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s drop to a 15-month low, abounded. Investors are also edgy about what the US Federal Reserve will announce tomorrow, at its final policy meeting of the year. Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s latest blast towards the Fed has only intensified the pressure, as the central bank tries to normalise policy without choking off growth. A tricky task, with Wall Street suffering one of its worst December\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ever.... Goodnight! GW US treasury secretary Stephen Mnuchin has a theory -- the market turmoil is due to two factors -- high-frequency trading, and regulations brought in after the last financial crisis. Mnuchin singled out the Volcker Rule, which prevents banks from banks from taking risky bets with their own money, or pumping it into hedge funds. This, Mnuchin claims, is removing liquidity and making market moves more abrupt. He told Bloomberg: In my opinion, market structure has led to a lot more volatility. Part of this is a combination of the market presence of high-frequency traders combined with the Volcker Rule.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a theory... however, HFT and the Volcker Rule have both been around for years, so they can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be the only cause. Plus, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no secret that the White House want to roll back the Dodd-Frank rules (of which Volcker is part), despite concerns it could lead to more reckless behaviour. Get caught up on the markets: The US stock market is clinging onto its gains, with the S&amp;P 500 still up almost 1% today. Oil, though, continues to wallow at 15-month lows as traders anticipate weak demand in 2019. Stock market analyst Ronnie Chopra suspects that some UK companies are now vulnerable to a takeover bid, following recent stock market losses.... Newsflash: Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s blue-chip stock index has just hit its lowest closing level in over two years. Amid worries over the global economy, and Brexit, the FTSE 100 has closed 71 points lower at 6701. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s its lowest closing level since November 2016 (although it fell below 6700 earlier this month in intraday trading). National Grid is the biggest faller, down 9%, after energy regulator Ofgem announced a shake-up that could cut bills. Energy firms BP and Royal Dutch Shell are also among the big fallers, tracking the slump in the oil price today. Technology, healthcare, and telecoms firms also had a bad day, while consumer-focused stocks also lost ground. European stock markets also fell today; the Stoxx 600 lost 0.6% as investors worry that the global economy is weakening. The Brent crude oil price has also slumped to its lowest level in over a year. Brent, sourced from the North Sea, is down almost 4% at $57.28, the lowest since October 2018. Despite today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s small recovery, this month is turning into one of the worst December\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s in Wall Street\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s history. Indeed, Reuters has calculated that it could be the worst December since the Great Depression.... Global growth fears are sending the oil price sliding again. US crude has dropped below $48 per barrel for the first time since mid-September, 2017, extending recent losses. That indicates traders believe excessive supply, and lacklustre growth, will keep crude prices down in 2019. Back in London, the FTSE 100 is falling close to a two-year low. The blue-chip index is now down 52 points, or 0.75%, at 6,721. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s less than 20 points away from the 25-month low struck earlier this month. Although Wall Street is still up, a 1% rise isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t anything to shout about - given the Dow lost 2% on both Friday and Monday. David Madden of CMC Markets thinks the rally lacks conviction, despite the welcome pick-up in US house-building reported today. Equity markets have bounced back today, but the upward move hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t been driven by anything, and that is a little worrying, as it might just be a mixture of short covering and bargain hunting. The severe sell-off that was endured yesterday is still fresh in traders\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 minds, and there is a sense that dealers want to get tomorrows Fed announcement out of the way, before formulating their next move. For a change, there was some upbeat housing data from the US. Building permits ticked up to 1.32 million in November, which topped the forecast of 1.25 million. Keep in mind, the October reading was 1.26 million. The housing starts reading was 1.25 million, which was an improvement on the 1.21 million in October. Admittedly, these figure weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t amazing, but they are a bright spot on a largely bleak housing figures. The Wall Street rally is being led by consumer-focused companies including Nike (+2.4%), and Visa (+1%). Industrial firms such as Boeing (+3.75%) and General Electric (+3.6%) are also up, as are financial stocks such as JP Morgan (+1.8%). The dollar, meanwhile, is dipping as investors brace for the Federal Reserve meeting tomorrow night. Fawad Razaqzada of FXTM explains: The greenback has been undermined by growing speculation that, at best, the Federal Reserve will deliver a dovish rate hike, while there is a possibility \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a small possibility, but a possibility nonetheless \u00e2\u20ac\u201c that it could even hold off hiking altogether. Most sectors of the US stock market are up, as traders try to shake off the pessimism gripping the markets. Bank share are rallying, after several tough weeks. But still, the overall picture is gloomy: Ding Ding! Wall Street is open, and shares are trying to recover after yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rout. The Dow Jones industrial average has gained 197 points at the open, or 0.85%. The broader S&amp;P 500 has gained 0.75%, after hitting a 14-month low yesterday. The Nasdaq index, focused on tech stocks, has gained almost 1%. Economist Ian Shepherdson makes a good point about the US housing stats: Just in: Home construction in America accelerated last month, in a sign that the economy can handle higher interest rates (whatever Donald Trump tweets). New housing starts jumped by 3.2% last month to an annual rate of 1.256 million, the Commerce Department says. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a seven-month high. The number of permits handed out for future housing projects also rose, up 5% compared with October. However... construction of single-family homes dropped to an 18-month low; the rise in housing starts was mainly due to more multi-family housing projects. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s some snap reaction: Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s CNBC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s take: Investors are fleeing stocks and buying bonds in record numbers amid the global sell-off in equities, according to a December survey of fund managers released on Tuesday. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Investors are approaching extreme bearishness ... this month\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s survey [found] the biggest ever one-month rotation into the asset class\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd of bonds, Bank of America Merrill Lynch said in the survey. The research report is one of the most widely-followed surveys of investors on Wall Street. Phew! After two days of serious losses, Wall Street is expected to rally when trading begins in 80 minutes time. The Dow is predicted to rise by over 200 points, having shed more than 500 on Monday. The Financial Times (PAYWALL) is concerned by BAML\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s survey of investor confidence, showing they are the gloomiest since 2008. Their Adam Samson writes: Investors have made the largest-ever shift into bonds this month, according to a widely-watched survey that also showed bets on global equities falling to the lowest in two years as concern over the economic outlook increases. Global investors\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 net underweight position in bonds tumbled 23 percentage points in December to 35%, according to data released on Tuesday by Bank of America Merrill Lynch. It was the biggest change in the history of the survey and brings the underweight position to the lowest level since the Brexit vote in June 2016. BAML\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Michael Hartnett is also anxious, saying: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Investors are close to extreme bearishness.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Newsflash: Donald Trump has launched another broadside at the Federal Reserve, as America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s central bank begins its two-day policy meeting. Once again, Trump is urging the Fed not to raise interest rates on Wednesday. He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also unhappy about its \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcquantitative tightening\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 programme, which is currently taking $50bn out of the economy each month as the Fed unwinds its stimulus. Aviva Investors are also gloomy. Michael Grady, their chief economist, has predict that risk assets will give weaker returns in 2019, as global growth moderates. He writes: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153In a slowing growth environment, investors tend to focus more on downside risks. Although the economic backdrop continues to provide a basis for positive returns for risk assets, expectations of more moderate growth and tighter global liquidity, and the impact of those risks, justify more restrained positioning. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We prefer to be overweight in US and emerging market equities because of the expected relative growth outperformance. Valuations in Europe look more attractive in some areas, but downside risks such as Brexit and the Italian budget continue to weigh on the outlook. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We are moderately underweight government bonds as yields will continue to move higher on expectations that central banks will tighten policy in 2019. With spreads relatively tight by historical standards, we have a bigger underweight with regard to credit, including duration. Our preference is for European over US high yield due to its lower leverage and reduced sensitivity to oil prices. We have a slight preference for being long US dollars, with the main underweight against Australia on domestic challenges and Chinese growth risks.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Sound the alarm bells! Global investors are their gloomiest since the financial crisis, according to a new survey from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. BAML\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s monthly check on investor sentiment shows that 53% expect global growth to weaken over the next 12 months. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the worst outlook for the global economy since October 2008 (when the wheels were coming off the financial system). The survey shows that investors have been piling into the US dollar, and into bonds, rather than crowding into tech stocks. BAML also found that investors are shunning UK stocks. A net 39% of investors are \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcunderweight\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 on the UK, as they try to protect themselves from Brexit. Given the recent selloff, are stocks now actually cheap? Or just low, and heading lower? The City\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s finest minds are wrestling with this question as 2019 approaches. On some measures, shares are offering plenty of value, as this charts shows: The FTSE 100, for example, has lost 12% in 2018, meaning that many stocks are yielding more than a year ago (unless they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve slashed their dividend, or are going to...) Major US companies like Amazon, Apple and Facebook are offering better value than three months ago, having fallen by around 20% since September. But... that sort of thinking is scrambled, if the world economy is really cooling -- and today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s IFO data doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t do much for confidence. Back in January, investors were being criticised for holding onto cash..... but it doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t look such a bad call now. Financial experts are concerned that German business morale has fallen again this month, according to the IFO thinktank. IFO president Clemens Fuest says Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy appears to be cooling, with most industries sending \u00e2\u20ac\u0153bad signals\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd about their prospects (sending its business expectations measure to a 25-month low). Fuest told Bloomberg TV that: We think it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a permanent slowdown. Not a downturn, we still expect growth next year. Teis Knuthsen, CFI at Kirk Kapital (managing the wealth of descendants of the creator of Lego), fears that Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t rebound from its summer contraction. Joumanna Bercetche of CNBC is also concerned: Just in: German business morale has fallen, in another sign that Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest economy is struggling. IFO, the Munich-based thinktank, says its business climate index has dropped to just 101.0 this month, down from 102 in November. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s weaker than expected, and the fourth decline in a row. IFO\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s business expectations measure slumped to just 97.3, from 98.7. That may indicate that growth will be subdued in 2019. Last night\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Wall Street rout dragged even more US companies into \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcbear market territory\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 - more than 20% off their all-time high. Companies suffering this grizzly fate include tech giants such as Apple, Amazon, IBM, Netflix and Facebook, as this chart from Marketwatch shows. More here. Kit Juckes of Soci\u00c3\u00a9t\u00c3\u00a9 G\u00c3\u00a9n\u00c3\u00a9rale also blames president Xi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s speech for today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s gloom: There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s snow on the ground and gluhwein everywhere but the Christmas spirit is absent in financial markets. After a miserable afternoon for US equities, this morning actually started in a bright mood on the other side of the world, before President Xi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s lack of any encouragement for expectations of further reform gave markets the jitters. No white beard, no sleigh, not much bowing to external pressure\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no Christmas cheer in the markets today, says Hussein Sayed, chief market strategist at FXTM: December 2018 has so far been one of the ugliest Decembers in U.S. stock market history. The S&amp;P 500 declined 7.8% in 10 trading days and experienced the worst two-day selloff since October. Cheaper valuations, the U.S.-China trade truce, and dovish Fed commentary were not enough to put an end to falling stock markets. Santa Clause seems to have lost his way this year, defying hopes that stocks will rally towards the year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s end. Instead, institutional investors appear to be pulling out, taking whatever profits they have accumulated throughout this year. Splat! European stock markets have fallen in unison at the start of trading. Traders are taking their cue from Wall Street; last night\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s selloff continues to reverberate around the markets. The FTSE 100 is down 52 points, or 0.7%. David Madden of CMC Markets says growth concerns are \u00e2\u20ac\u0153festering\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. US stocks sold-off yesterday as dealers were concerned about the world economy, and there is also a fear the Federal Reserve are tightening their monetary policy too fast. The S&amp;P 500 fell to a new 2018 low, while the Russell 2000 entered a bear market. Asian equity markets sold-off overnight on the back of the negative move on Wall Street. Growth fears are also weighing on the oil price today. Brent crude has dropped by almost 2% this morning, to $58.51 per barrel. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s near November\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 14-month low. China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s president has disappointed the markets today. Xi Jinging launched a robust attack on other nations who demand Chines policy changes (yes you, America), in a high-profile speech marking 40 years of economic reform. Xi declared: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153No one is in a position to dictate to the Chinese people what should or should not be done. We must resolutely reform what should and can be changed, we must resolutely not reform what shouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t and can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be changed.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd However, he didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t match this tough talk with any firm details of new reforms to stimulate China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy, or open it up to competition. My colleague Lily Yuo explains: Xi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s speech comes as the Chinese leadership is facing criticism over slowing growth and confrontation with the US. Observers hoped his speech would lay out new directions or reforms needed to help the Chinese economy, weighed down by debt and lagging consumption, and an overly dominant state sector. Instead, Xi stressed that the Party\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s leadership and strategy up to now have been \u00e2\u20ac\u0153absolutely correct.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd He promised to support the state sector while continuing reforms in appropriate areas. His remarks lacked any detail about new policies and failed to inspire confidence in Asian markets. Hong Kong and Shanghai both dropped sharply during the speech. They are now off 1% for the day while losses have deepened to 1.8% in Tokyo and more than 1% in Sydney. More here: Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcTis the season to be jolly nervous! Global stock markets are being buffeted by worries over global growth and trade wars, while in the UK Brexit fears are causing serious angst in the retail sector. Last night, the US stock markets suffered yet another bruising selloff. The Dow Jones industrial average shed 507 points, or 2%, while the S&amp;P 500 lurched to a 14-month low. Wall Street has now suffered the worst start to a December since 1980. Markets in Asia-Pacific have followed suit, with Japan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Nikkei slumping by 1.8% and Australia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s S&amp;P/ASX 200 down 1.2%. Europe is also heading for a chilly bath at the open. The FTSE 100 is being called down 50 points, adding to yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 70-points slide, taking the Footsie close to last week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s two-year low. Investors seem to be badly worried that the world economy is slowing, and that China and the US won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t resolve their trade dispute. But the number 1 issue is whether America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Federal Reserve raises interest rates tomorrow night, and how hawkish or dovish it sounds about next year. US president Donald Trump piled even more pressure on the Fed on Monday, arguing it would be madness to raise interest rates. However, the Fed may feel that not hiking would cause more turmoil than hiking -- as the markets are expecting borrowing costs to go up again. Jasper Lawler of London Capital Group explains: The market\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s overriding fear is that the Fed will press ahead with plans to raise interest rates, which could be too much for the US economy to handle. An indication from the Fed that they will slow their pace of hikes could calm these jittery markets. However, until the Fed have confirmed that as a course of action, investors will remain skittish. The volatility index, also known as the fear gauge lifted 2.27 points to a seven-week high. The markets remain anxious about China too, following data last week showing that Chinese retail sales growth has hit a 15-year low, as industrial output growth softens. UK retailers, meanwhile, will be desperately hoping that shoppers come out in force this week. The sector has been rocked by yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s profit warning from online clothing group Asos, after a slump in trading in November.

John Stevenson, a retail analyst at the City broker Peel Hunt, said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Those retailers that will be successful will not have massive stores with long leases and are relevant to their customer. They are absolutely focused on putting the customer first.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd But he said Debenhams was likely to miss its profit targets due to unseasonably warm weather, low consumer confidence and increased competition from online, alongside the chain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s specific problems with tired stores and product ranges. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Even if it gets through Christmas and comes out the other side OK, the outlook is one of the most challenged retailers in the market,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Stevenson said.",

One Asda driver, who also wanted to remain anonymous, said a new \u00e2\u20ac\u0153dark store\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a warehouse laid out like a supermarket where the only \u00e2\u20ac\u0153customers\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd are packers \u00e2\u20ac\u201c didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have enough capacity for the number of vans it was serving. That meant more substituted items, and more disgruntled customers, he said. An alternative, pioneered by Ocado, has robots bringing the items to the packers, who can finish a shop in five minutes. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re still in the early stages of online food, and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s all about market share,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Richard Lim of analyst Retail Economics. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Retailers are really investing in the long-term potential of online. But their margins are wafer- thin: a typical \u00c2\u00a380 food order costs \u00c2\u00a35 to pick and \u00c2\u00a35 to deliver. Retailers are working on about 4% to 5% margins so they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re not making any discernible profit from this.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Supermarkets and retailers are all nervous about Christmas. Operating costs are rising faster than profits, creating a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153really hostile\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd environment for shops, Lim said. Saturday daytime \u00e2\u20ac\u0153footfall\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the number of people visiting shops in high streets, retail parks and shopping centres \u00e2\u20ac\u201c is 10% down on last year, according to analyst Springboard, which believes Boxing Day footfall will be down 5.2%. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Wages are up and inflation is down,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Lim said, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153which would suggest there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s more spending power. But that differs massively among income groups.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd He cited an income tracker by Asda and the Centre for Economics and Business Research that shows the poorest 20% of households have seen their discretionary spending fall every month since June 2016. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Overall, I think Christmas is going to be tough this year.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd",

                "bodyText":"With City traders are now scrambling to the shops, the bar, or the pile of unfinished wrapping, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time to, err, wrap up here too. So, to quickly recap. The UK stock market has slumped to a new two-year closing low, on the final trading day before Christmas. The FTSE 100 dropped 35 points, or 0.5%, to 6685, its weakest close since September 2016. The traditional Santa Rally is officially cancelled (we can only speculate about what traders did to deserve such losses). The selloff means that \u00c2\u00a376bn has been wiped off the FTSE 100 this month, as world markets have suffered one of their worst Decembers ever. As David Jones, Chief Market Strategist at Capital.com, put it: As stock markets wind down for Christmas there is only one thing that we can be sure of - there was no Santa Rally. It has been a terrible month for investors - so far the Dow Jones is on track for its worst December since 1932, having lost 12% for the month as of last Friday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s close. Investors will be glad of some time off from the massive sides - but it does not bode well for 2019. The FTSE 250 index of medium-sized companies also took a pre-Christmas bath, dropping 0.75% to its lowest level since November 2016. Investors continue to worry that the global economy is weakening, and anxious that Donald Trump could attempt to fire Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell. Treasury secretary Steven Mnuchin has caused fresh jitters, by announcing that he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been speaking to America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s top bankers to check they have enough liquidity. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s worrying investors in America. The New York stock market has just opened in the red, with the Dow Jones industrial average has opened lower. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s probably all for today from London. Hope you all have a lovely festive break. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be back when the markets reopen on Thursday. Merry Christmas! GW Congratulations to anyone who finds a steak bake in their stocking tomorrow..... The French stock market is also lacking any pre-Christmas fizz. The CAC index, which tracks the biggest French companies, is down 1.5% today at its lowest level in over two years. Further confirmation that it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been a rough year for shares around the world, with US banks and emerging markets doing particularly badly. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the Press Association\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s take: The FTSE 100 index closed at its lowest level in two years on Christmas Eve as an attempt by the US treasury secretary to reassure investors mis-fired. In a half-day session, the blue-chip index closed down 35.18 points, or 0.52%, at 6,685.99, its lowest level since September 2016. US Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin called the heads of the six largest American banks to check if they had enough cash to see them through any market downturn. The move was an effort to reassure investors about the US government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s partial shutdown over budget spending for a border wall with Mexico and speculation that President Donald Trump is considering firing US Federal Reserve chairman Jay Powell. Fiona Cincotta, a senior market analyst at City Index, said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The stand-off between President Trump and Congress over the financing of the Mexican wall seems set to continue into January with the US government unable to pass any laws in the near future. All of the markets are slightly distorted today because of lower than usual volumes and a short trading day. With the London stock market closed, traders can make a late dash to the shops! And they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll find them quite busy. Consultancy firm Springboard reports that there is a last-minute surge in Christmas shopping. Footfall this morning was +10.3% higher than yesterday, and 6.8% above last year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Christmas Eve. Financial experts are continuing to criticise US Treasury secretary Steven Mnuchin, over his attempts to reassure the markets: Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Bloombeg\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Tim O\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Brien. Stephen Innes of OANDA is also unimpressed by Mnuchin\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s public declarations not to panic: Honestly, this would be comic if it wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t so tragic as the name is ridiculous and depressing the same time, the ultimate markets tragicomedy unfolds. It is getting so bad out here that investors might be in the midst of giving up on the US administrations policies, voting with their feet and fleeing risk markets en masse. Newsflash: Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s blue-chip stock index has closed at its lowest level in over two years, as the stock market selloff refuses to end. The FTSE 100 has ended the shortened Christmas Eve trading session at 6685 points, down 35 points or 0.5%. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s its lowest closing price since 14 September 2016 [but 40 points above last week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s intraday lows] This means that the FTSE 100 has lost more than 4% in December alone, wiping out \u00c2\u00a376bn of shareholder value since the end of November. For 2018 as a whole, the Footsie is down 13% this year, in a grim 12 months for investors around the globe. The traditional Santa rally has clearly not come to the City this year. Since the 1980s, there have only been six Decembers in which the FTSE 100 didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t rise. 2018 is very likely to be another one. Economic growth worries, the US government shutdown, trade tensions, and Brexit have all taken their toll this month. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s efforts to calm the markets, by announcing that the top US banks have enough liquidity, may not be helping. As the Financial Times put it: The statement appeared to be an attempt by the administration to calm nerves after a volatile week for traders and media reports that President Donald Trump was contemplating firing Federal Reserve chairman Jay Powell. Win Thin, global head of currency strategy at Brown Brothers Harriman, warned that among traders, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153sentiment is so negative right now that markets will assume the worst\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd about any suggestion that Mr Trump could seek to remove Mr Powell. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Until this weekend, markets were not that concerned about liquidity or clearance issues,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Mr Thin said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153At best, Mnuchin made a rookie policy mistake in trying to reassure markets; at worst, Mnuchin knows something that the markets don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Shares are coming under more pressure in London, with just a few minutes trading left today. The FTSE 100 is now down 0.75%, or 51 points, as traders hear that Wall Street may open lower.... Global slowdown worries are also hitting commodity prices. Aluminium has hit a 16-month low this morning, as traders worry that demand for metals will weaken in 2019. Aluminium prices have also weakened since the US said it would lift sanctions on Russian producer Rusal last week. More here. Newsflash: Sky\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tireless City editor has a Christmas Eve scoop! Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE 250 index isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t getting any sprinkling of good cheer from Santa either. The index, which contains medium-sized, UK focused companies too small for the FTSE 100, has dropped 0.6% so far today - down 97 points at 17,345. Nearly every sector is in the red: Pharmaceuticals firm Indivior is the biggest faller, followed by gambling firms Playtech and 888 Holdings. Playtech warned shareholders this morning that a new Italian gambling law will hit its profits. More reaction to Steven Mnuchin\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision to convene a crisis team to calm the markets: As it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s nearly Christmas...... With an hour\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trading to go in London, the FTSE 100 is still in the red. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re currently off 23 points at 6689, a drop of 0.5%, meaning the Footsie could hit a new two-year closing low today.... 2018 is shaping up to be the worst year for the markets since the financial crisis of 2008. And there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s plenty of concern that 2019 will be tough too. Michael Hewson of CMC Markets says there are several reasons to worry: One of many reasons why investors have got more than a little spooked is down to valuations, the outlook for global growth, as well as concern over the direction of Fed policy, which has seen US yields slide sharply after peaking at multi year highs earlier this year. Uncertainty over the future direction of Fed policy has seen US policymakers start to resile from expectations around multiple rate rises next year, though markets still appear to be clinging to the possibility of one rate rise next year. The US-China trade dispute is another factor, as is Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s slowing economy and political tensions: There is also concern about the direction of travel in respect of the European growth story with Italy in danger of falling into recession in the last part of this year, while the young pretender to Angela Merkel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s crown as the head of Europe, Emmanuel Macron appears to have fallen flat on his face by neglecting France domestic policies in his desire for a more closely integrated Europe. This \u00e2\u20ac\u0153gilets jaunes\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd protests which have blighted Paris are a classic case of political deafness to an increasingly squeezed middle that is fed up with fuel tax rises and cost of living squeezes, while the more mobile tax base benefits from tax reductions. To take the sting out of this, President Macron has embarked on a massive spending giveaway which is likely to send the French budget deficit to 3.5% of GDP in 2019. World stock markets are suffering their seventh straight day of losses today, as rising pessimism pushes shares steadily down. Reuters has more details: MSCI\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s world equity index, which tracks shares in 47 countries, was 0.15 percent lower on the day and down almost 7 percent in the past seven sessions -- its worst stretch of daily losses since January 2016. The index is also just off its lowest level since March 2017. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153There are a whole number of factors that have triggered this latest risk off climate, including the Fed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s very modest deviation from its (rate hiking) plan and the government shutdown in the United States,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Investec economist Philip Shaw. The U.S. Senate has been unable to break an impasse over U.S. President Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s demand for more funds for a wall on the border with Mexico, and a senior official said the shutdown could continue until January 3. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We may get some clarity on several factors in early 2019 starting with a clearer line of sight on the prospect for a resolution in U.S.-China trade dispute, but until there are some nerves flying around,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Investec\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Shaw said. Anxiety over the economic and political outlook in 2019 is pushing the gold price higher. Gold has gained around six dollars per ounce today to $1,262, which would be its highest closing value since last June: Bad new for any Wise Men who left their Christmas shopping to the last minute... Gold is traditionally seen as a safe store of value in troubled times (assuming you can find someone who wants to buy it then!). So the prospect of the global economy slowing next year, and the risk that the US government shutdown rumbles on, is good for bullion. David Jones, Chief Market Strategist at Capital.com, explains: Gold has been the shining performer in recent weeks. As uncertainty ramps up in other assets, gold has been enjoying something of a bounce back from its summer lows. It has risen by $100 an ounce since then, and is up by more than 6% over the past four months. If the wider uncertainty continues into 2019, gold could well retain its popularity and be a market to watch. (Prices weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t available for the frankincense and myrrh markets) It really has been a bleak month for shares in London. The FTSE 100 index (packed this top multinational companies) has shed around 300 points in December. It ended November at 6980 points, but is now hovering around 6684 points after several big losses. By my maths, that means some \u00c2\u00a376bn has been wiped off the blue-chip index this month. European bank shares are dipping this morning, as markets react to the news that America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock market crisis team is being convened. Financial stocks across Europe are down 0.8% on average, led by Romania\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Raiffeisen Bank (-4.3%). Clearly investors aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t overjoyed to learn that Treasury secretary Mnuchin has been on the phone to America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bank bosses, checking they have enough money.... Some of the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s latest technology companies have been hit hard by this autumn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s selloff. As this chart from the FT shows, Amazon and Apple have both lost a quarter of their value since the summer. Amazon, which was worth a staggering one trillion dollars in September, is now only valued at $673bn. Apple, which hit the $1tn mark first, is now valued at $715bn. Tech firms have been hurt by the US-China trade war, which threatens to hurt global growth as well as driving up import costs. The prospect of tighter regulation, following data protection scandals, have also weight on the sector. Naeem Aslam of Think Markets fears that Wall Street will also continue its December losses (having already slumped by more than 10% this month): US futures are trading lower as investors focus on the US partial government shutdown. The disappointing fact is that there is no immediate end in sight for this resolution... The ongoing downtrend would continue to dominate today and markets are likely to close lower again. The big fallers in London this morning are water group United Utilities (-3.4%), advertising group WPP (-2.7%) and tobacco group Imperial Brands (-2.3%). Mike van Dulken of Accendo Markets says there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s lots worrying investors right now, particularly from the Trump White House..... Markets are still under pressure from last week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s more hawkish update from the US Federal Reserve, exacerbating fears about slowing growth and more expensive refinancing following years of stimulus. This is on top of pre-existing trade war fears with the US Trade Secretary saying \u00e2\u20ac\u0153All auto tariff options still on the table\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. That said, China says it will remove some import and export tariffs on 1 Jan which has helped improve sentiment overnight. Countering this nugget of positivity, however, we have; 1) a US government shutdown (Senate Democrats refusing the President\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s demands for border wall funds); 2) US Defence Chief leaving even earlier than expected, and; 3) Treasury Secretary awkwardly calling Bank executives about market stability after a) market sell-off, b) government shutdown, and c) rumours the President asked if he could fire Fed Chair Powell. Mixed signals a plenty into Christmas! This morning\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s losses mean the FTSE 100 is only 40 points away from the 28-month low struck last week. And there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a strong risk that the Footsie will close at a new two-year low, as this chart shows: You can track Santa\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s progress via Norad (the North American Aerospace Defense Command), who have been motoring his progress every year for decades. But it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pretty obvious that he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not coming to trading floors in London, Paris, and Madrid. Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s main stock market indices are all in the red this morning, inflicting further losses on investor portfolios. In London, technology and telecoms firms, consumer groups, utilities and industrial firms are all down. Overnight, US treasury secretary Steven Mnuchin revealed he has spoken with the heads of America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s six largest banks. The move appears to be an attempt to reassure investors after the recent stock market losses, and anxiety over the government shutdown. Mnuchin tweeted that the CEOs told him they all have \u00e2\u20ac\u0153ample liquidity available for lending to consumer, business markets, and all other market operations\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a relief, except investors are now wondering WHY Mnuchin is so keen to reassure them.... Mnuchin is also planning to convene the president\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s working group on financial markets, later today. The group, created following the stock market crash of October 1987, is known more commonly as the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153plunge protection team\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and met in 2009 in the latter stages of the financial crisis. More here: Trading in Asia-Pacific stock markets has been weak, with the South Korean Kospi index and Hong Kong\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Hang Seng both dipping. Tokyo was closed, though, to mark the Japanese Emperor\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s birthday. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Despite its best efforts to be good all year, the City won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be getting a visit from Santa this year. After weeks of anxious trading, and occasional wild plunges, investors may be struggling to find a spare sixpence for the Christmas pudding. Slowdown worries, trade war fears, Brexit...the list of factors blamed for the rout are as familiar as Santa\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s herd of reindeer. And even Rudolph\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s famously colourful nose would be overshadowed by the sea of red that engulfed the markets this month. During December, the FTSE 100 has tumbled by 3.7%, and is down a painful 12.5% during 2018. Wall Street has been harder hit - the S&amp;P 500 has lost 12% this month alone! Unless there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a massive rebound soon, we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be looking at the worst December since the Great Recession. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s is only a half-day trading session, giving traders (and live-bloggers!) the opportunity for some last-minute gift-shopping. But there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no festive spirits in the City this morning; the Footsie is expected to fall by 45 points, back towards last week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 28-month low. Donald Trump continues to worry the markets. Over the weekend, there were several reports that the president has discussed whether he could sack Federal Reserve governor Jerome Powell. Treasury secretary Steven Mnuchin has denied this, adding that Trump realises he can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t dismiss Powell anyway. But still, the attacks on Powell - on top of the US government shutdown - are a worry. As Steven Innes of trading firm OANDA says: Honestly, I couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t believe my eyes when I read the Bloomberg headline over the weekend that Trump was considering firing Powell. Markets rise on confidence as well as economic growth and coming off one of the worst weeks since GFC; one would have expected more reassuring comments from the Whitehouse Thankfully Mnuchin came to the rescue to squash any thought\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s of this happening as I was about to crazy glue my \u00e2\u20ac\u0153sell button\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd down at Monday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s open. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s nothing in the economic calendar today, but we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be watching for any pre-Christmas developments....",

Much of the headwinds have come out of Washington. On Christmas Eve Trump tweeted: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The only problem our economy has is the Fed. They don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have a feel for the Market, they don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t understand necessary Trade Wars or Strong Dollars or even Democrat Shutdowns over Borders. The Fed is like a powerful golfer who can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t score because he has no touch - he can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t putt!\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The latest attack contributed to Monday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sell-off and came as economists wrestled with a government shutdown, sparked by Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s attempts to fund his border wall with Mexico. That shutdown is now in its fifth day with no signs of a resolution. Trump has since tried to walk back his criticism of the Fed, telling reporters at the White House on Tuesday that while the Fed was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153raising interest rates too fast\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he still had confidence in the central bank. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I mean, the fact is that the economy is doing so well that they raised interest rates and that is a form of safety in a way,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said. Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at Spartan Capital Securities in New York, told Reuters that he expected markets to continue to rally as investors looked for bargains. But he warned there was probably more volatility ahead. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcbear grip\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 is feeding on itself as Trump continues to spread uneasiness,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Cardillo.",

Its chairman, <strong>Keith Cochrane</strong>, chief executive, <strong>Richard Howson</strong><strong>,</strong> and former finance directors <strong>Zaf</strong><strong>ar Khan</strong> and <strong>Emma Mercer</strong> were eventually <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/feb/06/carillion-director-mp-executives-collapse\">branded \u00e2\u20ac\u0153delusional\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd by MPs</a> as the full extent of the failings at the company became clear in bruising hearings.

Those shares are worth about one-quarter of that now, after a torrid year for British retailers, affected by shoppers moving online, Brexit uncertainty and unseasonable weather. The sale might have been good timing \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 but the value of his remaining 18% stake has since been hammered and is down more than \u00c2\u00a3230m. The former boss \u00e2\u20ac\u201c who quit the company in March \u00e2\u20ac\u201c is not happy. Dunkerton reckons he could do a better job than its chief executive, Euan Sutherland, and has launched a comeback campaign.</p> <p>\u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 <strong>Bruce Ritchie</strong>, a Mayfair property developer who founded Residential Land, and <strong>David Meller</strong>, from the luxury good specialist Meller Group, are now better known as the men behind the Presidents Club.

In February, the committee <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/feb/20/mps-publish-full-unredacted-report-into-rbs-small-business-scandal\">made public a confidential report</a> by the Financial Conduct Authority into misconduct at Royal Bank of Scotland\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s global restructuring group.</p> <h2>March</h2> <p>\u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 <strong>Michael Spencer</strong>, the City financier and former Conservative party treasurer, netted \u00c2\u00a3670m when the company he founded, Nex Group, was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/mar/29/michael-spencer-nex-takeover-cme-group\">bought by CME Group</a>, the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest exchange.</p> <p>\u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 <strong>Barbara Judge</strong> was chairwoman of the Institute of Directors and known as the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/mar/08/barbara-judge-profile-the-best-connected-woman-in-britain\">best-connected woman in Britain</a> until March. She had prestigious roles before becoming the IoD\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s first female head, but this ended in ignominy after allegations of racism and bullying within the organisation, which focuses on promoting good corporate governance.</p> <h2>April</h2> <p>\u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 <strong>Mike Coupe</strong>, the chief executive of Sainsbury\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s, shocked the retail world when the FTSE 100 company and its Walmart-owned rival Asda announced plans for a merger to create the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest supermarket.

The deal and his song, Sainsbury\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s insisted, were unconnected.</p> <p>\u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 <strong>Jeff Fairburn</strong>, a former chief executive of Persimmon, was handed a pay packet that was more like a lottery win, with a \u00c2\u00a3110m bonus after the housebuilder\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s profits were pumped up, in part by the government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s help-to-buy subsidy. In April, despite widespread outrage, investors <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/apr/25/persimmon-investors-revolt-bonus-pay-vote\">voted 51% to approve it</a> . Persimmon eventually cut Fairburn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bonus to \u00c2\u00a375m and he promised to set up a charitable foundation. Fairburn finally lost his job in November after a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/nov/07/persimmon-boss-asked-to-leave-amid-ongoing-outrage-over-bonus\">disastrous local TV interview</a>, but he keeps the money \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and there is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/dec/21/persimmons-former-ceo-jeff-fairburn-fails-to-set-up-charity-after-pledging-portion-of-75-million-bonus\">still no sign</a> of that charitable foundation.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a5023dcd0074dd223a191fc56f7fc0c0d65fa08b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a5023dcd0074dd223a191fc56f7fc0c0d65fa08b/0_978_4480_2688/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Liv Garfield, chief executive officer of Severn Trent.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Liv Garfield, the chief executive of Severn Trent.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bloomberg/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>May</h2> <p>\u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 <strong>Liv Garfield</strong>, the chief executive of Severn Trent and the FTSE 100\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s youngest female boss at 43, picked up Veuve \u00c2\u00adClicquot\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s prestigious Business Woman of the Year award. Garfield\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rapid ascent started at BT and she joined the water utility in 2014.

But then came a massive computer glitch, which resulted in millions of customers being locked out of their bank accounts, some for several weeks. Pester did not react well to questioning by MPs, and was forced to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/may/02/tsb-hires-law-firm-slaughter-and-may-to-investigate-it-chaos\">forfeit his bonus</a> in May. By September he was an ex-chief executive. </p> <h2>June</h2> <p>\u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 <strong>Sir Martin Sorrell</strong>, the former chief executive of WPP, had quite a year.

His departure came after allegations of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153personal misconduct\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, which he denied. In June came allegations that he had been spotted by colleagues entering premises in Mayfair <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2018/jun/12/the-allegations-against-wpps-former-chief-martin-sorrell-pile-up\">used by sex workers</a>. An investigation found there was no proof of misuse of company money and Sorrell, 73, has since bounced back with a new advertising company.</p> <p>\u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 <strong>Richard Branson</strong>, the billionaire owner of the Virgin empire, enjoyed a healthy bump in his already considerable wealth in June as CYBG, the owner of the Clydesdale and Yorkshire Bank brands, swooped for Virgin Money in a \u00c2\u00a31.7bn deal to create the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/jun/18/virgin-money-bought-clydesdale-bank-cybg\">UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sixth-largest lender</a>. Branson owned a 35% stake, and will continue to earn licensing revenues as the Virgin brand is extended across the UK.</p> <h2>July</h2> <p>\u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 <strong>Jeff Bezos</strong>, the founder and chief executive of Amazon, became the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/jul/27/amazon-founder-jeff-bezos-worlds-richest-man-bill-gates\">world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s richest person</a> as a result of rising technology share prices. By September, the company was worth $1tn (\u00c2\u00a3790bn) and Bezos was worth more than $160bn. Since then, tech stocks have fallen sharply.</p> <p>\u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 <strong>Sundar Pichai</strong>, Google\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chief executive, has had a tough year at the helm of the company whose motto used to be \u00e2\u20ac\u0153don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be evil\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd.

                "bodyText":"January \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Days into 2018, the government outsourcing and construction business Carillion collapsed into bankruptcy. Its chairman, Keith Cochrane, chief executive, Richard Howson, and former finance directors Zafar Khan and Emma Mercer were eventually branded \u00e2\u20ac\u0153delusional\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd by MPs as the full extent of the failings at the company became clear in bruising hearings. The bankruptcy is estimated to have cost the taxpayer \u00c2\u00a3150m. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Julian Dunkerton, the founder of Superdry, cashed out \u00c2\u00a318m in shares of the fashion retailer shortly before he quit the brand he started in 2003. Those shares are worth about one-quarter of that now, after a torrid year for British retailers, affected by shoppers moving online, Brexit uncertainty and unseasonable weather. The sale might have been good timing \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 but the value of his remaining 18% stake has since been hammered and is down more than \u00c2\u00a3230m. The former boss \u00e2\u20ac\u201c who quit the company in March \u00e2\u20ac\u201c is not happy. Dunkerton reckons he could do a better job than its chief executive, Euan Sutherland, and has launched a comeback campaign. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Bruce Ritchie, a Mayfair property developer who founded Residential Land, and David Meller, from the luxury good specialist Meller Group, are now better known as the men behind the Presidents Club. The all-male event was shut down after the Financial Times revealed alleged sexual harassment at a black-tie dinner, and shone a light on sexism in the City. Meller was forced to resign from the board of the Department for Education in the aftermath. February \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 The Conservative MP Nicky Morgan has set about chairing the Treasury select committee in the same spirit as her predecessors, holding the government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s feet to the fire on Brexit and keeping the financial sector on its toes. In February, the committee made public a confidential report by the Financial Conduct Authority into misconduct at Royal Bank of Scotland\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s global restructuring group. March \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Michael Spencer, the City financier and former Conservative party treasurer, netted \u00c2\u00a3670m when the company he founded, Nex Group, was bought by CME Group, the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest exchange. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Barbara Judge was chairwoman of the Institute of Directors and known as the best-connected woman in Britain until March. She had prestigious roles before becoming the IoD\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s first female head, but this ended in ignominy after allegations of racism and bullying within the organisation, which focuses on promoting good corporate governance. April \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Mike Coupe, the chief executive of Sainsbury\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s, shocked the retail world when the FTSE 100 company and its Walmart-owned rival Asda announced plans for a merger to create the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest supermarket. Coupe was then filmed, ahead of an interview on ITV, singing \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re in the money\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. The deal and his song, Sainsbury\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s insisted, were unconnected. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Jeff Fairburn, a former chief executive of Persimmon, was handed a pay packet that was more like a lottery win, with a \u00c2\u00a3110m bonus after the housebuilder\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s profits were pumped up, in part by the government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s help-to-buy subsidy. In April, despite widespread outrage, investors voted 51% to approve it . Persimmon eventually cut Fairburn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bonus to \u00c2\u00a375m and he promised to set up a charitable foundation. Fairburn finally lost his job in November after a disastrous local TV interview, but he keeps the money \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and there is still no sign of that charitable foundation. May \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Liv Garfield, the chief executive of Severn Trent and the FTSE 100\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s youngest female boss at 43, picked up Veuve Clicquot\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s prestigious Business Woman of the Year award. Garfield\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rapid ascent started at BT and she joined the water utility in 2014. But her biggest challenge could lie ahead: if Labour wins the next election, the water companies are top of John McDonnell\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s list for nationalisation. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 As chief executive of TSB, Paul Pester had big plans to make the high-street challenger a real force in British banking. But then came a massive computer glitch, which resulted in millions of customers being locked out of their bank accounts, some for several weeks. Pester did not react well to questioning by MPs, and was forced to forfeit his bonus in May. By September he was an ex-chief executive. June \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Sir Martin Sorrell, the former chief executive of WPP, had quite a year. He resigned abruptly in April from the company he transformed from a wire shopping basket manufacturer into a global marketing and advertising group. His departure came after allegations of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153personal misconduct\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, which he denied. In June came allegations that he had been spotted by colleagues entering premises in Mayfair used by sex workers. An investigation found there was no proof of misuse of company money and Sorrell, 73, has since bounced back with a new advertising company. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Richard Branson, the billionaire owner of the Virgin empire, enjoyed a healthy bump in his already considerable wealth in June as CYBG, the owner of the Clydesdale and Yorkshire Bank brands, swooped for Virgin Money in a \u00c2\u00a31.7bn deal to create the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sixth-largest lender. Branson owned a 35% stake, and will continue to earn licensing revenues as the Virgin brand is extended across the UK. July \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Jeff Bezos, the founder and chief executive of Amazon, became the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s richest person as a result of rising technology share prices. By September, the company was worth $1tn (\u00c2\u00a3790bn) and Bezos was worth more than $160bn. Since then, tech stocks have fallen sharply. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Sundar Pichai, Google\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chief executive, has had a tough year at the helm of the company whose motto used to be \u00e2\u20ac\u0153don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be evil\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. In July, Pichai had to contend with a \u00c2\u00a33.8bn fine and dressing down from the European commission after competition concerns on its Android operating system. Since then, there have been internal sexual harassment protests and a row over plans to produce a censored search engine for China. August \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Tim Cook, the chief executive of Apple, will for ever be the man who led the first listed company to a valuation of more than $1tn. However, the trillion-dollar landmark did not last long amid a deep market sell-off in October and concerns that iPhone sales growth was waning \u00e2\u20ac\u201c with particular attention on the troublesome Chinese market. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Elon Musk, the founder of Tesla, is hailed by many as a visionary, but even visionaries have to abide by market abuse rules. So when he tweeted in August \u00e2\u20ac\u201c reportedly while driving himself to work \u00e2\u20ac\u201c that he had \u00e2\u20ac\u0153funding secured\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd for a private buyout of the electric carmaker, an immediate investigation was launched. In October, the US Securities and Exchange Commission forced him to resign the role of chairman (though not chief executive) and fined the billionaire $20m. It was not Musk\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s only controversial moment this year \u00e2\u20ac\u201c he also called a British cave diver trying to rescue trapped Thai boys a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153pedo\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd (prompting a defamation lawsuit) and was pictured smoking marijuana while recording a podcast. September \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Rupert Murdoch, the billionaire owner of News Corporation, may have failed in his aim to take over the broadcaster Sky, but the \u00c2\u00a312bn payday for 21st Century Fox when it sold shares will probably sweeten the pill. Murdoch is also in the process of a separate $71.3bn sale of Fox to Disney. Comcast ended up paying \u00c2\u00a330bn for Sky, significantly more than the \u00c2\u00a318bn bid made by Fox in December 2016. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Dara Khosrowshahi, the chief executive of Uber, has tried to take a different path from its founder, Travis Kalanick, and his abrasive manner since taking over in August 2017. However, changing the ride-hailing company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s culture has proved to be no easy feat: Khosrowshahi was forced to apologise for the app\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s mistakes in London in September, a year after Transport for London moved to remove its licence in the capital. October \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 The former deputy prime minister Nick Clegg once said he was not very impressed by Facebook. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m not especially bedazzled by Facebook,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he wrote in 2016. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I actually find the messianic, Californian new-worldy, touchy-feely culture of Facebook a little grating.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd But then he lost his parliamentary seat and his career trajectory started to head south \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and took a new job in the US as global head of communications at Facebook. One of his top priorities will be to avoid a regulatory showdown with Brussels at a time when Facebook\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s policies and behaviour are under scrutiny, not least after Sheryl Sandberg was accused of condoning a smear campaign against the financier George Soros. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Sir Philip Green, the owner of Topshop\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s parent company, Arcadia, is no stranger to controversy, but this autumn he was named in parliament as the man behind multiple non-disclosure agreements. The NDAs still hold, but Green has denied \u00e2\u20ac\u0153unlawful sexual or racist behaviour\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. November \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Denise Coates, the chief executive of Bet365, is the best-paid woman in Stoke, and the rest of the world, for that matter. Coates turned her father\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bookmaker into one of the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest online gambling businesses. Her record \u00c2\u00a3265m annual pay packet provoked criticism, but it is a private, family owned company and she controls it. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Carlos Ghosn, the chief executive of Renault, apparently had little idea that he was about to be arrested and detained when he arrived in Tokyo in November. The Lebanese-Brazilian executive, who forged an alliance between France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Renault and Japan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Nissan and Mitsubishi, was shopped by Nissan for allegedly underreporting his income. The Japanese carmakers quickly ousted him from their boards, leaving the alliance \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and Ghosn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s freedom \u00e2\u20ac\u201c in the balance. December \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Ray Kelvin was probably the biggest name in retail no one had heard of \u00e2\u20ac\u201c until 300 former and current employees of his Ted Baker fashion business signed a petition on the campaigning website Organise complaining about his behaviour, including \u00e2\u20ac\u0153forced hugs\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and ear kissing. The company said Kelvin\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hugs were \u00e2\u20ac\u0153part of Ted Baker\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s culture, but are absolutely not insisted upon\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. But then details of an office brawl emerged \u00e2\u20ac\u201c which had earned Kelvin a formal warning \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and \u00e2\u20ac\u0153further serious allegations\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd eventually prompted the rag trade multimillionaire to take a leave of absence while an independent investigation is carried out. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 It has not been such a great year for Nick Robertson, the co-founder of Asos.

The British retail sector laboured during 2018, but analysts were taken aback by declining margins online at a time when most eyes were on the travails of the high street.",

My central expectation \u00e2\u20ac\u201c amidst a range of possible outcomes \u00e2\u20ac\u201c is that an extension to Article 50 will be requested to allow time for a second referendum as Parliament fails to coalesce around any outcome to deliver Brexit and instead abdicates its responsibility back to the people clothed in the claims that this presents the most democratic resolution of the issues. This will then likely lead to a vote to Remain, likely followed by a General Election.</p> <p>\u00e2\u20ac\u0153If that happens I believe the markets will continue to be volatile in early 2019 but will rally on the prospect of no Brexit.

                "bodyText":"Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the full story about the markets\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 bad year: Best wishes for 2019!! GW With the Dow up more than 200 points today, Wall Street could yet end a rough month on a moderately high note. As MarketWatch puts it: The Dow Jones Industrial Average (+0.84% today) has declined 9.7% thus far in December, while the S&amp;P 500 index (+0.5%) is down 9.9% during the period, and the Nasdaq Composite Index (+0.55%) is off 10.2% through Friday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s close. Those declines would represent the worst monthly drops since October 2008, according to FactSet data. For the year, the Dow is in line for a 6.7% loss, with the S&amp;P 500 down 7% and the Nasdaq Composite on pace for a 4.6% fall. Trading on Monday, however, was looking up after investors saw reasons to buy in recent tweets from President Donald Trump about putative trade-negotiation progress between himself and Chinese leader Xi Jinping via weekend phone conversations. At the risk of flattening your NYE fizz, there are plenty of reasons to fret about 2019. Weak retail spending, falling house prices, a new chapter in the eurozone crisis or a deeper US-China trade war could all herald a recession. As could Brexit....... Richard Stone, chief executive at The Share Centre, says Brexit is the key factor determining if the FTSE 100 recovers, or stumbles, in 2019. He writes: No one really knows how that is going to resolve itself and it would be a brave (or untruthful) person who said they did! My central expectation \u00e2\u20ac\u201c amidst a range of possible outcomes \u00e2\u20ac\u201c is that an extension to Article 50 will be requested to allow time for a second referendum as Parliament fails to coalesce around any outcome to deliver Brexit and instead abdicates its responsibility back to the people clothed in the claims that this presents the most democratic resolution of the issues. This will then likely lead to a vote to Remain, likely followed by a General Election. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153If that happens I believe the markets will continue to be volatile in early 2019 but will rally on the prospect of no Brexit. This will also likely result in a bounce in the value of Sterling which will temper the rise, or at least the pace of the rise, in the FTSE 100 slightly due to the overseas earnings component of many of the FTSE\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s constituents. The other factor, of course, is Donald Trump: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Away from Brexit more volatile US politics and potentially increased trade tensions as President Trump continues to promote an \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcAmerica First\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 agenda as he starts his re-election campaign will likely weigh on US markets or at the very least cause them to be more volatile. We have already seen some of this since the mid-term elections in November 2018. Plus, the FAANG stocks (Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix, and Google/Alphabet) face a crunch year: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Finally, the drive towards greater regulation and taxation of the tech giants will likely weigh on some of their performance. Personal investors will need to be alive to trying to identify the new emerging companies or trends. On Twitter, the economics team at ACS Hillingdon International School are asking whether this year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s losses are a buying opportunity. I certainly don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t give investment advice #CaveatEmptor . But here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Laith Khalaf, senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown: \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcThe UK stock market has definitely felt the heat of the Brexit burn in 2018, with domestically-focused UK companies finding themselves under pressure as politicians seem unable to agree on the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s withdrawal from the EU. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s actually been a pretty poor year for markets globally though; Europe, Japan and Emerging Markets are all sharply down on the beginning of the year, and while the US has held up better, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s still in negative territory, and has witnessed a pretty dramatic fall in the last three months.We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re unlikely to see the gloom lift in January. Brexit looks set to reach a parliamentary crescendo, and a swathe of trading updates from the UK high street isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t likely to lighten the mood. Despite the negative sentiment, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s unwise to bet on the direction of the stock market in the short term, as it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s prone to defy expectations, sometimes for the better, sometimes for the worse. The appeal of putting long term savings to work in the stock market still remains, though investors who are concerned about its immediate prospects should consider drip-feeding money in gradually, to take advantage of any dips.\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Over in New York, investors are attempting to inject some New Year jollity into proceedings. The Dow Jones industrial average is up around 0.6%, or 150 points, at 23212 points, as Wall Street\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s worst December since 1931 heads towards the exit. After 2018\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s losses, what might next year have in store for investors, and everyone else? Andrew Milligan, Head of Global Strategy at Aberdeen Standard Investments, believes 2019 will be a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153middling year from an economic point of view\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. He told us: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The world economy is not in a bad place at the start of 2019. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve talked of the slowdown in Europe and China, but it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s still trend growth. America is above trend and will decelerate during the course of this year, but there are very few signs, currently, of any major economic problems in the immediate future. The oil price is lower, which helps. The Fed has hinted that it will not be as aggressive. Inflation is not a concern. There are debt issues out there. China remains the most worrying one. Housing markets in some countries are stretched. There is emerging market debt in some countries.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Milligan said a potential downside could be a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153negative feedback loop\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd caused by falling share prices, discouraging companies and consumers from spending. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Confidence and sentiment do matter. One can just see people being more cautious about spending and investing and the economies, just as we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve seen in Europe this year, slow and slow. That would be an adverse headwind.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd He added that potential upside could come from Trump and Xi coming to agreements to resolve the US-China trade dispute. The US stock market may manage a last-ditch rally, after Donald Trump tweeted that he was making progress over trade talks with China. UK housebuilders also had a rough 2018, hit by Brexit worries. Taylor Wimpey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s market capitalisation has slumped by a third, while Berkeley Group are down 17%. Shares in tobacco firms went up in smoke this year. British American Tobacco lost half its value during 2018, tumbling in November when US regulators proposed a major crackdown on menthol cigarette sales. But online grocery retailer Ocado bucked the gloom, almost doubling in value this year after securing deals to supply its technology to overseas supermarkets. Stock markets across Europe have had a torrid year, with all the main indices shedding at least 10%. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the damage: UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE 100: down 12.5% in 2018 German DAX: down 18% French CAC: down 11% Italian FTSE MIB: down 16% Spanish IBEX: down 14.9% The London stock exchange have confirmed that \u00c2\u00a3242bn was wiped off the companies which make up the FTSE 100 during 2018. Here are some more facts from the LSE: FTSE 100 highest point in 2018 was 7877.45 on 22 May 2018 FTSE 100 lowest point in 2018 was 6585.91 on 27 December 2018 Last time FTSE 100 closed down at year end was 31 December 2015: -4.93% Highest % daily rise in 2018 was on 5 April: +2.35% Highest % daily fall in 2018 was on 6 December: -3.15% Newsflash: Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock market has suffered its worst year since the financial crisis. The FTSE 100, which tracks the biggest companies listed in London, has shed 12.5% of its value this year -- or more than \u00c2\u00a3240bn (by my maths). The Footsie has just closed down 5 points at 6,728 points. It started this year at 7,687 points, before being rocked by fears over the global economy, fuelled by trade wars anxiety, and Brexit uncertainty. The FTSE\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s poor performance has helped to drag global markets deep into the red too. As explained earlier, the MSCI index of global stocks has fallen by around 11% during 2018, while the Chinese market has tanked by a quarter. The pound is ending the year with a small rally. Sterling is up 0.5% against the US dollar at $1.277, and 0.6% higher against the euro at \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.116. These are the highest levels since Theresa May was forced to postpone the parliamentary vote on her Brexit deal, to avoid a huge defeat. The government continues to push for improvements to May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s deal, to assuage MP\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s concerns over the Irish backstop. But there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s still no breakthrough. What a difference a year makes! On the last trading day of 2017, City traders were celebrating the news that the FTSE 100 had hit a new all-time high. As we blogged at the time, the blue-chip index gained over 7% during the year to finish at 7,687 points. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s more than 12% higher than today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s levels. Other countries did even better, helping to drive globe stocks up by a sizzling $9 trillion during the year. Analysts at Mizuho Bank have cautioned against getting carried away by Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s claim that he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s held \u00e2\u20ac\u0153very good\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd talks with Chinese president Xi Jinping. They told clients: Whilst President Trump has lauded \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcbig progress\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 in trade talks with China following a phone call with Xi during the weekend, it remains to be seen how much this can boost investor confidence given that market reaction on recent positive development has largely been muted. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve seen plenty of dramatic scenes at the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock exchanges this year, with traders wallowing in gloom as shares crash, or beaming with delight as shares recovered. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s delivered a bumper crop of photos from the trading floors, and no-one sums up the mood better than veteran trader Peter Tuchman - who has a real knack for capturing the state of play. My colleague Dominic Rushe caught up with Tuchman, and reports: Like most celebrities in real life, Tuchman is smaller than he looks. Twin clouds of white hair, echoed by snowy facial fuzz, frame a bald pate that slopes gently down to expressive eyes on a face that seems perpetually in motion, as are his hands and feet. Tuchman is a human emoji, a one-man metaphor for the mood of the market. But don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be fooled by the clowning \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Tuchman is a cool cat. What you are seeing is not necessarily what he is thinking. Tuchman, 60, came late to fame. The born-and-bred New Yorker had already been working on the floor of the NYSE for some 20 years when he first made the front pages. It was 2007 and the financial crisis was dominating the news cycle. On another day of wild swings Tuchman, snapped mouth agog, appeared on the front of the New York Post. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I had just received the bill for my son\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s barmitzvah and it was way more money than I anticipated,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd jokes Tuchman. But Tuchman\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s jollity has a serious side too: His sangfroid, Tuchman says, comes from his parents. Marcel and Shoshana Tuchman were Holocaust survivors who were imprisoned in Auschwitz and Bergen-Belsen. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153My father was a slave laborer for Siemens Corporation, which is still a public company here,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he says, nodding ruefully at the trading floor. His grandmother was murdered in front of his father, most of whose family were also murdered by the Nazis. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153As was my mother\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he says. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153My father went up against Josef Mengele, the death doctor [who performed deadly experiments on Auschwitz prisoners], as did my mother. My mother\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s whole family was gassed. They could have come out of that, you know, being angry and depressed, negative-minded people; they didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t. There are two options in this thing. You can come out of challenges trying to devour every day and looking at life as if the cup is half-full or you come from a negative point of view that you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re a victim and the cup is half-empty. I vote for the former.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Marcel Tuchman, who worked until he was 93 teaching medicine, died earlier this month aged 97. His son was back at work the next day. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153My father always said: \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcWhen I die, cry and go to work.\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 That was his advice.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the full piece: Fiona Cincotta of City Index points out that UK-focused companies are having a decent morning (after a pretty ropey year). The FTSE opened the last trading day of the year a touch higher with a mixture of consumer, property and mining companies making moderate gains. With the pound firmer against the euro and the dollar, FTSE gainers were mostly companies with a strong domestic focus except for miners which were helped by stronger copper and oil prices. Unless Wall Street manages the mother of all rallies today, it will suffer its worst December since the Great Depression. With less than two hours trading to go in London, the FTSE 100 is up 17 points at 6751. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 12% lower than this time last year.... Holger Schmieding of German bank Berenberg suggests there are four \u00e2\u20ac\u0153extraordinary political mistakes\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd which might trigger fresh market mayhem in 2019. They are: for Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s radical government to plunge their country into a genuine Greek-style debt crisis; for Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s mostly pro-EU political class to simply let the train roll towards and then over the hard Brexit cliff instead of using the ten weeks between the likely death of May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Brexit deal and Brexit day on 29 March 2019 to stop it through a softer Brexit option or a new vote to stay in the EU; for Donald Trump to hurt the US economy and impair his chances of re-election in late 2020 by going too far in his costly trade wars in 2019; for China to let a hard landing happen instead of using its ample policy toolbox to smooth the inevitable slowdown in cyclical momentum and trend growth. Now the good news. He doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re particularly likely... For example, Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s budget passed last night, showing that the EU and markets have imposed some rudimentary discipline on Rome. Separately, Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s latest musings on progress in talks with China support hopes that both sides will try to strike some deal in coming months even if some of the thorny issues between the geostrategic rivals will probably not be fully resolved for many years. So, Schmieding suspects that markets may pick up during 2019: Chances are that, after a rocky start to the New Year, a less negative narrative can unfold later in 2019. That we have finally put an unexpectedly difficult 2018 behind us need not remain the only reason to celebrate the advent of a New Year tonight. Hong Kong\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock exchange managed a last-minute rally today. The Hang Seng jumped by 1.3%, lifted by Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s latest optimistic tweet about the trade negotiations with China. But that still leaves the index down 13.6% for 2018, its worst year since 2011. The last 12 months have proved difficult for investors in stock markets around the world as fears over global growth mount up, and for many owners of commodities 2018 has proven equally tricky, my colleague Jasper Jolly writes: Prices for oil and gold, two of the most traded commodities, are both set to fall for the first calendar year since 2015. Futures for Brent crude oil, the North Sea benchmark, gained a dollar in value today, but that has not been enough to recover losses for 2018, which currently stand at around 18%. Fears of a supply glut amid weakening growth in China and other major economies depressed prices to just over $54 per barrel. Losses for West Texas Intermediate, the American benchmark, have been steeper, at 23%. Gold is seen as the financial safe haven par excellence, but it is on course to suffer its first annual decline in three years. Gold futures prices slumped from above $1,350 per troy ounce in the spring to below $1,200 in the late summer. They have since recovered for a 2% fall during 2018 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c stronger than the performance of silver, prices of which have fallen by 9%. Cocoa was the top gainer among major traded commodities in 2018, leading a field of strong performances from a select group of agricultural commodities. Cocoa futures prices have gained more than 27%. Speculators looking further afield at cryptocurrencies \u00e2\u20ac\u201c which share some characteristics with commodities \u00e2\u20ac\u201c would not have been rewarded. Those who had bought bitcoin at the end of 2017, near the height of the cryptocurrency mania, would have lost almost three-quarters of their money. Naeem Aslam of Think Markets blames monetary policy tightening by the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s central banks for this year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s losses. The Fed stopped printing easy money a few years back and increased the interest rates four times this year. The European Central Bank also ended up its quantitative easing program and there has been several discussion on the topic of the ECB normalising the interest rates. All in all, almost all the European indices are down more than 10 percent over this year and some of them are down over 15% (DAX) for this year. The Euro Stoxx 500 index is down by 13% this year\u00e2\u20ac\u201dthe biggest loss since 2008. The fact is that things aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t looking really any brighter in 2019 as well because there are plenty of risk events which are going to keep investors on their toes. For instance, at the beginning of the year, the first thing which investors will have to deal with is the Brexit chaos the UK leaving the European union. Then we have the US trade war with China and the ongoing struggle about securing the funds to build the wall. Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s claim that he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s making \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcbig progress\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 in the trade negotiations with China may be giving world markets a small boost today. Wall Street is expected to open higher in a few hours time, following the news that presidents Trump and Xi spoke over the weekend. European stock markets have started trading, but there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s little drama yet. In London the FTSE 100 index has gained 10 points, led by online supermarket Ocado (+2.1%), budget airline easyJet (1.7%) and web estate agent RightMove (1.5%). The French CAC has gained 0.5%, with Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s IBEC up 0.4% and the Netherland\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s AEX up 0.3%. So with trading thin, and little news about, European stocks seem certain to suffer their worst year since 2008, as this chart shows. Australia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock exchange has closed for the year, after yet another day of losses. The S&amp;P/ASX200 index dipped by 0.14%, taking its combined losses in 2018 to over 9% - the worst year since 2011. Another reason to worry about China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy: In a worrying signal for 2019, China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s manufacturing sector is now contracting. The official factory Purchasing Managers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Index (PMI) fell to 49.4 in December, official data shows, a two-year low. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s below the 50-point mark that shows if activity rose or fell. Manufacturers were hit by falling orders, with new export orders dropping for the seventh month in a row. That suggests the tariffs imposed on Chinese goods at the US border are hitting demand. Mike Van Dulken of City firm Accendo Markets says this data \u00e2\u20ac\u0153may fan the flames of concern about slowing global growth\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. More here. China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock markets have suffered a particularly bleak 2018. The Shanghai composite index has crashed by 25% this year, leaving investors suffering very heavy losses. The trade war with the US has acted like a lead weight on many stocks, of course, but there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also concern that China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy is weakening. My colleague Lily Kuo explains: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153People have started to reduce or even stop spending money because they don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t expect the economy will perform well,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Ye Tan, an independent economist based in Shanghai. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Companies and individuals are wary about the economy.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Going into 2019, China faces not just a slowing economy but also a protracted trade war with the US, a pile of debt that threatens the world economy along with the Chinese financial system, and a populace demanding better environmental, labour, and health protections. Shanghai is closed today, as China prepares for the New Year celebrations. Investors deserve the break. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the final day of the year, and many investors will forgiven for wishing \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcgoodbye and good riddance\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 to 2018. The last 12 months have been pretty tough in the markets. Global stocks have suffered their worst losses since the financial crisis of 2008, wiping around 11% off the MSCI All Country World Index of stocks. In London, the FTSE 100 is limping towards the end of a rough year. The blue-chip index has shed 12% of its value since the start of January, hitting a series of two-year lows -- in a blow to pension funds and savers big and small. The big worry is that the long bull market, which reared up after the great recession ended in 2009, is now over. Anxiety over trade wars, a slowing global economy, Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s increasingly erratic behaviour and US interest rate hikes have all hurt stocks this year. In Europe, the tortuous Brexit negotiations and the long-running row between Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s populist government and Brussels have also worried investors. Trevor Greetham of Royal London Asset Management explains: We were surprised at the ferocity of the selloff in December which we put down to rising nervousness about the US-China trade dispute, an ill-judged and poorly communicated rate hike from the US Federal Reserve and an increasingly erratic pattern of behaviour from President Trump as the Mueller investigation into Russian collusion enters its final stages. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The last couple of weeks have seen a surprise unilateral decision to pull all US troops out of Syria, threats of a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153very long\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd government shutdown if Congress refuses to fund the Mexican border wall and a counterproductive attempt to blame the Fed for market weakness when it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the trade war that investors are most worried about. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Elsewhere in the world Theresa May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chaotic postponement of the meaningful vote on the EU Withdrawal Bill has added to the jittery mood in markets, raising as it does the risk of a No Deal Brexit that would damage both the UK and euro area economies. But perhaps investors are too gloomy. Over the weekend, Donald Trump and Xi Jinping both made positive noises about a breakthrough in their trade talks, offering hope that deeper tariffs can be avoided. That is likely to give traders some much-needed optimism today. European markets are expected to open higher today, in a shortened trading session (although Germany and Italy will be closed).",
