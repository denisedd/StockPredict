                "bodyText":"Finally, here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Sarah Butler on Mike Ashley\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s views on the high street crisis: Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s high street might be in better shape if it could sell tickets to watch Mike Ashley in action. In an eye-catching performance, the man behind Sports Direct has unveiled a new plan to tackle Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s high street -- a tax on web retailers, to encourage them to keep high bricks-and-mortar outlets running too. Under Ashley\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s plan, any retailer which did more than 20% of its business online would be hit by the tax. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not my fault the high street\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s dying, is it? It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not House of Fraser\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fault, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not Marks &amp; Spencer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fault, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not Debenham\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fault. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s very simple why the high street is dying - it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the internet. The internet is killing the high street. He suggested this would catch Sports Directs itself, but it was worth it to resuscitate the high street. Sports Direct won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be pleased with me for my suggestion. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not necessarily a good fix for Sports Direct , but it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a fantastic fix for the high street. Ashley\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s plans sounds like a twist on the digital services tax which chancellor Philip Hammond announced in October\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s budget. Ashley, though, insisted that the high street was otherwise doomed, saying: The high street won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t make 2030, it won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get there, unless you do something really radical and grab the bulls by the horns. Ashley also criticised landlords for using \u00e2\u20ac\u0153prehistoric\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd rents, including some which can only be revised higher each year. This has put some retailers into a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153downward death spiral\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, the retail chief claimed, adding: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Everybody has to come together and look at this. I know it sounds very socialist, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m not this crazy capitalist that everybody thinks I am.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Ashley also called for retailers need to be more innovative, perhaps laying out computer games consoles for one half of a couple to play on while the other perused the aisles. MPs on the Housing, Communities and Local Government Committee, who are looking at the future of the high street in 2030, looked sceptical -- asking how overseas-based e-tailers could be made to pay the levy. Ashley arrived at the Thatcher Room in Westminster, keen to give MPs the benefits of his experience running Sports Direct. But he swiftly found himself on the back foot, as MPs demanded answers about his takeover of House of Fraser this year. Ashey hotly denied ever promising to save all HoF\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 59 stores, saying: What person could keep 59 stores open - beside God? It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s impossible, it can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be done. I believe Ashley is right - in August, he spoke about hoping to save 47 stores. Even keeping 80% would be a God-like performance, Ashley continued. Ashley also found that MPs haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t forgotten Sports Direct\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s reputation for using zero-hours contracts (it was criticised for Victorian workhouse practices in 2016). He refused to rule out using more zero-hours contracts at HoF, insisting that many workers love them. And he denied \u00e2\u20ac\u0153stroking a white cat\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd like a Bond villain, deciding which stores to axe. And finally, Mike Ashley hinted that House of Fraser could work closer with Debenhams (in which he owns a stake). He tol MPs: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I told them to work together. They should work together Mike Ashley winds up his hearing with a prediction -- Harrods and Selfridges will have a good year. One of the reasons that House of Fraser failed is that it didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t elevate itself, Ashley continues. Luxury brands are on the up. Teenagers, people today, want to wear their wealth. Mike Ashley returns to his big theme - the internet has killed the high street. He tells the MPs: The web has killed the high street, not the local councils, not this, not that. Ashley concedes that everyone involved may have moved too slowly to tackle the issue. Now, unless major change is pushed through, the high street is finished. It is just going to die, and you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be left with Oxford Street and Bond Street. Outside of London, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s going to be a ghost town. Sorry, that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s what it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s going to be. Interestingly, Mike Ashley says that local councils have helped keep House of Fraser stores open since his Sports Direct chain took it over this year. Ashley tells the committee that some landlords have refused to cut the rent, in the hope that the department store will close - freeing them up potentially turn it into housing. Councils, though, insisted that everyone involved made an effort to keep the House of Fraser store open. Ashley suggests, though, that some stores need to downside - perhaps by turning their upper floors into residential units. I accept House of Fraser cannot have 500,000 square feet in Birmingham. Honestly, you would need an Uber to take you round. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ridiculous. Q: There are reports that high street rents might crash next year, by 20%. Wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t that be good news for the retailers? But wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t rents NOT fall, if landlords were able to turn high street stores into residential units (as some campaigners have asked for) You\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll make me hated by every landlord in the country, but you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re absolutely correct, Ashley replies. Labour MP Liz Twist, who represents the Bladon in North-East England, asks Mr Ashley to meet with her to discuss the fate of the House of Fraser Metro store. No, absolutely not, Ashey replies. Q: Why not? If I do it for one person, think of all the other people that I have let down, Ashley replies, burying his head in his hands. People keep thinking I can do these one-off things. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not easy to do, But Ashley is prepared to attend a meeting with MPs to discuss the wider issue, ideally with HoFs landlords too. Q: What\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s happening with House of Fraser stores, and your push to cut rents? Mike Ashley says local councils are refusing to cut rents, because they can see that HoF stores are profitable...but they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re not recognising the overhead costs behind the scenes. So a store that seems to be making a \u00c2\u00a32m profit on paper is actually losing \u00c2\u00a32m, once you factor in the true costs of running a business. Ashley then give a fascinating insight into business, saying that accountants can make up nearly any number you like, to flatter a company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s accounts. You don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t even understand what they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re talking about, and they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll say \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcI can make that store loss-making, or I can make it profitable\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. They say \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll put exceptions in - what are they when they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re at home?\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Ashley adds with (apparent) disbelief. The underlying problem in UK retail is the web, says Mike Ashley, as he continues to brief MPs on the future of the high street. Looking magnanimously at the Housing, Communities and Local Government Committee, he adds kindly: It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not your fault, you didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t do it. Q: Why is there such a problem with rents in the retail sector? Landlords and retailers have always been uneasy bedfellows, says Mike Ashley. And whenever one has the upper hand, he \u00e2\u20ac\u0153gets out his hammer\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and bashes the other one. He says \u00e2\u20ac\u0153good luck\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to any landlord who owns highly lucrative land on Bond Street. But he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s more critical of landlords who have got retailers on contracts where rents can only rise. Those rental agreements are a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153downward death spiral....\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Ashley blames successful companies, such as McDonalds and his own Sports Direct chain, which agreed to hefty rent deals in the good times - which everyone else was then moved onto as well. If you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re just tuning into Mike Ashley\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hearing on the future of the high street, here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s what you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve missed... Mike Ashley now concedes that it would be difficult to implement his plan for a new tax on web companies, but insists that it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s simple in principle. [Reminder, the idea is a new levy on any retailer who does over 20% of its business online] Q: Many retailers say that the solution is lower business rates and free parking.. Yes, but who\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s going to pay for it, Ashley shoots back. He admits that Sports Direct, which he founded, would be hit in the pocket if the government took up his suggestion of a new tax on e-tailers. Sports Direct won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be pleased with me for my suggestion. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not necessarily a good fix for Sports Direct , but it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a fantastic fix for the high street. Otherwise, Ashley argues, the high street is destined for destruction: The high street won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t make 2030, it won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get there, unless you do something really radical and grab the bulls by the horns. Q: How would your plan for a new tax on web retailers work when people buy goods from abroad? In theory you could still tax them, Ashley insists, but agrees that overseas retailers would have to sign up to pay it. You want to get retailers saving the high street, he adds - through a new tax on companies who make most of their money selling online only. High stores have to change, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not just about a sea of clothing any more, says Mike Ashley. He suggests retailers need to be much more innovative -- maybe with different opening hours, more self-service tills. In another burst of blue-sky thinking, Mike Ashley suggests high street stores could offer services such as free computer gaming to lure customers in. Retail analyst Neil Saunders isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t impressed: Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s some video clips of Mike Ashley in action: Mike Ashley now insists that he doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t \u00e2\u20ac\u0153sit in an office stroking a white cat\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, trying to decide which House of Fraser stores to shut following this year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s takeover. Of course I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m worried about the state of the high street, he continues. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not my fault the high street\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s dying, is it? It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not House of Fraser\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fault, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not Marks &amp; Spencer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fault, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not Debenham\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fault. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s very simple why the high street is dying - it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the internet. The internet is killing the high street. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s quite a statement, given Sports Direct has hundreds of stores in the UK, just bought House of Fraser, and also has a stake in Debenhams. But Ashley has a cunning plan -- a new tax on web-only retailers, to encourage them to maintain a high street presence too. Q: You promised to turn House of Fraser into the Harrods of the high street and keep its 59 stores open, but now people are worried that their local store will close. How will you decide which stores to shut? Ashley looks like he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s going to burst a blood vessel. I never said I would keep 59 stores over. Never, never, never... Everyone knows I set a target of keep 80% of the estate open, the Sports Direct boss insists. What person could keep 59 stores open - beside God? It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s impossible, it can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be done. Even keeping 80% open would be messianic, Ashley indicates, before adding modestly that he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not comparing himself to God. Over in the UK parliament, the boss of retailer Sports Direct is testifying to MPs about the future of the high street. But Mike Ashley actually finds himself fending off tough questions about his company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s business practices, following the takeover of House of Fraser. First off, he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s accused of letting customers down - by not refunding orders placed online just before House of Fraser went into administration. Ashley insists that customers received gift cards instead, as SPD got to grips with the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s problems. Ashley then asked whether he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be putting House of Fraser staff onto zero-hours contracts, something he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been criticised for using heavily at Sports Direct. Ashley insists that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the vast majority of staff love them\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, but he won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t commit not to roll them out more heavily at HoF. Getting impassioned, Ashley insists that he needs to keep all options open. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s impossible what you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re asking. It doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t make sense. The high street has to change what it offers consumers. That means stores might need to open later, and close later, Ashley suggests, telling MPs firmly: Stop trying to showboat... I thought we were here to save the high street. For all Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s optimism, many financial analysts are unconvinced that the US and China can settle their trade dispute in just 90 days. Reforming Beijing treatment of intellectual property will take much longer, and there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s only so much US produce which China can really absorb to help mop up the trade gap. But still, the markets are up. And that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s because the immediate threat of a deeper trade war has receded. As Aninda Mitra, senior sovereign analyst at BNY Mellon Investment Management, puts it: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153To be sure, underlying problems remain unresolved. It is not as though existing tariffs are on the verge of being unwound. But what Xi has managed to extract from Trump is a stay on any escalation for three months. That interlude should see a stronger effort to set a framework for more talks and quid-pro quos. In the long term, though, achieving full trade d\u00c3\u00a9tente will be tricky: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The best one can hope for in three months\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 time is a trade and geopolitical deal in which we see a road-map for China to materially raise oil and agriculture imports from the U.S. to cut the bilateral surplus by more than one-half in about 1-2 years\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 time. That will result in a diversion of Chinese imports from U.S. foes such as Russia and Iran, and possibly Saudi and rest of OPEC. I would imagine the Chinese would also acquiesce to at least some softening of U.S. access to technology and finance in China. Signals to this effect came from Xi suggesting he would not object to the Qualcomm-NXP deal if this were presented again. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The highest priority for the Chinese authorities at the moment is to stabilize their economy. In this context, a 90-day truce should boost local sentiment, and prove more important from a psychological standpoint than recent policy stimulus which was seen as tepid, if not grudging. In another boost to the White House, the US manufacturing sector has posted another month of strong growth. The Institute for Supply Management has reported that new orders, employment levels and activity also jumped last month, while the prices paid by manufacturers fell. This drove ISM\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s monthly healthcheck on America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s factory sector up to 59.3. from 57.7. That level is consistent with strong growth. There are some major names among the big movers on Wall Street today. Aircraft maker Boeing has gained 6%, construction and machinery business Caterpillar is up 4%, and Apple has gained 2.6%. That suggests investors are optimistic that the trade war time-out will yield results. Chipmakers AMD (+7.8%) and NVIDIA (+6%) are also romping ahead. Randeep Somel, Director of Global Equities at M&amp;G, explains why markets are upbeat: The rally seen this morning in equity markets show that the escalating trade disputes are a significant concern to the global growth outlook of the world economy. Whilst its very early days and the process of normalising the trading relationship with China is going to be a complex process \u00e2\u20ac\u201c today, at the very least is a signal that those negotiations can begin. Riskier assets such as base metals and oil producers, as well as the US and European car manufacturers and associated supply chains are likely to show the most positive reflection of the news as they have borne the brunt of the negative headlines for most of this year.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd After a minute\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s silence to honour President George H.W Bush, Wall Street has opened, and shares are rallying hard. The Dow Jones industrial average has jumped by 412 points, or 1.6%, to 25,950, in early trading, following upbeat comments from Donald Trump and Stephen Mnuchin in the last couple of hours. The broader S&amp;P 500 index is up 1.5%, while the Nasdaq has gained 2%. Industrial stocks and technology firms are leading the rally, on relief that the US will not be imposing tougher tariffs on China -- at least not for 90 days. Nick Payne, head of global emerging market equities, Merian Global Investors, says investors around the globe are feeling much cheerier. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The 90-day truce in the Sino-US trade war agreed between President Xi and President Trump in Buenos Aires is a welcome development in reducing tension. The very fact that both sides have reopened dialogue is a good step forward and should help sentiment and asset prices in emerging markets. Of course, hard yards lie ahead in reaching a comprehensive agreement, but for now, both sides can claim a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153win\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. US consumers can cheer that their manufactured-in-China favourites like iPhones will not be increasing in price for Christmas. Donald Trump is claiming that China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s promise to cut tariffs on US car imports, from 40%, is a win. However, Beijing only raised the tariff to 40% this summer after the US launched its trade war. A few months earlier, China actually cut the tariff from 25% to 15%. Brad Setser of the Council of Foreign Relations reckons the tariff won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be slashed below 15%. US treasury secretary Stephen Mnuchin is also cheering the trade war truce. Speaking on CNBC a few moments ago, Mnuchin says that the 90-day hiatus is a significant step: This is the first time that we have a commitment from them that this will be a real agreement. However...Mnuchin added that Beijing to follow through on its commitments, and open its economy more widely, and fairly, to US companies: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153They put on the table an offer of over $1.2 trillion in additional commitments. But the details of that still need to be negotiated. This isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t just about buying things. This is about opening markets to U.S. companies and protecting U.S. technology. Those are very important structural issues to the president.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd More optimism from the White House: The US president is awake, and in an effusive mood after his negotiations with Xi Jinping on Saturday night. Donald Trump is tweeting that the trade truce can be a win for both the US and China -- a point analysts have also made today. Salman Ahmed, chief investment strategist at Lombard Odier IM, agrees that Trump and Xi made a breakthrough: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The much anticipated dinner between the two leaders resulted in the first major breakthrough since talks broke down in May. For now, China has agreed to buy more US products, including agricultural goods, and to tackle the trade imbalance concern. President Xi also agreed to designate fentanyl a controlled substance, in a move which was described as a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153wonderful humanitarian gesture\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in a statement issued by the White House on Saturday. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153On trade, President Trump said the US will not go ahead with the implementation of a 25% tariff rate scheduled for January. The tariffs on $200 billion worth of products will be left at the 10% rate for the next 90 days while both parties attempt to negotiate structural changes. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Signs of rapprochement between China and the US is certainly good news. This does not reflect a definitive shift in the relationship between the US and China, but the opening up of negotiations is certainly a big step in the right direction. Stephen Cooper, Head of Industrial Manufacturing at KPMG UK, is concerned by today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s UK factory data (even though anxious stockpiling drove growth up): \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Brexit and supply chain worries have dented November\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s UK manufacturing data, with muted growth and optimism at a 27-month low. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The continued decline in export orders is something manufacturers need to be mindful of, particularly as the Eurozone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Manufacturing PMI numbers for last month were relatively flat and there are are also wider global demand concerns. With the Eurozone as such an important market for the UK, manufacturers need to prepare carefully for Brexit and ensure they understand every aspect of their supply chains.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a handy chart showing how the trade dispute intensified this year, as the US and China exchanged tit-for-tat tariffs. Tony Fratto, a former White House deputy press secretary, will believe China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tariff cuts when he sees them.... Influential investor Mohamed A. El-Erian of Allianz reckons the US-China trade truce is a quadruple win, at least in the short term. He writes: At the end of almost three hours of what the White House called \u00e2\u20ac\u0153highly successful\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd discussions, the U.S. agreed to refrain for 90 days from implementing additional tariffs on $200 billion of imports from China. In return, China promised to use the time to make progress in three areas of concern to the U.S. and other countries: relaxing an array of nontariff barriers, including joint-venture requirements, that result in forced transfers of technology, operational models and other proprietary information and business practices; combatting intellectual property theft and other cyber interferences; and reducing the bilateral trade surplus by importing \u00e2\u20ac\u0153very substantial\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd quantities of certain goods from the U.S. This outcome is a short-term win for both sides, as well as the global economy: China avoids additional tariffs that would further undermine its growth prospects and place even greater pressure on its financial markets. The U.S. defines a time-specific way forward to counter practices that place it at a competitive disadvantage in its bilateral economic relationship with China. And the world economy is in a better place, for now, to avoid a stagflationary trade war. It is also a short-term win for investors and markets: El-Erian adds that the world economy would have suffered if the talks had broken down. However, both sides now have to work \u00e2\u20ac\u0153cooperatively\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to turn this truce into a long-term deal. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also a danger that the new 90-day deadline creates fresh political pressures, which will weigh on markets in early 2019. The trade war time-out may come too late for some American farmers. As this chart shows, soybean exports from the US to China usually peak in October and November, but not this year due to the trade dispute. Wang Cun, director of the China Automobile Dealers Association\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s import committee, has welcomed the suggestion that car tariffs will be cut. Wang told reporters in Beijing that: If they cancel the extra 25 percent tariff on US-made cars, then we will see positive signs for imported cars,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Wall Street is on track for a big jump when trading begins in three and a half hours. The Dow Jones is currently up 2%, or 500 points, in the futures market. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a chunky move, given the US and China have only agreed a 90-day truce....and there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been silence from Beijing about exactly what they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve agreed too.... Shares in European car companies are surging, after Donald Trump tweeted that China has agreed to cut tariffs on auto imports. Daimler are leading the pack, up 7%, in Germany followed by BMW (+6.6%) and Volkswagen (+4%). They all have factories in the US, so should benefit from a cooling in trade war tensions. Tire maker Continental is up 3.5%. Shares in fashion chain Ted Baker have plunged by 13% this morning after the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s founder was accused of forcing staff into hugs, massages and other inappropriate conduct. My colleagues Sarah Butler and Jasper Jolly reported yesterday that current and former Ted Baker staff had accused Ray Kelvin of harassment. They wrote: More than 60 current or former staff are understood to have come forward to the employee campaigning platform Organise with complaints about Kelvin\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s alleged behaviour, including kissing ears and giving unwanted hugs and shoulder massages. Organise published a petition, signed by more than 1,000 people, calling for an end to forced hugging, saying: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It is part of a culture that leaves harassment unchallenged.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd It also calls for new procedures allowing employees to report harassment to an \u00e2\u20ac\u0153independent, external body\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Ted Baker says it will investigate the case, adding: Hugs have become part of Ted Baker\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s culture, but are absolutely not insisted upon.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Shares in the company have fallen to \u00c2\u00a315.86 (from \u00c2\u00a318.26), their lowest level since June 2013. Newsflash: Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s manufacturing was unexpectedly strong last month, as companies rush to stockpile products ahead of a Brexit crisis. Markit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s UK factory PMI, which measures activity in the sector, has jumped to 53.1 for November, up from October\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 27-month low of 51.1. Most of the demand came from domestic customers amid a rush to fill inventories with important products and components, in case of trade disruption after Brexit. But the export picture is darker -- new orders from overseas shrank for the second straight month in November, the first back-to-back contraction since early-2016. Rob Dobson, Director at IHS Markit, points out that manufacturers are still quite pessimistic. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153While demand from the domestic market was a positive spur, in some cases as clients built up stocks in response to Brexit and other supply-chain uncertainties, manufacturers also reported a further decrease in new export business as slower global economic growth and Brexit worries took a bite out of foreign demand. Brexit worries also increasingly dominated the outlook for the sector. Although still forecasting growth for the year ahead, manufacturers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 confidence fell to its lowest ebb since August 2016.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Overnight, manufacturing group EEF also reported that UK manufacturers have been working hard, stockpiling products ahead a possible cliff-edge Brexit. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s official: Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s factory sector slowed last month. Data firm Markit reports that its eurozone manufacturing PMI fell to 51.8 last month, down from 52 in October. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the weakest growth since August 2016, and close to the 50-point mark that shows stagnation. Italy and France were the worst-performing regions: Netherlands 56.1: 25-month low Austria 54.9: 2-month high Ireland 55.4: 2-month high Greece 54.0: 6-month high Spain 52.6: 3-month high Germany 51.8 (flash: 51.6) 31-month low France 50.8 (flash: 50.7) 26-month low Italy 48.6: 47-month low On the upside, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s better than the initial \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcflash\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 estimate released mid-way through the month (51.5). UBS analyst Paul Donovan suggests investors shouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get too excited about the US-China trade truce. US President Trump may, metaphorically, be claiming to have a tweet on Twitter that promises trade peace in our time. The reality of the US-China handshake deal at the G20 is not that secure. The deal looks to be a variation on the Juncker-Trump EU handshake deal. City traders often talk about a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcSanta Rally\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, in which shares end the year with solid gains. And this year, Santa may be coming early.... as the Trump-Xi truce boosts confidence across the financial markets. Neil Wilson of Markets.com explains: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153December is starting with a bang, with a de-escalation in Sino-US tensions positive for risk. Donald Trump tweeted yesterday that China \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcwill reduce and remove\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 tariffs on US auto imports, amid signs of progress on trade talks. It follows a more positive G20 meeting. The US will delay for 90 days any increase in tariffs to enable talks to take place. The US had planned to raise its 10% tariff on $200bn of Chinese goods to 25% on January 1st. Some be concerned that there was no official word from China in relation to auto tariffs, and that the two sides are saying different things about the meeting. European stock markets are a sea of green this morning, with gains across the board. In London, nearly every share is up in Mayank Mishra, global macro strategist at Standard Chartered, explains: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Even though it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a 90-days truce and both U.S. and China still need to sort out multiple issues in this period, from markets\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 perspective getting past the event risk with a positive outcome and de-escalation of tensions is clearly positive for risk sentiment.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Progress! Mining stocks are surging sharply in London too. Anglo American, Glencore and BHP Group have all gained at least 6% this morning, on the prospect of higher demand for iron ore, copper and coal. Boom! Shares in London have surged to a two-week high at the start of trading. The FTSE 100 has jumped by 1.5%, or 102 points, to 7,082, as the US-China trade truce cheers investors. Other European markets are also higher, with France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s CAC up 2%. Carmakers are among the top risers, following Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s claim that China will drop auto tariffs. Soybeans prices are moving sharply this morning, on relief that Washington and Beijing have backed away from a deeper trade war. Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s claim that China will \u00e2\u20ac\u0153immediately\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd start buying more US products has driven soybean prices up by 3% on the Chicago futures market. However, they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve dropped in China -- as traders anticipate a surge in supplies from America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s farmers. Bloomberg has more details: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The price spike in Chicago soybeans and the fall in Dalian is a normal market reaction to the U.S.-China trade truce because China has agreed to start buying agricultural products from American farmers immediately,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Monica Tu, an analyst at researcher Shanghai JC Intelligence Co. Still, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the market is very concerned about the outcome of further negotiations,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and whether there will be big purchases in the next few weeks, she said. China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s currency is strengthening, on relief that America has decided not to hike tariffs on Chinese imports at the start of January. The yuan has jumped by 1% against the US dollar, to \u00c2\u00a56.88 to $1. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s up from \u00c2\u00a56.954 on Friday night, before the G20 summit got up to speed. Hussein Sayed, Chief Market Strategist at FXTM, What was delivered over the dinner was not a breakthrough, neither a long-term solution for the ongoing trade war between the largest two economies, but a 90-day window to improve relations. Introduction of new tariffs are now shelved, and trade talks will intensify over the next three months. This outcome seems to be an optimistic one from the two leaders and more than what was priced into markets beforehand, meaning that this is enough to boost sentiment and risk-on trade. But, don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t forget the White House\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 90-day deadline.... Chinese newspapers have cheered the truce hammered out between Trump and Xi at the G20 leaders meeting. The Global Times called the deal a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153momentous step forward\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, while the People\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Daily dubbed it an \u00e2\u20ac\u0153important consensus\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. However, China has NOT backed up the White House claim that the ceasefire will only last for 90 days, unless a permanent trade deal is reached. As CNBC explains: Official online statements about Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s briefing on the meeting did not discuss the technology transfers or the 90-day condition. The timeframe and details on areas of disagreement also did not appear in online reports from China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s state news agency Xinhua, People\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Daily \u00e2\u20ac\u201d the official Communist Party paper \u00e2\u20ac\u201d and CGTN \u00e2\u20ac\u201d the English-language version of state broadcaster CCTV. The articles did note the U.S. and China agreed to work towards mutual benefits, and generally indicated Beijing would increase purchases of U.S. goods. The state media also said the two parties discussed North Korea denuclearization. The Chinese press also said Trump upheld a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153One-China Policy\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd regarding Taiwan \u00e2\u20ac\u201d something not mentioned in the White House statement. Sue Trinh of Royal Bank of Canada is cautious about this trade truce -- pointing out that the US and China haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t released a joint statement on what was agreed. But she also believes this is a win for president Trump: Trade wars need to be framed in terms of who hurts the least and see the G20 meeting as a stronger win for the US. China buys 3 months before tariffs on $200bn in goods rise to 25% while the US knows it will have a deal with sizeable China concessions in 90 days, or go ahead with tariffs having cleared the backlog of harvested crops from the agri sector. Tai Hui, chief market strategist for Asia Pacific at J.P. Morgan Asset Management, is also wary, saying: The negotiation is likely to remain challenging given the competition in a number of areas, especially technological development between the two countries. 90 days is not a very long to resolve these differences. The good news is that this truce should be seen as Washington recognising the potential damage on the U.S. economy if tariffs escalate further. We see an ongoing dialogue between the two sides to be an important catalyst for Asian markets to recover lost ground this year, alongside steady global growth and a weaker US dollar.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Global stock markets are rallying today on relief that America and China have pulled back from escalating their trade war. In one of the most eagerly awaited dinner dates in a while, Donald Trump and Xi Jinping struck a truce at the end of the G20 meeting in Buenos Aires. After the dinner, Trump declared: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This was an amazing and productive meeting with unlimited possibilities for both the United States and China. It is my great honor to be working with President Xi.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd However, the agreement is light on detail. We know that America has deferred its plan to raise the tariff on $200bn of Chinese imports from 10% to 25%, for 90 days (it was scheduled for 1 January). This kicks the can down the road a little, teeing up more tense talks before the end of March. In return, China has apparently agreed to purchase a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153very substantial\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd amount of US goods - including farm, energy and industrial products. That would help narrow the massive trade gap between the two countries. Trump has declared that China is also removing tariffs on US car imports -- which would be a win for America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s auto sector However, the two sides will now face fraught talks over intellectual property protections, and the threat that the truce could break down at an time. Still, investors are delighted to hear peace ring out. Asian markets have surged overnight, with China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Shanghai Composite jumping by 2.5%. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s its biggest one-day gain in a month. Australia has gained 1.8%, and Japan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Nikkei is 1% higher. Stephen Innes of trading firm OANDA says: With the immense weight of the global supply chain dynamic network on their shoulder, a tariff detente has emerged after a highly anticipated dinner. Both Presidents\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 XI and Trump have agreed to put on hold the menacing tariff increases expected to get imposed January 1, marking a significant de-escalation in trade tensions between the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s two biggest economies. Thankfully, for risk sentiment, the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153dinner date of the decade\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd ended with a sense of harmony rather than trade war discord. European markets are going to join the party too, and are expected to gain almost 2% at the open.... Also coming up today... We find out how the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s factories fared in November, when the latest surveys of purchasing managers are released. They\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll probably confirm that the eurozone has slowed sharply, while the US economy is more robust.

                "bodyText":"The collective value of digital media brands including Huffington Post, Yahoo and AOL, which once had a stock market capitalisation of more than $200bn (\u00c2\u00a3158bn), has been slashed to only $200m by their parent Verizon. The US telecoms company has taken a $4.6bn charge on the goodwill value of Oath, the digital media subsidiary that houses properties including HuffPo, Yahoo and AOL, leaving it worth about $200m on paper. In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the US stock market regulator, Verizon said it was writing down the value of Oath after a strategic review that resulted in the downgrading of financial projections for the business. The write-down of the value of Oath, which Verizon put together in the hope of creating a viable rival to Google and Facebook with a target of $10bn revenues by 2020, provides further stark evidence of the tough conditions facing a whole generation of digital media companies. It is also a far cry from the frothy excesses of the turn of the century dotcom boom, when AOL hit a peak stock market value of $222bn in December 1999, with Yahoo\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s capitalisation topping $100m around the same time. The following year AOL\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s mega-merger with Time Warner created a $350bn business that was lauded as a visionary marriage of old and new media. However, the deal has since been widely derided as one of the most disastrous mergers in corporate history and the two companies split in 2009, with AOL valued at about $3.5bn. The year before that, Yahoo, still holding ambitions to fight back against the rise of Google and Facebook, spurned a $45bn offer from rival Microsoft. Verizon bought AOL in 2015 for $4.4bn and two years later acquired Yahoo for $4.5bn. A newer generation of digital media companies with hot prospects have also found themselves falling on tougher times over the past year.

Williams\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 dovish comments could point to hidden concerns among some Fed policymakers, said Tim Ghriskey, the investment strategist at Inverness Counsel in New York. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153(Williams\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 comments) helped the markets for a while early on, and then it was just a sell-off after that,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Ghriskey said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Part of that is when the Fed says something like they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re re-looking at things, there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a concern that maybe the Fed knows something that we don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Technology and communication services stocks bore the brunt of the sell-off, falling 2.3% and 2.7%, respectively. The so-called Faang group \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix and Google \u00e2\u20ac\u201c fared poorly. Facebook shares tumbled 5.4%, Amazon shares slid 4.8% and Netflix shares sank 5%. Shares of both Apple and Google parent Alphabet dropped more than 2%. Turmoil in Washington injected further pessimism into US stock markets. Donald Trump said there was a very good chance a government funding bill, which included funding for a wall along Mexico border, would not pass the Senate. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The market continues to react to the possibility of a government shutdown, fear of a domestic and global slowdown and general displeasure about the direction of Fed policy,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Ryan Larson, the head of US equity trading at RBC Global Asset Management in Chicago.",

The sale might have been good timing \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 but the value of his remaining 18% stake has since been hammered and is down more than \u00c2\u00a3230m. The former boss \u00e2\u20ac\u201c who quit the company in March \u00e2\u20ac\u201c is not happy.

The bankruptcy is estimated to have cost the taxpayer \u00c2\u00a3150m. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Julian Dunkerton, the founder of Superdry, cashed out \u00c2\u00a318m in shares of the fashion retailer shortly before he quit the brand he started in 2003. Those shares are worth about one-quarter of that now, after a torrid year for British retailers, affected by shoppers moving online, Brexit uncertainty and unseasonable weather. The sale might have been good timing \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 but the value of his remaining 18% stake has since been hammered and is down more than \u00c2\u00a3230m.

In July, Pichai had to contend with a \u00c2\u00a33.8bn fine and dressing down from the European commission after competition concerns on its Android operating system. Since then, there have been internal sexual harassment protests and a row over plans to produce a censored search engine for China. August \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Tim Cook, the chief executive of Apple, will for ever be the man who led the first listed company to a valuation of more than $1tn. However, the trillion-dollar landmark did not last long amid a deep market sell-off in October and concerns that iPhone sales growth was waning \u00e2\u20ac\u201c with particular attention on the troublesome Chinese market. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Elon Musk, the founder of Tesla, is hailed by many as a visionary, but even visionaries have to abide by market abuse rules. So when he tweeted in August \u00e2\u20ac\u201c reportedly while driving himself to work \u00e2\u20ac\u201c that he had \u00e2\u20ac\u0153funding secured\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd for a private buyout of the electric carmaker, an immediate investigation was launched. In October, the US Securities and Exchange Commission forced him to resign the role of chairman (though not chief executive) and fined the billionaire $20m. It was not Musk\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s only controversial moment this year \u00e2\u20ac\u201c he also called a British cave diver trying to rescue trapped Thai boys a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153pedo\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd (prompting a defamation lawsuit) and was pictured smoking marijuana while recording a podcast. September \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Rupert Murdoch, the billionaire owner of News Corporation, may have failed in his aim to take over the broadcaster Sky, but the \u00c2\u00a312bn payday for 21st Century Fox when it sold shares will probably sweeten the pill. Murdoch is also in the process of a separate $71.3bn sale of Fox to Disney. Comcast ended up paying \u00c2\u00a330bn for Sky, significantly more than the \u00c2\u00a318bn bid made by Fox in December 2016. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Dara Khosrowshahi, the chief executive of Uber, has tried to take a different path from its founder, Travis Kalanick, and his abrasive manner since taking over in August 2017. However, changing the ride-hailing company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s culture has proved to be no easy feat: Khosrowshahi was forced to apologise for the app\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s mistakes in London in September, a year after Transport for London moved to remove its licence in the capital. October \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 The former deputy prime minister Nick Clegg once said he was not very impressed by Facebook. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m not especially bedazzled by Facebook,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he wrote in 2016. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I actually find the messianic, Californian new-worldy, touchy-feely culture of Facebook a little grating.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd But then he lost his parliamentary seat and his career trajectory started to head south \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and took a new job in the US as global head of communications at Facebook. One of his top priorities will be to avoid a regulatory showdown with Brussels at a time when Facebook\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s policies and behaviour are under scrutiny, not least after Sheryl Sandberg was accused of condoning a smear campaign against the financier George Soros. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Sir Philip Green, the owner of Topshop\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s parent company, Arcadia, is no stranger to controversy, but this autumn he was named in parliament as the man behind multiple non-disclosure agreements. The NDAs still hold, but Green has denied \u00e2\u20ac\u0153unlawful sexual or racist behaviour\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. November \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Denise Coates, the chief executive of Bet365, is the best-paid woman in Stoke, and the rest of the world, for that matter. Coates turned her father\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bookmaker into one of the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest online gambling businesses. Her record \u00c2\u00a3265m annual pay packet provoked criticism, but it is a private, family owned company and she controls it. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Carlos Ghosn, the chief executive of Renault, apparently had little idea that he was about to be arrested and detained when he arrived in Tokyo in November. The Lebanese-Brazilian executive, who forged an alliance between France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Renault and Japan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Nissan and Mitsubishi, was shopped by Nissan for allegedly underreporting his income. The Japanese carmakers quickly ousted him from their boards, leaving the alliance \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and Ghosn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s freedom \u00e2\u20ac\u201c in the balance. December \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Ray Kelvin was probably the biggest name in retail no one had heard of \u00e2\u20ac\u201c until 300 former and current employees of his Ted Baker fashion business signed a petition on the campaigning website Organise complaining about his behaviour, including \u00e2\u20ac\u0153forced hugs\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and ear kissing. The company said Kelvin\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hugs were \u00e2\u20ac\u0153part of Ted Baker\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s culture, but are absolutely not insisted upon\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. But then details of an office brawl emerged \u00e2\u20ac\u201c which had earned Kelvin a formal warning \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and \u00e2\u20ac\u0153further serious allegations\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd eventually prompted the rag trade multimillionaire to take a leave of absence while an independent investigation is carried out. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 It has not been such a great year for Nick Robertson, the co-founder of Asos. He has watched the value of his stake in the online fashion retailer fall by about 70% \u00e2\u20ac\u201c or \u00c2\u00a3275m \u00e2\u20ac\u201c between its peak in March and the aftermath of a shock profit warning in December. The British retail sector laboured during 2018, but analysts were taken aback by declining margins online at a time when most eyes were on the travails of the high street.",

My central expectation \u00e2\u20ac\u201c amidst a range of possible outcomes \u00e2\u20ac\u201c is that an extension to Article 50 will be requested to allow time for a second referendum as Parliament fails to coalesce around any outcome to deliver Brexit and instead abdicates its responsibility back to the people clothed in the claims that this presents the most democratic resolution of the issues. This will then likely lead to a vote to Remain, likely followed by a General Election.</p> <p>\u00e2\u20ac\u0153If that happens I believe the markets will continue to be volatile in early 2019 but will rally on the prospect of no Brexit. This will also likely result in a bounce in the value of Sterling which will temper the rise, or at least the pace of the rise, in the FTSE 100 slightly due to the overseas earnings component of many of the FTSE\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s constituents.</p> </blockquote> <p>The other factor, of course, is Donald Trump: <br></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\u00e2\u20ac\u0153Away from Brexit more volatile US politics and potentially increased trade tensions as President Trump continues to promote an \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcAmerica First\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 agenda as he starts his re-election campaign will likely weigh on US markets or at the very least cause them to be more volatile.

It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s actually been a pretty poor year for markets globally though; Europe, Japan and Emerging Markets are all sharply down on the beginning of the year, and while the US has held up better, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s still in negative territory, and has witnessed a pretty dramatic fall in the last three months.We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re unlikely to see the gloom lift in January. Brexit looks set to reach a parliamentary crescendo, and a swathe of trading updates from the UK high street isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t likely to lighten the mood.</p> <p> Despite the negative sentiment, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s unwise to bet on the direction of the stock market in the short term, as it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s prone to defy expectations, sometimes for the better, sometimes for the worse.

                "bodyText":"Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the full story about the markets\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 bad year: Best wishes for 2019!! GW With the Dow up more than 200 points today, Wall Street could yet end a rough month on a moderately high note. As MarketWatch puts it: The Dow Jones Industrial Average (+0.84% today) has declined 9.7% thus far in December, while the S&amp;P 500 index (+0.5%) is down 9.9% during the period, and the Nasdaq Composite Index (+0.55%) is off 10.2% through Friday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s close. Those declines would represent the worst monthly drops since October 2008, according to FactSet data. For the year, the Dow is in line for a 6.7% loss, with the S&amp;P 500 down 7% and the Nasdaq Composite on pace for a 4.6% fall. Trading on Monday, however, was looking up after investors saw reasons to buy in recent tweets from President Donald Trump about putative trade-negotiation progress between himself and Chinese leader Xi Jinping via weekend phone conversations. At the risk of flattening your NYE fizz, there are plenty of reasons to fret about 2019. Weak retail spending, falling house prices, a new chapter in the eurozone crisis or a deeper US-China trade war could all herald a recession. As could Brexit....... Richard Stone, chief executive at The Share Centre, says Brexit is the key factor determining if the FTSE 100 recovers, or stumbles, in 2019. He writes: No one really knows how that is going to resolve itself and it would be a brave (or untruthful) person who said they did! My central expectation \u00e2\u20ac\u201c amidst a range of possible outcomes \u00e2\u20ac\u201c is that an extension to Article 50 will be requested to allow time for a second referendum as Parliament fails to coalesce around any outcome to deliver Brexit and instead abdicates its responsibility back to the people clothed in the claims that this presents the most democratic resolution of the issues. This will then likely lead to a vote to Remain, likely followed by a General Election. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153If that happens I believe the markets will continue to be volatile in early 2019 but will rally on the prospect of no Brexit. This will also likely result in a bounce in the value of Sterling which will temper the rise, or at least the pace of the rise, in the FTSE 100 slightly due to the overseas earnings component of many of the FTSE\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s constituents. The other factor, of course, is Donald Trump: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Away from Brexit more volatile US politics and potentially increased trade tensions as President Trump continues to promote an \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcAmerica First\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 agenda as he starts his re-election campaign will likely weigh on US markets or at the very least cause them to be more volatile. We have already seen some of this since the mid-term elections in November 2018. Plus, the FAANG stocks (Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix, and Google/Alphabet) face a crunch year: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Finally, the drive towards greater regulation and taxation of the tech giants will likely weigh on some of their performance. Personal investors will need to be alive to trying to identify the new emerging companies or trends. On Twitter, the economics team at ACS Hillingdon International School are asking whether this year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s losses are a buying opportunity. I certainly don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t give investment advice #CaveatEmptor . But here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Laith Khalaf, senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown: \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcThe UK stock market has definitely felt the heat of the Brexit burn in 2018, with domestically-focused UK companies finding themselves under pressure as politicians seem unable to agree on the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s withdrawal from the EU. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s actually been a pretty poor year for markets globally though; Europe, Japan and Emerging Markets are all sharply down on the beginning of the year, and while the US has held up better, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s still in negative territory, and has witnessed a pretty dramatic fall in the last three months.We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re unlikely to see the gloom lift in January. Brexit looks set to reach a parliamentary crescendo, and a swathe of trading updates from the UK high street isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t likely to lighten the mood. Despite the negative sentiment, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s unwise to bet on the direction of the stock market in the short term, as it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s prone to defy expectations, sometimes for the better, sometimes for the worse. The appeal of putting long term savings to work in the stock market still remains, though investors who are concerned about its immediate prospects should consider drip-feeding money in gradually, to take advantage of any dips.\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Over in New York, investors are attempting to inject some New Year jollity into proceedings. The Dow Jones industrial average is up around 0.6%, or 150 points, at 23212 points, as Wall Street\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s worst December since 1931 heads towards the exit. After 2018\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s losses, what might next year have in store for investors, and everyone else? Andrew Milligan, Head of Global Strategy at Aberdeen Standard Investments, believes 2019 will be a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153middling year from an economic point of view\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. He told us: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The world economy is not in a bad place at the start of 2019. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve talked of the slowdown in Europe and China, but it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s still trend growth. America is above trend and will decelerate during the course of this year, but there are very few signs, currently, of any major economic problems in the immediate future. The oil price is lower, which helps. The Fed has hinted that it will not be as aggressive. Inflation is not a concern. There are debt issues out there. China remains the most worrying one. Housing markets in some countries are stretched. There is emerging market debt in some countries.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Milligan said a potential downside could be a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153negative feedback loop\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd caused by falling share prices, discouraging companies and consumers from spending. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Confidence and sentiment do matter. One can just see people being more cautious about spending and investing and the economies, just as we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve seen in Europe this year, slow and slow. That would be an adverse headwind.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd He added that potential upside could come from Trump and Xi coming to agreements to resolve the US-China trade dispute. The US stock market may manage a last-ditch rally, after Donald Trump tweeted that he was making progress over trade talks with China. UK housebuilders also had a rough 2018, hit by Brexit worries. Taylor Wimpey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s market capitalisation has slumped by a third, while Berkeley Group are down 17%. Shares in tobacco firms went up in smoke this year. British American Tobacco lost half its value during 2018, tumbling in November when US regulators proposed a major crackdown on menthol cigarette sales. But online grocery retailer Ocado bucked the gloom, almost doubling in value this year after securing deals to supply its technology to overseas supermarkets. Stock markets across Europe have had a torrid year, with all the main indices shedding at least 10%. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the damage: UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE 100: down 12.5% in 2018 German DAX: down 18% French CAC: down 11% Italian FTSE MIB: down 16% Spanish IBEX: down 14.9% The London stock exchange have confirmed that \u00c2\u00a3242bn was wiped off the companies which make up the FTSE 100 during 2018. Here are some more facts from the LSE: FTSE 100 highest point in 2018 was 7877.45 on 22 May 2018 FTSE 100 lowest point in 2018 was 6585.91 on 27 December 2018 Last time FTSE 100 closed down at year end was 31 December 2015: -4.93% Highest % daily rise in 2018 was on 5 April: +2.35% Highest % daily fall in 2018 was on 6 December: -3.15% Newsflash: Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock market has suffered its worst year since the financial crisis. The FTSE 100, which tracks the biggest companies listed in London, has shed 12.5% of its value this year -- or more than \u00c2\u00a3240bn (by my maths). The Footsie has just closed down 5 points at 6,728 points. It started this year at 7,687 points, before being rocked by fears over the global economy, fuelled by trade wars anxiety, and Brexit uncertainty. The FTSE\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s poor performance has helped to drag global markets deep into the red too. As explained earlier, the MSCI index of global stocks has fallen by around 11% during 2018, while the Chinese market has tanked by a quarter. The pound is ending the year with a small rally. Sterling is up 0.5% against the US dollar at $1.277, and 0.6% higher against the euro at \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.116. These are the highest levels since Theresa May was forced to postpone the parliamentary vote on her Brexit deal, to avoid a huge defeat. The government continues to push for improvements to May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s deal, to assuage MP\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s concerns over the Irish backstop. But there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s still no breakthrough. What a difference a year makes! On the last trading day of 2017, City traders were celebrating the news that the FTSE 100 had hit a new all-time high. As we blogged at the time, the blue-chip index gained over 7% during the year to finish at 7,687 points. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s more than 12% higher than today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s levels. Other countries did even better, helping to drive globe stocks up by a sizzling $9 trillion during the year. Analysts at Mizuho Bank have cautioned against getting carried away by Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s claim that he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s held \u00e2\u20ac\u0153very good\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd talks with Chinese president Xi Jinping. They told clients: Whilst President Trump has lauded \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcbig progress\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 in trade talks with China following a phone call with Xi during the weekend, it remains to be seen how much this can boost investor confidence given that market reaction on recent positive development has largely been muted. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve seen plenty of dramatic scenes at the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock exchanges this year, with traders wallowing in gloom as shares crash, or beaming with delight as shares recovered. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s delivered a bumper crop of photos from the trading floors, and no-one sums up the mood better than veteran trader Peter Tuchman - who has a real knack for capturing the state of play. My colleague Dominic Rushe caught up with Tuchman, and reports: Like most celebrities in real life, Tuchman is smaller than he looks. Twin clouds of white hair, echoed by snowy facial fuzz, frame a bald pate that slopes gently down to expressive eyes on a face that seems perpetually in motion, as are his hands and feet. Tuchman is a human emoji, a one-man metaphor for the mood of the market. But don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be fooled by the clowning \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Tuchman is a cool cat. What you are seeing is not necessarily what he is thinking. Tuchman, 60, came late to fame. The born-and-bred New Yorker had already been working on the floor of the NYSE for some 20 years when he first made the front pages. It was 2007 and the financial crisis was dominating the news cycle. On another day of wild swings Tuchman, snapped mouth agog, appeared on the front of the New York Post. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I had just received the bill for my son\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s barmitzvah and it was way more money than I anticipated,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd jokes Tuchman. But Tuchman\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s jollity has a serious side too: His sangfroid, Tuchman says, comes from his parents. Marcel and Shoshana Tuchman were Holocaust survivors who were imprisoned in Auschwitz and Bergen-Belsen. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153My father was a slave laborer for Siemens Corporation, which is still a public company here,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he says, nodding ruefully at the trading floor. His grandmother was murdered in front of his father, most of whose family were also murdered by the Nazis. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153As was my mother\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he says. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153My father went up against Josef Mengele, the death doctor [who performed deadly experiments on Auschwitz prisoners], as did my mother. My mother\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s whole family was gassed. They could have come out of that, you know, being angry and depressed, negative-minded people; they didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t. There are two options in this thing. You can come out of challenges trying to devour every day and looking at life as if the cup is half-full or you come from a negative point of view that you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re a victim and the cup is half-empty. I vote for the former.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Marcel Tuchman, who worked until he was 93 teaching medicine, died earlier this month aged 97. His son was back at work the next day. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153My father always said: \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcWhen I die, cry and go to work.\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 That was his advice.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the full piece: Fiona Cincotta of City Index points out that UK-focused companies are having a decent morning (after a pretty ropey year). The FTSE opened the last trading day of the year a touch higher with a mixture of consumer, property and mining companies making moderate gains. With the pound firmer against the euro and the dollar, FTSE gainers were mostly companies with a strong domestic focus except for miners which were helped by stronger copper and oil prices. Unless Wall Street manages the mother of all rallies today, it will suffer its worst December since the Great Depression. With less than two hours trading to go in London, the FTSE 100 is up 17 points at 6751. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 12% lower than this time last year.... Holger Schmieding of German bank Berenberg suggests there are four \u00e2\u20ac\u0153extraordinary political mistakes\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd which might trigger fresh market mayhem in 2019. They are: for Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s radical government to plunge their country into a genuine Greek-style debt crisis; for Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s mostly pro-EU political class to simply let the train roll towards and then over the hard Brexit cliff instead of using the ten weeks between the likely death of May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Brexit deal and Brexit day on 29 March 2019 to stop it through a softer Brexit option or a new vote to stay in the EU; for Donald Trump to hurt the US economy and impair his chances of re-election in late 2020 by going too far in his costly trade wars in 2019; for China to let a hard landing happen instead of using its ample policy toolbox to smooth the inevitable slowdown in cyclical momentum and trend growth. Now the good news. He doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re particularly likely... For example, Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s budget passed last night, showing that the EU and markets have imposed some rudimentary discipline on Rome. Separately, Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s latest musings on progress in talks with China support hopes that both sides will try to strike some deal in coming months even if some of the thorny issues between the geostrategic rivals will probably not be fully resolved for many years. So, Schmieding suspects that markets may pick up during 2019: Chances are that, after a rocky start to the New Year, a less negative narrative can unfold later in 2019. That we have finally put an unexpectedly difficult 2018 behind us need not remain the only reason to celebrate the advent of a New Year tonight. Hong Kong\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock exchange managed a last-minute rally today. The Hang Seng jumped by 1.3%, lifted by Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s latest optimistic tweet about the trade negotiations with China. But that still leaves the index down 13.6% for 2018, its worst year since 2011. The last 12 months have proved difficult for investors in stock markets around the world as fears over global growth mount up, and for many owners of commodities 2018 has proven equally tricky, my colleague Jasper Jolly writes: Prices for oil and gold, two of the most traded commodities, are both set to fall for the first calendar year since 2015. Futures for Brent crude oil, the North Sea benchmark, gained a dollar in value today, but that has not been enough to recover losses for 2018, which currently stand at around 18%. Fears of a supply glut amid weakening growth in China and other major economies depressed prices to just over $54 per barrel. Losses for West Texas Intermediate, the American benchmark, have been steeper, at 23%. Gold is seen as the financial safe haven par excellence, but it is on course to suffer its first annual decline in three years. Gold futures prices slumped from above $1,350 per troy ounce in the spring to below $1,200 in the late summer. They have since recovered for a 2% fall during 2018 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c stronger than the performance of silver, prices of which have fallen by 9%. Cocoa was the top gainer among major traded commodities in 2018, leading a field of strong performances from a select group of agricultural commodities. Cocoa futures prices have gained more than 27%. Speculators looking further afield at cryptocurrencies \u00e2\u20ac\u201c which share some characteristics with commodities \u00e2\u20ac\u201c would not have been rewarded. Those who had bought bitcoin at the end of 2017, near the height of the cryptocurrency mania, would have lost almost three-quarters of their money. Naeem Aslam of Think Markets blames monetary policy tightening by the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s central banks for this year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s losses. The Fed stopped printing easy money a few years back and increased the interest rates four times this year. The European Central Bank also ended up its quantitative easing program and there has been several discussion on the topic of the ECB normalising the interest rates. All in all, almost all the European indices are down more than 10 percent over this year and some of them are down over 15% (DAX) for this year. The Euro Stoxx 500 index is down by 13% this year\u00e2\u20ac\u201dthe biggest loss since 2008. The fact is that things aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t looking really any brighter in 2019 as well because there are plenty of risk events which are going to keep investors on their toes. For instance, at the beginning of the year, the first thing which investors will have to deal with is the Brexit chaos the UK leaving the European union. Then we have the US trade war with China and the ongoing struggle about securing the funds to build the wall. Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s claim that he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s making \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcbig progress\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 in the trade negotiations with China may be giving world markets a small boost today. Wall Street is expected to open higher in a few hours time, following the news that presidents Trump and Xi spoke over the weekend. European stock markets have started trading, but there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s little drama yet. In London the FTSE 100 index has gained 10 points, led by online supermarket Ocado (+2.1%), budget airline easyJet (1.7%) and web estate agent RightMove (1.5%). The French CAC has gained 0.5%, with Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s IBEC up 0.4% and the Netherland\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s AEX up 0.3%. So with trading thin, and little news about, European stocks seem certain to suffer their worst year since 2008, as this chart shows. Australia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock exchange has closed for the year, after yet another day of losses. The S&amp;P/ASX200 index dipped by 0.14%, taking its combined losses in 2018 to over 9% - the worst year since 2011. Another reason to worry about China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy: In a worrying signal for 2019, China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s manufacturing sector is now contracting. The official factory Purchasing Managers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Index (PMI) fell to 49.4 in December, official data shows, a two-year low. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s below the 50-point mark that shows if activity rose or fell. Manufacturers were hit by falling orders, with new export orders dropping for the seventh month in a row. That suggests the tariffs imposed on Chinese goods at the US border are hitting demand. Mike Van Dulken of City firm Accendo Markets says this data \u00e2\u20ac\u0153may fan the flames of concern about slowing global growth\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. More here. China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock markets have suffered a particularly bleak 2018. The Shanghai composite index has crashed by 25% this year, leaving investors suffering very heavy losses. The trade war with the US has acted like a lead weight on many stocks, of course, but there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also concern that China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy is weakening. My colleague Lily Kuo explains: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153People have started to reduce or even stop spending money because they don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t expect the economy will perform well,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Ye Tan, an independent economist based in Shanghai. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Companies and individuals are wary about the economy.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Going into 2019, China faces not just a slowing economy but also a protracted trade war with the US, a pile of debt that threatens the world economy along with the Chinese financial system, and a populace demanding better environmental, labour, and health protections. Shanghai is closed today, as China prepares for the New Year celebrations. Investors deserve the break. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the final day of the year, and many investors will forgiven for wishing \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcgoodbye and good riddance\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 to 2018. The last 12 months have been pretty tough in the markets. Global stocks have suffered their worst losses since the financial crisis of 2008, wiping around 11% off the MSCI All Country World Index of stocks. In London, the FTSE 100 is limping towards the end of a rough year. The blue-chip index has shed 12% of its value since the start of January, hitting a series of two-year lows -- in a blow to pension funds and savers big and small. The big worry is that the long bull market, which reared up after the great recession ended in 2009, is now over. Anxiety over trade wars, a slowing global economy, Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s increasingly erratic behaviour and US interest rate hikes have all hurt stocks this year. In Europe, the tortuous Brexit negotiations and the long-running row between Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s populist government and Brussels have also worried investors. Trevor Greetham of Royal London Asset Management explains: We were surprised at the ferocity of the selloff in December which we put down to rising nervousness about the US-China trade dispute, an ill-judged and poorly communicated rate hike from the US Federal Reserve and an increasingly erratic pattern of behaviour from President Trump as the Mueller investigation into Russian collusion enters its final stages. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The last couple of weeks have seen a surprise unilateral decision to pull all US troops out of Syria, threats of a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153very long\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd government shutdown if Congress refuses to fund the Mexican border wall and a counterproductive attempt to blame the Fed for market weakness when it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the trade war that investors are most worried about. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Elsewhere in the world Theresa May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chaotic postponement of the meaningful vote on the EU Withdrawal Bill has added to the jittery mood in markets, raising as it does the risk of a No Deal Brexit that would damage both the UK and euro area economies. But perhaps investors are too gloomy. Over the weekend, Donald Trump and Xi Jinping both made positive noises about a breakthrough in their trade talks, offering hope that deeper tariffs can be avoided. That is likely to give traders some much-needed optimism today. European markets are expected to open higher today, in a shortened trading session (although Germany and Italy will be closed).",
