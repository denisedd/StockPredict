                "bodyText":"When Mohammed bin Salman was touring the UK and US earlier this year, the crown prince of Saudi Arabia \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and its de facto ruler \u00e2\u20ac\u201c could have relied almost exclusively on businesses backed by the kingdom\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s money. Landing in London, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153MBS\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd might have dispensed with his chauffeur-driven car, travelling into the capital by Uber, while his aides finalised his itinerary on smartphones powered with chips designed by Cambridge-based ARM Holdings. After glad-handing bank chiefs in the City, any investment plans they discussed could have been further developed using cloud office app Slack. On the US leg of the journey, perhaps slumming it in an Accor hotel, MBS and his entourage might have dialled up a plate of the Saudi national rice dish, kabsa, from delivery service DoorDash. Later, they could have relaxed by playing computer games partly designed by simulation technology firm Improbable. Every one of these companies is part of the portfolio of Riyadh\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Public Investment Fund (PIF), which manages the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s oil wealth. Under the stewardship of the young prince \u00e2\u20ac\u201c he is just 33 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the PIF has adopted a more aggressive investment approach, seeking out eye-catching, forward-looking deals, particularly technology startups. Its aim is to increase the pot from $250bn to $2 trillion in the next 12 years. This strategy is a key part of Vision 2030, a blueprint to reduce Saudi reliance on oil and diversify the economy into sustainable industries with a long-term future. But the plan hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t gone smoothly. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The idea is that you give the money to the PIF and they invest seriously all over the world, particularly in hi-tech and future-oriented industries,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd says David Butter, Middle East and north Africa analyst at Chatham House. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153But a sovereign wealth fund is by definition based on surplus revenue and Saudi Arabia has been running deficits because the oil price is weak, so they need to get [the money] from somewhere else.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Butter points out that Riyadh hoped to accelerate its plans by raising $100bn from the flotation of a 5% stake in its giant state oil company, Aramco, an offering since put on hold. But even if funds can be raised elsewhere, the international investment component of the masterplan is at risk, due to the allegations \u00e2\u20ac\u201c denied by the crown prince \u00e2\u20ac\u201c that he ordered the murder and dismemberment of journalist Jamal Khashoggi. The keystone of the international strategy \u00e2\u20ac\u201c which could now be under threat \u00e2\u20ac\u201c has been the kingdom\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s provision of nearly half the money in the $93bn Vision Fund managed by Japan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Softbank. Much of that cash has gone into potential future blue-chips such as Uber, electric car start-up Lucid Motors and General Motors\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s driverless car unit, GM Cruise. MBS is close to Softbank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s billionaire chief executive, Masayoshi Son, one of the few business leaders not to have pulled out of next week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Future Investment Initiative (FII) in Riyadh \u00e2\u20ac\u201c described as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Davos in the desert\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u201c in light of the allegations. But the gruesome scandal does appear to have tested even that close relationship. Earlier this month, MBS told Bloomberg that the PIF was ready to pump another $45bn into a second Vision Fund. By the end of last week, Softbank appeared to have cooled on the idea, with its chief operating officer, Marcelo Claure, saying there was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153no certainty\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd such a fund was in the offing. An impressive roll-call of business names have been rather less circumspect in putting distance between themselves and MBS. The high-profile pull-outs from the FII include JP Morgan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Jamie Dimon, the head of the IMF, Christine Lagarde, Glencore chairman Tony Hayward and many more \u00e2\u20ac\u201c even Uber\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s boss, Dara Khosrowshahi, despite the PIF\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s $3.5bn investment in his company. Separately, Richard Branson has suspended the Gulf state\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s $1bn investment in his space project, Virgin Galactic. Rarely have so many business leaders been seen running in the same direction, in this case away from Saudi Arabia at speed.

                "bodyText":"Time to wrap up: The US stock market has suffered another day of big losses, as investors worry about the state of the economy, trade wars, and possible interest rate rises. The Dow shed more than 600 points, wiping out all its gains for 2018, while the Nasdaq dropped into a correction. Analysts warned that further losses are possible, as fear grips the markets. Manufacturers warned that Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade wars are pushing up their costs. Tariffs are making raw materials and imports more expensive, eating into profits. However two companies - Boeing and Tesla - bucked the trend with forecast-beating results. European companies have suffered a worrying slowdown in growth this month. Trade wars may be to blame here too, with manufacturers suffering a drop in orders. Brexit angst is weighing on the pound. Sterling fell to a seven week low, below $1.29, as Theresa May struggles to reach an agreement on Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s transition deal. Goodnight! Tesla has addressed a lot of criticism with its results tonight, says Alan Boyle of Geekwire. He writes: Tesla shares jumped more than 10 percent in after-hours trading today after the controversial electric-car company posted a surprisingly positive quarterly report, including a profit rather than a loss. Adjusted net income for the third quarter amounted to $312 million, which translated into earnings of $2.90 a share. Analysts had expected a loss of around 19 cents per share. Total revenue hit $6.8 billion, exceeding expectations of $6.3 billion. And Tesla\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s cash on hand increased by $731 million, even though Tesla repaid $82.5 million in bonds during the quarter. That cash position could take some of the pressure off Tesla, which had been burning through its reserves by the billions during what CEO Elon Musk called \u00e2\u20ac\u0153production hell\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd for the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Model 3 electric car. Analysts had worried that Tesla would have to borrow more money to stay afloat. But Tesla said \u00e2\u20ac\u0153our cash position should remain at least flat in spite of our plan to repay $230 million of convertible notes in cash\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd during the current quarter. Shares in Tesla have surged 12% in after-hours trading. Investors are scrambling to grab a stake in the company following its surprise move to profitability. Amid the gloom tonight, electric car company Tesla has stunned the markets with much better results than expected. Elon Musk\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s company made a profit of $312m in the last quarter, surprising analysts who expected another loss. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s its first profit in two years. Revenues hit a record, at $6.82 billion, beating expectations of $6.33bn. After a long struggle to meet production targets for its Model 3, and Musk\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s well-known run-ins with regulators, has Tesla finally turned the corner? Nicholas Hyett, equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, believes it has. He writes: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Production numbers earlier this month meant we already knew Tesla could churn out the cars, the question was whether it could it do it profitably, and even more importantly, could Musk wean the company off a constant flow of cash from investors. To say Tesla\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s answer is emphatic is an understatement. Gross margins on the Model 3 are above even the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s own lofty expectations and its position as the 5th most popular car by volume in the US suggests it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s drawing in a wide range of customers despite its comparatively high price point. Drivers will pay more for Musk it would seem. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s important because the premium end alone won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t deliver the impressive growth Tesla needs in the coming years to justify its premium valuation. Normally we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d tell investors to avoid reading too deeply into a single quarter\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s numbers, but this quarter really counted at Tesla. Reading deeply is something of pleasure today.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a scent of fear in the air in the markets tonight, according to Chris Zaccarelli, chief investment officer at Independent Advisor Alliance. Zaccarelli says (via Reuters) that there may be more turmoil ahead: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153At this point it seems selling is begetting selling. The VIX [volatility index] has doubled in the last couple of weeks. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a bit more fear in the air and you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re seeing the acceleration of growth to value. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It looks like more panic and fear as the selling has continued to roll.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s now Marketwatch sums up today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Wall Street wobble: Stocks ended sharply lower Wednesday, as losses accelerated into the close and put both the Dow and the S&amp;P 500 into the red for the year, and the Nasdaq into correction territory. Upbeat results from Boeing Co. were credited with briefly pushing the Dow higher in early morning trading, before investors took an increasingly defensive stance, fleeing for the relative safety of utilities and consumer nondurable shares. Another day, another big loss on Wall Street! The Dow Jones industrial average managed to lose 608 points by the close, meaning it has lost all its gains for 2018. It closed 2.4% lower at 24,583. Technology shares, such as Microsoft (-5%) and Intel (-4.6%), fell sharply, while construction equipment group Caterpillar shed another 5.8%. In another blow, the Nasdaq index slumped by over 4%, putting it into correction territory (more than 10% off its recent high). Investors seem to again be gripped by worries about global trade, geopolitical tensions, and the state of the US economy -- with new home sales slowing, and manufacturers warning that cost pressure are going up. Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s row with the Federal Reserve over future interest rate rises, and the ongoing Brexit deadlock, can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have helped the mood either. Paul Zemsky, chief investment officer of multi-asset strategies and solutions at Voya Investment Management in New York, explained: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a big global risk-off trade. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve had some headwinds, higher interest rates affecting housing, tariffs causing input costs for manufacturers to go up, which makes earnings look not as stellar ... but that doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t mean the whole economy is rolling over,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Those weak home sales figures haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t helped the mood in New York. The Dow is having another down day, currently off 221 points (-0.9%) at 24,969. Fiona Cincotta of City Index sees nervousness on the trading floors: Despite clawing back heavy losses on turnaround Tuesday, Wall Street has once again opened on the back foot. With a long list of risk factors, including Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s growing tensions with Brussels, Saudi Arabia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s increased isolation over Jamal Khashoggi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s killing, global growth worries and some earnings disappointments investors are struggling to find reasons to buy in. The Federal Reserve may ignore Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s complaints, but they should heed the latest US housing data. New home sales fell to an annual rate of just 553,000 in September, 13.2% less than a year ago, and the weakest rate since December 2016. That could suggest the housing market is cooling - perhaps in response to recent Fed rate hikes which have made borrowing more expensive. A late sell-off has sent most European markets into the red tonight. At the close of trading, Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s DAX was down 0.7% while the French CAC shed 0.3%. This morning\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s weaker than expected PMI reports rather dampened the mood (and the Euro!) Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB had yet another bad day, losing 1.7% as the clash with Brussels over its 2019 budget rages. Markets had been higher this morning, but it seems that investors didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t trust the recovery - especially with so many risks (Italy, Brexit, Saudi Arabia) to think about. In London, the FTSE 100 has closed 7 points higher, as the weaker pound propped up shares. Some snap reaction: The Bank of Canada has hiked borrowing costs, taking its benchmark interest rate up to 1.75%, from 1.5%. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largely as expected, but shows that the Federal Reserve isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t the only central bank moving away from crisis-era policies. America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s companies are still growing, but they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re also facing tough price pressures. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s according to the latest healthcheck from data firm Markit, just released. It shows US output growth hitting a three-month high, encouraging firms to take on more staff. However, they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re also having to pay more for raw materials, and imports, as Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade wars kick in. Chris Williamson of Markit explains: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The domestic economy remained the main driver of demand, with exports stagnating amid growing signs of trade being subdued by tariffs. Tariffs also drove a further marked rise in prices, exacerbating an upward trend in price pressures borne out of robust domestic demand. Just in: Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s steel industry has been hit by a surge in imports from overseas. The steel tariffs imposed by Donald Trump seem to have had a knock-on effect, with metals that was destined for America ending up in Europe instead. According to European steel association Euroferi, imports from Turkey have increased by 57% this year, while those from Russia are up 56%. Trump impose a 50% tariff on Turkish steel, as part of a diplomatic row with Ankara, making it very uncompetitive. That had a knock-on effect on Russia, which sells a chunk of its steel to Turkey (which is now swimming in the stuff). Ding ding goes the opening bell in New York....and the markets aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t doing very much. The Dow has risen by 0.3%, or 71 points, to 25,262 in early trading, with Boeing gaining 3%. European stock markets are pushing higher, as Boeing\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decent results brings some cheer to the trading floors. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE 100 is up 80-odd points, recovering yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s losses, and the other indices are also looking healthier. By hiking its profit forecasts, Boeing has brought some confidence that corporate earnings - and economic growth - is holding up well. European multinational companies are also getting a currency boost. With the euro and pound dropping against the dollar today, their overseas earnings are more valuable. Abi Oladimeji, Chief Investment Officer at Thomas Miller Investment, thinks investors should be cautious, though: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The current double-digit pace of earnings growth (expected to be circa 20% in Q3) is clearly unsustainable and this will create a headwind in the months ahead. For this reason, as well as the ongoing elevated levels of political and policy uncertainty in key regions of the world, we retain a cautious outlook on equities for now and await better opportunities to add to holdings. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Reuters\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 take on Boeing\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s strong results today. Boeing topped analysts\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 forecasts for quarterly profit on Wednesday and raised its forecasts for annual profit as it continued to benefit from a boom in global air travel and demand for airplanes. Shares of the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest planemaker were up 3.1 percent at $361 in premarket trading, helping brighten the mood on Wall Street after a handful of shaky results outlooks on Tuesday from U.S. manufacturers hurt by concerns over global trade. Soaring demand from commercial airlines has driven another surge in revenues for Boeing over the past year, pushing shares in the company up by roughly a third over the past 12 months. Those moves have been dented somewhat by a combination of the trade worries, this year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s greater market volatility and a series of recurring charges for its KC-46 tanker program. More here. (Sonic) Boom! Aircraft maker Boeing has posted strong results and raised its forecast for earnings this year. In a boost to morale on Wall Street, Boeing posted earnings of $3.58 per share, beating forecasts of $3.47 per share. With plane sales looking robust, the company now expects to make $14.90-$15.10 per share this financial year, up from $14.30-$14.50 per share. This optimism has sent Boeing shares up by 4% in pre-market trading. That might be enough to push the Dow higher at the open, in an hour\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time. The pound\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s weakness today is partly because the dollar is strengthening against a basket of currencies. The dollar index has hit a nine-week high today, as the greenback rallied across the board. I can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t spot a particular reason why. But it may suggest investors expect the Federal Reserve will ignore Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s latest attack on Jay Powell, and raise interest rates in December. Newsflash: The pound has hit a new six-week low, as Brexit anxiety swirls to new heights. Sterling has fallen by three quarters of a cent today to $1.291, its weakest point since 10th September. The sell-off comes as Theresa May struggles to reach an agreement on Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s transition deal. Yesterday, she couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get the whole cabinet onside, making traders wonder how she will get an agreement through parliament. My colleague Dan Sabbagh explains: No 10 sources conceded that the discussion, which came a day before the prime minister was due to plead for support from Tory MPs at a meeting of the party\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 1922 Committee, was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153impassioned\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Others characterised it as a row. A group of ministers, including Jeremy Hunt, the foreign secretary; Liz Truss, the chief secretary to the Treasury; and Michael Gove, the agriculture secretary, were among half a dozen who emphasised their concern over imposing a time limit on any backstop, which is designed to avoid a hard border in Northern Ireland. Later today, the PM will meet with Conservative MPs to plead for their support. That could be another stormy session, after some anonymous MPs unpleasantly told the Sunday papers that she should \u00e2\u20ac\u0153bring her own noose\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to the 1922 committee meeting. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s National Audit Office (the government watchdog) has piled more pressure on, saying a no-deal Brexit could undermine security at the UK border and increase delays. Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s latest attack on Fed chair Jerome Powell hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t cheered Wall Street. The New York stock exchange is expected to open lower in a few hours, with the Dow called down 0.8%. European stock markets are actually up this morning, with the FTSE 100 gaining 50 points or 0.7%. Craig Erlam of foreign exchange firm OANDA says there is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a huge amount of anxiety in the markets\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd today, partly due to anxiety over US interest rate hikes. The US has been late to the game when it comes to the stock market sell-off, having been sheltered by last year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tax cuts but they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re wasting no time in playing catch-up, with the S&amp;P and Dow both fast closing in on 10% declines from the peak in a matter of weeks, while the Nasdaq has already ticked that box. Trump has been quick to point the finger of blame at the Fed, with the President desperately not wanting to be associated with a stock market sell-off in the run up to the mid-term elections. Especially when he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s spent the last two years taking credit for the colossal gains. Rising interest rates has clearly been a factor in the loss of confidence in the stock market in recent weeks, with trade wars, Brexit, Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s budget issues and the Khashoggi murder also being important contributing factors. Some good jobs news amid the gloom: car rental chain Enterprise are taking on 800 new graduate trainees. The roles are scattered across Enterprise\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 470 branches across the UK. Do well, and you could be assistant manager within a year, they say. More details here. Back in the UK, new mortgage approvals have fallen to a six-month low. Industry figures show that 38,505 home loans were approved in September, down from 39,241 in August, and 6.7% less than a year ago. This may show that the Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s interest rate rise, in August, has chilled the housing market. UK Finance\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s managing director of personal finance, Eric Leenders, suggests people raced to get new mortgages before the BoE rate hike: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The mortgage market softened slightly in September, following strong remortgaging activity in the months preceding the recent base rate rise.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Brexit uncertainty may be another factor, of course. As Stephen Pegge, UK Finance\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s managing director for commercial finance, puts it: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Economic uncertainty continues to impact on businesses\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 appetite for finance as overall lending remains slightly below the same period last year. This morning\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s weak eurozone PMI report has hurt the euro. The euro has fallen by half a cent against the US dollar, to $1.141, as investors fear that the eurozone is weakening. If so, it could make it harder for the European Central Bank to normalise monetary policy and raise interest rates above their record low of zero (a level Donald Trump can only dream of....) Mike Dolan of Reuters shows how German firms are particularly downbeat, according to today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s PMI report. Oliver Rakau of Oxford Economics says European carmakers are struggling to meet new tougher emissions rules (which has also hurt car sales recently). Markit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Chris Williamson fears the eurozone economy could be heading for choppier waters: Newsflash: Eurozone corporate growth is stumbling this month, as tariffs and trade wars hit economic demand. Data firm Markit reports that business growth is the slowest for over two years, while optimism has hit a four-year low in October. Firms reported a slowdown in exports, particularly in manufacturing, where new export orders for goods decreased for the first time since June 2013. This has pulled Markit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Flash Eurozone PMI Composite Output Index down to 52.7, a 25 month low, down from 54.1 in September. Any reading over 50 shows growth. Germany, the eurozone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest economy, was hit particularly hard. Factory output rose by the smallest in almost four years, while service sector growth was the slowest since May. Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit, says the eurozone appears to be slowing as the economic outlook darkens. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The pace of Eurozone economic growth slipped markedly lower in October, with the PMI setting the scene for a disappointing end to the year. The survey is indicative of GDP growth waning to 0.3% in the fourth quarter, and forward-looking indicators, such as measures of future expectations and new business inflows, suggest further momentum could be lost in coming months. The slowdown is being led by a drop in exports, linked in turn by many survey respondents to trade wars and tariffs, which appears to have darkened the global economic environment and led to increased risk aversion. It is therefore not surprising to see the slowdown broadening out across the economy, hitting the service sector. Paul Donovan of UBS isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t impressed by this latest attack on the Federal Reserve. He told clients that the real risk comes from trade wars or excessive tax cuts, not monetary policy. US President Trump has suggested the Fed is the greatest threat to the US economy. An economist would suggest recessions arise from overheating (caused by deficit financed tax cuts, perhaps), or policy error (disrupting supply chains on which an economy depends, perhaps). Zero real rates with full employment are probably not a (restrictive) policy error. The big question is whether Donald Trump could reprise his days on The Apprentice, and tell Jerome Powell that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re fired\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. And the answer? Probably not. The Federal Reserve Act only permits the President to remove a Governor \u00e2\u20ac\u0153for cause\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, and no chairman has ever been fired. But we live in interesting times. Elsa Lignos of Royal Bank of Canada says you can hardly sack a Fed chair for raising borrowing costs. Overnight Trump stepped up criticism of Powell, saying \u00e2\u20ac\u0153every time we do something great, he raises the interest rates\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and that it is the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153biggest risk\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to the US economy, despite this being the slowest ever Fed tightening cycle. He didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t answer what would make him try and replace the Fed chair. By law he can only fire governors \u00e2\u20ac\u0153for cause\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and raising interest rates can hardly be considered a cause \u00e2\u20ac\u201c whether Congress would stop him perhaps depends on whether Democrats manage to take the house. David Madden of CMC Markets points out that Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s recent tax cuts are also putting pressure on the Fed to raise interest rates: President Trump attacked Jerome Powell, the head of the Federal Reserve, for hiking interest rates. Mr Trump is ignoring the fact that his tax cuts helped spur on US economic growth, which warrant higher rates. I fear Donald Trump is on shaky ground when he complains that the Fed blessed president Obama with record low interest rates, but hiked on his watch. When Obama took office, America had fallen into a deep recession as the financial crisis raged. This forced the Fed to slash borrowing costs to stimulate growth. Today, the US economy is running at its fastest pace since 2014 - something Trump isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t bashful about taking credit for. US inflation hit 2.7% in August, over the Fed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s target, and policymakers fear that rising prices could get out of hand, unless borrowing costs rise. As CNN puts it: Obama took office after the Great Recession began in December 2007. The Federal Reserve at that time put historically low interest rates in place, and took other measures besides, in an effort to inject money into the faltering economy. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the financial markets, the world economy, the eurozone and business. Donald Trump may want to Make America Great Again, but he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also showing a talent for making the markets nervous. Overnight, the president has launched a new barrage at America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s central bank, accusing it of being too trigger-happy when raising US interest rates. In an interview with the Wall Street Journal, Trump intensified his criticism of the Federal Reserve and its chairman Jerome Powell, for hiking borrowing costs. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s all terribly unfair, the president griped, saying: I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m just saying this: I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m very unhappy with the Fed because Obama had zero interest rates. Every time we do something great, he raises the interest rates.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd In another jibe, the president added that Powell \u00e2\u20ac\u0153almost looks like he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s happy raising interest rates\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, even though it could threaten EU economic growth. And when asked if he regretted making Powell America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s top central banker last year, Trump replied: Too early to tell, but maybe.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd These comments are totally at odds with the principle of central bank independence. The Fed is meant to be free to change monetary policy to manage inflation and employment without worrying about a blast from the White House. So far this year the Fed has raised interest rates three times; Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s attacks sound like an attempt to ward off a fourth hike in December. Reaction to follow... Also coming up today Stocks may be volatile again today, as October continues to be a testing time for investors. Asia-Pacific markets have risen today after Tuesday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sell-off, and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re expecting Europe to open higher - after the FTSE 100 hit a seven-month low last night. Italy will be in focus, after being given three weeks to resubmit its 2019 budget for EU approval. Rome insists there is no Plan B, though, so further clashes seem inevitable. Traders will also be watching for a new healthcheck on the eurozone economy, the latest UK mortgage figures, plus a likely interest rate hike by the Bank of Canada.

                "bodyText":"Alphabet also missed Wall Street forecasts. The company behind Google posted revenue of $33.74bn in the last quarter, missing estimates of $34.05 billion. Still, Alphabet also reported net profit of $9.19 billion, or $13.06 per share, up from $9.57 per share a year ago. eMarketer analyst Monica Peart says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re seeing a larger than expected slowdown in Google properties\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 revenue, representing its core search business. This is likely related to the ramp-up in competition from Amazon, as consumers increasingly turn to the ecommerce giant for their product searches.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s all for tonight! GW Amazon has taken a bite out of Wall Street\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new-found optimism tonight, by missing analyst expectations: Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Bloomberg\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s take: Amazon.com Inc. reported sales that missed analysts\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 estimates, and issued a disappointing revenue forecast for the busy holiday quarter, suggesting the online marketplace may be reaching a saturation point in the U.S. Revenue gained 29 percent to $56.6 billion in the third quarter, the e-commerce giant said Thursday in a statement. Analysts\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 projected $57.1 billion. Sales will be from $66.5 billion to $72.5 billion in the current period, falling short of analysts\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 average estimate of $73.8 billion. Shares declined as much as 6.5 percent in extended trading. Ut-oh... Amazon and Alphabet have just released results as the echo of the closing bell fade. And Wall Street is NOT happy..... Intel has smashed earnings forecasts, though: Breaking: After Wipeout Wednesday, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Turnaround Thursday. October has maintained its run of wild swings tonight, as Wall Street bounces back. The Dow Jones industrial average has closed 401 points higher, a gain of 1.6%, at 24,984. Technology, industrials companies and banks led the rally. Microsoft closed 6% higher, while Intel gained 4.8%. With tech stocks romping ahead, the Nasdaq has posted its biggest one-day jump in seven months. The Nasdaq\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s recovery is even punchier than the Dow\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s. The tech-focused index has leapt by 3%, with just a few minutes to go. Tesla, Twitter and Microsoft have all done their bit, with forecast-beating results in the last 24 hours. The rebound has legs! With just 30 minutes to go, the Dow is up an impressive 490 points, or 2%, at 25,073. That means its recovered a large chunk of the Wednesday wobble. Traders in New York must be dizzy! The Dow is holding onto its gains. With two hours to go, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s up 380 points at 24,963, up 1.5%. Microsoft is leading the charge, up 5.7% after impressive results last night. Intel (+5%) and VISA (+3.45%) are close behind. The ongoing market turbulence hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t deterred US company Yeti from floating on the stock market today. Yeti makes high end coolers and outdoor gear, popular with outdoor types like hunters and surfers, and pitmasters who spend time tending barbecues (important work!). Their kit isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t cheap. The Tundra 125 cooler retails at $549 -- for that, you get enough space for 73 cans or dozens of hot dogs, hamburger patties and cold cuts. Yeti floated at $18 per share -- so far, they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve slipped by 7% to $16.80. Not a great start - still, a yeti makes a change from all those Wall Street bears. After tumbling in early trading, European stock markets have recovered to end the day higher. In London, the FTSE 100 has climbed back over the 7,000 point mark, ending up 41 points at 7,004. It would be higher, but for WPP\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s woes. Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB had a good day, gaining 1.8% after Mario Dragji said he was confident that the deadlock over Rome\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s budget plans would be resolved. The French CAC gained 1.6%, and Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s DAX rose 1%, as traders welcomed the rally in New York. On Wall Street, the Dow is now up 350 points - trying to put Wednesday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shocker behind it. Asia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tumble into a bear market overnight is still a concern, though, as market volatility remains high. Fiona Cincotta of City Index says this month\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s losses could be a buying opportunity...... Wall Street started on the front foot with tech stocks on the rise after falling sharply in the previous session. Upbeat results from Microsoft and Telsa have gone some way to calming investor nerves after disappointments from Caterpillar and 3M earlier in the week. Whilst a slew of risk factors have hit traders confidence hard this month, investors will be looking searching for the bottom of this recent shake out. So far market shake out\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s this year have been buying opportunities and whilst we are still in a bull market, we don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t see why this one should be any different right now. Neil MacKinnon, Global Macro Strategist at VTB Capital, says today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s governing council meeting came at a tricky time for the ECB. The ECB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision to hold current interest rate levels at 0% takes place at a time of a cyclical slowdown in the Eurozone economies, as well as persistently subdued core CPI inflation. Business growth is at its slowest in two years and companies\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 expectations of future growth have slipped to the lowest in four years. The Italian budget drama is also high on the agenda and the stand-off between Rome and Brussels is unlikely to be resolved. Also noteworthy is the risk of a worsening \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcdoom-loop\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 between Italian banks and their holdings of domestic sovereign debt. Italy is not Greece and Rome will react badly if the ECB resorts to its \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcenforcement tools\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 of closing down bond purchases and turning off the liquidity tap for the Italian banking system.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s some expert reaction to the European Central Bank press conference today: Anna Stupnytska, global economist at Fidelity International, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153At today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s press conference Draghi chose to strike a relatively hawkish note, while acknowledging somewhat weaker economic momentum as of late. There has been some concern in the market about a number of disappointing data prints this month, including the flash PMIs yesterday, but evidence so far has not been strong enough to change the ECB stance. Anthony Kurukgy, Senior Sales Trader at Foenix Partners Mario Draghi stuck to the script again at today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ECB Press Conference, delivering yet another \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcbalanced\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 assessment of the eurozone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy. The ECB President quelled recent concerns of weaker economic data as merely a slowdown of growth momentum, not a downturn. This aside, the ECB remain committed to ending the central bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bond-buying programme come December. Transitory or not, Draghi and Co. will need to buy themselves more time to distinguish what effect trade wars, Brexit and the recent Italian budget crisis will have on its interest rate hike timeline in 2019. Silvia Dall\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Angelo, Senior Economist, Hermes Investment Management The bottom line is that the ECB is on a gradual path of monetary policy normalisation for now, but risks from protectionism, a further slowdown in external demand, domestic political instability, Brexit and volatility in financial markets cast a dark shadow on the ECB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s plans. Policy uncertainty has increased both externally and domestically: international trade tensions have remained high, there is no solution for the Brexit issue in sight, and the Italian government seems determined to defy the European fiscal rules. The recent turmoil in financial markets is a new addition to the list of downside risks. Marina Mensah-Afoakwah, Senior Economist at the CEBR Between Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s budget drama and the precarious nature of Brexit, there is a lot that threatens the Eurozone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stability. For the time being these pressures haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t risen to a level requiring ECB intervention. Time will tell however, as latest figures suggest cracks are beginning to show in the region\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bounceback on Wall Street means some investors may be snaffling up bargains. Or at least, what they hope are bargains. CNBC explains why traders may be putting their toes into the water again: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The technical picture has turned increasingly bearish this month,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Ed Yardeni, president and chief investment strategist at Yardeni Research. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The percentage of S&amp;P 500 companies trading above their 200-day moving averages was down to 37% after yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s debacle.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd He noted, however, that prior similar declines during this bull market have \u00e2\u20ac\u0153marked buying opportunities.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Yardeni added: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153If this is still a bull market, as we believe it is, then the latest bearish technicals and October\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s swoon should mark the latest buying opportunity.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Back in the markets, shares are rising in New York as traders return to the fray after yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s alarming late sell-off. The Dow Jones industrial average jumped by 192 points at the open, or 0.8%. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s an encouraging start, after Wednesday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 608-point slide. The Nasdaq is also recovering, after slumping ingloriously into a correction yesterday, in its worst day since 2011. The strong results from Twitter today, plus Microsoft and Tesla yesterday, may be calming nerves. Tesla has surged by over 8% in early trading, with other carmakers also up (Ford has gained almost 6%). Twitter has leapt by 15%, after beating profit and revenue forecasts today. But it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s early days. Investors will be watching nervously to see if Wall Street can hold onto these gains, or be dragged down again. Mario Draghi warns that there could be \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcuneasiness\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 in the financial markets, unless Britain and the EU make progress towards a Brexit deal. Asked about Brexit at today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s press conference, the ECB president says he is confident that a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153good, common sense solution\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd will be found. But he also warns that time is running out - if a deal isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t reached, banks and other businesses will be forced to trigger their contingency plans. As Draghi puts it: If this lack of a solution continues, and approaches the end date, the the private sector itself will have to prepare on the assumption that it will be a hard Brexit. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s where there will be financial uneasiness in markets. Boom! Mario Draghi has admonished politicians, such as Donald Trump, who put pressure on central banks to change their policy. He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been asked the pressure on the European Central Bank and the Fed to maintain their stimulus programmes, or do more. Draghi tells reporters in Frankfurt that these attacks threaten central bank independence. He says: Central bank independence is a precious thing. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s precious because it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s essential for the credibility of the central banks, and credibility is essential for effectiveness. That means giving central banks the independence to deliver their mandates, and to choose which instruments are most effective. If that is eroded, then a central bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s effectiveness is reduced, he warns. Earlier this week, Trump blasted the Fed for being too keen to raise interest rates, accusing it of threatening the US economy. In Europe, the ECB has faced criticism from Germany, for example, over its stimulus programme and record low interest rates. Draghi suggests that politicians should see the big picture: Actually the legislators themselves, who are often the very same people who are arguing for the central bank to do this or that, should be the first ones to care about monetary policy effectiveness and central banks achieving their goals. Q: What options do you have if the financial markets continue to fall, if economic data worsens, or if relations between Italy and the EC deteriorate further? We still have tools in the toolbox, Draghi replies. He reveals that two speakers at this week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Governing Council meeting mentioned its TLTRO programme -- which provides cheap financing to eurozone banks. Mario Draghi is fending off several questions about Italy, and whether he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s worried about the rise in its bond yields. He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s arguing that the spillover impact from Italy onto other countries is limited so far. Q: Are you worried that the spread between Italian and German bonds could continue to widen, perhaps to 400 basis points? Would that cause impairments to Italian banks\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 balance sheets? I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have a crystal ball, Draghi snaps back briskly. But yes, there is a linkage betweem Italian sovereign debt and its banks (which hold a lot of it). If they lose value, they are denting into the capital position of the banks. Mario Draghi adds that he is \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcconfident\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 that an agreement between Italy and the European Commission over its budget will be found . [reminder, the EC rejected Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s plans on Tuesday, but Rome is refusing to rewrite them] Q: What does the ECB think about the clash between Rome and Brussels over Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 2019 budget? Italy is a fiscal discussion, Draghi replies, so it wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t discussed much at today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meeting. Onto questions.. Q) Did the ECB discuss downgrading their assessment of the eurozone economy today? Mario Draghi speaks at some length, explaining that the governing council agreed that economic momentum has weakened, but we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re not facing a downturn. Various \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcidiosyncratic\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 reasons are to blame - such as the slowdown in Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s car sector as manufacturers get to grips with new emission rules. There are also a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcbunch of uncertainties\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, such as the stalemate between the US and China over trade, Brexit, and Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 2019 budget. Plus, Draghi adds, growth is returning to potential when it was clearly above potential in 2017. These risks are not considered enough to merit changing our balance of risks, he insists firmly. Draghi ends his statement with his traditional call for eurozone government to \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcsubstantially step up\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 their structural reforms, to take advantage of the ECB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stimulus measures. Eurozone states must raise their long-term growth potential, he adds. Over in Frankfurt, ECB president Mario Draghi is explaining today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s interest rate decision. He has singled out protectionism, emerging market vulnerabilities and financial market volatility as important risks to the eurozone recovery. However, overall risks are \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcbroadly balanced\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, he says. On inflation, the ECB thinks domestic cost pressures are strengthening and broadening, as wage increases feed through to prices. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Bloomberg\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s take on those durable goods figures: Newsflash: Orders for durable goods at American firms has fallen for the second month running (if you strip out aircraft and defence sales). Core durable goods orders shrank by 0.1% last month, new data shows, following a 0.2% decline in August. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s only a small move, of course, but it suggests US manufacturing isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t sizzling. Perhaps tariffs are having an effect. Twitter\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s earnings beat is going to help drive Wall Street up again, after yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s late rout. The tech-focused Nasdaq is now forecast to jump by 1.7% when trading begins. The Dow is on track to gain 220 points (or more than a third of yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s slump). Electric carmaker Tesla is also likely to surge, after surprising investors with a return to profitability last night. Microsoft also beat forecasts last night, partly thanks to strong growth at its Azure cloud computing division. Twitter isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t the only company beating forecasts today. Comcast, which recently won the battle for Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Sky News, has also impressed investors. Net income jumped by 9% in the last three months, as it attracted more broadband customers. NEWSFLASH: The European Central Bank has (to no-one\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s surprise) left eurozone interest rates at their current record lows. That means the headline borrowing rate remains at zero, while banks face a negative interest rate of -0.4% on their deposits at the ECB (to encourage them to lend the money instead). It also makes three important points: The ECB is still \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcanticipating\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 it will end its bond-buying programme in December, after buying \u00e2\u201a\u00ac15bn of securities each month until the end of the year. The ECB reiterated that it expects to leave rates on hold until at least the summer of 2019, to ensure that inflation returns sustainably to its target of just below 2%. It also restated its plan to reinvest the proceeds of bonds bought under its QE stimulus programme. That would avoid the risk of tightening monetary policy too quickly, even if the ECB has stopped printing any more electronic money. Dr Ben Marder, Senior Lecturer in Marketing at University of Edinburgh Business School, is concerned that Twitter\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s active user base is shrinking. He thinks that the site\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Fake News problem is hurting: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Donald Trump, no matter your opinion of the man, is Twitter gold. His tweets attract vast swathes of traffic to the site and he has no doubt had a positive effect on Twitter\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock price in the past few years. This was a mutually beneficial relationship as Twitter was pivotal for Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 2016 presidential election success. However, despite Twitter posting higher than expected earnings and revenue in Q3 2018, monthly active users have fallen for a second quarter in a row as the company continues to purge bots and fake accounts. It seems Trump is now biting the hand that used to feed him. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Twitter, much like other social media giants are starting to bleed-out from the large thorn in their side which is \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcfake news\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. Worsening the wound are world-wide governments, including the US who are threatening regulatory action against the tech giants for facilitating the dissemination of fake news. Adding to the many great ironies for Trump, he is largely rumoured to be a not so secret proponent of \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcfake news\u00e2\u20ac\u2122.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Par exemple..... Twitter is benefitting from a surge in advertising deals, explains Anthony Capano, managing director of Europe for Rakuten Marketing: While Twitter focused its efforts earlier this year on cleaning the platform of fraudulent actors, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s clear that the focus has returned to investing in global opportunities for advertisers. Earlier in Q3 the platform revealed a host of content partnerships including Bloomberg, Sony Music and NBCUniversal that would bring hundreds of hours of livestreams and other videos to the platform in the Asia-Pacific region. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s important UK marketers see how relevant these opportunities are to their operation. In Britain alone, as many as 35% of our client transactions are now taking place overseas. Some Silicon Valley early risers are waking up to the news that Twitter did better than expected last quarter: Newsflash: Twitter has smashed Wall Street forecasts with its latest financial results. The social network site grew its earnings to 21 cents per share in the last quarter, well ahead of estimates of 14 cents. Revenues came in at $758, beating forecasts of $702m, thanks to a 29% leap in advertising sales. However, Twitter also revealed that the number of monthly active users fell to 326 million; analysts expected 331.5 million. That may be due to Twitter\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s efforts to eradicate trolls, and malicious accounts created to pump out fake news and influence elections. Twitter also warned that it expects to keep losing active users in the current quarter. Shares are soaring in pre-market trading, as investors cheer the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s earnings growth. 2018 has been a pretty rough year for the markets, with nearly $7 trillion (!) wiped off stock values since the end of January. So, the 42 trillion dollar question is whether we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re heading towards a proper, old-fashioned crash... or if these lower prices actually give value. Neil Wilson of Markets.com suggests the long-running bull market hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t run out of steam yet. Stocks could rally if the Federal Reserve decides to slow the pace of future interest rate rises - as Donald Trump has been demanding. Wilson writes: We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re in a period of pressure building to the downside as we get more down days than up and the breadth of the decline is important as is the volume. However whilst the recent spike in volatility may be seen as meaning we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re past the peak, there may yet be a few breaths left in this old bull. Valuations - while not going for a song - are a lot more attractive at about 16x forward earnings. Confidence is clearly lacking however and it may require a softening tone from the Fed to assuage concerns on rates. Softer inflation figures would help greatly and the autumn/winter may provide respite on that front. If we go back a couple of weeks we must recall that this selling started on some very hawkish jawboning by Jerome Powell on rates. This may be the start of the age of the Bears but it may equally be just a tantrum. The macro outlook is not great - China, trade, Italy are all weights but for most of 2018 US investors were able to shrug off any global worries. Advertising giant WPP is having a torrid day, as its new boss gets to grips with the business\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s problems. Shares are down 16%, at their lowest level since December 2012, after it missed sales forecasts and slashed its guidance. CEO Mark Read, who replaced industry veteran Sir Martin Sorrell earlier this year, was blunt about WPP\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s problems, saying: Clearly we have underperformed our competition in the third quarter. We are not going to sugarcoat the reality.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd More here: Facebook has been buffeted by the stock market sell-off. Its shares slid by 5% yesterday, and are down 17% this year as the social network giant faces tough questions about extremism and election interference. In another blow, it has just been fined half a million pounds by Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s information commissioner for not protecting users\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 data. This follows the Cambridge Analytica scandal, which exposed how third party developers had been allowed to access user information without sufficient consent. In monetary terms, \u00c2\u00a3500k is barely a mosquito bite on a mammoth company worth $421bn. But it comes with a stern rebuke from information commissioner Elizabeth Denham, who says: Facebook failed to sufficiently protect the privacy of its users before, during and after the unlawful processing of this data. A company of its size and expertise should have known better and it should have done better. After that shaky start, European stocks have now turn positive for the day! Germany, France and Italy have all rebounded from this morning\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s lows, with Italian banks are leading the rally. Even the FTSE 100 is getting a boost, clawing its way back from that seven-month low. One factor - Wall Street is currently expected to rally in a few hours. The Dow futures show a gain of 224 points, following Wednesday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 608-point rout. Another factor: One of Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s coalition leaders has vowed to step in if a bank or other company needs help. Deputy PM Matteo Salvini, who also leads the right-wing Northern League party, said any help provided would be different from past interventions. Salvini also suggested that investors are too pessimistic about Italy, having driven its bond yields higher in recent weeks. Reuters has more details: Salvini, who is also the leader of the ruling League party, said on the sidelines of a conference in the northern city of Verona that the Italy/Germany bond yield spread would inevitably fall if it followed the real economy. Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell, says investors are nervous about the state of the world. He explains: The chief concerns are the potential negative impacts of higher interest rates, weaker global growth and the knock-on effects of trade tariffs. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The FTSE 100 fell 0.7% in early trading on Thursday to 6,912 with pharmaceuticals, insurers and oil companies the biggest contributors to the index\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decline. Japan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Nikkei index incurred heavy losses, falling 3.7% in a single session.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Back in Australia, insurance group AMP\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shares crashed by 25% today, as it paid the price for past misdeeds. AMP shocked investors by revealing that its wealth management business suffered a $1.5bn asset withdrawal in the last quarter. The company suffered badly from Australia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Royal Commission into banking, earlier this year. That inquiry exposed that AMB had charge customers who had died, and imposed fees even if it didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t provide a services. More here: Our latest Brexit dashboard shows how consumer spending slowed last month, even before the stock market turmoil hit confidence. Two leading economists argue that the government needs to take bold action, by ending austerity and helping businesses navigate Brexit uncertainty: Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s troubled retail sector is reeling from another blow this morning, as Debenhams outlines plans to shut up to 50 stores. The closure plan puts thousands of jobs at risk, on top of tens of thousands of redundancies at fellow chains such as Toys R Us, Mothercare, Carpetright and Maplin. Debenhams dropped the bad news as it reported a \u00c2\u00a3500m annual loss, partly due the cost of writing off unwanted shop leases and IT systems. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s an astonishing amount, for a company only valued at \u00c2\u00a3100m. The closures will take place over the next three to five years, Debs says, as it pulls out of unprofitable stores. Simon Underwood, business recovery partner at accountancy firm Menzies LLP, warns that the days of the traditional department store are numbered. Instead, they will become \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcexperimental showrooms\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, or places for meetings etc. Underwood adds: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The decision to focus on a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcprofitable core\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 of stores is a good one. However, the question is whether closing just ten stores now, with a view to reducing store numbers further over the next three to five years will be enough in view of the speed of changes in the marketplace as consumers shift to buying online. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The high street needs support, but some of the ideas being mooted by Government could prove counterproductive. For example, the Chairman of John Lewis, Sir Charlie Mayfield has recently spoken out against the Amazon tax and many bricks and mortar retailers fear that a blanket levy on online sales would be tantamount to hitting the high street when it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s down, as most of them sell goods online too. German firms are also anxious about the danger that Britain leaves the EU without a deal, says IFO. The row between Italy and the EU over its 2019 budget is another worry, it adds. Just in: business morale in Germany has taken a tumble this month. The German business climate index produced by the IFO institute dropped to 102.8 this month, down from 103.7 in September. Company bosses said business conditions had deteriorated, while their expectations also become gloomier. Geopolitical tensions, such as the trade wars between the US and China, seem to be hurting. Ifo chief Clemens Fuest blamed \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcglobal uncertainty\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 for the drop in confidence, adding: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Firms were less satisfied with their current business situation and less optimistic about the months ahead. Growing global uncertainty is increasingly taking its toll on the German economy.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Worryingly, there doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t seem to be a single cause for the current sell-off (unlike in 2008, say, or in 2015 when investors fretted about China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy). Instead, a cocktail of problems are being blamed, as traders worry that the long bull market in shares may be petering out. Kerry Craig, global market strategist at JP Morgan Asset Management, says the lack of a single cause for the current volatility is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153troubling\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. There are many symptoms but no one can diagnose the illness. Geopolitics, rising bond U.S. bond yields, a more hawkish looking U.S. Federal Reserve (the Fed), slowing Chinese growth, a strong U.S. dollar and the already well known problems in some emerging economies have all contributed to the market unease. The focus for investors had been on corporate earnings. Against all the macro headwinds, the micro factor of strong U.S. corporate earnings had been enough to insulate the market. So far the U.S. earnings season has been decent, with approximately 30% of the S&amp;P 500 companies by market capitalization having reported and 83% of those having beaten analyst\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s expectations for earnings. The anxiety now in markets stems from whether this is the peak in earnings and growth, as higher input costs from rising wages, the impact of tariffs and higher funding costs start to impinge on corporate margins. The problems in the U.S. market are having knock-on effects on global equities, and the rising U.S. dollar is exacerbating difficulties for emerging markets and Asia. However, the global economy is still growing and corporate earnings are still positive. They may not grow as fast or be as positive from here on out, but these are still reasons to favour risk assets and equities. Markets are likely to remain jittery for the rest of the year. The upcoming G20 meeting is not likely to result in a resolution of the trade dispute between the U.S. and China. Both sides are caught in a case of political brinkmanship. There are heavy losses in Europe too. Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s DAX index has fallen by 0.8%, to its lowest level since December 2016. France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s CAC hit its lowest level since March 2017, down another 0.4% in early trading. Here are the best and worst performing shares on the FTSE 100 this morning. Utilities, precious metal miners, and other defensive stocks are in - most other companies are out! Boom! Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE 100 has hit a seven-month low at the start of trading in London. The blue-chip index has fallen by 75 points to 6887, a drop of over 1%, its lowest level since late March. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s now lost around 8% of its value in the last four weeks, as the market sell-off has gathered pace. Advertising giant WPP are leading the selloff, slumping by 18% after reporting that revenues 1.5% fell in the last quarter. Consumer goods producers, technology companies, miners and energy firms are also in the red, as Europe picks up the sell-off baton from Asia. Some context: Stephen Innis of foreign exchange firm OANDA fears that the US stock markets are on the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153verge of crumbling\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, after last night\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s late rout. If people are struggling to find a driver I suggest, they wake up and smell the coffee. The catalysts are nothing new -- Tariffs, Italy, Brexit, Saudi Arabia. But with the towering pillars of market strength, the US equity markets, is looking ever so fragile and on the verge of crumbling. The air is so thick with a sense of foreboding that you can cut it with a dull butter knife. Maybe there are too many things going sideways clouding investor judgement, but things could turn nasty in a heartbeat. With risk sentiment tanking, we could be facing \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the early stages of a protracted equity market meltdown\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, he adds. Yesterday was the worst day for tech stocks on Wall Street for seven years, dragging the Nasdaq into bear-market territory and wiping out the Dow\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 2018 gains. And today, markets were in retreat from Sydney to Shanghai, my colleague Martin Farrer reports: In Australia the benchmark ASX200 closed down 164 points or 2.8% as it suffered its fifth straight day of losses. In Japan the Nikkei was off 3.7% and has now dropped around 13% from a 27-year peak of 24,448.07 touched in early October. A broad indicator of shares in the region \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the MSCI Asia Pacific index \u00e2\u20ac\u201c has now fallen 20.3% from the year-to-date high set on 29 January, representing an official bear market. The Vix \u00e2\u20ac\u0153fear\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd index, which measures volatility across the market, has spiked sharply this week and was up 21% overnight. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t thought that selling would be this steep. This sell-off makes us think the market may be set for capitulation,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Shoji Hirakawa, chief global strategist at Tokai Tokyo Research Center. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. The sell-off in global stock markets is accelerating today, as stocks keep sliding across the globe. Asian stock markets have plunged into bear market territory, meaning they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve shed 20% of their value since their highs in January. Fears over the health of the global economy, future US interest rate rises, Jamal Khashoggi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s murder, and America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade war with China are all being blamed as investors try to grab the nearest tin hat to ride out the storm. Some disappointing corporate results this week - including from industry bellwether Caterpillar - have also dampened the mood, and raised fears that growth is slowing. After a very bruising session, Japan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Nikkei has tumbled by 3.7%, while Australia has lost 2.8%. China suffered fresh losses too, taking it deeper into its own bear market. Analysts are worried that the sell-off has further to run, and could turn into a full-blown collapse. As Greg McKenna, an independent markets strategist in Australia, put it: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The fear is palpable in stock markets at the moment,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This could get much worse before it gets better. Collapses happen after falls. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the danger.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd That follows another rocky session on Wall Street, where the Dow slumped by another 600 points (-2.4%). That wipes out all its gains for this year, as a wave of worry swept the trading floors. Optimism is out, and volatility is back. Bears are prowling the trading floors this morning in Europe too. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE 100 is expected to fall, and could hit a new seven-month low. Other European markets are expected to slide too, as the spat between Rome and Brussels over next year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s budget continues. The EU has asked for a new version within three weeks, but Italy is refusing to rewrite its plans. Also coming up The European Central Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s governing council is meeting today to set monetary policy. No change is expected, but Mario Draghi will be quizzed by journalists.
