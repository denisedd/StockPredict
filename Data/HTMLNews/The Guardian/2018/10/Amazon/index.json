                "bodyText":"And finally, here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our economics editor Larry Elliott on Amazon\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision to pay its staff more: Goodnight! GW Royal Mail was the biggest faller on the FTSE 100 today, shedding another 8% to 359p after Monday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s profits warning shocker. European stock markets ended the day lower, although Italy clawed its way back from an early-morning selloff. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE 100 closed 21 points lower, or -0.28%, at 7,474, with Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB down a similar amount. The French CAC shed 0.7%, though, while Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s DAX lost 0.4%. In the currency markets, the pound is down half a percent at $1.2978, having hit a three week low today. Connor Campbell of SpreadEx says: The FTSE, which is normally a fan of a pummelled pound, found little to celebrate as the day went on, slipping 30 or so points to hit 7470. This despite a decent rebound from its miners, and the (admittedly slim) gains made by BP and Shell as Brent Crude lurked around $85 per barrel. Over in the Eurozone, the conflict between the EU and Italy has not only dragged the euro lower, but caused the region\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s indices to reverse Monday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s growth. Happy scenes at an Amazon warehouse as the news broke: Bernie Sanders has given Amazon his blessing, and urged other businesses chiefs to copy them: Amazon\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pay hike could be a watershed moment for the global economy, says Hinesh Patel of Quilter Investors. Patel thinks the move is partly PR-driven \u00e2\u20ac\u201d having the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s richest man leading tens of thousand of poorly paid staff isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t a great look... In that sense, this shift is about improving the company image and guarding Amazon\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s reputation. But, it also reflects changes in the jobs market, where tight labour supply is giving workers more muscle. If so, other firms may be forced to follow, Patel explains: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s news could be a watershed moment in this paradigm shift, with one of the largest employers and a household name making such a bold statement on wages. This will place pressure on other large corporates to follow up this move with a comparable remuneration offer of their own. While these wage raises will cost Amazon, it has the financial might to absorb that cost increase and put the squeeze on rivals as the ripple effect of these wage rises hits other corporates. Similarly, while the national minimum wage has been static for some time, at state level increases have been implemented and today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s news could prompt Washington to revise the national minimum, with Amazon already indicating they will be lobbying Congress to that effect. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Markets will be watching the impact of this dynamic closely. A tightening labour market could create healthy inflation and boost consumer spending power but it could also have an impact on corporate earnings. Back in the financial markets, Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s deepening dispute with Brussels has driven the euro down to a six-week low. The single currency has dropped to $1.154 against the US dollar, down 0.3%, as Rome refuse to back down over its spending plans. Deputy Prime Minister Luigi Di Maio raised the stakes by insisting that his government will stick to its deficit target - of 2.4% of GDP. He told a radio interview: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We are not turning back from that 2.4 percent target, that has to be clear ... We will not backtrack by a millimetre.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Italian bonds have also weakened today, pushing the gap with safe-haven German debt to a four-year high. Di Maio has insisted that his government aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t planning to leave the euro...but also blasted Brussels officials for fuelling the crisis. Investors are fretting that the eurozone crisis could be poised for another act. David Madden of CMC Markets explains: The administration in Rome are set to be on a collision course with Brussels over the proposed size of its deficit. Traders are worried that Italy might be aiming to exit the euro and or the EU, but Luigi Di Maio, one of the joint Deputy Prime Ministers denied those claims this morning. The political rumbling in Italy is weighing on their banking sector due to its exposure to the Italian government bond market. The UNI Global Union, a collection of 900 unions from 150 countries, is also pushing Amazon to do more for its workers. UNI Global Union General Secretary Christy Hoffman argues that Jeff Bezos must do better. She also points out that Amazon workers who are members of ver.di, the largest service worker union in Germany, began a two-day strike on Monday to push for pay increases. Hoffman says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153A trillion-dollar company headed by the richest man in the world should pay its workers a wage above the poverty line. While this is a step forward, it is a long way from where Amazon needs to be. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153These pay rises come only after workers and communities have demanded better from the company\u00e2\u20ac\u201dincluding Amazon workers striking in Germany today. Instead of giving Amazon pats on the back, unions around the world will continue pushing Amazon until it is a truly responsible global company, until it recognises union rights.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Amazon\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s move comes four weeks after the Archbishop of Canterbury warned that Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economic model was broken, with the gap between the rich (led by Jeff Bezos) and the poor widening. Archbishop Welby is part of a new commission on Economic Justice, led by the IPPR thinktank. It proposed a swathe of measures including a higher minimum wage, more protection for workers, and better regulation of digital firms. IPPR director Tom Kibasi has tweeted that Amazon\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s wage increases are a start: UK opposition leader Jeremy Corbyn has tweeted that Amazon\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pay increase shows the power that workers can have if they work together. However, US Amazon workers have found it extremely hard to unionise. Some have reported intense pressure from management when they tried to form a union. Amazon\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pay hike may also be a sign that the company is finding it harder to recruit staff, especially with Black Friday and Christmas coming up... This is from Mike Jakeman, PwC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s global economist: Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s unions aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t too impressed by Amazon\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pay rise - and are urging the company to improve working conditions too. TUC General Secretary Frances O\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Grady says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Amazon is a trillion-dollar company. It can easily afford to pay staff higher wages. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153If Amazon is really serious about looking after its workforce it must recognise trade unions. And it must end the exploitative working practices that have seen hundreds of ambulances called to its UK warehouses. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153All workers deserve decent conditions at work \u00e2\u20ac\u201c not surveillance, inhuman targets and the threat of a disciplinary if they to go to the toilet. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s announcement is the result of campaigning by the GMB and unions around the world. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s only a start and shouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be spun as a huge act of generosity.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Back in 2016, journalist James Bloodworth worked undercover at an Amazon warehouse, and reported that some staff were urinating in bottles because they feared disciplinary action if they took a toilet break. What could possibly have prompted Amazon\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sudden largesse? Well, the company has been facing rising criticism on both sides of the Atlantic for its business practices, from pay and conditions to its tax bills. Progressive US senator Bernie Sanders has targeted the company with a new bill called Stop BEZOS. It would penalise companies whose poorly paid staff were forced to take welfare payments to make ends meet. Amazon is one of the biggest employers of those who receive food stamps in the United States, with nearly one in three Amazon workers on food stamps in Arizona and one in 10 in Pennsylvania and Ohio. European workers are also unhappy. There have been strikes in Italy, Germany and Spain as unions demand better pay and conditions from the company. UK workers have also warned that conditions at Amazon\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s warehouses are below standard, with ambulances had been called out 600 times to the online retailer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s UK warehouses in the past three years. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pay rise won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t address those issues, but may show that Amazon has recognised it has a serious problem. And just yesterday, chancellor Philip Hammond called for urgent reforms to the way big technology firms are taxed. Amazon actually halved its UK corporation tax bill last year to \u00c2\u00a34.5m, despite continuing to grow strongly - often at the expense of traditional retailers. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our news story on Amazon\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s dramatic wage increases: Amazon had previously paid its UK staff \u00c2\u00a38 per hour, or \u00c2\u00a38.20 in London. So staff in the capital are getting a pay rise of up to 28%, while those in the rest of the country could earn 18% more. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a whopping inflation-busting increase, especially as average UK wages are rising by less than 3% at present. Newsflash: Amazon is also hiking its minimum wage in the UK too. It just announced it will now pay at least \u00c2\u00a310.50 per hour in London, and \u00c2\u00a39.50 across the rest of the UK. As in America, the rise will apply to all full-time, part-time, temporary (including those hired by agencies), and seasonal employees from the start of November. Amazon says 17,000 staff, and 20,000 seasonal employees, will benefit. Doug Gurr, Amazon VP and UK Country Manager, says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This will impact more than 37,000 employees across the country, resulting in higher pay for them and their families.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd For comparison, the UK minimum wage for those over 25 is \u00c2\u00a37.83 per hour, or \u00c2\u00a37.38 for those under 25. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s some instant reaction to Amazon\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision to raise its minimum wage to twice the US minimum: Amazon have also released a Q&amp;A about their pay rise. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a flavour: Does this apply to Whole Foods and your other subsidiaries? Yes. The new Amazon $15 minimum wage applies to all U.S. employees at Amazon and its subsidiaries. How are you going to work with Congress to raise the federal minimum wage? Our public policy team will work with policymakers in Washington, D.C., to advocate for a higher federal minimum wage. What do you want the federal minimum wage to be raised to? We believe $7.25 is too low. We would look to Congress to decide the parameters of a new, higher federal minimum wage. In another important move, Amazon is going to lobby Congress to raise the Federal minimum wage from $7.25 per hour. Jay Carney, Senior Vice President of Amazon Global Corporate Affairs, says: We will be working to gain Congressional support for an increase in the federal minimum wage. The current rate of $7.25 was set nearly a decade ago. We intend to advocate for a minimum wage increase that will have a profound impact on the lives of tens of millions of people and families across this country.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Amazon\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new $15/hour minimum wage will apply to all full-time, part-time, temporary and seasonal workers in the US. It will begin on November 1st, meaning staff should have a little more cash in their pockets for Thanksgiving and Christmas spending. Newsflash from America: E-commerce giant Amazon is raising its minimum wage for US workers to DOUBLE the US minimum. It will now pay at least $15 per hour, compared to the national floor of $7.25 per hour. Jeff Bezos, Amazon founder and CEO (and the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s richest man), says Amazon has responded to criticism over the way it treats its staff. Bezos is now urging other companies to do the same.... \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We listened to our critics, thought hard about what we wanted to do, and decided we want to lead. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re excited about this change and encourage our competitors and other large employers to join us.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd https://twitter.com/LJKawa/status/1047064119751467009 Back in the markets, European stocks have lost ground today as the optimism over the new US-Mexico-Canada trade deal fizzles out. In London, the FTSE 100 has lost almost 50 points to 7448. Royal Mail shares have dropped 7.8% to their lowest level since the company floated in 2014, after a whopping profits warning yesterday. Oil giants BT and Shell are bucking the trend, though; their shares have risen, matching the higher oil price today. The German DAX and French CAC are both down around 1%, while Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB has sunk lower as the row over the 2019 Italian budget worries investors. The relief following the new NAFTA deal did not last long, points out Fiona Cincotta of City Index. She adds: Expectations that the agreement would somehow translate into the easing of trade tensions with China proved wishful thinking \u00e2\u20ac\u201c President Trump poured cold water over those with a sobering comment. Unlike the markets, US officials believe that Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s approach will eventually wear China down by stifling foreign investment and discouraging companies to use China as part of their production chain, such as in the case of Apple and its iPhones, and forcing the country to agree to the concessions asked by the US. Brexit may make it much harder for British builders to find skilled staff, warns Blane Perrotton of property consultancy and surveyors Naismiths. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153With the government confirming its plans to make it harder for European workers to come to the UK after Brexit, the construction industry could become an early casualty. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Across the UK, one in 10 builders is an EU national \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and this figure rises to a third in London. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153With UK construction already struggling from a chronic skills shortage and Brexit sapping investors\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 confidence, British builders need restrictions on European workers like they need a hole in the head.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s retail crisis is also hurting UK construction. With scores of stores closing, there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s less demand for builders to knock up new outlets, argues. Max Jones of Lloyds Bank Commercial Banking says this makes it tougher for construction firms to find work: The commercial sub-sector is facing myriad headwinds, with the London market still heavily exposed to Brexit uncertainty and retail suffering an annus horribilis. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Against this background, many contractors are betting big on infrastructure, yet there is only so much work to go round. And with some questioning the merit of the current pipeline of megaprojects, it underlines that there is no risk-free part of the market in which to be invested.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Duncan Brock, Group Director at the Chartered Institute of Procurement &amp; Supply, says Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s builders have plenty to worry about, including Brexit: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Despite the biggest rise in new orders since December 2016, the sector remained in a downbeat mood with business optimism at its second lowest level since the beginning of 2013. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153A cause of this malaise pointed to increased cost burdens with both fuel prices on the rise, and acute shortages in raw materials, as supplier delivery times have lengthened to an extent not seen since 2015. The Brexit blot on the landscape was still in evidence as housing activity slowed to a pre-April growth rate and clients hesitated to place orders. Civil engineering was hit the hardest however and under 50 for the second month in a row, which points towards another contraction. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s PMI report suggests British builders are struggling, because clients are too worried about Brexit to commit to new projects. Tim Moore, Associate Director at IHS Markit (who wrote the report), explains: Construction companies continued to note that political uncertainty acted a key drag on decision- making, with Brexit worries encouraging a wait-and- see approach to spending among clients. The main areas reported as likely to see a boost in the coming year were construction work related to large-scale energy and transport projects.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Newsflash: Growth in Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s building sector has fallen to a six-month low. Data firm Markit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s construction PMI (which measures activity in the sector) fell to 52.1 in September, down from 52.9 in August. Civil engineering suffered particularly badly, with growth contracting. Worryingly, business confidence across the sector fell to its second-lowest level in over five years - even though new orders picked up. Markit blames uncertainty over Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s exit from the European Union, saying: Construction companies noted that political uncertainty and investor concerns about Brexit had dampened confidence in September. Where a rise in business activity was projected, forthcoming energy and transport projects remained the main areas of optimism. Builders also reporting that they were forced to pay more for fuel (thanks to the rising oil price), and for raw materials such as timber. More to follow.... Rising oil prices aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t great news for the car industry. If petrol becomes pricier, it may deter some consumers from buying a new motor. But another issue is casting a shadow over the Paris Motor Show today - Brexit. Dieter Zetsche, the CEO of Daimler, has warned that the risk Britain leaves the EU without a deal is a serious worry. Zetsche told the Motor Show that: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Possible scenarios are highly worrying. We have analysed possible scenarios since the (2016 Brexit) referendum to prepare ourselves. In sum, it is an extraordinarily sad development.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Peugeot is also concerned. Its European boss, Maxime Picat, told Reuters that its UK manufacturing could suffer if new trade barriers are set up after Brexit. Picat warned: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve been doing all we can to develop our UK business, restore Vauxhall and Opel profitability, reinvesting in Luton and improving our sites\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 competitiveness in order to help them face up to an uncertain future. But there are limits. Those limits are customs barriers,and the loss of freedom of movement, for people and goods. If we get to that point, we will be obliged to take measures. If we suddenly have to start manufacturing for the UK in the UK, and for Europe in Europe, there will necessarily be an impact on UK production. Back in the UK, London house prices have continued to fall. Prices in the capital dropped by 0.7% in the last three months - the fifth quarterly drop in a row, according to the Nationwide building society. More here: There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s lots of chatter that oil could be heading back to $100 per barrel - a level last seen in September 2014. Jasper Lawler of London Capital Group, for example, thinks the loss of Iranian supplies will keep prices buoyant: Concerns over tighter supply ahead of the Iran embargo are keeping the bulls firmly in control. Iran supplies almost 3% of the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s daily oil consumption, so any sanctions on Iran will hit the supply side of the equation, and hard. Supply is looking fragile and when you then throw in Venezuela\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s declining output, the price looks well supported at $85 with $100 in sight. Bloomberg\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Julian Lee agrees that Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s attack on Iran\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy (triggered by his withdrawal from the Iranian nuclear deal) are partly to blame: The loss of nearly a million barrels a day [from Iran] and the prospect of more to follow, have done more than anything else to revive the possibility of $100 oil. Little wonder Trump has tweeted his frustration at an increasingly powerless OPEC. Most members of that group are already producing as much as they can. Even if they could squeeze out more barrels, doing so would only raise worries about diminishing the cushion of spare capacity to offset any future disruption to supply. Oil at $100 a barrel would be bad news for drivers everywhere \u00e2\u20ac\u201d including those in the U.S. \u00e2\u20ac\u201d and the sanctions on Iran are making it increasingly likely. With the midterm elections looming, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no surprise that the president is trying to deflect blame for outcome of his foreign policy onto foreign oil producers. Oil has \u00e2\u20ac\u0153sprung another gusher overnight\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, says Stephen Innes of trading firm OANDA, as he watches the US crude price hit a fresh four year high. He believes the new USMCA trade deal is also pushing crude prices up: Ultimately the markets remain singularly focused on the prospect of supply disruptions from Iran which is the primary driver of oil prices. And of course, the US/Mexico/Canada trade agreement will have a longer-term positive impact on oil prices in a broader macro context. Michael Hewson of CMC Markets fears that higher oil prices will choke off growth, at a time when trade war fears are also hurting confidence: IMF head Christine Lagarde warned yesterday that the fund was likely to be downgrading its global growth outlook in the coming days, and its hard to argue that an oil price that could be heading towards $90 a barrel at a time when economic activity is slowing, is conducive to a strong growth picture. If anything, it will act as a pinch on consumer spending and could well choke it off altogether if it moves towards $100. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. The oil price is on a tear, hitting its highest level in four years, sparking speculation that the world economy could return to the era of $100 per barrel again. Brent crude - sourced from the North Sea - has jumped over $85 per barrel, a level last seen in November 2014. US crude has also hit a four-year high this morning, surging to nearly $76 per barrel. The oil price has now surged by 50% in the last 12 months, driving up transport costs and threatening to drag on global growth. This won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t please Donald Trump, who has been been loudly lobbying Opec to get the oil price down, fearing it will hurt American consumers. But the president must take some responsibility - his sanctions on Iran are one factor driving prices up. Analysts estimate that Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s block on Iranian oil exports could remove 1.5 million barrels per day from the global market. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a significant loss, at a time when global demand is rising towards 100 million barrels per day. Oil, after all, isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t immune to the law of supply and demand. As Norbert Ruecker, head of commodity research at Swiss bank Julius Baer, puts it: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Oil prices continue to climb, supported by the nearing Iran embargo and related supply concerns. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The supply situation looks fragile indeed, as any additional shortfall such as a deterioration of the situation in Venezuela would tighten oil supplies.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be tracking the oil price closely through the day. Also coming up today It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a quiet day on the economic front, but we will find out how Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s builders fared last month. Investors will also be watching Italy nervously, as the row with Brussels over its budget deepens. European finance ministers may discuss the situation as they gather for an ECOFIN meeting in Brussels later today.

                "bodyText":"The boss of Shell has said a huge tree-planting project the size of the Amazon rainforest would be needed to meet a tougher global warming target, as he argued more renewable energy alone would not be enough. Ben van Beurden said it would be a major challenge to limit temperature rises to 1.5C (equivalent to a rise of 2.7F), which a landmark report from the UN\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s climate science panel has said will be necessary to avoid dangerous warming. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153You can get to 1.5C, but not by just by pulling the same levers a little bit harder, because they are being pulled roughly as fast and as hard as we are currently imagining. What we think can be done is massive reforestation. Think of another Brazil in terms of rainforest: you can get to 1.5C,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he told an oil and gas industry audience in London. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not what some people sometimes think: we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll just do a little bit more solar, a bit more wind and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll get there,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he added. Reforestation is seen as essential in the scenarios outlined this week by the UN\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s intergovernmental panel on climate change, if the world is to restrict warming to 1.5C. But Van Beurden stressed that meeting the challenge would be an uphill battle, because while it was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153technically about doable\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, it would not be commercially viable without changes to government policies and regulation. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Already to get to less than 2C will be [a] quite unimaginable, unprecedented scale of collaboration. Getting to 1.5C is a major challenge on top of it,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said. But the Shell chief executive was adamant that gas, which makes up a growing share of the firm\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s portfolio, would have have a role to play in a 1.5C world. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153You can have an endless discussion about semantics. Is it a transition role, a destination role? In the end it is a bit of both,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he told the Oil and Money conference. He said observers should not mistake headlines on the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s forays into low-CO2 projects as a sign it was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153going soft\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd on oil and gas. In the past year, Shell has made investments in electric car infrastructure firms, offered support to the government bringing forward its proposed ban on new petrol and diesel car sales and bought up one of the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest electricity and gas suppliers. Van Beurden said renewables would become a bigger part of what the company does in future, but it could only move as far as society did. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153That means Shell\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s core business is, and will be for the foreseeable future, very much in oil and gas,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said. Separately, Qatar, the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest exporter of liquefied natural gas (LNG) said there was no doubt gas would be a fuel of the future, even with tough climate targets. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We believe natural gas will continue to play a key role, not as a so-called transition fuel but rather in our view, a destination fuel,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Saad al-Kaabi, chief executive of Qatar Petroleum.

                "bodyText":"A volatile week across global stock markets has escalated into a frenzied sell-off, with European stock markets plunging to their lowest level in 20 months on Thursday. In the UK the FTSE 100 fell to a six-month low after Wall Street suffered its biggest drop in eight months, with the Dow Jones losing more than 800 points. Why are markets tanking? The sell-off is being fuelled by concerns over rising US interest rates, political uncertainty in Italy, mounting trade tensions between the US and China, and crises in emerging markets such as Turkey and Argentina. Donald Trump added to the pressure by branding the US Federal Reserve \u00e2\u20ac\u0153crazy\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd for planning further rate rises. The US economy is booming, prompting the Fed to raise rates to keep a lid on inflation. Rising interest rates mean higher borrowing costs for companies and individuals, such as higher mortgage rates. Investors are fearful that firms and consumers will struggle to cope with higher costs. Charlie Ripley, a senior strategist at Allianz Investment Management, said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The equity sell-off is a reaction from investors finally realising we are in a higher interest-rate environment and, given the elevated level of stocks, market participants were likely looking for a reason to sell.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Which stocks have been worst hit? The rout has been led by technology stocks. In the US the Dow Jones and the S&amp;P 500 both lost more than 3% overnight, their worst declines since February, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq tumbled more than 4%, the biggest fall since the Brexit vote. The best-performing stocks over the past year have been the so-called Faang group, comprising Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix and Google, which have endured some of the biggest losses. Tech companies tend to be highly leveraged, so will be vulnerable to rising interest rates. The EU\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s planned new tax on technology companies is also putting pressure on tech giants. Why are bond yields rising? The Fed has raised interest rates three times this year and traders are expecting another increase in December, followed by three more next year. This is pushing up bond yields and higher bond yields can weigh on stock markets as they provide more competition for investors seeking returns. The yield on the two-year US government bond hit its highest level since 2008 on Wednesday, while the 10-year yield, which is used to price mortgages, auto loans and other debt, reached a seven-year high the previous day. Rising bond yields make it more expensive to borrow money. What is the latest in the US-China trade war? Last month Washington imposed new tariffs on $200bn of Chinese goods, hitting thousands of consumer goods, from luggage and electronics to homewares and foods. Tariffs were set at 10% but could go to 25% next year. Beijing retaliated with extra duties on $60bn of US goods. The US president has also threatened further tariffs on an additional $276bn of goods, covering virtually all Chinese imports. Earlier US tariffs imposed in July targeted imports of steel, aluminium and cars. Ominously, Jack Ma, the Alibaba billionaire, predicted that the US-China trade war could last 20 years.

And in case you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re wondering what all this is about, you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re in good company ... the US economist Paul Krugman doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have a clue either. Some reaction to the Australian housing market numbers, which are quite bad. Less lending = lower house prices as one tweeter neatly up sums. But at least the number of first-time buyers is the highest for six years. The bank hearings have wound up in Canberra. In final questions, ANZ chief Shayne Elliott said fewer customers used physical banks to do their business and so ANZ plans on closing about 12 of its 650 or so branches. That follows a trend, Elliott says, which had been set over the last couple of years, with 30 to 50 branches being closed a year. Elliott now heads to his meetings with bank customers who have come to Canberra to discuss their issues with him. Next Friday, Andrew Thorburn, the head of NAB, will face the committee. The positive moves in the Chinese markets come despite the Singapore central bank announcing a tightening of monetary policy. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a sign of the times. Singapore, which manages policy through exchange rate settings rather than interest rates, noted that it expected steady growth despite the possibility of trade tensions disrupting the global outlook. Monetary Authority of Singapore said: In 2019, trade frictions between some major economies and the uncertainty they pose could weigh more discernibly on global economic activity. Barring a significant setback in global growth, the Singapore economy should expand at a pace close to potential in 2019. The Chinese markets have opened up. Hong Kong has managed a gain of 0.5% while the Shanghai Composite is up 0.16%. As far as Australia is concerned, the RBA says the economy is at risk from external shocks and says the incipient US-China trade war or a slowdown in growth in China could trigger a domestic problem. Australia would be sensitive to a sharp contraction in global growth or dislocation in global financial markets because of the importance of trade and capital inflows. A worsening in external conditions could see a downturn in the domestic economy, reduced availability and higher cost of offshore funding and falls in asset prices, with a resulting deterioration in the performance of borrowers and lenders. As for the housing market, it says it has turned a little and says it could be \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a positive development for financial stability\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd However, it could also be bad news for people who have borrowed too much and find themselves in negative equity as lending requirements tighten and house prices fall. Some existing borrowers may find they do not meet new lending standards and so have difficulty refinancing. Similarly, while most borrowers with loans transitioning from interest-only to principal and interest payments are well placed to meet the higher payments, a small share could struggle. The Reserve Bank of Australia has issued its financial stability review today. It says the rise in US interest rates blamed for the current market volatility are not causing much disruption. But it says that some risks are emerging as the Fed moves away from the low-interest environment: The extended period of low-interest rates has seen some financial stability risks emerge. Notably compensation for risk is very low with asset prices in a range of markets at high levels, underpinned by low long-term interest rates. Household, corporate and sovereign debt has also risen to high levels in some jurisdictions. For emerging market economies \u00e2\u20ac\u201c especially those with structural or cyclical vulnerabilities \u00e2\u20ac\u201c there are concerns about the implications of a tightening in financial conditions in the advanced economies. Those housing finance figures are not great news for Australia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s banks, which have built their huge profitability in recent years on some heroic mortgage lending. The financial sector of the ASX 200 is down 0.77% today in a market off 0.25% overall. Things go from bad to worse in the Australian housing market. Figures just released by the bureau of statistics show that total dwelling finance dropped by 2.1% in August to just over $30bn \u00e2\u20ac\u201c much worse than the -1% expected and a big drop on the 0.4% increase in July. Another big fall in investor lending. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s down -1.2%. On the currency markets, the yen has continued to hold up against the dollar at 112 to the greenback. A stronger yen is usually not so good for the Nikkei, which is a stronghold of Japan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s big exporters. The Aussie dollar \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a key proxy for emrging markets in the Asia Pacific region \u00e2\u20ac\u201c has also fought back during the big stock selloff, going from around US70.5 to US71.27 this morning. The Nikkei has dropped a modest amount this morning. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re currently off by 0.22%, or 50 points, at 22,541 points. The Kospi in Seoul is up 0.47%. Sydney is now down only 0.15%. Elliott also admits that ANZ\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s profits have been hit by the aftermath of the commission, explaining that the bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s return on equity has fallen from 17-18% to 11% in the past few years. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153ANZ\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s profitability is dramatically lower than it was,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he says. Labor MP Matt Keogh has scored a direct hit against ANZ boss Shayne Elliott bringing applause from the audience in Canberra, which includes people from the Bank Reform Now group. It came after the bank boss seemed to suggest that money being paid out as compensation to customers belonged to investors (\u00e2\u20ac\u0153it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s their money\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said). But Keogh said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not \u00e2\u20ac\u201c it should have been in the customer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pocket the whole time,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to which Elliott puts his hands up: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I accept that I misspoke there, fair point. The bulk of the money is not refunds actually, the bulk of the money is actually the cost of going back and finding and recalculating the money and doing the data search - that was the piece I was talking about, the cost of remediation, the work, costs significant amounts of money, that is what I was referring to \u00e2\u20ac\u201c but you are quite right, the refund money obviously belongs to customers.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd In commodities, gold has benefited from falling stocks as investors seek familiar safe havens for their money. Business Insider tells us that on Thursday gold had its best day since Brexit. Talking of Brexit, just a quick diversion here which readers might find depressing or amusing, or perhaps a bit of both. The UK transport department has announced that part of the M26 motorway in Kent will be closed while work is carried out on figuring out how to turn it into a truck park in the event of Brexit causing huge delays at the Channel ports and tunnel. You couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t make it up, as they say. More from Amy in Canberra. Shayne Elliott says he has met some ANZ customers who felt abused by the bank, and was personally answering emails from customers. He also gives his personal email to the committee and asks people to contact him directly with their concerns. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Shayne.Elliott@anz.com The committee members, including Liberal MP Trevor Evans, are giving personal cases to Elliott and asking about those customers who still say they are not receiving responses from the bank. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Every case is unique and they should expect a response,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Elliott said, who is appearing before the committee for the fourth time. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I give my commitment that I will be personally involved in the response from the bank.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd He says he won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t always be the person who speaks directly with the customer, but he makes the commitment that he \u00e2\u20ac\u0153will stay on top\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd of responding to customer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s concerns. But he also says, in terms of time frames, some of the matters are exceptionally complicated, mentioning one case which goes back to 1992. But he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meeting with more customers this afternoon - including the case Evans just raised. ANZ chief Shayne Elliott is getting his grilling from a parliamentary committee. My colleague in Canberra, Amy Remeikis is watching and says that Elliott has told the committee that renumeration had absolutely been part of the ANZ culture - which follows on from Commissioner Kenneth Hayne\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s interim report which found \u00e2\u20ac\u0153greed\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd had led to a lot of the misconduct issues. Elliott said there had been changes, and he admits, again, that he was wrong to have dismissed the need for a royal commission, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153given what has been uncovered so far.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd ANZ has engaged in misconduct and conduct falling below community standards and expectations. It is completely unacceptable that we have caused financial harm and emotional distress to our customers. He also said there was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153no pride\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd being the subject of regulator Asic\u00e2\u20ac\u2122sfocus and that it caused reputational damage and was seen as a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153major fail\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. He said \u00e2\u20ac\u0153fear\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd was a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153strong word\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd when it came to Asic, but the bank \u00e2\u20ac\u0153certainly respects Asic\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Overall, he wants you to know that the bank has changed. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The bank needs to be able to generate capital so we can fulfil our social obligations, but we need to get that balance right and we clearly failed at that in the past, and we are moving away from that. As I said, revenue, and the generic terms for \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcsales\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t been part of the group score card in the last three years, so we don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have that same middle layer, saying \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcmiddle management have a sales target, but the juniors don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t. We don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have that today. But we can certainly improve and I agree that we need to do more work in getting that balance right. Not a bad start for the ASX after yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s big moves. Losses are easing back already but it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s early days. Volatility could be the name of the game today. Jonathen Chan, market analyst, CMC Markets, thinks so, and flags today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s data (see below) as key set points:. Futures markets are pointing to a mixed start for Asia Pacific equities. Regional markets may fluctuate in a similar fashion to the overnight action in the US markets. In particular, the Australia housing finance data due this morning may influence the banking sectors, as well the appearance of senior executives at the royal commission inquiry. The Shanghai stock markets may have a chance to rebound if the trade balance data due this afternoon illustrates growth, or potentially lesser impact from the trade war. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re off. The ASX 200 has slipped 47 points or 0.8% at the open. I should say that the Australian stock market opens in Sydney at 10am local time (00.00BST) followed by Tokyo and Seoul an hour later. Then at 02.30GMT trading starts in Hong Kong and Shanghai. And in Australia this morning it is the turn of ANZ bank boss Shayne Elliott to face questioning by MPs in the wake of the damaging revelations of the banking royal commission. The inquiry has exposed a widespread culture of greed in an industry once revered for having avoided the worst ravages of the global financial crisis. Matt Comyn, the boss of the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest bank Commonwealth, was jeered from the public gallery during his apperance yesterday. If you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re reading outside Australia and you haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t followed the course of the commission, here is an excellent wrap of the preliminary findings. Aside from what happens on the markets, there is a lot of data being released today which will keep us busy. At 11.30 Sydney time (01.30BST) we have Australian mortgage lending figures for August which will speak to the state of the housing market. In July they were up 0.4% but the market forecast is -1%. The Reserve Bank of Australia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s financial stability review comes at the same time which could contain commentary on the markets. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re also expecting China trade data later which could shed some light on the state of the Chinese economy. When Europe awakes, we will get industrial production figures for the eurozone. One of the biggest talking points of the past 24 hours has been Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s comments about the Federal Reserve and interest rate hikes. The president has described the Fed as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153out of control\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd because he thinks it is increasing borrowing costs too quickly and putting pressure on the economy. Greg McKenna, the independent Australian market strategist, has this salient point: President Trump has captured the narrative by blaming the Fed for all these market ructions. But the reality is the economy his policies have overheated does need more rate hikes. Markets know that he knows that, but the Fed is the perfect foil in the run-up to the mid-terms. The New Zealand stock market is up and running. A bit like how they are among the very the first to celebrate New Year, the Kiwis are first out of the blocks for finance. The benchmark NZX-50 index is currently down about 1% after dropping 3.64% yesterday. Remarkably, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s still positive for the year, unlike most others. If you need a more in-depth catch up on a dramatic day\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trading on Wall Street, you can read the wrap by my colleague Dominic Rushe here. Good morning to everyone in Australia and Asia, and good evening to everyone else. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m Martin Farrer and I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m taking over the blogging reins from the the indefatigable Graeme Wearden. The news from here is that more falls are expected in markets across the region, but so far not as dramatic as yesterday. The ASX in Sydney is seen falling 1.1% with around the same mark expected for the Nikkei in Tokyo. But who knows where they might end up if the dramatic swings in the Dow Jones today are anything to go by. What we do know for sure is that the Aussie dollar has had a good crisis. Like Usman Khawaja, it is has risen to task and climbed nearly 1% in the past 24 hours to stand at US71.2c. A quick recap Wall Street has suffered its second day of heavy losses, as the global stock market correction continues. The Dow Jones industrial average has fallen by 2.1%, or 545 points, on top of Wednesday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 830-point tumble. The S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq indices also weakened sharply again. The sell-off followed a bruising session in Europe. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE 100 slumped by almost 2% into a correction, down 10% since its peak, while European stocks languished at a 21-month low. Italy lurched into a bear market. Earlier, Asia-Pacific markets suffered sharp losses too, with China down over 5% and Japan losing almost 4%. Traders fear fresh losses on Friday, with Australia called down another 1.1%. Economists have blamed a series of factors for the selloff, from trade war angst to rising US government borrowing costs. Neil Wilson of Markets.com argued there are five key factors: Rising bond yields \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the sharp rally last week was the cue for a sustained period of declines which culminated in yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s selloff. Now we have a lot of momentum \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the breadth of the decline \u00e2\u20ac\u201c we could see things get worse before rallying. China and trade \u00e2\u20ac\u201c we thought that Nafta was important but really the fear is that we see the Sino-US tensions get worse. Comments around currency manipulation have not helped risk sentiment. No resolution can be expected until after the mid-terms. Fears around luxury stocks and comments from LVMH on Chinese demand have raised some concerns around earnings. Italy \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the ongoing Rome-Brussels spat is keeping European investors in a risk-off stance. Fresh valuation concerns heading into earnings season A deepening row between the White House and the US Federal Reserve is also looming over the markets. Donald Trump has unleashed a series of attacks on the Fed, blaming its interest rate policy for spooking the markets. On Thursday Trump said he was \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcdisappointed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 in Fed chair Jay Powell, but insisted he didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t intend to fire him, Apprentice-style. The president explained that the strong dollar was driving shares down: It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a correction that I think is caused by the Fed and interest rates. The dollar is very strong, very powerful \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and it causes difficulty doing business. IMF chief Christine Lagarde rode to Powell\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s defence, insisting that the Fed was doing a good job. But still, Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s claim that the central bank is making a mistake has raised the pressure building on the Fed. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m now handing over to my colleague Martin Farrer who will cover developments in the Asia Pacific markets. Markets will be opening in Australia in less than three hours, followed by Tokyo and Seoul an hour after that. Traders throughout the region are braced for another rough ride. Some $50bn was wiped off values in Australia on Thursday as the benchmark ASX 200 plunged 2.74%, its worst day since February. It is set to fall 1.1% at the opening on Friday, according to futures trading. Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s attack(s) on Fed chair Jay Powell make the front of Friday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Financial Times: US and European stock markets have been a veritable sea of electronic ink today, following the overnight rout in Asia. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the damage...... Phew! Traders in New York can finally catch their breath, after another rough day. And there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s nothing to celebrate -- instead, we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re staring at big losses for the second day running. The Dow has closed down 2.1%, or 545 points lower, at 25,052, on top of Wednesday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 830-point slide. The S&amp;P 500 provisionally closed 2.06% lower, while the Nasdaq lost around 1.2%. Unless something remarkable happens in the last 10 minutes, Wall Street is going to end the day deep in the red. The Dow is having another wobble, now down 485 points at 25,119 Another twist! The Washington Post is now reporting that President Trump will meet with President Xi at the G20 meeting of world leaders next month. This is lifting Wall Street off its lows, on hopes that relations between Washington and Beijing might be melting. Things have been worse, though... The S&amp;P 500 index has had a bad day too, currently down almost 2% as market volatility spikes. Some photos from in and around Wall Street today: Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our news story about the market mayhem: The City has felt the full impact of a sell-off in global financial markets with shares in the FTSE 100 index of leading companies now more than 10% below their record peak in May. On a second day of turbulence, aftershocks from panic-selling on Wall Street rippled through Asian and European bourses as dealers took fright at trade tensions, the prospect of higher inflation and Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s attempts to put pressure on America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s central bank over interest rates. The FTSE 100 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the index of UK blue-chip shares \u00e2\u20ac\u201c closed almost 2% lower after dropping 138.81 points to 7006.93. After a closing peak of 7877 in late May, the FTSE has now lost more than 10% of its value \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the definition of a market correction. Boom! The Nasdaq has tallen into correction territory, a journey which Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE 100 travelled a few hours ago. The tech-focused index has shed 2% today, or 151 points, to 6,892. That meaning it has lost more than 10% since its record high of 7,700 at the start of this month! Nearly every one of the 30 companies which make up the Dow has lost ground today. Pharmaceuticals firm Pfizer, fast food chain McDonalds, and energy companies Chevron and Exxon are among the big fallers. Make that 500 points off the Dow! The sell-off is accelerating as we head towards the final hour of trading. Oh dear, the Dow is taking another leg downwards in afternoon trading. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s now shed 424 points, or 1.66%, 25,174 points. That means the Dow has lost more than 1,200 points since the start of trading yesterday - a reminder that what went up can come down rather abruptly.... Fast FT points out that mining stocks have had a particularly bad 2018: That partly reflects concerns over economic growth prospects, especially if a protracted trade war rumbles on. More drama in the markets, this time involving Turkey: Donald Trump regularly hailed the stock market boom as a sign that he was dong a good job. Now shares are falling, he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s determined to pin the blame on the Federal Reserve. Bloomberg suspects the president has a motive.... Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s criticisms mark a stunning departure from the practices of his recent predecessors. Presidents for more than two decades had avoided public comments on the Fed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s interest-rate policies as a way of demonstrating respect for the institution\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s independence. For a president who has frequently invoked rising stock prices as affirmation for his economic policies, criticism of the Fed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s monetary policies lays ground for shifting blame elsewhere if the market slide continues. He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s escalating his attacks on the Fed with less than a month to go before elections that will determine whether Republicans maintain control of Congress. More here: Trading on Wall Street remains choppy. The Dow is back in the red, down around 115 points (or -0.45%), while the tech-focused Nasdaq index is now slightly higher... Jay Powell, incidentally, was Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pick to run the Fed. The president could have reappointed Janet Yellen, Powell\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s predecessor, but instead he favoured a change (even though Yellen had done a good job helping to heal the economy from the financial crisis). Jay Powell may regret ever agreeing to become Fed chair! Donald Trump has unleashed another attack on America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s top central banker, reiterating that he thinks the Federal Reserve is making a mistake. And once again, Trump is breaching the concept that central banks such as the Fed are independent (which is meant to reassure investors). Speaking as Wall Street wobbles today, Trump said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a correction that I think is caused by the Fed and interest rates. The dollar is very strong, very powerful \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and it causes difficulty doing business.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Asked if he might sack the Fed chair, Trump replied: No, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m not going to fire him. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m just disappointed. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the big picture tonight, and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not pretty: The braver, or riskier, among you may see today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s losses as a buying opportunity. I certainly don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t give investment advice. But Trevor Greetham of Royal London Asset Managment believes there are bargains out there: It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not surprising to see a sharp rise in volatility given the negative cross currents for markets. Global growth is slowing, US interest rates are rising and Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade war rhetoric is hotting up ahead of next month\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s midterm elections. Longer term, we expect the economic expansion to continue into 2019 and this should ultimately propel stock markets higher. Investors should note that US tax cuts and spending increases are still feeding through, interest rates elsewhere in the world are very low and China is easing policy to offset trade war fears. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Our multi asset funds have been defensively positioned since the early summer but we have started to buy equities on weakness after our investor sentiment gauge hit its most pessimistic reading since April. As another old saying goes, investors should be fearful when others are greedy and greedy when others are fearful.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd After a day of hectic selling, Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s blue chip index has ended the day deep in the red. The blue chip FTSE 100 index has shed almost 2% today, sending it solidly into a correction (10% below its all-time high of 7093 back in May). It has closed 138 points lower at 7,006, its lowest level since April. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no brighter across the channel either, where markets have ended at a 21-month low. Ouch! Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s main stock index seems to have plunged into a BEAR market - meaning it has fallen by 20% from its recent peak. That shows how worried investors are about its government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s budget plans, and the row with the EU over fiscal targets. European stocks market are also suffering deeper losses as the closing bell looms. The Stoxx 600 index of top European companies is now down 2%, as shares get another mauling. So much for the recovery! The New York stock market has turned south again. The Dow is now down 336 points, or 1.3%, at 25,262 points, adding to yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 830-point tumble. The broader S&amp;P 500 is also down 1.3%, while the Nasdaq has shed 1%. So far today, the market has opened lower, recovered, and now taken another leg down. This zig-zag trading shows nervousness and volatility is high. Issues such as the US-China trade wars, Brexit and the Italian budget row are all weighing on markets. Professor Costas Milas of the University of Liverpool argues that this week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u0153financial market turmoil is (long) overdue\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. He has sent over this chart, from Policyuncertainty.com, which shows how uncertainty has risenL Profess Milas explains: Global policy uncertainty has hit its highest level for more than 18 months now. In fact, September 2018 saw global policy uncertainty at a level comparable to what we saw during the Referendum vote!!! The chart measures policy uncertainty in 18 countries that account for more than 70% of global GDP. Based on this plot information, I am surprised market reaction did not happen in late September or the very first days of October! Hello... Larry Kudlow, the US president\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chief economic advisor, seems to have suggested that Donald Trump could meet with China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s president Xi soon. Speaking on CNBC, Kudlow indicated that talks could take place at the G20 summit in November. However, it seems that nothing is \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcconcrete\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, so don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t count on a breakthrough in the trade war yet.... If such Wall Street is gyrating, as investors struggle to decide whether to stick or twist. The Dow has now shaken off its early malaise, and is now up 50 points or 0.2%. It could be a testing day.... Stuart Clark, manager at Quilter\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s WealthSelect, reckons automatic trading systems helped to fuel Wednesday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s losses. The sell-off really gained momentum quickly, especially toward the end of trading. That can be a tell-tale sign that algorithm based strategies are kicking in and chasing a trend, which can fuel a rally or a sell-off. While that can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be ignored, it is important to remember that reflects high volume, short-term trading and isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t necessarily a reflection of the fundamental case for any given stock.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s treasury secretary has called for calm. Speaking at the IMF meeting in Bali, Stephen Mnuchin steered away from the president\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s criticism of the Federal Reserve. Instead, Mnuchin suggested that Wednesday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sell-off was a fairly normal event. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Markets go up. Markets go down. I see this as a normal correction.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sell-off was bad, but it was hardly horrific. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s some context: The S&amp;P 500 index, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq, have also dipped into the red in very early trading.... The New York stock exchange has reopened, after suffering its biggest loss in eight months yesterday. And the Dow has opened..... LOWER, dropping by around 100 points in the opening moments. Don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t panic too much, though - it usually takes several minutes before trading is fully underway. Hold onto your hats... Wall Street is about to open for trading. Will Hobbs, head of investment strategy at Barclays Smart Investor, reckons investors should \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcstay calm\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 today, rather than panicking. He argues that the world economy isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t on the brink of a recession, so there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no reason to dump your portfolio: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Isolating the causes of sharp falls in stock markets is always a hazardous game. The reality is that such drops, as gut churning as they tend to be, are best seen as part and parcel of investing in capital markets. For long term investors, the rising trend is of course more important to focus on than the bumps in the road. For those trying to more actively trade the economic cycle, the key question is whether such volatility speaks of a darker economic turn for the US and world economy, a recession even. For our part we still cannot see the next recession on the horizon in the indicators that we look at. Recessions can, of course, rain from clear blue economic skies, so humility is always appropriate. This is particularly the case as we enter a period where US interest rates approach levels where, if still some distance from asphyxiate, are certainly no longer accommodative for the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s most important capitalist economy. After a nasty pummelling, European stock markets are trying to climb off the mat. The FTSE 100 has clawed back some losses, following today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s weaker-than-expected US inflation data. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s still having a bad day, though, currently down 91 points at 7054. Investors are pondering whether today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sell-off is the start of a downturn, or a buying opportunity.... Newsflash: Donald Trump has renewed his attack on the US Federal Reserve. Speaking to Fox News this morning, the president repeated his claim that the Fed has been too aggressive with its interest rate hikes. Trump said the Fed was getting \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a little bit too cute,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd adding: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153They\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re making a big mistake.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd More news: the number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefit has risen. Some 214,000 US citizens filed an \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcinitial claim\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 for jobless help last week, up from 207,000. That could be another reason for the Fed to keep its hand off the trigger.. NEWSFLASH: US inflation didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t rise as fast as expected last month. This might bring some relief to the troubled markets. Core inflation (which strips out volatile items like oil and food) only rose by 0.1% in September, versus forecasts of a 0.2% rise. The means that annual core inflation was unchanged, at 2.2%. The headline inflation measure, the Consumer Prices Index, is also weaker than expected. It dropped to 2.3% year-on-year, down from 2.7%. Why does this matter? Because core inflation is a key measure used by the Federal Reserve when setting interest rates. So if prices aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t rising as fast as feared, the Fed might be more reluctant to raise rates aggressively. And that might act as a balm to anxious investors around the globe..... Time for a quick recap. World stock markets are suffering one of their biggest slumps in months, after a shock slide on Wall Street on Wednesday. A wave of selling has sent Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE 100 into correction territory, meaning it has lost most than 10% from its recent record high. It is currently down 113 points, or 1.6%, with house-builders and financial companies leading the rout. There are losses across Europe too; the French CAC is down 1.5% while Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s DAX has lost 0.9%. Photos of the sell-off are here. Investors across the globe have been shaken by the losses in New York yesterday - the shock sent Japan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Nikkei down almost 4%, while China tumbled over 5% to a four-year low. The VIX \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcfear index\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, which tracks anxiety in the markets, has spiked. Analysts are blaming various factors, including the US-China trade war, recent rises in US borrowing costs, and the prospect of several more American interest rate rises. Technology stocks, and luxury goods makers, have been hit hard. The sight of Donald Trump blurring the lines around central bank independence, branding the Federal Reserve \u00e2\u20ac\u02dccrazy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t helped the mood. The world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s top emerging nations have also weighed in, warning that trade wars are hurting their economies. Wall Street could suffer further losses when trading begins in around 80 minutes. Lukman Otunuga, research analyst at FXTM, says: While U.S. President Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s renewed criticism of the Federal Reserve for hiking interest rates played a role behind the steep selloff, there were other key factors brewing in the background. It is becoming clear that global equity markets are facing a perfect storm of headwinds such as rising U.S. bond yields, U.S.-China trade disputes, global growth concerns and prospects of higher U.S. interest rates. For as long as these themes remain, appetite for stocks are likely to diminish further consequently fueling speculation over the bull party coming to an end. Asian stocks fell sharply during early trade to close in the red while European shares slumped this morning. With the negative sentiment from Asian and European markets deterring investors from riskier assets, Wall Street is at threat of trading lower this afternoon. The oil price has also been dragged down today. Brent crude has sled $1.5 per barrel, or almost 2%, to $81.57. That reflects concerns that trade wars and higher US interest rates could hurt global growth. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a video clip of the head of the IMF defending America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s top central banker against Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s claim that the Federal Reserve has \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcgone crazy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122: Tech has been the golden child for markets this year. But now it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s being disowned by investors, who rushed to ditch internet giants like Amazon (down 6% yesterday), Apple (which dropped 4.8%) Netflix (which shed 8%). One theory is that people are taking profits - there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a temptation to cash in your winning stocks when you see shares diving. Another theory is that tech firms will suffer particularly badly from a full-blown trade war, which looks increasingly likely unless Washington and Beijing start mending fences. Thirdly, some technology stocks are highly-leveraged, having issued large amounts of debt to fund their growth. So if US interest rates keep rising, their borrowing costs could become rather higher. Even crypto-currencies are being caught up in today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s selloff. Bitcoin has shed 5% today to trade around $6,200 at present, down $300 today. Here some photos showing how the stock sell-off has ripped around the world. It started in New York yesterday when a late slump wiped 3% off the value of the US stock market, while tech stocks suffered particularly badly. This set Asia up for a fall - with Japan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s main indices losing over 3.5% Australia was also pulled into the mire; its S&amp;P/ASX index shed 2.7%, led by energy and technology companies. Cue more pain in China, where stocks slumped by over 5%. This dragged the market down to its lowest level since 2014, as traders worried that the economy is suffering from the trade war with America. European investors then picked up the baton, and conducted a selling operation of their own. Heavy losses on all the main exchanges has wiped almost 2% off the Stoxx 600 index, down to to lowest level since the end of 2016. And with Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE 100 still down over 100 points, and in correction territory (10% below its record high), it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been a bad morning in the City. Helal Miah, investment research analyst at The Share Centre, says investors have been speculating for weeks that a correction was coming - and now \u00e2\u20ac\u0153we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve talked ourselves into a sell-off\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Miah pins the blame on trade war fears, and the prospect of higher US borrowing costs: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The sell-off has been gathering strength for about two weeks now lead by the Asian markets as concerns were raised about China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s growth rate, but fingers will also point at the hike in tariffs between the US and China and the impending trade wars. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153But for us and many other analysts, a market sell-off was always going to be most likely as a result of the rising interest rate environment, especially in the US. We had the much expected hike in September from the US Federal Reserve now taking interest rates to 2.25% with the expectation that the policy makers will keep in their path of steady rate hikes as the US economy strengthened. But with unemployment recently hitting 3.7%, and as signs slack in the economy and with the labour market disappearing, there is the expectation that prices and inflation could start running ahead of the Fed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s expectations. As a result, the policymakers may now think about increasing rates at a faster pace than anticipated. Over in New York, financial workers will be rising early and inspecting the damage across the global markets. Wall Street got an early taste of the rout, of course, when the Dow plunged by over 800 points in late trading on Wednesday. US traders can now see that the shockwave rippled to Asia, sending major indices down by 3%, and then Europe, where the Stoxx 600 is down 1.8% now. And the bad news is that New York is expected to suffer fresh losses today. The futures market suggests the Dow will fall by another 1%, when trading begins again, in three and a half hours time. Just in: A group of leading developing countries are calling for an end to the trade wars that have gripped the global economy this year. The G24, which includes China, India, Brazil, Mexico and Argentina, say the global trading system should be reformed, not smashed up. In a statement issued in Bali, alongside the IMF\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meeting his week, the G24 warn that emerging markets are suffering: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Trade uncertainties and financial and monetary conditions compound rising debt vulnerabilities. Improving debt sustainability depends on a supportive external trade and financial environment, timely contingency financing and the adequate flow of concessional financing for low income countries.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Back in the UK, a new Bank of England survey shows that it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s harder to get access to credit, as lenders tighten up: There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no relief in the City. After two hours of bruising trading, the FTSE 100 sinking deeper into correction territory, down 123 points or 1.7% at 7022. Fiona Cincotta, senior market analyst at City Index, says investors have been perturbed by New York\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 3% slump yesterday. Wednesday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s plunge on Wall Street came as a shock and global markets are now readjusting. Sellers shaved 830 points off the Dow Jones Industrial Average and 4% of Nasdaq with big tech names like Amazon, Intel and Microsoft bearing the brunt of the decline. The picture is not looking much better this morning. The Nikkei and the Shanghai Composite closed over 4% and 5.7% lower respectively, the FTSE started the day with a 1.19% decline and continued to sink from there. She also explains how the recent rise in US bond yields - because investors expect higher inflation and interest rates - is now hurting stocks: The plunge in US stock markets comes after a long run of almost undisrupted gains on Wall Street which were bound to come up for a correction. The strong US economic background that has supported share prices this year is now working against that same market. Rising interest rates are fuelling concerns that higher borrowing costs will erode the margins of US companies and with the domestic labour market at its strongest in nearly 50 years, wage pressures are filtering into companies\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 costs. The 10-year Treasury yield is used as a reference price for mortgages, car loans and other consumer debt and a spike in those yields is hitting industries like car makers and house builders that are exposed to consumer borrowing. The VIX volatility index has hit its highest level since April, following the hefty losses seen in the markets in recent days. The number of contracts for trading the VIX has also jumped, showing that traders expect the current market volatility to continue. Paul Donovan of UBS Wealth Management blames the Wall Street sell-off on Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision to impose tariffs on Chinese goods: US equities seem to be (finally) reflecting the cost of US President Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade taxes. Around 80% of global trade involves multinational (generally listed) companies. A bit less than half of S&amp;P earnings come from outside the US. However, listed companies are only 25% of the US economy. Equities are at greater risk than the economy if trade is taxed aggressively. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a taste of the mood on the trading floors today: China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock market has closed at its lowest level in almost four years, as the trade war with America continues to bite. The Shanghai composite index ended the day down 5.2% its heftiest rout in over two years. Trading screens were a sea of green, not red, though (as red is a lucky colour, it is used to show rising prices in China) Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sell-off has dragged the FTSE 100 index into a correction! The blue-chip index has now lost more than 10% of its value since May, when it traded at an all-time high of 7,903 points. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a blow to anyone whose invested money in UK stocks in recent months. Neil Wilson of Markets.com has helpfully drawn up a list of the key factors behind the sell-off: Rising bond yields \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the sharp rally last week was the cue for a sustained period of declines which culminated in yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s selloff. Now we have a lot of momentum \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the breadth of the decline \u00e2\u20ac\u201c we could see things get worse before rallying. China and trade \u00e2\u20ac\u201c we thought that Nafta was important but really the fear is that we see the Sino-US tensions get worse. Comments around currency manipulation have not helped risk sentiment. No resolution can be expected until after the mid-terms. Fears around luxury stocks and comments from LVMH on Chinese demand have raised some concerns around earnings. Italy \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the ongoing Rome-Brussels spat is keeping European investors in a risk-off stance. Fresh valuation concerns heading into earnings season Yikes! World stock markets have slumped to their lowest level since February. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s according to data provider MSCI, whose \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcall country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 index has careered down to an eight-month low this morning. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s thanks to the triple-whammy of losses in Wall Street, the rout on Asia, and this morning\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s heavy early losses in Europe. Craig Erlam of trading firm OANDA says some frightened investors are ditching stocks: European stocks are the latest casualty in the global sell-off that has rattled markets over the last 24 hours, as investors worry about the potential for a sharper correction on the back of rising bond yields. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been something of a bloodbath overnight, as investors saw what occurred in the US \u00e2\u20ac\u201c despite there being no clear catalyst for such a move - and dashed for the exits as fears grow that global risks are mounting and the bill is coming due. While people are naturally pointing to the bond market to explain the sudden panic \u00e2\u20ac\u201c most notably Trump who\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been laying the groundwork for blaming the Fed for the last couple of months \u00e2\u20ac\u201c I wonder whether the underlying risk in the markets for some time has left market primed for a correction and investors have simply fled at the first sign of danger. Paras Anand, head of asset management for Asia Pacific at Fidelity International, argues the sell-off in America isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t a shock: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The sharp sell-off in the US has likely caught no one by surprise. If anything, investors have been wondering how, in the face of tighter monetary policy, a contracting labour market and rising oil prices, the US has continued to be so resilient. Ouch! European stock markets have plunged to their lowest level in 20 month. The Stoxx 600 index, which tracks the largest shares in the region, has slumped by 1.6% today to its lowest level since the start of February 2017. Every sector is taking a chilly bath: Eurozone stocks are being dragged down the row between Rome and Brussels over Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new budget, on top of today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s other concerns. Housebuilders and financial stocks are among the big fallers in London this morning: Newsflash: Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE 100 index has hit a new six-month low at the start of trading. The wave of selling that began in Wall Street last night, and swept through Asia today, has now reached the City. The Footsie has shed 113 points, or 1.58%. That takes it down to 7032 points, its lowest level since early April. Nearly every share has fallen. One rare exception being gold miner Randgold (as traders scramble for safe-haven assets). David Madden of CMC Markets says: The prospect of higher interest rates has left trader worried, as it means higher borrowing costs for companies and individuals. Homebuilders are under pressure as mortgage rates are likely to increase. Retailers are suffering for the same reason. Investors in Asia are reeling after a rather brutal day in the markets. China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Shanghai index is now down over 6%, as worries over the US trade war intensify. Chinese stocks have now lost more than a fifth of their value this year. Naeem Aslam of Think Markets fears that the sell-off will continue: This slump is not going to be over that easily as Asia have already borne the burnt of this year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade war, which is fuelled with nothing but uncertainty. The Chinese markets are already in the bear territory so I expect the U.S. markets to continue to face the selling pressure. Boom! Christine Lagarde, the head of the International Monetary Fund, has waded in. Speaking at the Fund\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meeting in Bali, Lagarde insisted that it was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153legitimate and necessary\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd for the Federal Reserve to be raising interest rates. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a rebuke to Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s claim that the Fed is going crazy. Touching on the slide in the markets, Lagarde pointed out that US stocks have hit record levels recently - suggesting that a correction should be expected. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It is fair to observe and all people are observing that the US equity market and stock markets in general have been extremely high\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. The FT has more details. Hussein Sayed, chief market strategist at FXTM, argues that Trump must take some of the blame for the market losses: While I agree with President Trump that Wednesday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s selloff is the fault of the Fed, he should be reminded that the trade war he started with China and re-imposing sanctions on Iran is also to blame. His actions helped building inflationary pressures and the Fed cannot stand still when it sees the economy overheating. A steeper selloff in equity markets will probably lead to a pause in hiking rates, but the Fed will be more concerned about the overall economy performance than just equity prices. The widening rift between the US and China is driving shares down, says J.P. Morgan Asset Management global market strategist Marcella Chow: Headlines around the broadening US-China conflict also continue to worsen as the U.S. arrested and extradited a Chinese official in Belgium to face espionage charges. There are concerns over a 3Q earnings rise following recent profit warnings and weak reports. In particular, Fastenal\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s CEO said the trade war with China is raising material costs that will crimp profit margins and hurt US consumers, and French luxury goods maker LVMH confirmed Chinese border guards are more actively searching travelers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 suitcases for undeclared goods added to fears of a slowdown in spending by Chinese consumers. Charles Ripley, senior strategist at Allianz Investment Management, blames the prospect of higher interest rates: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s equity selloff is a reaction from investors finally realizing we are in a higher interest-rate environment, and given the elevated level of stocks, market participants were likely looking for a reason to sell. Higher interest rates typically bring on tighter financial conditions which could dampen growth going forward and equity markets are reacting to that.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Ari Shrage, chief executive of Aliya Capital, agrees: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This is much more interest-rate related than anything going on specifically with tech. Interest rates are moving higher, so stocks that are the most expensive typically are the ones that roll over. Steven Friedman, senior economist at BNP Paribas Asset Management, points to recent falls in the value of US government debt (or Treasury Bills). That has pushed up the yield on these bonds - a sign that investors expect inflation and interest rates to rise The rise in Treasury yields has been the primary catalyst for the sell-off in equities, since higher yields suggest a lower present value of future dividend streams, assuming an unchanged economic outlook. It is also possible that equity investors are growing concerned that the Federal Reserve\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s projected rate path will choke off the expansion.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Good morning from London. World stock markets are sliding today as the anxiety that has been building in recent days explodes into a wave of selling. Shares have fallen sharply across Asia, after Wall Street suffered their worst sell off in eight months overnight, wiping 800 points, or 3%, off the Dow Jones industrial average. The rout has sent Japan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Nikkei into a tailspin, shedding 4%. Stocks in Hong Kong are down 3.8%, and there are chunky losses in Australia (-2.8%) and South Korea (4%) too. My colleague Martin Farrer explains from Australia: A jittery, volatile week on global financial markets has burst into a frenzy of selling, triggered by heavy losses on Wall Street and comments by Donald Trump describing US interest rate hikes as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153crazy\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd.... \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a bit of a bloodbath,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Ed Campbell, senior portfolio manager at QMA, the asset management branch of Prudential Financial in New York. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s primarily the cumulative effect of interest rate moves over the past five days and news reports about trade impacting companies.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd European markets had already endured a bad week, and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s about to get worse. Traders are predicting that Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE 100 will plunge to a new six-month low this morning, perhaps shedding more than 100 points. The rout is being fuelled by concerns that US interest rates are heading higher, as the Federal Reserve tries to keep a lid on American inflation. Donald Trump added to the pressure overnight, branding the Fed \u00e2\u20ac\u02dccrazy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 for planning to keep raising interest rates in the months ahead. Trump told reporters in Pennsylvania that: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The Fed has gone crazy. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153No, I think the Fed is making a mistake. They\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re so tight.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a correction we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve been waiting for, for a long time, but I really disagree with what the Fed is doing.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The president neglected to mention that its his relaxed fiscal policy, and recent tax cuts, are one factor pushing Federal Reserve governors to hike. Worries over the US trade war with China (another Trump \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcachievement\u00e2\u20ac\u2122), are also worrying investors, after the IMF slashed its growth forecasts earlier this week. Kit Juckes of French bank Societe Generale says Wall Street has finally caught up with events: For much of 2018, the US economy has been oblivious to a turn in the global economic cycle, and the US equity market has been unaffected as emerging market equities and currencies have come under pressure. This week has seen the S&amp;P, and the Nasdaq, sit up and pay attention to what\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s going on. The President\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s criticism of the Fed adds colour, but no real substance to the situation. Later today we get new US inflation figures, which could also move the markets. If price pressures keep mounting, the Fed will feel that it needs to keep raising borrowing costs, despite chuntering from the White House.

Griffith has received about \u00c2\u00a317m. Comcast\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s takeover of Sky includes buying out the personal stakes and various investment and share schemes that Darroch and Griffith have with the company.</p> <p>Darroch is in line to receive several million more when his annual pay and bonus awards for running the company over the last year are revealed.</p> <p>The 55-year old received <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/sep/13/sky-chief-executive-jeremy-darroch-pay-quadruples-to-16m-despite-profits-fall\">\u00c2\u00a316m in total remuneration</a> for running the company for the year to the end of June 2017. However, his pay for Sky\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s most recent financial year will be substantially lower as the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bumper long-term incentive plan payouts only vest every two years.</p> <p>Comcast has bought out Darroch\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s personal Sky stake, 775,772 shares, worth over \u00c2\u00a313m at the \u00c2\u00a317.28 price it acquired the company. The US pay-TV giant has also bought more than 1.4m of Darroch\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shares tied up in various schemes including Sky\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s long-term incentive plan and co-investment plan.</p> <p>More than 13,000 Sky staff across Europe who are part of Sky\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Sharesave scheme will also share the windfall. Historically, scheme members were able to buy shares at prices between \u00c2\u00a36.08 to \u00c2\u00a38.17 and will make gains equal to the the value of the difference between that price and \u00c2\u00a317.28.

                "bodyText":"Sky\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chief executive, Jeremy Darroch, has been handed a near-\u00c2\u00a340m bonanza following Comcast\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00c2\u00a330bn takeover of the satellite broadcaster. The windfall will see Darroch pay a monster tax bill estimated to be about \u00c2\u00a314m \u00e2\u20ac\u201c which is more than the total UK tax paid by Amazon (\u00c2\u00a34.5m), Facebook (\u00c2\u00a37.4m) and Netflix (received a \u00c2\u00a3174,000 rebate) combined last year. The bidding war between Comcast and Rupert Murdoch\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 21st Century Fox powered a near-doubling of Sky\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock market value in the last year, fuelling the bumper pay day for Darroch and the finance chief, Andrew Griffith. Sky said that Darroch, who has run Sky since December 2007, has now received about \u00c2\u00a337m for his shares. Griffith has received about \u00c2\u00a317m. Comcast\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s takeover of Sky includes buying out the personal stakes and various investment and share schemes that Darroch and Griffith have with the company. Darroch is in line to receive several million more when his annual pay and bonus awards for running the company over the last year are revealed. The 55-year old received \u00c2\u00a316m in total remuneration for running the company for the year to the end of June 2017. However, his pay for Sky\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s most recent financial year will be substantially lower as the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bumper long-term incentive plan payouts only vest every two years. Comcast has bought out Darroch\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s personal Sky stake, 775,772 shares, worth over \u00c2\u00a313m at the \u00c2\u00a317.28 price it acquired the company. The US pay-TV giant has also bought more than 1.4m of Darroch\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shares tied up in various schemes including Sky\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s long-term incentive plan and co-investment plan. More than 13,000 Sky staff across Europe who are part of Sky\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Sharesave scheme will also share the windfall. Historically, scheme members were able to buy shares at prices between \u00c2\u00a36.08 to \u00c2\u00a38.17 and will make gains equal to the the value of the difference between that price and \u00c2\u00a317.28. The scale of the staff windfall is not known. Sky\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s share price skyrocketed after Murdoch\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Fox submitted a \u00c2\u00a310.75p a share bid in December 2016. At the time of Fox\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s opportunistic bid, Sky was trading at \u00c2\u00a37.69p. Darroch has overseen a trebling of the value of Sky since he took over as chief executive at the end of 2007, when it traded at about \u00c2\u00a36. As chief executive he has overseen a massive expansion of the business. In 2014, he spent almost \u00c2\u00a37bn buying its sister companies in Germany and Italy creating a pan-European pay-TV giant with more than \u00c2\u00a312bn in revenues and 23 million customers. Darroch is yet to reveal what his future plans are but Comcast is likely to want him to stay on board for at least a couple of years to help transition the business. His service contract states that he, or Sky, have to give up to a year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s notice, if he decides to leave. There is also a one-year non-compete clause. His contract states that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the company may require the individual to continue to fulfil current duties or may assign garden leave\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, if he resigns.",

                "bodyText":"\u00e2\u20ac\u0153I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t understand the point of Sears, I just buy everything online,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said 23-year-old Lyft driver Shannon Dickey as we pull up to the abandoned storefront of Sears that sits at the top of Ross Park Mall, nine miles north of downtown Pittsburgh \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I think their old catalogs are cool, but I just don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t understand the point of Sears.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Founded in 1893, Sears was once a staple of the American lifestyle. Now after 125 years in business, the quintessential American brand has filed for bankruptcy, an announcement that came Monday, unable to pay its debts.. In the past year, Sears has already shuttered its last three remaining marquee stores in Pittsburgh. Now, all that remains is a rundown Sears outlet warehouse store scattered along the railroad tracks in an industrial neighborhood alongside the Allegheny River in Lawrenceville. The so-called \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Scratch &amp; Dent Sears\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd outlet sells slightly defective washers, dryers and other goods, appliances that can still be purchased with Sears\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 trademark warranty, and on credit in monthly installments. For generations, Sears served the middle market of working-class homeowners hoping to buy high-quality products, but who could not afford to make the purchases outright without Sears monthly installment programs. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Nobody offers payment plans now because they don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t trust nobody,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Bob, a 15-year employee of the Sears outlet store as he helps his friend load a La-Z-Boy chair into his truck. That said, Bob warned Sears was not to be messed with if buyers don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t meet the monthly payments. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Sears will come in your house though and take that shit back if they want to. Sears ain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t like the rest of them, they gonna come steal that shit.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd However, with the rise of Amazon, the advent of discount shopping on the internet and competition from stores like Walmart, Sears\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 target audience has drifted elsewhere. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I feel upset because I like Sears,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd says Mark Vesei, who signed up for a store credit card. Vesei regularly buys tools for his auto detail business in the nearby neighborhood of Swissvale. Sears tools gained a great reputation among craftsmen like Vesei who saw them as being dependable. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I used to come to Sears with my dad back in the day because of the Sears Craftsman lifetime guarantee,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Trevor Thomas as he picked up a refrigerator he purchased at the store\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Columbus Day sale. The 125-year-old department store operator was once the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest retailer. It has been controlled by hedge fund billionaire Eddie Lampert for some 13 years. Lampert has slashed costs, cut stores and lost millions trying to turn the company around. Sears merged with Kmart in 2004, at which point the holding company had more than 3,500 locations. About 250 of its best-performing stores were spun off into a new company, Seritage, while others were sold or closed, leaving Sears managing around 700 locations, many within struggling shopping malls that face the prospect of another \u00e2\u20ac\u0153dark anchor\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a shuttered major store \u00e2\u20ac\u201c if their Sears closes.

The company currently employs 70,000 people and has shed 200,000 jobs since 2007.

Europe then had a wobbly session, before the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE 100 managed to close nearly 0.5% higher. Brexit remained a worry, as UK PM Theresa May warned that she can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t accept Brussels\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 proposal for a backstop for Northern Ireland. The US market failed to sparkle, after the latest US retail sales figures were weaker than expected - only growing by 0.1% in September. There was no big sell-off in New York, but the main indices did end the day lower. The tech sector remained under pressure, due to its exposure to global growth, and its vulnerability to disruption from a trade war. Hardware maker Cisco Systems was the biggest faller on the Dow, down 2.2%, followed by Apple (-2.1%), Visa (2%) and Microsoft (-1.8%). The disappearance of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi in Turkey also loomed over the markets.

And on the fiscal side, America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s budget deficit has jumped to $779bn, thanks to a burst of spending. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s all from us today. Goodnight. So much for the rally! A late swirl of selling has sent Wall Street into the red at the closing bell. The Dow shed 89 points, or 0.35%, back down to 25,250. The Nasdaq had a worse day, losing 1%.

America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s budget deficit jumped by over $100bn in the last fiscal year, to nearly $780bn. Higher defence and social security spending helped to drive up the deficit, even though the economy grew strongly too. Marketwatch has the details: The U.S. recorded a $779 billion deficit in the fiscal year ending Sept. 30, an increase of $113 billion, as spending climbed while revenue remained nearly flat, the Treasury Department announced Monday. Outlays grew by $127 billion, or 3.2%, while government receipts rose 0.4%, or $14 billion. Compared to GDP, the deficit rose to 3.9%, up by 0.4 percentage points. In September alone, the U.S. recorded a surplus of $119.1 billion. UK defence firm BAE Systems saw its shares fall today, as traders pondered the implications of the Khashoggi case. Earlier, Donald Trump told reporters that the Saudi king had firmly denied being responsible for the journalist\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s disappearance - indeed, Trump suggested that rogue elements could be to blame (inside the Saudi consulate in Ankara?). Trump has now dispatched his Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo, to the Middle East to investigate. Fiona Cincotta of City Index says the Saudi tensions loomed over the City: Ironically, it was UK defence giant BAE Systems that bore the brunt of the dispute, trading down 3.46% on the day, as a conflict with the oil producing country could threaten its \u00c2\u00a310 billion deal for 48 Typhoon jets. The oil market was surprisingly placid about rising political tensions with Brent crude trading up 0.35% and WTI up 0.39%. Instead some investment went into gold and gold shares, notably Rangold and Anglo American. Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock market also had a better day, with the DAX gaining 90 points or 0.8%. France ended slightly lower, though. A day that started with blustery rain and deep puddles in the City of London has ended with a modest recovery. The FTSE 100 has nudged its way back over the 7,000 point mark, gaining 33 points or 0.45% to finish at 7,029. This means the Footsie has avoided setting another six-month closing low, as looked possible this morning. Wall Street is attempting to push higher, and add to Friday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s recovery. The Dow is now up 84 points, or 0.3%, while the Nasdaq is coming off its lows. Last week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s market sell-off was partly due to worries that the global economy is slowing. And Capital Economics has added to those concerns, by predicting that the next recession could be closer than previously thought. Neil Shearing, their chief economist, believes it will be triggered in America, as the Federal Reserve raises rates to calm inflation (as Donald Trump has warned). Shearin\u001cg writes: The next global downturn is likely to come much sooner than the current consensus anticipates \u00e2\u20ac\u201c indeed, we think that world GDP growth is already peaking in this cycle and that it will slow relatively sharply in 2019-20. The downturn itself is likely to be led by the US, where higher interest rates will begin to weigh on rate-sensitive sectors of the economy, and China, which is undergoing a structural slowdown. And while we anticipate that the next global downturn will be relatively short and mild compared to previous cycles, there is a long and growing list of threats that mean there is a significant risk of a sharper adjustment. The newswires are reporting that Janet Yellen, the former chair of the US Federal Reserve, has criticised Donald Trump for his attacks on her predecessor, Jerome Powell. Nick Timiraos of the Wall Street Journal has the details: Yellen also cited the danger that the US economy is running too hot, and also cautioned that the US trade dispute with China could hurt the global economy. Back in New York, the sell-off is gathering momentum. The Nasdaq tech index is now down 1%. Pharmaceuticals giant AstraZeneca has frozen investment in the UK until it knows what\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s happening with Brexit, according to the firm\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chairman. Leif Johansson told French newspaper Le Monde that the UK-Swedish firm has activated its contingency plans. It is now stockpiling medicines at national borders and has duplicated some of its UK operations in Sweden. Johansson, whose company has operations in Cambridge and Macclesfield, adds: We have also stopped investing in the UK. More here. The chimes of the opening bell are ringing out across Wall Street, teeing up a fresh week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trading. Traders are edgy following the worst week since March, and in the face of rising tensions around Saudi Arabia. And...shares are dipping in early trading. The Dow Jones industrial average has shed 20 points, or 0.1%, while the Nasdaq is 0.3% lower. Big tech stocks, including Facebook, Netflix and Amazon, are among the big fallers: Back in London, the FTSE 100 has struggled back from his morning\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s six-month low. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s now up 19 points , or 0.3%, at 7015. But the FTSE 250 index, which contains smaller UK companies, is having a worse day. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s down 199 points, or 1%, at 18,774, partly due to those nasty profit warnings from SuperDry and ConvaTec this morning. The weak US retail sales growth in September has surprised City economics and investors - here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s some early reaction: Just in: Americans spent less in restaurants and malls than expected last month. US retail sales only rose by 0.1% in September, much weaker than the 0.6% growth which economists had expected. This is partly due to a 1.8% fall in spending at restaurants and bars, the biggest drop since December 2016. That wiped out a 0.8% surge in car purchases. Clothing sales rose by 0.5%, while online and mail-order shopping jumped by 1.1%. Such a big drop in spending in bars and eateries could worry economists - it may signal that US consumers are cutting back. However, it could also be due to one-off factors, such as the hurricanes which hit the US last month. Two more top US executives have pulled out of Saudi Arabia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcDavos in the desert\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 event, over the disappearance of Jamal Khashoggi. Blackstone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Stephen Schwarzman and BlackRock\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Larry Fink have both withdraw from the high-profile Saudi Arabian investment conference taking place later this month (with a shrinking guest list). Over the weekend, the CEO of JP Morgan and the chairman of Ford both cancelled, as the furore over Khashoggi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s disappearance intensified. Other top bosses are still weighing up their next move -- but I suspect we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re reaching where attending the event is more controversial than finding a previous engagement in the diary (or even subsequent one...) Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shadow foreign secretary, Emily Thornberry, has called for Britain to rethink its relationship with Riyadh too: We should not be in league with a brutal dictatorship that beheads its own citizens for standing up for their rights, which rains down airstrikes on civilian areas in Yemen with no concern for innocent children, and that thinks it can assassinate dissident journalists in other countries with impunity. We must apply the same standards to countries such as Saudi Arabia, Israel and Egypt that we apply to Iran, Russia and Syria. Where any of them abuse human rights and breach international humanitarian law, we must be prepared to call it out in the same measure, rather than treating it as one rule for our supposed friends and another for our supposed enemies. Just in: Bank of America has beaten Wall Street forecasts, which might calm some investors\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 nerves. The second-largest US bank make profits of 66 cents per share in the last quarter, ahead of the 62 cents expected by analysts. Revenues grew by 4%, as Bank of America benefitted from higher interest rates and recent US tax cuts. Chief executive officer Brian Moynihan sounds upbeat, declaring: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Responsible growth, backed by a solid U.S. economy and a healthy U.S. consumer, combined to deliver the highest quarterly pre-tax earnings in our company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s history.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd More UK retail gloom: Fashion accessories retailer Claire\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s is considering a raft of store closures in the UK, according to a report on the Press Association. The US stock market is expected to lose ground when trading begins in three hours. The futures market is indicating the Dow Jones industrial average will shed 106 points, or 0.4%, at the open. New retail sales figures (at 1.30pm UK time) and financial results from Bank of America could both move the markets. The main Asian stock markets have all closed in the red today. Japan fell by almost 1.8%, Hong Kong lost 1.5%, Shanghai shed 1.4% and Australia finished 1% lower (our earlier summary has more details) The oil price is pushing higher this morning, amid rising tensions between Saudi and the US over the disappearance of journalist Jamal Khashoggi. Brent crude has risen 1% to $81.25 per barrel, back towards the four-year high set earlier this month. Bloomberg is reporting that the Saudi King has ordered an \u00e2\u20ac\u0153internal probe\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd into the Khashoggi - who is presumed to have been murdered after entering the Saudi consulate in Istanbul. On Saturday, US president Donald Trump vowed \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcsevere punishment\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 if it was confirmed that the Saudi regime had killed Khashoggi. This was a hardening of Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s original position, that he didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to risk investment and jobs over the case. Saudi Arabia, though, denies being involved -- and has now vowed to retaliate if sanctions are imposed. In theory, Saudi could hurt America badly by cutting crude production -- in a repeat of the 1970s oil shock. That would send transport costs soaring, drive inflation higher, and hurt growth. Saudi is the biggest single producer in the Opec cartel, producing over 10 million barrels today (global demand is 100 barrels/day), so it could have a major impact on prices. However, there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s an argument that rival suppliers, such as the US shale industry, could step in to fill a production shortfall. Ouch. Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock exchange has now overcome its technical issues, and traders are sending shares lower. The DAX has dipped by 20 points, or 0.18%, to 11,503 points, a new 20-month low. The gold price has jumped by 1% today to $1,231 per ounce. Bullion is benefiting from a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153flight to safety\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd as nervous investors look for a safer place for their money, says Stephen Innes of trading firm OANDA: While the market\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s version of a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Red October \u00e2\u20ac\u0153 makes it way into the South China Sea, echoes of Octobers past are reverberating throughout global capital markets as risk off continues to linger with equity market look ever so fragile. The US Treasury is set to release the semi-annual FX report. While China doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t meet the historical criteria to be named a currency manipulator who is to say, President Trump, my not rewrite the requirements so that China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s inclusion in the future is assured? Geopolitical embers are smouldering, threatening to ignite the middle east powder over the disappearance of journalist Jamal Khashoggi. The UK FTSE 100 has just hit a new six-month low, as its early gains fizzle out. The blue-chip index of leading sharews in London is now down 27 points at 6968. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s its lowest level since the end of March, adding to last week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s losses. This follows the weak trading in Asia (where Japan lost 1.8% and China fell 1.4%). Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell explains: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153There is a noticeable lack of bargain hunters on Monday morning as last Friday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rebound in select parts of the market fails to extend into the new working week. The FTSE 100 was down 0.1% in early trading at 6,988 with investors clearly lacking confidence to snap up stocks whose share prices were badly damaged in last week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s market sell-off. The biggest riser is gold producer Randgold \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a traditional \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcsafe-haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 in troubled times, with other \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcdefensive\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 stocks such as British American Tobacco and BT Group also in demand. Engineering firms such as Melrose and BAE are among the big fallers: Pakistan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock market has made a bad start to the new week, falling over 2% in early trading. That follows a 4% tumble last week, as investors fretted about Pakistan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economic outlook. Prime Minister Imran Khan is seeking an emergency bailout from the International Monetary Fund, who may demand tough austerity measures in return. Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock exchange has been hit by a technical glitch that has prevented trading getting underway. The Financial Times explains: The opening of trade in Deutsche B\u00c3\u00b6rse\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock market, the primary trading venue for German equities, was delayed on Monday by \u00e2\u20ac\u0153technical problems\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Deutsche B\u00c3\u00b6rse\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Xetrastock exchange, one of Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest, faced issues with its \u00e2\u20ac\u0153trading infrastructure\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd which meant the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153trading start will not take place according to the usual trading schedule.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd So, we can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t see how the German DAX is faring yet.... As feared, there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no recovery in Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock market this morning. The Stoxx 600 index, which tracks the largest European companies, has dropped by another 0.4% to a fresh 22-month low. With traders reluctant to take risks, there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a jittery feel in the trading floors again. Kit Juckes of Societe Generale says: The Swiss franc and yen are stronger. Hard Brexit risks are mounting, global political risks are ever-present and equities and bond yields are lower ex-Italy. The breakdown in Brexit talks, the disappearance of dissident Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi, the demise of the CSU in Bavarian elections, the impasse over Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s budget and the worried tone coming from the IMF/World Bank meetings in Bali all combine to give financial markets an uncomfortable feel this morning. Shares in UK fashion group SuperDry have plunged by 20% after it shocked the City with a profits warning. SuperDry says that the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153unseasonably hot weather conditions\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in the UK, Continental Europe and on the East Coast of America has hit demand for its autumn ranges, and wipe \u00c2\u00a310m off profits. In another blow, the company is taking an \u00c2\u00a38m hit on foreign exchange costs, after discovering that its \u00e2\u20ac\u0153hedging mechanisms\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd have not protected it from volatility in the currency markets. Investors aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t impressed - sending SuperDry shares sliding from \u00c2\u00a310.15 to just \u00c2\u00a38.12. At the start of the year they were worth \u00c2\u00a320. Astonishingly, that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not enough to make SuperDry the worst-performing stock today. That \u00e2\u20ac\u02dchonour\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 goes to medical equipment maker ConvaTec, whose shares have lurched 30% lower. The colostomy and wound bag manufacturer has slashed its profit forecasts, due to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153challenging market dynamics\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, and its CEO is retiring. In London, the FTSE 100 index has opened 20 points higher (+0.3%), as traders try to put last week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s losses behind them. Artjom Hatsaturjants at City firm Accendo Markets says the pound\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s weakness is helping multinational companies: The muted open comes after a negative start to the week in Asia, where concerns over rising US interest rates continued weighing on equities. Brexit negotiations suffered another setback over the weekend, as PM Theresa May rejected key EU proposals over the Irish border, dealing a blow to negotiations to avert a hard Brexit. This has sent the GBP [the pound] sharply lower ahead of an EU leaders summit on Wednesday, helping FTSE\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s international names. After another day of losses, China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock market has sunk to its lowest closing level in almost four years. CHINA\u00e2\u20ac\u2122S SHANGHAI COMPOSITE INDEX CLOSES DOWN 1.49% TO 2568.1 CHINA\u00e2\u20ac\u2122S CSI 300 INDEX FALLS 1.4% TO 3,126.45 AT CLOSE A cocktail of risks are weighing on the markets, says Jasper Lawler of London Capital Group: Concerns over higher US borrowing costs were the catalyst for last week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s heavy sell off. However, there were plenty of other risk factors which were also dampening sentiment. Those risk factors, including US- Sino trade tensions, Brexit, Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Budget proposal and now increased political tensions between the US and Saudi Arabia, are set to keep pressure on risk appetite this week. Good morning from a wet and grisly London. Last week wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t a pretty one for the City - the FTSE 100 fell steadily to a six-month low, while European stock sank to their lowest in 21 months. And as the rain tips down, there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s little sign of optimism in the markets today. Germany traders have been rattled by yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Bavarian state parliament election, which saw the ruling Christian Social Union lose its majority. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s another blow to Angela Merkel (whose CDU party are partners with the CSU) There are tensions in Italy too, where the government is expected to approve its new budget, despite complaints from Brussels that it will breach EU fiscal rules. Yesterday, Italian prime minister Giuseppe Conte announced the budget would be \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a change of gear for Italy\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Conte suggests Europe would soften its view, once Rome has explained its growth strategy to them.... But until that happens, investors will fear another episode in the eurozone debt crisis. Spread-betting firm IG predicts fresh losses in Frankfurt and Milan today: The losses continue to mount up on financial markets amid uncertainty across the world about trade, rising US interest rates and now a potential clash between the US and Saudi Arabia over the fate of missing journalist Jamal Khashoggi. The Saudi tension has sent the price of oil up and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also been a rough night for the pound ahead of this week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s crunch Brexit summit with sterling slipping. The yen meanwhile has strengthened a touch against the dollar. Stock markets fell in Asia overnight led by the Nikkei in Japan. It is off 1.85% (not helped by the rising yen). Seoul -0.7%, the Hang Seng -1.24% and Shanghai is off 0.83%. The ASX200 in Sydney closed down 0.99%. Futures trade suggests a flat start later today for the FTSE100 while the Dax30 in Germany is seen dropping 0.25%. Wall Street is tipped to fall too. The pound is down 0.3% to $1.31 and \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.135. Brent crude is up 1.25% amid Saudi tensions. JP Morgan and Ford bosses have joined the boycott of the Future Investment Intiative conference in Riyadh next week in the wake of the Khashoggi affair. China says it faces \u00e2\u20ac\u0153uncertainties\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd but has \u00e2\u20ac\u0153plenty of room\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd for fiscal manoeuvre if thin gs get sticky. Which they nevertheless say they won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t. The US dollar rose against the euro and other currencies. These included the Aussie dollar, a proxy for emerging market sentiment, which slipped to US71.06c from US71.26c on Friday. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m signing off now. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been an interesting day but it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time to hand over to Graeme Wearden in London. Thanks for joining us. It will be fascinating to see where the price of oil goes this week. Brent futures have risen 1.255 today to $81.5 a barrel and that could rise to $100 according to one analyst. Kazuhiko Fuji, senior fellow at the Japanese government thinktank, the Research Institute of Economy, Trade and Industry, said: Oil prices could rise to $100 on worries about Saudi Arabia. People had thought the Saudis will make up for fall in Iran\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s output. If they are starting to use oil as their weapon, that will be a whole new chapter. Apologies - I jumpped the gun on the Aussie market. The final settlemtn pushed it deeper into the red to end down 58.6 points, or 0.99%, at 5837.1 points. Sears, the venerable US retailer, has gone into administration. It has filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy, according to a filing in a New York court, Reuters reports. The filing says Sears, which once dominated US retailing in the golden age of catalogues, has assets in the range of $1bn to 10bn and liabilities in the range of $10bn to $50bn. The ASX200 is done for the day. It finishes down 46 points, or 0.79%, at 5,849 points. Saudi Arabia has threatened to retaliate against the world economy if western nations impose sanctions or similar if it emerges that the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s security forces murdered the journalist Jamal Khashoggi. But what form could Saudi action take? Our business reporter Rob Davies has been looking at the issues and his main points are The Saudis have the obvious power to push up oil prices. it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest producer and reducing output would see prices rise, possibly causing a devastating oil shock to the world economy. Second, the Saudis support thousands of US jobs through their extensive arms imports. Loss of those contracts would damage Donald Trump and he has already flagged that he doesnn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to jeopradise those deals for companies such as Boeing and Lockheed. Saudi funds are also important to planned US infrastructure development. And it is a key strategic ally in the Middle East On the other side of the ledger, the Saudis are relying on western companies to reform the kingdom\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stagnant economy and diversify it away from oil. The growing boycott of next week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Future Investment Initiative conference in Riyadh (now including JP Morgan and Ford) shows possible leverage. it will be a blow to Prince Mohammed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s prestige if more high-profile names pull out. You can read Rob\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s full piece here: We seem to have hit a fairly quiet spot in the trading day. The ASX200 in Sydney is down around 1% and is due to close in a few minutes. The Nikkei hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t moved from the -1.5% mark for a couple of hours. Ditto the Kospi (-0.5%) and the Hang Seng ( -0.1%). The CSI300 in Shanghai is probably the biggest mover, sliding from positive territory a couple of hours ago to now being off 0.8%. Talking of China, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s worth revisiting comments by the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s central bank governor at the close of the IMF meeting in Bali on Sunday. Yi Gang said China still had plenty of room for adjustment in interest rates and the reserve requirement ratio (RRR) in the face of any negative impact from trade tensions with the United States. He admitted China faced \u00e2\u20ac\u0153tremendous uncertainties\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd but was seeking a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153constructive solution\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to the current trade tensions. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We still have plenty of monetary policy instruments in terms of interest rate policy, in terms of RRR. We have plenty of room for adjustment, just in case we need it,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Yi said, indicating that Beijing feels it has plenty of ammunition to fire up the economy if needed. He added that he expected GDP to print at least 6.5% on Friday. Chris Weston of Pepperstone in Melbourne has weighed with some commentary, saying things could quite ugly on stock markets if data out of China \u00e2\u20ac\u201c inflation, GDP and retail sales \u00e2\u20ac\u201c disappoints later in the week. After last week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s volatility shock to markets, we start the week on a negative tone, with broad weakenss through Asia and the ASX 200 falling out of bed. The weekend news flow has centred on a lack of progress in the Brexit negotiations, a deterioration in Saudi/US relations, which have resulted in a 1.1% rally in crude, and the loss of majority for the CSU party in the German regional elections. Here are the latest scores, courtesy of IC Markets (although I think they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve missed the minus sign off the Hang Seng price): Summing up nicely, Masayuki Kubota, chief strategist at Rakuten Securities says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t say the shock is over.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The pound is set for a volatile few days as the wrangling over Brexit intensifies ahead of the meeting of European leaders starting on Wednesday night. It sits at $1.31 at the moment after losing 0.3% today. The key issue is how to prevent a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic. The EU wants the North to remain essentially bound by EU customs rules but that is facing pushback from Brexiters. Theresa May is hoping a temporary \u00e2\u20ac\u0153backstop\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd can be put in place where the whole country remains in the customs deal for the time being. (There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a good explainer here from Daniel Boffey, or Brussels correspondent.) Meanwhile, former foreign secretary and would-be Tory leader, Boris Johnson, has sounded off again in his Telegraph column. He says the backstop idea should be rejected completely and says the EU is treating the UK \u00e2\u20ac\u0153with contempt\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd: In presuming to change the constitutional arrangements of the United Kingdom, the EU is treating us with naked contempt. Like some chess player triumphantly forking our king and our queen, the EU commission is offering the UK government what appears to be a binary choice. It is a choice between the break-up of this country, or the subjugation of this country, between separation or submission. So seems like a good moment to run this brilliant picture of UK foreign secretary Jeremy Hunt and other foreign ministers in the maze at his country retreat Chevening this weekend. Still with Australia and interesting to note that Shane Oliver, the high-profile chief economist at AMP, has suggested that he might have to revise downwards his forecasts on house prices. He tweeted on Saturday that the auction results weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t good but his forecast of a peak to trough fall of 15% out to 2020 remained in place. But he told the AFR that he might hve to rethink that forecast on the downside. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The risks are skewing to greater than 5% declines per year, which is what I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve been assuming,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he told the Financial Review on Sunday. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I am thinking about revising down again.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd In Australia the ASX200 has had a torrid morning. At one point it was down more than 1.5% but it has recovered at bit and is now at 5,829, a fall of 66 points or 1.1%. The financial sector has been battered amid concern about the impact of the royal commission on the big four and the amount of compensation they will have to pay. Commonwealth is the worst performing, down more than 2%. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also the question of the impact from a deteriorating housing market. According to the AFR this morning, less than half of properties at auction this weekend were sold. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a bad outcome during what should be one of the busiest times of the year. Agents are blaming lack of credit for buyers pulling out. The Chinese trading day has kicked off. The Hang Seng is down nearly 1% while the Shanghai Composite is up a fraction. Another major factor in stock market losses this week has been the prospect of a full-blown US-China trade war. But calls for calm from leaders gathered at the IMF conference in Bali last week seem to have fallen on deaf ears. The Chinese currency fell again against the dollar today. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s now at 6.92. That is sure to rattle Washington where there is a widespread view that beijing manipulates the currency to benefit exporters. In Sunday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s IMF communique, members agreed to debate ways to improve the World Trade Organization so it can better address trade disputes and that countries would \u00e2\u20ac\u0153refrain from competitive devaluations and will not target our exchange rates for competitive purposes\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. The latter point address concern that China will allow the yuan to depreciate in order to make its exports more competitive to cope with any downside from US tariffs. Hmm ... While the Ssudi government has come out fighting on the prospect of US sanctions in the Khashoggi case, the boss of the Saudi-owned Al-Arabiya satellite news network has gone a few steps further. Turki Aldakhil paints an apocalyptic picture of world affairs if the US tries to get tough on the Saudis. He says the kingdom would respond by slashing oil output and would team up with Russia and stop buying US arms. The US would be \u00e2\u20ac\u0153stabbing itself to death\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Imposing any type of sanctions on Saudi Arabia by the West will cause the kingdom to resort to other options, US President Donald Trump had said a few days ago, and that Russia and China are ready to fulfill Riyadh\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s military needs among others. No one can deny that repercussions of these sanctions will include a Russian military base in Tabuk, northwest of Saudi Arabia, in the heated four corners of Syria, Israel, Lebanon and Iraq. At a time where Hamas and Hezbollah have turned from enemies into friends, getting this close to Russia will lead to a closeness to Iran and maybe even a reconciliation with it. The list of marquee speakers at the Future Investment Intiative conference in Saudi Arabia next week makes interesting reading because a few of them have now said they will not be going. Jamie Dimon has pulled out along with the boss of Uber and the editor of the Economist, Zanny Minton-Beddoes, while US treasury secretary Steve Mnuchin is under pressure not to go. Watch this space for more. The rise in oil prices is gathering pace too. Brent futures are up 1.3% to $81.54 a barrel. The sellers are gaining the upper hand in stock markets around Asia Pacific today. Hong Kong and China open later this morning. But this is how it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s looking so far: The Nikkei is now down 1.56%, or 353 points at 22,341 The Kospi is off 12 points, or 0.55% at 2,150 The ASX200 is down 62 points at 5,833, a fall of 1.07% so far Bill Ford, the chief executive of Ford, has become the latest high-profile business leader to pull out of the Future Investment Initiative conference in Riyadh later this month, Reuters reports. He joins JP Morgan boss Jamie Dimon in announcing his withdrawal on Sunday. Neither cited a reason but it is suspected that the diplomatic standoff over the Khashoggi affair would be high on the list. Uber chief executive Dara Khosrowshahi, Viacom boss Bob Bakish and billionaire Steve Case, one of the founders of AOL, have also said they won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be going to the event dubbed \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Davos in the desert\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, Reuters said. Bloomberg and CNN have also pulled out of covering the event. Read the full story on the growing row by our diplomatic editor Patrick Wintour: Trading is under way in Japan and Korea. The Nikkei is off 1% and the Kospi is down 0.5% in Seoul. That seems par for the course today given the poor start in Sydney, where it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s now off 0.89% for the day. The question is whether the markets can bounce back or they are dragged lower by a compound of problems ... The price of Brent crude has risen this morning to $80.5 a barrel. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s surely connected to the Saudi issue, so it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s worth looking again at what the kingdom has said about possibly retaliating to external pressure over the Khashoggi affair. A statement from Riyadh on Sunday said: The kingdom affirms its total rejection of any threats and attempts to undermine it, whether through economic sanctions, political pressure or repeating false accusations. The kingdom also affirms that if it is [targeted by] any action, it will respond with greater action. Crucially, the statement also pointed out that the oil-rich kingdom \u00e2\u20ac\u0153plays an effective and vital role in the world economy\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. That has to be an implicit threat to cut oil production and push up the price of a barrel, doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t it? The standoff between Saudi Arabia and just about everyone else in the world over the disappearance of journalist Jamal Khashoggi looks like intensifying. The Saudis have promised pushback if Donald Trump carries out his threat of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153severe Punishment\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd if the kingdom is found to have disposed of Khashoggi, as alleged by Turkey. Now, Reuters report that JP Morgan Chase chief executive Jamie Dimon has cancelled plans to attend a Saudi Arabian investor conference later this month. The bank did not give any more details for Dimon\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision not to attend the Future Investment Initiative conference in Riyadh, and did not comment on whether concerns about the disappearance of Khashoggi were a factor. In currencies, the US dollar has gained a bit today. That means the Aussie dollar is down slightly at US71.07 while the yen has slipped to 112.2. The pound is at $1.31. The benchmark ASX200 has slipped around 1% in the first few minutes. The banks, as usual of late, have been sold with the financial sector down 1.47%. Same for resources which are down more than 1% but utilities are off 2%. More commentary on the Australian market from Michael McCarthy at CMC Markets. His thrust is that this week sees a lot of data from China including lending, retail sales and GDP which should give us a picture of where the superpower is heading, ie is it in good enough shape to survive a trade-war inspired downturn? There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also inflation and trade data from Japan, retail sales in the UK and in the US, retail sales, housing numbers and Fed minutes. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s what Michael says: Australian investors face a challenge at this morning\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s opening. Despite positive moves for US shares and buoyant industrial commodities SPI futures were belted at the New York close, suffering a 51 point loss for the session. The first hour of trading may indicate whether this was an error or the beginning of further underperformance for Australian shares. Greg McKenna, the independent market strategist, says the markets narrative has been hijacked by the Saudi pushback and Brexit but reckons it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a close call on what direction things will take. This is what he says in his morning note: Much water to flow here especially for the Pound and oil prices. Looking back to Friday though and while stocks in the US rallied into the close it was a messy day and hardly a convincing bounce. Is it the bottom? Many think so and the medium-term charts recovered to hold channel bottoms. But we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll see. Good morning and welcome to the Guardian business live blog. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re firing up a bit earlier than usual today because it looks like being an interesting session in Asia Pacific markets. In Australia, the ASX200 has dropped 51 points after opening a few minutes, or just under 1%. The Nikkei in Japan in expected to fall 0.83% and the Hang Seng will also dip slightly. China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s CSI300 is set for a bounce though. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s only part of the picture today though because Saudi Arabia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s threat to disrupt the global economy will likely send the oil price higher today. Stocks on the Saudi market fell on Sunday. Meanwhile, the Brexit talks in the UK remain very tense with questions about whether Theresa May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s government can seal a deal on its backstop solution for the Irish border. Senior members of her Tory party are threatening to rebel over the matter and that has seen the pound drop substantially. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s buying $1.309 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c down more than 1% on Friday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s close. A forecast showing that the UK economy is going to have its worst year since the financial crisis hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t helped.",

They thought they would be able to do a couple of new lettings and sell it on.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd</p> <p>Business rates have become a lightning rod for angry retail bosses saddled with expensive property portfolios in an internet age.</p> <p>Retailers in parts of the country where there have been property booms have been especially hard hit because rates are calculated as a proportion of a property\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s value on 1 April 2015.

                "bodyText":"With its deserted tables and recycled office furniture, the Ping Pong Parlour in Maidenhead\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s struggling Nicholsons shopping centre is not fooling anyone. The desperate attempt to fill what used to be Argos is evidence of the losing battle fought by private equity investors who have surrendered the keys after the mall\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s declining fortunes left them unable to meet huge loan repayments. The financial failure of the affluent Berkshire commuter town\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s main shopping centre has brought this year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s high street crisis directly on to the embattled prime minister\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s doorstep. Theresa May has been Maidenhead\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s MP for more than 20 years but rows of empty shops contrast with noisy construction work as new flats populate the town\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s revamped waterways, making it hard to tell whether its fortunes are falling or improving. On Thursday, clipboard-wielding market researchers were canvassing shoppers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 views on the squat mall built on the site of the Nicholson\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s brewery in the 1960s. One middle-aged woman does not sugar-coat the pill, rating the experience \u00e2\u20ac\u0153one out of 10\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd because \u00e2\u20ac\u0153shops keep shutting\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hard to disagree, with at least 20 of the centre\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 50 large stores empty or being marketed by property agents. The precinct bears the scars of a hiatus that has seen about 30 chains, including Toys R Us, Maplin and House of Fraser, go under this year in a domino run that has affected 2,100 stores and nearly 40,000 jobs. The metal grille over Poundworld remains shut as shoppers flow in to the centre from the weekly fruit and vegetable market on the high street. With all eyes on the Brexit negotiations in Brussels, attention will swing back to the UK in 10 days when the chancellor, Philip Hammond, delivers his budget. The fallout from last year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s business rates revaluation, which will add another \u00c2\u00a3180m to retailers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 bills in April, has been the final straw for some struggling chains. Hammond is now under increasing pressure to make internet retailers share the load. Fashion store Next dealt the Maidenhead centre a blow when it followed Argos out the door. Avid Vogue reader May now has little to choose from locally, apart from H&amp;M (which she attended the opening of two years ago), Topshop or Marks &amp; Spencer. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153If this shopping centre disappeared, the town centre would die,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd says one worried store manager . \u00e2\u20ac\u0153People\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shopping habits have changed; young people don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t shop in shopping centres, they shop online. Amazon has taken over: why pay to park here when anything bog standard can be ordered online and delivered the next day? This situation is not unique. It is happening everywhere.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd When private equity property investor Vixcroft teamed up with a hedge fund to buy Nicholsons for \u00c2\u00a337m in 2015, the centre\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s selling points included Crossrail and numerous upmarket residential developments on the horizon. The price tag, backed with a \u00c2\u00a326m loan, was less than half the \u00c2\u00a385m paid when it changed hands in 2007. Some property experts fear that Nicholsons, which has been pushed into receivership, is just the tip of an iceberg as hundreds of shopping centre deals brokered in the early part of the decade turn sour. Property asset firm Apam counts at least 175 malls in similar straits as high street names queue up to shut stores or negotiate lower rents. Retailers including Carpetright, Mothercare, House of Fraser and New Look have resorted to company voluntary arrangements \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a form of insolvency \u00e2\u20ac\u201c to close down shops, dramatically reducing the rental income collected by centre owners. Apam executive Simon Cooke says private equity investors did not anticipate the perfect storm created by business rates, weak consumer confidence and the fallout from Brexit: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153They came with a five-year plan, in a five-year fund and with five years of debt. They thought they would be able to do a couple of new lettings and sell it on.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Business rates have become a lightning rod for angry retail bosses saddled with expensive property portfolios in an internet age. Retailers in parts of the country where there have been property booms have been especially hard hit because rates are calculated as a proportion of a property\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s value on 1 April 2015. As a result, Maidenhead\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s total rates bill will increase again to \u00c2\u00a357m next year. That is \u00c2\u00a36m more than in 2016, the equivalent of a 12.6% increase, according to real estate advisor, Altus Group. Nicholsons owners, however, cannot blame its woes on business rates because its retailers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 bills have been cut by a third \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a result of what Altus\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Robert Hayton describes as a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153seismic shift\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd down in the rents being paid in the centre. Another problem for Nicholsons is that shoppers prefer bigger nearby centres such as Reading\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Oracle. Mary, a volunteer in the Maidenhead Heritage Centre where the attractions include a Spitfire simulator, heads to the upmarket Windsor for her retail therapy. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The shops in town have been closing for a number of years,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd she says of Maidenhead. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a lot of money around here but we don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t seem to get the facilities.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Councils in Kent and Shropshire have resorted to bailing out struggling malls and it remains to been seen who might be prepared to invest in the Maidenhead mall. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Some of these centres will ultimately be closed down if nothing is done, as the income will fall to below the running cost,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd says Cooke who suggests long-term partnerships with councils are the answer. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This is not about property investors and banks losing money.

And while all bricks and mortar retailers would welcome an \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Amazon tax\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd from Philip Hammond in next week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s budget, that would not make a material difference either.</p> <p>Already, there is much speculation that if the financial position does not improve, Sports Direct\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s boss, Mike Ashley, will launch a takeover bid with a view to merging Debenhams with his newly acquired House of Fraser stores. That looks a lot easier on paper than it is likely to be in practice. It would be quite a project to stitch the two chains together and make them viable.</p> <p>For now, though, the question is whether the Debenhams management has a plan for saving the business, and it hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t done a lot to suggest it has. The emergency package of measures that has been announced buys time, but not all that much.</p> <h2>Labour won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t risk higher taxes</h2> <p>Theresa May and John McDonnell don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t often see eye to eye, but on one thing they are agreed. The public has had enough of spending cuts.</p> <p>Hard though it is to recall now, the public was receptive to the idea of a bit of belt-tightening when George Osborne first announced his austerity plans in 2010. But voters were never told that the squeeze would go on until the mid-2020s, and sometime between the general elections of 2015 and 2017 austerity fatigue set in.</p> <p>Osborne\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s plan was a dud. It resulted in slower growth, and a slower pace of deficit reduction. The deep, early cuts to public investment were especially harmful. Yet turning the clock back to 2010 and reversing all the cuts would be mightily expensive. The price tag would be more than <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/oct/25/john-mcdonnell-says-labour-will-reverse-cuts-and-end-austerity\">\u00c2\u00a3108bn,</a> McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, said on Thursday.</p> <p>Clearly this is not going to happen while May is in Downing Street, but it is unlikely to happen if Jeremy Corbyn becomes prime minister either.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"56d958af708c804458af82ed46944cd6608918ce\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/56d958af708c804458af82ed46944cd6608918ce/0_59_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"John McDonnell\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">John McDonnell calls on Philip Hammond to admit the hardship that eight years of Conservative austerity have inflicted on voters.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kirsty O\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Connor/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Labour was committed to \u00c2\u00a349bn of spending pledges at the 2017 election, matched by \u00c2\u00a349bn of tax increases, and would only borrow for investment, so if McDonnell wanted to reverse post-2010 austerity in its entirety it would involve more than doubling his tax increases. That would mean extending their scope beyond the current soft targets \u00e2\u20ac\u201c companies and the 5% highest earners \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and hitting those further down the income scale.</p> <p>That, however, would be a political risk because until now Labour has sought \u00e2\u20ac\u201c with some success \u00e2\u20ac\u201c to persuade voters that they can have a free lunch; higher spending with somebody else paying for it. All of which helps to explain why McDonnell is being careful not to commit himself to finding an extra \u00c2\u00a3108bn. Voters are indeed sick of austerity, but that doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t mean they are gagging to pay higher taxes.</p>",

And while all bricks and mortar retailers would welcome an \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Amazon tax\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd from Philip Hammond in next week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s budget, that would not make a material difference either. Already, there is much speculation that if the financial position does not improve, Sports Direct\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s boss, Mike Ashley, will launch a takeover bid with a view to merging Debenhams with his newly acquired House of Fraser stores. That looks a lot easier on paper than it is likely to be in practice. It would be quite a project to stitch the two chains together and make them viable. For now, though, the question is whether the Debenhams management has a plan for saving the business, and it hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t done a lot to suggest it has. The emergency package of measures that has been announced buys time, but not all that much. Labour won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t risk higher taxes Theresa May and John McDonnell don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t often see eye to eye, but on one thing they are agreed. The public has had enough of spending cuts. Hard though it is to recall now, the public was receptive to the idea of a bit of belt-tightening when George Osborne first announced his austerity plans in 2010. But voters were never told that the squeeze would go on until the mid-2020s, and sometime between the general elections of 2015 and 2017 austerity fatigue set in. Osborne\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s plan was a dud. It resulted in slower growth, and a slower pace of deficit reduction. The deep, early cuts to public investment were especially harmful. Yet turning the clock back to 2010 and reversing all the cuts would be mightily expensive. The price tag would be more than \u00c2\u00a3108bn, McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, said on Thursday. Clearly this is not going to happen while May is in Downing Street, but it is unlikely to happen if Jeremy Corbyn becomes prime minister either. Labour was committed to \u00c2\u00a349bn of spending pledges at the 2017 election, matched by \u00c2\u00a349bn of tax increases, and would only borrow for investment, so if McDonnell wanted to reverse post-2010 austerity in its entirety it would involve more than doubling his tax increases. That would mean extending their scope beyond the current soft targets \u00e2\u20ac\u201c companies and the 5% highest earners \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and hitting those further down the income scale. That, however, would be a political risk because until now Labour has sought \u00e2\u20ac\u201c with some success \u00e2\u20ac\u201c to persuade voters that they can have a free lunch; higher spending with somebody else paying for it. All of which helps to explain why McDonnell is being careful not to commit himself to finding an extra \u00c2\u00a3108bn. Voters are indeed sick of austerity, but that doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t mean they are gagging to pay higher taxes.",

Against all the macro headwinds, the micro factor of strong U.S. corporate earnings had been enough to insulate the market. So far the U.S. earnings season has been decent, with approximately 30% of the S&amp;P 500 companies by market capitalization having reported and 83% of those having beaten analyst\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s expectations for earnings.</p> <p>The anxiety now in markets stems from whether this is the peak in earnings and growth, as higher input costs from rising wages, the impact of tariffs and higher funding costs start to impinge on corporate margins. The problems in the U.S. market are having knock-on effects on global equities, and the rising U.S. dollar is exacerbating difficulties for emerging markets and Asia. However, the global economy is still growing and corporate earnings are still positive. They may not grow as fast or be as positive from here on out, but these are still reasons to favour risk assets and equities.</p> <p>Markets are likely to remain jittery for the rest of the year.

                "bodyText":"Alphabet also missed Wall Street forecasts. The company behind Google posted revenue of $33.74bn in the last quarter, missing estimates of $34.05 billion. Still, Alphabet also reported net profit of $9.19 billion, or $13.06 per share, up from $9.57 per share a year ago. eMarketer analyst Monica Peart says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re seeing a larger than expected slowdown in Google properties\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 revenue, representing its core search business. This is likely related to the ramp-up in competition from Amazon, as consumers increasingly turn to the ecommerce giant for their product searches.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s all for tonight! GW Amazon has taken a bite out of Wall Street\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new-found optimism tonight, by missing analyst expectations: Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Bloomberg\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s take: Amazon.com Inc. reported sales that missed analysts\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 estimates, and issued a disappointing revenue forecast for the busy holiday quarter, suggesting the online marketplace may be reaching a saturation point in the U.S. Revenue gained 29 percent to $56.6 billion in the third quarter, the e-commerce giant said Thursday in a statement. Analysts\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 projected $57.1 billion. Sales will be from $66.5 billion to $72.5 billion in the current period, falling short of analysts\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 average estimate of $73.8 billion. Shares declined as much as 6.5 percent in extended trading. Ut-oh... Amazon and Alphabet have just released results as the echo of the closing bell fade. And Wall Street is NOT happy..... Intel has smashed earnings forecasts, though: Breaking: After Wipeout Wednesday, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Turnaround Thursday. October has maintained its run of wild swings tonight, as Wall Street bounces back. The Dow Jones industrial average has closed 401 points higher, a gain of 1.6%, at 24,984. Technology, industrials companies and banks led the rally. Microsoft closed 6% higher, while Intel gained 4.8%. With tech stocks romping ahead, the Nasdaq has posted its biggest one-day jump in seven months. The Nasdaq\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s recovery is even punchier than the Dow\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s. The tech-focused index has leapt by 3%, with just a few minutes to go. Tesla, Twitter and Microsoft have all done their bit, with forecast-beating results in the last 24 hours. The rebound has legs! With just 30 minutes to go, the Dow is up an impressive 490 points, or 2%, at 25,073. That means its recovered a large chunk of the Wednesday wobble. Traders in New York must be dizzy! The Dow is holding onto its gains. With two hours to go, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s up 380 points at 24,963, up 1.5%. Microsoft is leading the charge, up 5.7% after impressive results last night. Intel (+5%) and VISA (+3.45%) are close behind. The ongoing market turbulence hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t deterred US company Yeti from floating on the stock market today. Yeti makes high end coolers and outdoor gear, popular with outdoor types like hunters and surfers, and pitmasters who spend time tending barbecues (important work!). Their kit isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t cheap. The Tundra 125 cooler retails at $549 -- for that, you get enough space for 73 cans or dozens of hot dogs, hamburger patties and cold cuts. Yeti floated at $18 per share -- so far, they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve slipped by 7% to $16.80. Not a great start - still, a yeti makes a change from all those Wall Street bears. After tumbling in early trading, European stock markets have recovered to end the day higher. In London, the FTSE 100 has climbed back over the 7,000 point mark, ending up 41 points at 7,004. It would be higher, but for WPP\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s woes. Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB had a good day, gaining 1.8% after Mario Dragji said he was confident that the deadlock over Rome\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s budget plans would be resolved. The French CAC gained 1.6%, and Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s DAX rose 1%, as traders welcomed the rally in New York. On Wall Street, the Dow is now up 350 points - trying to put Wednesday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shocker behind it. Asia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tumble into a bear market overnight is still a concern, though, as market volatility remains high. Fiona Cincotta of City Index says this month\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s losses could be a buying opportunity...... Wall Street started on the front foot with tech stocks on the rise after falling sharply in the previous session. Upbeat results from Microsoft and Telsa have gone some way to calming investor nerves after disappointments from Caterpillar and 3M earlier in the week. Whilst a slew of risk factors have hit traders confidence hard this month, investors will be looking searching for the bottom of this recent shake out. So far market shake out\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s this year have been buying opportunities and whilst we are still in a bull market, we don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t see why this one should be any different right now. Neil MacKinnon, Global Macro Strategist at VTB Capital, says today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s governing council meeting came at a tricky time for the ECB. The ECB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision to hold current interest rate levels at 0% takes place at a time of a cyclical slowdown in the Eurozone economies, as well as persistently subdued core CPI inflation. Business growth is at its slowest in two years and companies\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 expectations of future growth have slipped to the lowest in four years. The Italian budget drama is also high on the agenda and the stand-off between Rome and Brussels is unlikely to be resolved. Also noteworthy is the risk of a worsening \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcdoom-loop\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 between Italian banks and their holdings of domestic sovereign debt. Italy is not Greece and Rome will react badly if the ECB resorts to its \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcenforcement tools\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 of closing down bond purchases and turning off the liquidity tap for the Italian banking system.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s some expert reaction to the European Central Bank press conference today: Anna Stupnytska, global economist at Fidelity International, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153At today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s press conference Draghi chose to strike a relatively hawkish note, while acknowledging somewhat weaker economic momentum as of late. There has been some concern in the market about a number of disappointing data prints this month, including the flash PMIs yesterday, but evidence so far has not been strong enough to change the ECB stance. Anthony Kurukgy, Senior Sales Trader at Foenix Partners Mario Draghi stuck to the script again at today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ECB Press Conference, delivering yet another \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcbalanced\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 assessment of the eurozone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy. The ECB President quelled recent concerns of weaker economic data as merely a slowdown of growth momentum, not a downturn. This aside, the ECB remain committed to ending the central bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bond-buying programme come December. Transitory or not, Draghi and Co. will need to buy themselves more time to distinguish what effect trade wars, Brexit and the recent Italian budget crisis will have on its interest rate hike timeline in 2019. Silvia Dall\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Angelo, Senior Economist, Hermes Investment Management The bottom line is that the ECB is on a gradual path of monetary policy normalisation for now, but risks from protectionism, a further slowdown in external demand, domestic political instability, Brexit and volatility in financial markets cast a dark shadow on the ECB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s plans. Policy uncertainty has increased both externally and domestically: international trade tensions have remained high, there is no solution for the Brexit issue in sight, and the Italian government seems determined to defy the European fiscal rules. The recent turmoil in financial markets is a new addition to the list of downside risks. Marina Mensah-Afoakwah, Senior Economist at the CEBR Between Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s budget drama and the precarious nature of Brexit, there is a lot that threatens the Eurozone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stability. For the time being these pressures haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t risen to a level requiring ECB intervention. Time will tell however, as latest figures suggest cracks are beginning to show in the region\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bounceback on Wall Street means some investors may be snaffling up bargains. Or at least, what they hope are bargains. CNBC explains why traders may be putting their toes into the water again: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The technical picture has turned increasingly bearish this month,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Ed Yardeni, president and chief investment strategist at Yardeni Research. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The percentage of S&amp;P 500 companies trading above their 200-day moving averages was down to 37% after yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s debacle.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd He noted, however, that prior similar declines during this bull market have \u00e2\u20ac\u0153marked buying opportunities.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Yardeni added: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153If this is still a bull market, as we believe it is, then the latest bearish technicals and October\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s swoon should mark the latest buying opportunity.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Back in the markets, shares are rising in New York as traders return to the fray after yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s alarming late sell-off. The Dow Jones industrial average jumped by 192 points at the open, or 0.8%. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s an encouraging start, after Wednesday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 608-point slide. The Nasdaq is also recovering, after slumping ingloriously into a correction yesterday, in its worst day since 2011. The strong results from Twitter today, plus Microsoft and Tesla yesterday, may be calming nerves. Tesla has surged by over 8% in early trading, with other carmakers also up (Ford has gained almost 6%). Twitter has leapt by 15%, after beating profit and revenue forecasts today. But it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s early days. Investors will be watching nervously to see if Wall Street can hold onto these gains, or be dragged down again. Mario Draghi warns that there could be \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcuneasiness\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 in the financial markets, unless Britain and the EU make progress towards a Brexit deal. Asked about Brexit at today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s press conference, the ECB president says he is confident that a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153good, common sense solution\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd will be found. But he also warns that time is running out - if a deal isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t reached, banks and other businesses will be forced to trigger their contingency plans. As Draghi puts it: If this lack of a solution continues, and approaches the end date, the the private sector itself will have to prepare on the assumption that it will be a hard Brexit. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s where there will be financial uneasiness in markets. Boom! Mario Draghi has admonished politicians, such as Donald Trump, who put pressure on central banks to change their policy. He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been asked the pressure on the European Central Bank and the Fed to maintain their stimulus programmes, or do more. Draghi tells reporters in Frankfurt that these attacks threaten central bank independence. He says: Central bank independence is a precious thing. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s precious because it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s essential for the credibility of the central banks, and credibility is essential for effectiveness. That means giving central banks the independence to deliver their mandates, and to choose which instruments are most effective. If that is eroded, then a central bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s effectiveness is reduced, he warns. Earlier this week, Trump blasted the Fed for being too keen to raise interest rates, accusing it of threatening the US economy. In Europe, the ECB has faced criticism from Germany, for example, over its stimulus programme and record low interest rates. Draghi suggests that politicians should see the big picture: Actually the legislators themselves, who are often the very same people who are arguing for the central bank to do this or that, should be the first ones to care about monetary policy effectiveness and central banks achieving their goals. Q: What options do you have if the financial markets continue to fall, if economic data worsens, or if relations between Italy and the EC deteriorate further? We still have tools in the toolbox, Draghi replies. He reveals that two speakers at this week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Governing Council meeting mentioned its TLTRO programme -- which provides cheap financing to eurozone banks. Mario Draghi is fending off several questions about Italy, and whether he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s worried about the rise in its bond yields. He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s arguing that the spillover impact from Italy onto other countries is limited so far. Q: Are you worried that the spread between Italian and German bonds could continue to widen, perhaps to 400 basis points? Would that cause impairments to Italian banks\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 balance sheets? I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have a crystal ball, Draghi snaps back briskly. But yes, there is a linkage betweem Italian sovereign debt and its banks (which hold a lot of it). If they lose value, they are denting into the capital position of the banks. Mario Draghi adds that he is \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcconfident\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 that an agreement between Italy and the European Commission over its budget will be found . [reminder, the EC rejected Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s plans on Tuesday, but Rome is refusing to rewrite them] Q: What does the ECB think about the clash between Rome and Brussels over Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 2019 budget? Italy is a fiscal discussion, Draghi replies, so it wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t discussed much at today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meeting. Onto questions.. Q) Did the ECB discuss downgrading their assessment of the eurozone economy today? Mario Draghi speaks at some length, explaining that the governing council agreed that economic momentum has weakened, but we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re not facing a downturn. Various \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcidiosyncratic\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 reasons are to blame - such as the slowdown in Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s car sector as manufacturers get to grips with new emission rules. There are also a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcbunch of uncertainties\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, such as the stalemate between the US and China over trade, Brexit, and Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 2019 budget. Plus, Draghi adds, growth is returning to potential when it was clearly above potential in 2017. These risks are not considered enough to merit changing our balance of risks, he insists firmly. Draghi ends his statement with his traditional call for eurozone government to \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcsubstantially step up\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 their structural reforms, to take advantage of the ECB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stimulus measures. Eurozone states must raise their long-term growth potential, he adds. Over in Frankfurt, ECB president Mario Draghi is explaining today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s interest rate decision. He has singled out protectionism, emerging market vulnerabilities and financial market volatility as important risks to the eurozone recovery. However, overall risks are \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcbroadly balanced\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, he says. On inflation, the ECB thinks domestic cost pressures are strengthening and broadening, as wage increases feed through to prices. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Bloomberg\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s take on those durable goods figures: Newsflash: Orders for durable goods at American firms has fallen for the second month running (if you strip out aircraft and defence sales). Core durable goods orders shrank by 0.1% last month, new data shows, following a 0.2% decline in August. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s only a small move, of course, but it suggests US manufacturing isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t sizzling. Perhaps tariffs are having an effect. Twitter\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s earnings beat is going to help drive Wall Street up again, after yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s late rout. The tech-focused Nasdaq is now forecast to jump by 1.7% when trading begins. The Dow is on track to gain 220 points (or more than a third of yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s slump). Electric carmaker Tesla is also likely to surge, after surprising investors with a return to profitability last night. Microsoft also beat forecasts last night, partly thanks to strong growth at its Azure cloud computing division. Twitter isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t the only company beating forecasts today. Comcast, which recently won the battle for Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Sky News, has also impressed investors. Net income jumped by 9% in the last three months, as it attracted more broadband customers. NEWSFLASH: The European Central Bank has (to no-one\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s surprise) left eurozone interest rates at their current record lows. That means the headline borrowing rate remains at zero, while banks face a negative interest rate of -0.4% on their deposits at the ECB (to encourage them to lend the money instead). It also makes three important points: The ECB is still \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcanticipating\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 it will end its bond-buying programme in December, after buying \u00e2\u201a\u00ac15bn of securities each month until the end of the year. The ECB reiterated that it expects to leave rates on hold until at least the summer of 2019, to ensure that inflation returns sustainably to its target of just below 2%. It also restated its plan to reinvest the proceeds of bonds bought under its QE stimulus programme. That would avoid the risk of tightening monetary policy too quickly, even if the ECB has stopped printing any more electronic money. Dr Ben Marder, Senior Lecturer in Marketing at University of Edinburgh Business School, is concerned that Twitter\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s active user base is shrinking. He thinks that the site\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Fake News problem is hurting: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Donald Trump, no matter your opinion of the man, is Twitter gold. His tweets attract vast swathes of traffic to the site and he has no doubt had a positive effect on Twitter\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock price in the past few years. This was a mutually beneficial relationship as Twitter was pivotal for Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 2016 presidential election success. However, despite Twitter posting higher than expected earnings and revenue in Q3 2018, monthly active users have fallen for a second quarter in a row as the company continues to purge bots and fake accounts. It seems Trump is now biting the hand that used to feed him. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Twitter, much like other social media giants are starting to bleed-out from the large thorn in their side which is \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcfake news\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. Worsening the wound are world-wide governments, including the US who are threatening regulatory action against the tech giants for facilitating the dissemination of fake news. Adding to the many great ironies for Trump, he is largely rumoured to be a not so secret proponent of \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcfake news\u00e2\u20ac\u2122.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Par exemple..... Twitter is benefitting from a surge in advertising deals, explains Anthony Capano, managing director of Europe for Rakuten Marketing: While Twitter focused its efforts earlier this year on cleaning the platform of fraudulent actors, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s clear that the focus has returned to investing in global opportunities for advertisers. Earlier in Q3 the platform revealed a host of content partnerships including Bloomberg, Sony Music and NBCUniversal that would bring hundreds of hours of livestreams and other videos to the platform in the Asia-Pacific region. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s important UK marketers see how relevant these opportunities are to their operation. In Britain alone, as many as 35% of our client transactions are now taking place overseas. Some Silicon Valley early risers are waking up to the news that Twitter did better than expected last quarter: Newsflash: Twitter has smashed Wall Street forecasts with its latest financial results. The social network site grew its earnings to 21 cents per share in the last quarter, well ahead of estimates of 14 cents. Revenues came in at $758, beating forecasts of $702m, thanks to a 29% leap in advertising sales. However, Twitter also revealed that the number of monthly active users fell to 326 million; analysts expected 331.5 million. That may be due to Twitter\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s efforts to eradicate trolls, and malicious accounts created to pump out fake news and influence elections. Twitter also warned that it expects to keep losing active users in the current quarter. Shares are soaring in pre-market trading, as investors cheer the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s earnings growth. 2018 has been a pretty rough year for the markets, with nearly $7 trillion (!) wiped off stock values since the end of January. So, the 42 trillion dollar question is whether we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re heading towards a proper, old-fashioned crash... or if these lower prices actually give value. Neil Wilson of Markets.com suggests the long-running bull market hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t run out of steam yet. Stocks could rally if the Federal Reserve decides to slow the pace of future interest rate rises - as Donald Trump has been demanding. Wilson writes: We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re in a period of pressure building to the downside as we get more down days than up and the breadth of the decline is important as is the volume. However whilst the recent spike in volatility may be seen as meaning we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re past the peak, there may yet be a few breaths left in this old bull. Valuations - while not going for a song - are a lot more attractive at about 16x forward earnings. Confidence is clearly lacking however and it may require a softening tone from the Fed to assuage concerns on rates. Softer inflation figures would help greatly and the autumn/winter may provide respite on that front. If we go back a couple of weeks we must recall that this selling started on some very hawkish jawboning by Jerome Powell on rates. This may be the start of the age of the Bears but it may equally be just a tantrum. The macro outlook is not great - China, trade, Italy are all weights but for most of 2018 US investors were able to shrug off any global worries. Advertising giant WPP is having a torrid day, as its new boss gets to grips with the business\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s problems. Shares are down 16%, at their lowest level since December 2012, after it missed sales forecasts and slashed its guidance. CEO Mark Read, who replaced industry veteran Sir Martin Sorrell earlier this year, was blunt about WPP\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s problems, saying: Clearly we have underperformed our competition in the third quarter. We are not going to sugarcoat the reality.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd More here: Facebook has been buffeted by the stock market sell-off. Its shares slid by 5% yesterday, and are down 17% this year as the social network giant faces tough questions about extremism and election interference. In another blow, it has just been fined half a million pounds by Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s information commissioner for not protecting users\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 data. This follows the Cambridge Analytica scandal, which exposed how third party developers had been allowed to access user information without sufficient consent. In monetary terms, \u00c2\u00a3500k is barely a mosquito bite on a mammoth company worth $421bn. But it comes with a stern rebuke from information commissioner Elizabeth Denham, who says: Facebook failed to sufficiently protect the privacy of its users before, during and after the unlawful processing of this data. A company of its size and expertise should have known better and it should have done better. After that shaky start, European stocks have now turn positive for the day! Germany, France and Italy have all rebounded from this morning\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s lows, with Italian banks are leading the rally. Even the FTSE 100 is getting a boost, clawing its way back from that seven-month low. One factor - Wall Street is currently expected to rally in a few hours. The Dow futures show a gain of 224 points, following Wednesday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 608-point rout. Another factor: One of Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s coalition leaders has vowed to step in if a bank or other company needs help. Deputy PM Matteo Salvini, who also leads the right-wing Northern League party, said any help provided would be different from past interventions. Salvini also suggested that investors are too pessimistic about Italy, having driven its bond yields higher in recent weeks. Reuters has more details: Salvini, who is also the leader of the ruling League party, said on the sidelines of a conference in the northern city of Verona that the Italy/Germany bond yield spread would inevitably fall if it followed the real economy. Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell, says investors are nervous about the state of the world. He explains: The chief concerns are the potential negative impacts of higher interest rates, weaker global growth and the knock-on effects of trade tariffs. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The FTSE 100 fell 0.7% in early trading on Thursday to 6,912 with pharmaceuticals, insurers and oil companies the biggest contributors to the index\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decline. Japan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Nikkei index incurred heavy losses, falling 3.7% in a single session.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Back in Australia, insurance group AMP\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shares crashed by 25% today, as it paid the price for past misdeeds. AMP shocked investors by revealing that its wealth management business suffered a $1.5bn asset withdrawal in the last quarter. The company suffered badly from Australia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Royal Commission into banking, earlier this year. That inquiry exposed that AMB had charge customers who had died, and imposed fees even if it didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t provide a services. More here: Our latest Brexit dashboard shows how consumer spending slowed last month, even before the stock market turmoil hit confidence. Two leading economists argue that the government needs to take bold action, by ending austerity and helping businesses navigate Brexit uncertainty: Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s troubled retail sector is reeling from another blow this morning, as Debenhams outlines plans to shut up to 50 stores. The closure plan puts thousands of jobs at risk, on top of tens of thousands of redundancies at fellow chains such as Toys R Us, Mothercare, Carpetright and Maplin. Debenhams dropped the bad news as it reported a \u00c2\u00a3500m annual loss, partly due the cost of writing off unwanted shop leases and IT systems. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s an astonishing amount, for a company only valued at \u00c2\u00a3100m. The closures will take place over the next three to five years, Debs says, as it pulls out of unprofitable stores. Simon Underwood, business recovery partner at accountancy firm Menzies LLP, warns that the days of the traditional department store are numbered. Instead, they will become \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcexperimental showrooms\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, or places for meetings etc. Underwood adds: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The decision to focus on a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcprofitable core\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 of stores is a good one. However, the question is whether closing just ten stores now, with a view to reducing store numbers further over the next three to five years will be enough in view of the speed of changes in the marketplace as consumers shift to buying online. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The high street needs support, but some of the ideas being mooted by Government could prove counterproductive. For example, the Chairman of John Lewis, Sir Charlie Mayfield has recently spoken out against the Amazon tax and many bricks and mortar retailers fear that a blanket levy on online sales would be tantamount to hitting the high street when it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s down, as most of them sell goods online too. German firms are also anxious about the danger that Britain leaves the EU without a deal, says IFO. The row between Italy and the EU over its 2019 budget is another worry, it adds. Just in: business morale in Germany has taken a tumble this month. The German business climate index produced by the IFO institute dropped to 102.8 this month, down from 103.7 in September. Company bosses said business conditions had deteriorated, while their expectations also become gloomier. Geopolitical tensions, such as the trade wars between the US and China, seem to be hurting. Ifo chief Clemens Fuest blamed \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcglobal uncertainty\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 for the drop in confidence, adding: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Firms were less satisfied with their current business situation and less optimistic about the months ahead. Growing global uncertainty is increasingly taking its toll on the German economy.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Worryingly, there doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t seem to be a single cause for the current sell-off (unlike in 2008, say, or in 2015 when investors fretted about China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy). Instead, a cocktail of problems are being blamed, as traders worry that the long bull market in shares may be petering out. Kerry Craig, global market strategist at JP Morgan Asset Management, says the lack of a single cause for the current volatility is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153troubling\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. There are many symptoms but no one can diagnose the illness. Geopolitics, rising bond U.S. bond yields, a more hawkish looking U.S. Federal Reserve (the Fed), slowing Chinese growth, a strong U.S. dollar and the already well known problems in some emerging economies have all contributed to the market unease. The focus for investors had been on corporate earnings. Against all the macro headwinds, the micro factor of strong U.S. corporate earnings had been enough to insulate the market. So far the U.S. earnings season has been decent, with approximately 30% of the S&amp;P 500 companies by market capitalization having reported and 83% of those having beaten analyst\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s expectations for earnings. The anxiety now in markets stems from whether this is the peak in earnings and growth, as higher input costs from rising wages, the impact of tariffs and higher funding costs start to impinge on corporate margins. The problems in the U.S. market are having knock-on effects on global equities, and the rising U.S. dollar is exacerbating difficulties for emerging markets and Asia. However, the global economy is still growing and corporate earnings are still positive. They may not grow as fast or be as positive from here on out, but these are still reasons to favour risk assets and equities. Markets are likely to remain jittery for the rest of the year. The upcoming G20 meeting is not likely to result in a resolution of the trade dispute between the U.S. and China. Both sides are caught in a case of political brinkmanship. There are heavy losses in Europe too. Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s DAX index has fallen by 0.8%, to its lowest level since December 2016. France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s CAC hit its lowest level since March 2017, down another 0.4% in early trading. Here are the best and worst performing shares on the FTSE 100 this morning. Utilities, precious metal miners, and other defensive stocks are in - most other companies are out! Boom! Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE 100 has hit a seven-month low at the start of trading in London. The blue-chip index has fallen by 75 points to 6887, a drop of over 1%, its lowest level since late March. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s now lost around 8% of its value in the last four weeks, as the market sell-off has gathered pace. Advertising giant WPP are leading the selloff, slumping by 18% after reporting that revenues 1.5% fell in the last quarter. Consumer goods producers, technology companies, miners and energy firms are also in the red, as Europe picks up the sell-off baton from Asia. Some context: Stephen Innis of foreign exchange firm OANDA fears that the US stock markets are on the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153verge of crumbling\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, after last night\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s late rout. If people are struggling to find a driver I suggest, they wake up and smell the coffee. The catalysts are nothing new -- Tariffs, Italy, Brexit, Saudi Arabia. But with the towering pillars of market strength, the US equity markets, is looking ever so fragile and on the verge of crumbling. The air is so thick with a sense of foreboding that you can cut it with a dull butter knife. Maybe there are too many things going sideways clouding investor judgement, but things could turn nasty in a heartbeat. With risk sentiment tanking, we could be facing \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the early stages of a protracted equity market meltdown\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, he adds. Yesterday was the worst day for tech stocks on Wall Street for seven years, dragging the Nasdaq into bear-market territory and wiping out the Dow\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 2018 gains. And today, markets were in retreat from Sydney to Shanghai, my colleague Martin Farrer reports: In Australia the benchmark ASX200 closed down 164 points or 2.8% as it suffered its fifth straight day of losses. In Japan the Nikkei was off 3.7% and has now dropped around 13% from a 27-year peak of 24,448.07 touched in early October. A broad indicator of shares in the region \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the MSCI Asia Pacific index \u00e2\u20ac\u201c has now fallen 20.3% from the year-to-date high set on 29 January, representing an official bear market. The Vix \u00e2\u20ac\u0153fear\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd index, which measures volatility across the market, has spiked sharply this week and was up 21% overnight. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t thought that selling would be this steep. This sell-off makes us think the market may be set for capitulation,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Shoji Hirakawa, chief global strategist at Tokai Tokyo Research Center. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. The sell-off in global stock markets is accelerating today, as stocks keep sliding across the globe. Asian stock markets have plunged into bear market territory, meaning they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve shed 20% of their value since their highs in January. Fears over the health of the global economy, future US interest rate rises, Jamal Khashoggi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s murder, and America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade war with China are all being blamed as investors try to grab the nearest tin hat to ride out the storm. Some disappointing corporate results this week - including from industry bellwether Caterpillar - have also dampened the mood, and raised fears that growth is slowing. After a very bruising session, Japan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Nikkei has tumbled by 3.7%, while Australia has lost 2.8%. China suffered fresh losses too, taking it deeper into its own bear market. Analysts are worried that the sell-off has further to run, and could turn into a full-blown collapse. As Greg McKenna, an independent markets strategist in Australia, put it: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The fear is palpable in stock markets at the moment,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This could get much worse before it gets better. Collapses happen after falls. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the danger.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd That follows another rocky session on Wall Street, where the Dow slumped by another 600 points (-2.4%). That wipes out all its gains for this year, as a wave of worry swept the trading floors. Optimism is out, and volatility is back. Bears are prowling the trading floors this morning in Europe too. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE 100 is expected to fall, and could hit a new seven-month low. Other European markets are expected to slide too, as the spat between Rome and Brussels over next year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s budget continues. The EU has asked for a new version within three weeks, but Italy is refusing to rewrite its plans. Also coming up The European Central Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s governing council is meeting today to set monetary policy. No change is expected, but Mario Draghi will be quizzed by journalists. Given the market volatility, is Draghi still happy to end the ECB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stimulus programme in December? And how worried is he about Italy? It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a busy day for corporate results in London, with Lloyds Banking Group, WPP and Debenhams reporting results (and store closures, in Deb\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s case).

                "bodyText":"Global markets chalked up their longest weekly losing streak in five years on Friday, as Wall Street reacted to worse-than-expected results from US tech giants. The MSCI all-country world index, which tracks shares across stock markets in 47 developed and emerging countries, closed down 3.7% on Friday. The fifth consecutive week of losses would represent its worst period since May 2013. The global index has dropped by 9.5% since the start of the month, the second largest sell-off of the year following turmoil in February. British companies on the FTSE 100 fell by 0.92%, with the index hitting its lowest level in seven months at one point on Friday, before recovering slightly to the lowest close since March. The share price of the steel producer Evraz fell by more than 6%. The grocery delivery firm Ocado lost 5%, while BT Group, Royal Bank of Scotland and Royal Mail all dropped by more than 4%. The slide was matched on Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s other large markets. Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax index fell by 0.94% while France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac 40 lost about 1.29%. Shares across Europe have suffered from nerves around the Brexit negotiations, with UK government ministers still insisting that leaving the EU without a deal is a possibility. Economists predict that a no-deal Brexit would cause significant damage to earnings for companies in the UK and Europe. The Italian government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s dispute with the European commission over its budget has also added to the risk aversion in the EU. Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new government decided to increase spending dramatically, pushing the deficit to 2.4% of GDP, three times higher than planned. The commission rejected the budget under an EU review process. In the US, investors have grown increasingly concerned in recent weeks on the valuations of large firms, even as GDP growth in the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest economy has continued to impress. The latest US GDP figures, published on Friday by the Bureau of Economic Analysis, showed annualised growth of 3.5% in the third quarter, after an even faster rate of 4.2% in the previous quarter. US GDP growth was supported by the strongest burst of consumer spending in nearly four years, but analysts questioned the sustainability of the boom. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Investors must be asking the question how much longer can consumers maintain this pace for,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Chris Towner, a director at risk management consultancy JCRA. Gregory Daco, chief US economist at consultancy Oxford Economics, said in a note to clients that the US economy \u00e2\u20ac\u0153continues to show resilience\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, but said he expects \u00e2\u20ac\u0153more moderate growth in 2019\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. The US Federal Reserve is expected to continue on its path of raising interest rates, raising borrowing costs for firms around the world. Investors have also been spooked by the threat of disruption from a trade war between the US and China, prompted by the protectionism of the US president, Donald Trump. The robust performance of the US economy in the third quarter was overshadowed on Friday by the fallout from technology company results overnight, which showed revenue growth below analyst expectations, adding to concerns that American firms will be unable to sustain profits at current strong levels. Amazon on Thursday delivered record profits of almost $3bn for the last three months, but revenue growth was slower than expected. Alphabet also missed analysts\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 revenue expectations. The parent company of Google was also under pressure after a New York Times report alleging that it paid executives after they were accused of sexual harassment. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re going through this transition where, earlier in the year, the corporate earnings results were just a blowout and now they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re more mixed,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said David Lefkowitz, senior equity strategist Americas at UBS Global Wealth Management. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s causing some of this volatility.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd New York\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Nasdaq index was down 2.07% at close on Friday, continuing a bumpy week for US stocks.

                "bodyText":"Time for a recap Global stock markets are on track for their worst month in five years ,after another day of losses. In London, the FTSE 100 has lost nearly 1% to close at its weakest level since March. At one point it hit a 22-month low. The US stock markets is also in the red today. Technology stocks are leading the sell-off, after Amazon and Alphabet underwhelmed Wall Street with their results last night. Investors have not taken much cheer from the latest US GDP report, which showed a slightly faster acceleration in growth than expected. Consumer spending and government spending both boosted growth, but trade was a drag. Asia-Pacific markets also ended the week with another bout of volatility, and fears that contagion was spreading through the markets. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our latest news story on the markets, after a turbulent week: Shares in New York are also climbing back from their earlier lows. The Dow is now down just 140 points, or 0.6%, as a degree of calm returns to Wall Street. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE 250, an index of smaller companies, also lost almost 1% today: As European traders count their losses and head to the pub, their counterparts on Wall Street have just endured a rough morning Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the latest damage: Dow Jones industrial average: down 279 points or 1.1% at 24,715 S&amp;P 500: down 43 points or 1.6% at 2,661 Nasdaq: down 153 points or 2.2% at 6,862 Neil Wilson of Markets.com says the FAANG stocks (Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix and Google) are doing the damage. He writes: Bloody FAANGs means Halloween comes early in nightmare month for equities. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153No respite for equity markets today as the weight of the FAANGs dragged on the wider market and raises a real risk that this selloff is about to turn into a full bear market. The S&amp;P 500 has now dipped into correction territory in little over a month \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a steep selloff. Amazon and Alphabet earnings disappointed with less upbeat outlooks casting a cloud over tech stocks in particular. Bear in mind that it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s still the only real bright spot out there YTD and now it looks as though it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s starting to rollover. If FAANGs are rolling over the weaker sector stocks are very vulnerable \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Snap off 15% today after reporting another quarter of declining users and offered a pessimistic outlook. Snap\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s investment thesis was always shaky and the truth is it was never going to deliver. Quality like Microsoft and Intel are holding relatively firm \u00e2\u20ac\u201c they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve not seen sky high valuations as some of the FAANGs so are seen a bit safer, while both have delivered on earnings. Just in: Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock market has ended the day solidly in the red, at the end of a volatile week. However, the losses aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t quite as bad as earlier in the day, when stocks were languishing at a 22-month low. The FTSE 100 closed 64 points lower, or -0.92%, at 6,939 points. Things looked worse an hour ago, before shares rallied into the closing auction in London. Evraz was the biggest faller, down 6.3%, followed by online supermarket chain Ocada (-5%) and BT (-4.5%). There are losses in Europe: Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s DAX: -0.94% French CAC: -1.3% Italian FTSE MIB: -0.7% Fiona Cincotta of City Index says: The large-scale volatility that we have seen across the week was certainly not packing away for the weekend early. The bloodbath continued with markets across the globe slamming lower as concerns over US corporate results overshadowed a robust US GDP figure. As shares slide, investors are piling into the safety of government bonds. Debt issued by Germany and America is always attractive on these occasions. So as prices leap, bond yields (the interest on the bond) are dropping. Newsflash: The FTSE 100 just hit its lowest level since December 2016. It fell 152 points, or over 2%, to 6851, as markets end the week on a low. Technology stocks had been a stellar performer earlier this year. But now they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re sliding, and dragging the wider markets down, according to David Madden of CMC Markets: The S&amp;P 500 has fallen into correction territory as the decline in stocks intensifies. Amazon and Alphabet shares are in the red after both companies missed on revenue forecasts last night, and Amazon\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s guidance was also below the consensus estimate. US tech stocks set a series of record-highs throughout the summer, and they were the first to fall in the recent market rout. There is a sense that the tech sector is setting the pace for the rest of the world. The sell-off is gathering pace, again. The S&amp;P 500 index, which covers a broader spread of the US economy than the Dow, is down 2.2%. That puts the S&amp;P 500 into correction territory, more than 10% off its peak in September. The good news for City investors is that this week of pain is almost over. The bad news is that the FTSE 100 is wallowing close its lowest level since December 2016. The blue-chip Footsie index is down 117 points, or almost 1.7%, at 6887. Steel and mining company Evraz is the biggest faller, down 7.6% after mixed production numbers yesterday. WPP has shed another 4.6%, after Thursday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rout following a profits warning. Several economists are predicting that the US economy will slow in the quarters ahead, after six months of solid growth. Capital Economics believes tighter monetary policy is already having an impact: At 3.5% annualised, GDP growth remained unusually strong in the third quarter, thanks partly to this year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fiscal stimulus, but there are signs that higher interest rates are beginning to have a bigger restraining effect. Once the boost from fiscal stimulus fades next year, we expect economic growth to slow below its potential rate, forcing the Fed to the side-lines by mid-2019. Kay Daniel Neufeld, managing economist of CEBR, believes the trade war with China will also hurt growth. Q3 growth surprised on the upside, showing that the US economy continues to perform with considerable momentum in the second half of the year. However, house-made problems including the deteriorating global trading conditions and the fast pace of monetary tightening spell trouble for the coming quarters.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Ouch! The Dow Jones industrial average is now down 400 points, or 1.7%, as the market turmoil continues. Another tech firm, Cisco, is the biggest faller on the Dow (down 2.1%), followed by Home Depot (-1.9%) and American Express (-1.7%). Technology stocks are sliding in New York, particularly those which have disappointed Wall Street. Hard drive maker Western Digital has tumbled by 17%, after reporting a 3% drop in revenues for the last quarter. Profits shrank by 24%. Amazon has slumped by 7.5% after giving disappointing guidance for the holiday period last night. Google parent company Alphabet has shed 3%. This is all weighing on the Nasdaq, of course, which is down over 2%. The bell has rung and stronger-than-expected US growth in Q3 has failed to cheer investors. Opening scores: Dow Jones: -242 points or -1% at 24,742 S&amp;P 500: -39 points or -1.5% at 2,666 Nasdaq: -186 points or -2.5% at 7,132 Three minutes until the opening bell on Wall Street... Balraj Sroya, trader at currency firm Foenix Partners, says the US growth figures are key to both Trump and the Federal Reserve: Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s mantra of \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcMaking America Great Again\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 is echoing across the US economy as third quarter GDP growth outpaced market consensus with a print of 3.5%. Consumer spending and businesses increasing their inventories aided the strongest back to back quarters for growth in over two years. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s print was crucial for Trump and the GOP ahead of the Midterm elections as GDP seems to be aligning with the President\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s target for 2018, however it could spark the Fed to consider a more aggressive monetary policy. The detail behind the headline GDP growth figure, published by the US Commerce Department, shows that consumer spending boosted the economy in the third quarter, but net trade was a drag as exports fell but imports rose. The Department said: The increase in real GDP in the third quarter reflected positive contributions from personal consumption expenditures, private inventory investment, state and local government spending, federal government spending, and nonresidential fixed investment that were partly offset by negative contributions from exports and residential fixed investment. Imports, which are a subtraction in the calculation of GDP, increased. The deceleration in real GDP growth in the third quarter reflected a downturn in exports and a deceleration in nonresidential fixed investment. Imports increased in the third quarter after decreasing in the second. These movements were partly offset by an upturn in private inventory investment. Nancy Curtin, chief investment officer at Close Brothers Asset Management, said Donald Trump is likely to jump on the US growth figures: We can expect President Trump to wax lyrical about these results in the run up to the congressional midterm elections, adding evidence to his promise on expanding the economy. However, growth has already moderated and will continue to do so in 2019 as the tax cut boost dissipates and inflation tightens its grip as a result of Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tit for tat with China. (No Trump tweet about Q3 as yet...) Pre-trading on Wall Street has picked up after the news that US growth slowed less than expected in the third quarter, to 3.5%. US futures are still down before the opening bell, but less so: Dow Jones: -177 points or -0.7% S&amp;P 500: -24 points or -0.9% Nasdaq: -124 points or -1.8% Breaking: The US economy grew by 3.5% in the third quarter, faster than the 3.3% predicted by economists. It was a slowdown compared with the second quarter, when the economy grew by 4.2% on an annual basis. Economists at Investec have taken a step back from this week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s market mayhem to look at prospects in the months ahead for the global economy. In a month full of uncertainties, a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcglass half full\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 approach might be to say that there has been some respite in global trade tensions. However the pause looks to be because the Chinese and US authorities are eyeing more constructive talks after the US mid-terms. Even with this respite, risk assets are currently under pressure amid continuing concerns that the Fed may embark on a more aggressive tightening path, concerns over earnings and equity valuations and as other global political concerns have arisen. Furthermore some signs have emerged that suggest recent protectionist actions have spilt over into confidence and growth. But as yet we do not judge risks related to the above to be substantial enough to shift our world GDP forecasts, particularly given supportive fiscal policy in the US and China. We continue to look for 3.8% world growth this year and 3.7% next. Risks though lie to the downside for 2019. The pound is down 0.3% against the dollar at a two-month low of $1.2784. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s partly a story of a stronger dollar, which is up against a basket of currencies ahead of the US GDP number at 1.30pm UK time. Another day, another statement from Patisserie Valerie, the troubled cafe and bakery chain which earlier this month discovered a black hole in its accounts and a \u00c2\u00a31m unpaid tax bill that threatened the firm\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s collapse. The latest news is that Chris Marsh, the firm\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s finance director who was arrested on suspicion of fraud and subsequently bailed, has resigned. Pat Val\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s parent company, Patisserie Holdings, issued a brief statement: Patisserie Holdings plc announces that following the suspension of Chris Marsh on 9 October 2018, the company has now accepted his resignation as the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s finance director with immediate effect, while reserving its position in respect of any potential claims it may have against him. The latest announcement isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t quite surprising as the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s other ones over the past month. Thursdays rebound on Wall Street - with the Dow Jones surging 401 points - is nowhere to be seen today, with global markets on course for their longest losing streak in more than five years. European markets are sharply lower and US futures suggest the Dow could lose another 300-or-so points when the bell goes on Wall Street. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a look at US futures: Dow Jones: -271 points or -1.1% S&amp;P 500: -38 points or -1.4% Nasdaq: -174 points or -2.5% The MSCI all-country index, which tracks shares in 47 countries, was earlier down 0.3% and on track for a fifth week of losses - the longest losing streak since May 2013. Royal Bank of Scotland is weighing on the FTSE 100 this morning, with shares down nearly 5%. The bailed-out bank published third-quarter results this morning, and the detail has underwhelmed investors. Attributable profit - the figure which determines the dividend - was up 14% in the three months to the end of September, at \u00c2\u00a3448m, but it was below expectations of \u00c2\u00a3507m. Operating costs also increased as the bank set aside another \u00c2\u00a3200m for payment protection insurance claims. In better news, pre-tax profit rose 10% in the third quarter, to \u00c2\u00a3961m. But that has not been enough for traders, and RBS is among the top FTSE fallers: Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell, says that hopes appear to have been dashed for a positive end to the week for the FTSE . Any suggestion UK stocks might end the week on a more positive note has been swatted aside after the third quarter sales performance of Amazon and Google\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s parent company Alphabet disappointed after the market close in the US. Given the technology sector helped lead US indices to fresh highs in 2018 and is so dominant, its performance in the current earning season was always likely to be pivotal to investor sentiment. As if traders didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have enough to contend with, later today we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll get US GDP data for the third quarter. Figures are expected to show the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest economy grew by 3.3% in the third quarter, on an annual basis. It would be a slowdown from 4.2% in the second quarter. The figures will be published at 1.30pm, UK time. Connor Campbell, analyst at Spread Ex, says the number could weigh on investor moods: Given that the slightest thing sets the markets off at the moment, it is going to be interesting to see how they deal with this afternoon\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s first look at the US third quarter GDP figure. Analysts are expecting a slowdown from 4.2% in Q2 to 3.3% in Q3, a decline that may only cause further problems at the end of a tiring and tricky week. Let\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s take a closer look at the markets in Europe, where losses are accelerating this morning: As well as the disappointing results (on some measures) from Amazon and Alphabet, investors are also concerned by a number of other risks. To name a few - the US/China trade war, rising US interest rates, instability in emerging markets, and Brexit. Here is our story on how the market volatility has gripped Asian and Australian markets overnight: Opening bells have rung across Europe and the mood is gloomy: FTSE 100: -0.8% Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s DAX: -1.1% France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s CAC: -1% Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB: -0.5% Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s IBEX: -0.6% Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s STOXX 600: -0.6% David Madden, analyst at CMC Markets, explains why Amazon and Alphabet disappointed investors: We heard from tech giants Amazon and Alphabet after the closing bell last night. Amazon topped the earnings per share forecast, but missed on revenue and the guidance. Google\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s parent, Alphabet, exceeded estimates on EPS, but undershot the revenue forecast. Both stocks dropped heavily in the post-market session, and in turn sparked selling across major US indices. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re almost at the end of what has been a hugely volatile week for global stock markets. Wall Street bounced back on Thursday, with the Dow Jones surging 401 points, a gain of 1.6%, to close at 24,984. It followed sharp falls on Wednesday, and the turnaround in sentiment was largely down to technology stocks - after positive Twitter and Microsoft results - industrials companies and banks. But sentiment soured when US tech giants Amazon and Alphabet reported disappointing revenues after the closing bell on Wall Street. It was enough to send US futures lower, which in turn triggered a sell-off in Asia where shares hit 20-month lows. Markets across Europe are expected to open sharply lower this morning as the gloomy sentiment spreads across the Atlantic: We will be following the markets and all the latest business news as this volatile week for global markets draws to a close.",

It will come into effect in April 2020 and will raise \u00c2\u00a3400m a year, the chancellor said. Digital tech giants will be taxed 2% on the money they make from UK users.</p> <p>Stella Amiss, head of tax policy at PricewaterhouseCoopers, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The chancellor\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s strong words of recent months were no bluff. At home, the confirmation of a new digital services tax was trailed as a step towards levelling the playing field between online retailers and the high street. But it is much more than that. Working out who is taxed and who isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t in the digital economy is no mean feat when all businesses operate in an increasing technological world.</p> <p>It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no surprise then that the chancellor has approached this with caution - a narrowly targeted regime, a 2% rate, and an effective implementation date pushed back to 2020. This new tax is well and truly aimed at the tech giants and not the online retailers so will do little to address the woes of bricks and mortar retailers and could well be perceived across the pond as an anti-American measure that could come back to bite us as the UK looks to move to trade talks after the Brexit deadline.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5bd737e8e4b0bda4dc41b9d9\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-10-29T16:46:29.408Z\">4.46pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Duty on beer, cider and spirits has been frozen for a year \u00e2\u20ac\u201c while wine wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t spared, with duty going up in line with inflation. </p> <p>The Wine and Spirit Trade Association was quick to respond. Its chief executive Miles Beale welcomed the government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision to freeze duty on spirits, but deplored the increase in wine duty.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The decision by the chancellor to increase wine rates significantly is a hammer blow to this great British industry.

                "bodyText":"It has been a good day for stock markets. In the eurozone, the Dax closed up 1.2% while France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s CAC was up 0.4% and Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MiB gained 1.9%. The FTSE 100 index pared some of the gains made before the budget speech when it was up more than 120 points, and closed down 86.76 points at 7026.32, a 1.25% gain. Despite growth upgrades, sterling was little moved by the chancellor\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s speech (the growth outlook is still poor by historical standards). The pound slipped a bit more against the dollar, by 0.26% to $1.28, while it remained flat against the euro. Neil Wilson, chief market analyst at Markets.com, said: We got a confident, jocular chancellor and a fair bit of extra cash being splashed around for various departments \u00e2\u20ac\u201c defence, potholes, schools etc. Nothing earth-shatteringly major however. This was a political budget aimed at tackling the Corbyn threat \u00e2\u20ac\u201c end of PFI and a kind of pseudo Google tax. And the elephant in the room was Brexit \u00e2\u20ac\u201c it could all change if there is no deal, the odds of which are shortening by the day. We are closing the blog for the day \u00e2\u20ac\u201c we will be back tomorrow. Good night. You can read more reaction and analysis on our budget live blog: And here are the key points at a glance: One of the main budget announcements was a new digital services tax, on tech giants such as Google (but not start-ups). It will come into effect in April 2020 and will raise \u00c2\u00a3400m a year, the chancellor said. Digital tech giants will be taxed 2% on the money they make from UK users. Stella Amiss, head of tax policy at PricewaterhouseCoopers, said: The chancellor\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s strong words of recent months were no bluff. At home, the confirmation of a new digital services tax was trailed as a step towards levelling the playing field between online retailers and the high street. But it is much more than that. Working out who is taxed and who isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t in the digital economy is no mean feat when all businesses operate in an increasing technological world. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no surprise then that the chancellor has approached this with caution - a narrowly targeted regime, a 2% rate, and an effective implementation date pushed back to 2020. This new tax is well and truly aimed at the tech giants and not the online retailers so will do little to address the woes of bricks and mortar retailers and could well be perceived across the pond as an anti-American measure that could come back to bite us as the UK looks to move to trade talks after the Brexit deadline. Duty on beer, cider and spirits has been frozen for a year \u00e2\u20ac\u201c while wine wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t spared, with duty going up in line with inflation. The Wine and Spirit Trade Association was quick to respond. Its chief executive Miles Beale welcomed the government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision to freeze duty on spirits, but deplored the increase in wine duty. The decision by the chancellor to increase wine rates significantly is a hammer blow to this great British industry. It actively undermines a sector that has been hardest hit since the Brexit Referendum and will be thoroughly unwelcome for the 33 million consumers of the nation\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s most popular alcoholic drink. This inflationary rise is grossly unfair, unjustified and counter-productive. The UK is the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest wine trading nation and, as such, deserves government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s support, not punishment. The wine industry is, unfortunately, no stranger to harsh treatment from chancellors. Since 2012 wine overtook beer as the largest contributor to the public purse through duty payments, and no alcoholic drink has paid more to the Treasury since then. The chancellor has pledged a \u00c2\u00a3675m high street fund and business rates to be cut by a third to help embattled high street retailers. Paul Clement, head of place shaping at property group Savills, says: We are very pleased that the chancellor has recognised the need to extend an essential lifeline to the British high street. Business rate relief alongside a new fund for local authorities to redevelop and transform town centres are just some of the key recommendations made by Savills as part of the evidence submitted to the Housing Communities and Local Government Committee\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s (HCLGC) latest government inquiry. Creating places where people want, rather than need to be, can only be achieved through this kind of systemic change. Earlier, Hammond said we are at a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153pivotal moment\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in the Brexit talks. If we get it right, there will be a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153double Brexit dividend\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. More investment, currently on hold, will come on stream, and the Treasury will no longer have to hold back money. But the chancellor also said he was increasing the amount of spending for no deal planning to \u00c2\u00a32bn. Markets shrugged off the comments... As to whether the budget commitments are funded whether there is a Brexit deal or not, as No. 10 said today, the chancellor suggested the opposite yesterday. The new UK growth forecasts from the Office for Budget Responsibility, announced by Philip Hammond in his budget speech a few minutes ago, are higher than in March but still dismal. Paul Johnson, director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies, tweeted: The speech has had little impact on markets so far. The FTSE 100 index is about 105 points ahead at 7045.42, a 1.5% gain. The pound still 0.2% lower against the dollar at $1.2805, and flat against the euro at \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.1242. In other news, easyJet now expects to be flying electric plans by 2030, pushing back its forecast from 2027, but expressed confidence about a technology that is expected to cut the energy costs of a plane by 30%. The low-cost carrier\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chief executive Johan Lundgren told Reuters: We can definitely see a way forward in how we will get this aircraft into the fleet. EasyJet has a partnership with US start-up Wright Electric, which is working on an electric engine for a nine-seater plane that will fly next year, following success with a two-seater, and will also start working on a 50-seater version. The goal is to build battery-propelled aircraft for flights of less than two hours. More importantly, the chancellor has echoed Theresa May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s comments that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the era of austerity is finally coming to an end\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. You can follow the budget speech more closely at our budget live blog: Hammond says the last time a UK budget was presented on a Monday was in 1962, when he was six. He recalls that his parents turned to him and said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Philip, one day that could be you.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd And we are off. Philip Hammond has started his budget speech. With the UK budget just a couple of minutes away, let\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s take a quick look at the markets. All the major indices are in the green. On Wall Street, the Dow Jones rose as much as 300 points and is now trading 175 points higher, or 0.7%, at 24,867.62 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c compared with the 27,000 all-time highs at the beginning of the month. The eurozone has shrugged off Angela Merkel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision not to seek re-election as CDU party leader. Markets took comfort from her intention to stay on as chancellor until the next German federal election in 2021. Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax is 1.8% ahead at 11,405.95. Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MiB has rocketed 2.4% as S&amp;P kept Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s credit rating unchanged, while the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s battle with the EU over its budget continues. Rome was last week given three weeks to rewrite its draft budget. As for the FTSE, it is trading over 100 points higher at 7051.32, a 1.6% gain. The pound is feeling the pressure of the budget, slipping back under $1.281 against the dollar, down 0.2%. John Flint, the chief executive of HSBC, Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest bank, reckons that the murder of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi is unlikely to hurt Saudi Arabia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ability to attract foreign investors. Flint said this morning: I understand the emotion around the story but it is very difficult to think about disengaging from Saudi Arabia, given its importance to global energy markets. Flint was one of several banking chief executives who pulled out of a major investment conference in Riyadh last week, along with Tidjane Thiam of Credit Suisse, Bill Winters of Standard Chartered and Jamie Dimon of JPMorgan Chase. However, Samir Assaf, the head of HSBC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s global banking and markets, attended the event. While most western business leaders shunned it, the kingdom managed to get $50bn of deals signed at the investment conference. Flint said: My decision [to pull out] was not an easy decision but I felt it was the right thing to do under the circumstances. But he defended the bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision to send a less high-profile figure to the conference: We are the biggest foreign bank in Saudi Arabia, so we own 40% of the Saudi British Bank, we have 4,000 employees in the kingdom and we have many customers in the kingdom as well so we have a responsibility to them. Flint hinted at future investment in the Middle East, saying: We are a significant part of the banking system in many parts of the region \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 We will build our businesses as the opportunities arise. Here is our full story on the HSBC results, out earlier today. Poland\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s foreign minister Jacek Czaputowicz said today that Merkel plays an important role in stabilising the European Union, and expressed support for her to stay on as chancellor. Merkel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision not to seek re-election as CDU party chairwoman which means her fourth term as chancellor will be her last heralds the end of an era in which she has dominated European politics. She became Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chancellor in 2005. The race for a successor to Merkel at the top of the CDU has already started. This morning, three candidates announced their ambitions: Party secretary-general Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer Health minister Jens Spahn Former parliamentary leader when Merkel started as party chair, Friedrich Merz Carsten Brzeski, chief economist at ING Germany, says the key question is will the new CDU leader move to the political right again or continue Merkel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s strategy of capturing the political centre. Merkel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s announcement remains less of a risk for the German government than the SPD\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s losses in the last elections. The CDU has no interest in Merkel stepping down as chancellor or a snap election before any successor has been able to build up a profile. The SPD, however, remains in an existential crisis which could easily lead to the decision to leave the coalition next year. As historic as today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s announcement is, the approaching end of an era also holds the potential for positive developments. Not so much because new is always better but rather because it could give Merkel the freedom and the tailwind - freed from party ties - to put a final stamp on her legacy, possibly with bolder steps to reform the German economy and the monetary union. Three years of a lame duck government would clearly be harmful, not only for Europe but also for Germany. Somehow, the announced end is typical for the entire era Merkel: unpretentiously pulling the strings. Stefan Koopman, market economist at Rabobank, notes that after the initial shock caused by Merkel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s announcement, the market reaction has been relatively muted as she also said she would like to see her term through to 2021. The CDU is suffering heavy losses in state elections and the opinion polls indicate there is no improvement in sight. It will now be increasingly difficult for her to stay on as Chancellor, and having shown signs of weakness, the wolves may come for her sooner rather than later. Germany has been a cradle of political stability over the last decade, but this now looks to be over. Ms Merkel has been a driving force in Europe, leading the response to major political and economic upheaval like the Eurozone debt crisis. What now remains to be seen is whether her CDU successor has the political will and gravitas on the European stage to hold it together in these testing times. With Brexit imminent and growing controversy around the Italian government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s spending plans, there couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be a worse time for Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s steady ship to hit choppy waters. This implies more financial market volatility going forward and is another reason to remain bearish about the euro. More on Angela Merkel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision to step down as CDU party chair but stay on as Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chancellor until the next national election in 2021. She has argued against splitting the two roles in the past... Her move comes after disastrous regional elections in Hesse and Bavaria for her Christian Democrats and their Bavarian sister party, the CSU. Holger Schmieding, economist at Berenberg Bank, says Her first step towards the exit adds to the risk that her coalition partner SPD will walk out of the Berlin coalition in late 2019 upon a mid-term review of the government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s agenda. If Merkel were to lose her position as chancellor, the most likely outcome would be a CDU/CSU-Green-FDP coalition in Berlin led by somebody else from the CDU or - as a slightly less likely alternative - new elections. Here are the main contenders for the CDU leadership: Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer, the CDU general secretary, appears to be Merkel\u00e2\u20ac\u02dcs preferred choice Armin Laschet, prime minister of North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s most populous state, whose experience would make him well suited to lead a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Jamaica\u00e2\u20ac\u0153 coalition with the Greens and the FDP Jens Spahn, the more conservative minister for health Friedrich Merz, a conservative who once was Merkel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rival and is reportedly ready to re-enter frontline politics. Other candidates with fewer chances are: Peter Altmaier, the economy minister, Daniel G\u00c3\u00bcnther, the state prime minister of Schleswig Holstein and Julia Kl\u00c3\u00b6ckner, the minister of agriculture. On Wall Street, the Dow Jones climbed about 200 points at the open to 24,922.34, a gain of almost 1%. Wall Street is also expected to rally when trading begins shortly..... European stock markets are pushing higher, as traders try to put the nightmare of October behind then. The FTSE 100 is now up 126 points, or 1.8%, as it bounces back from last week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s seven-month low. Fiona Cincotta of City Index explains: Strong earnings from banks and positive company news boosted European markets helping them to shrug of the gloom emanating from Asia. HSBC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s strong results this morning certainly seem to have cheered the City; its shares are now up almost 6%. Markets are up across Europe - bringing some relief to investors, after hitting their lowest levels since December 2016 last week. Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s DAX index has jumped by over 2%, led by those car companies. Traders are clearly more excited by Chinese tax cuts than Angela Merkel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s political future.... In Milan, there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s mild jubilation that S&amp;P didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t downgrade Italy on Friday night. Dean Popplewell of trading firm OANDA explains: Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 10-year BTP bond yield has fallen to a one-week low this morning, narrowing the gap to the German Bund, on relief that ratings agency Standard &amp; Poor\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s left the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s credit rating unchanged. Shares in European carmakers are surging, thanks to a report that China is considering halving the sales tax on most vehicles. The move would help Beijing spur auto sales, as it tries to protect its economy from the chill winds of the US trade war. Bloomberg has more details: The country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s top economic planning body submitted a plan to key policymakers to lower the purchase tax to 5 percent for passenger vehicles with engines no bigger than 1.6 liters, according to people familiar with the matter. No decision has been made on implementation, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the information isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t public. European car shares have jumped by over 4%, including by Volkswagen (+5.6%), Daimler (+4.6%) and BMW (+4.1%). Elsewhere in the eurozone, Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock market is flying after S&amp;P left the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s credit rating unchanged on Friday night. The FTSE MIB has leapt by 2.5%, and Italian government bonds are also rallying. BREAKING: In a major development, Angela Merkel has decided not to stand for re-election as the chair of her CDU party in December. Merkel took her decision after an election drubbing over the weekend, which saw voters in Hesse abandon the CDU in favour of the Green party and the anti-immigrant Alternative f\u00c3\u00bcr Deutschland (AfD). This could trigger a battle to succeed Merkel as Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chancellor, a job she\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s held since 2005 (and isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t giving up yet...) Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Reuters\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s take: German Chancellor Angela Merkel has told leaders of her Christian Democrats (CDU) that she will not seek re-election as party chairwoman at a conference in early December, a senior party source said. Merkel has been CDU chairwoman since 2000 and giving up the role would start a race within the party to succeed her as chancellor. The euro has promptly fallen by 0.4% to \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.138. Support for the CDU in Hesse fell by 10 percentage points since the last election in 2013 - a major snub by voters. Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s left-wing SPD party, who are in coalition with the CDU, also performed badly in Hesse, fuelling speculation that the coalition could collapse. More here: European stock markets are all showing gains this morning. Bank stocks are up, following HSBC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s strong results, along with healthcare groups and industrial companies. Banking giant HSBC is pulling the London stock market higher, after growing its profits sharply. HSBC shares have leapt by 4% in early trading, after beating City expectations this morning. The bank posted a 16% year-on-year rise in adjusted pre-tax profits to $6.19bn, ahead of its previous forecasts. Revenues rose 8.8% to $13.8bn, as its investment banking and wealth management divisions enjoyed a strong quarter. Three-quarters of HSBC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s profits came from Asia. This has lifted the FTSE 100 up to 7002 points, up 62 points. Laith Khalaf, senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153HSBC may be the second biggest company on the UK stock market, but its profits are predominantly emanating from its historic home in the far east. Three quarters of the bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s profits so far this year have come from its Asian operations, leaving the European business trailing in its wake. Profit growth has been broad-based across HSBC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s main banking activities, and what\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s positive is that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s coming from a rising top line rather than simply cost-cutting, which can only deliver results for so long. Indeed adjusted operating costs have actually ticked up, though that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s to support investment in growth opportunities, notably in the bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s digital proposition. As an international retail and commercial bank, HSBC is clearly plugged into the global economy, and in particular the fortunes of China and the surrounding area. While in the long term this looks like an ace in the sleeve, investors should expect a bumpy journey, particularly if Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade war dents growth in the region.\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Last week the US stock markets fell into correction territory, after several heavyweight companies posted disappointing results: David Madden, market analyst at CMC Markets, says last week was grim: Global stock markets had a terrible time last week as investor sentiment continued to sour. Concerns about higher interest rates in the US, along with political uncertainty in Italy as well as geopolitical concerns played on investors\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 minds. Last week, Amazon and Alphabet both released quarterly figures and the revenue components missed market estimates and that added to the decline. The major US indices enjoyed a positive run over the summer, and there was a sense that valuations were lofty, particularly for the tech sector. The S&amp;P 500 is now in correction territory, which means it had fallen more than 10% from the recent peak, and this underlines how large the correction has been. The Shanghai Composite lost over 2% overnight after China confirmed that industrial profit fell for the fifth straight month. Financial blogger Jeroen Blokland says a range of factors have hurt the markets this month. However, that doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t mean we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re facing a repeat of the 2008 crisis. He writes: This chart by Bloomberg shows that global equities have lost almost USD 8 trillion in market cap in October, the worst sell-off since 2008. However, the absolute numbers can be deceptive as the total market capitalization has increased by roughly 50% since start of the financial crisis. But more importantly, while there are definitely a number of factors that are negatively impacting markets (China-US trade war, rising geopolitical risk, Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s massive debt pile \u00e2\u20ac\u201c to name just a few), current economic circumstances make it less likely that a crisis like the one in in 2008 will happen now. Of course, things could change quickly, especially if market sentiment remains as depressed as it is now, but this might be a good moment to take a step back and refocus on the fundamentals. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s losses in China suggest markets have further to fall, warns Hussein Sayed, chief market strategist at foreign exchange broker FXTM: The steep sell-off in U.S. equity markets suggests October could be the worst month since the global financial crisis of 2008. Seven trillion dollars have already been wiped from the global market cap, and still there are no signs of bulls returning. Chinese stocks fell today with the CSI 300 declining more than 3% while the Yuan remained trading near a decade low. The Nikkei 225 gave up gains of more than 1% to trade in negative territory. Moving against the trend were stocks in Australia, with the ASX 200 gaining more than 1% supported by the healthcare and telecom sectors. The bears seem well in control of the market and there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re many reasons to justify their actions. Whether it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s weakening global economic growth, the ongoing U.S.-China trade war, monetary policy tightening, fears of a hard Brexit, Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s budget woes\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 and the list goes on. What is more interesting is that investors are even punishing companies that have reported positive earnings surprises. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. October has been a pretty brutal month for the markets. Over the last four weeks, trillions of dollars of value have been wiped off bonds and shares, as nervous investors have sold up. Bloomberg estimates that $8 trillion has been \u00e2\u20ac\u02dclost\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, amid fears over US interest rate hikes, the US-China trade war, Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s budget row and Brexit. That would make October the worst month in a decade, since the collapse of Lehman Brothers. They say: Equities globally have lost almost $8 trillion of value this month, set for the biggest wipeout since the height of the financial crisis a decade ago on concerns ranging from the peak being past for earnings growth to the U.S.-China trade war to the end of central bank quantitative easing. Traders are paring wagers on Fed rate hikes for next year, with markets now expecting fewer than two quarter-point increases in 2019, compared with three that policy makers project. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s room for a bit of a downside to go, because I do see this as being largely a structural shift in markets,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Kyle Rodda, a market analyst at IG Group in Melbourne, said on Bloomberg Television. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Sentiment is still to the downside, is still quite bearish and there will be a little while for this correction to play out.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The new week has begun badly in China, where the Shanghai stock market has fallen over 2% today. However, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a brighter picture in Europe. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE 100 had jumped by 36 points, or 0.5%, after hitting a seven-month low on Friday night. Perhaps the extra hour\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sleep has cheered traders up a bit. Also coming up today. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Budget Day in the UK. Chancellor Philip Hammond is expected to announce that the public finances aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t as bad as previously thought, clearing the way for more spending on the NHS, help for UK high streets, money to build roads and fix potholes, He could also tighten pension relief limits (taking money from higher earners) and raise income tax personal allowances (handing money back to them). We also get new consumer credit and mortgage approvals figures from the Bank of England The agenda: 9.30am GMT: UK mortgage approvals and consumer credit figures 3.30pm GMT: The Budget speech",

                "bodyText":"UK retail sales growth slowed significantly in October as British consumers reined in their spending after a summer spree fuelled by warm weather and the World Cup, according to the latest industry figures. The latest snapshot from the Confederation of British Industry showed retail sales growth dropped to the weakest level since April, while separate government figures showed an increasing number of UK companies entering insolvency as trading conditions remain tough on the high street. The CBI\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s monthly retail sales index fell further than expected to +5 in October from a reading of +23 in September, missing analysts\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 estimates for a smaller decline in consumer spending. The details from the survey of 104 firms, of which 45 were retailers, show sales volumes were significantly below average for the time of year, and that online shopping was the only sector to record increasing sales volumes. The figures come after the chancellor, Philip Hammond, announced tax breaks on business rates for smaller shops in the budget on Monday, with reductions on rates by a third for up to 90% of retail properties. The budget also contained measures to impose a digital services tax on large US technology companies including Google, Facebook and Amazon, which he said was to ensure \u00e2\u20ac\u0153these global giants with profitable businesses in the UK pay their fair share\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. High streets have come under growing pressure as an increasing number of consumers shop online, while sluggish wage growth and high levels of inflation have constrained their spending power. Statistics from the Insolvency Service, a government agency, showed the biggest rise in company insolvencies since the depths of the financial crisis, which analysts said was connected to the struggles on the high street. It recorded a 19.3% year-on-year rise in the third quarter, the biggest increase since the second quarter of 2009, when Britain was still struggling to emerge from a recession. Nick Levine, the head of enterprise at the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales, said it was likely the tough trading conditions and the economic climate were having an impact. He suggested the slowing growth in the number of EU migrants since the Brexit vote could also have had an impact. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It is not only high street stores suffering. The hospitality industry is also seeing an increasing amount of businesses go insolvent,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said. Duncan Swift, the vice-president of R3, the insolvency and restructuring trade body, said it was the first time more than 4,000 corporate insolvencies had been recorded in a single quarter since the start of 2014. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153For every struggling retailer unable to pay its debts, there will be numerous suppliers as well as shop-fitting or delivery firms who come under pressure,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said.

October is traditionally a difficult month for equities but the FTSE shedding 4.8% is a significantly larger drop than what we would normally expect.

Of the geopolitical issues which have be weighing on the market, namely Brexit, the Italian standoff with Brussels over spending, the US \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Sino trade war or the slowing global, none have been resolved and we also have the US mid-term elections thrown into the mix. </p> <p>Gains were broad based on the FTSE with Standard Chartered a notable riser following impressive results with profits surging 37% on last year. Standard Chartered reported a pre-tax profit of $1.06 billion, up from $774 million a year before and 9% ahead of estimates. By focusing on what is does best \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Asia \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the bank has managed to sharpen its competitive edge.

Fundamentals are still strong but there are questions about earnings growth from here.</p> </blockquote> <p> So, if the US-China trade war pushes prices up (inflationary), and US wage growth picks up (also inflationary), does the Federal Reserve keep hiking? Or does it hold off, to protect asset prices?</p> <p>Wilson says:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The stock market is telling the Fed to stop raising rates. Janet Yellen has come out to urge the Fed to keep to its course, but the signs are the equity market is highly susceptible to a more aggressive course of hiking. The Fed has been here before \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the question is do we get 1998 Greenspan Fed that listens to the equity market, or 2007/08 Bernanke Fed?

                "bodyText":"Be gone, October! Wall Street has closed for the day, and the month, with a two-day rally. The Dow and the S&amp;P 500 had both gained around 1% as the closing bell rang. The Nasdaq jumped by 2%, driven by the revival in FAANG stocks. Slightly worryingly, the rally did soften in the last few minutes (like a chocolate in the warm hand of a trick-or-treater). And the monthly losses are still alarming. The S&amp;P fell almost 7% in October, its worst month since 2011. The Dow shed 5%, its roughest month since January 2016. The Nasdaq had a real month to forget, down over 9% in its worst month since November 2008. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s an up-sum of today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trading in London, from Fiona Cincotta of City Index: The FTSE rallied for a third straight session on Wednesday despite a stronger pound, jumping 115 points after a dismal October. October is traditionally a difficult month for equities but the FTSE shedding 4.8% is a significantly larger drop than what we would normally expect. How the beginning of November pans out will be interesting. Of the geopolitical issues which have be weighing on the market, namely Brexit, the Italian standoff with Brussels over spending, the US \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Sino trade war or the slowing global, none have been resolved and we also have the US mid-term elections thrown into the mix. Gains were broad based on the FTSE with Standard Chartered a notable riser following impressive results with profits surging 37% on last year. Standard Chartered reported a pre-tax profit of $1.06 billion, up from $774 million a year before and 9% ahead of estimates. By focusing on what is does best \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Asia \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the bank has managed to sharpen its competitive edge. Costs have been a concern in previous years, but the bank has shown its capabilities at reigning these in. Next fell following lacklustre results. The bellwether dropped close to 3% after results underwhelmed. The retailer confirmed that in store sales fell further in the third quarter, whilst overall sales grew by 2% thanks to a strong performance in online sales. Back in New York, tech shares are still on a tear - pushing the Nasdaq up by almost 3% today. By my maths, that still leaves the Nasdaq down 8% for the month. Good news: October is over, at least for traders in Europe. Better news: European stock markets have all ended today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s session higher, clawing back some of this month\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s losses. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the closing prices: UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE 100: UP 92 points or 1.3% at 7,128 Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s DAX: UP 160 points or 1.4% at 11,447 France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s CAC: UP 51 points of 2.3% at 5,093 That still means European stocks have lost around 5% of their value this month. Could the worst be over? Possibly, but it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s worth noting that nothing has really changed. All the factors blamed for the sell-off - from US interest rate policy to the Italian budget row - are in place. On the other hand, maybe there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s relief that the earnings season hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t been worse. Neil Wilson of Markets.com has a good take: Earnings are not universally strong and outlooks have betrayed some murkiness. But, on the whole, we have more companies beating earnings estimates than missing, and more than the average. Fundamentals are still strong but there are questions about earnings growth from here. So, if the US-China trade war pushes prices up (inflationary), and US wage growth picks up (also inflationary), does the Federal Reserve keep hiking? Or does it hold off, to protect asset prices? Wilson says: The stock market is telling the Fed to stop raising rates. Janet Yellen has come out to urge the Fed to keep to its course, but the signs are the equity market is highly susceptible to a more aggressive course of hiking. The Fed has been here before \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the question is do we get 1998 Greenspan Fed that listens to the equity market, or 2007/08 Bernanke Fed? October was a horrid month despite the gains of the last two days. We could see seasonal factors support further gains into the year-end but the primary trend could remain bearish.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The Dow is holding onto its gains, now up 286 points (+1.15%) at 25,160 points. Wall Street traders are doing their best to end October on a positive note. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decent results from GM, and strong ADP jobs figures, seem to be helping. October\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s volatility probably won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t spook the Federal Reserve out of raising US interest rates again in December. Capital Economics expect Fed chair Jay Powell will pave the way for a pre-Christmas hike, arguing: Although the Fed is unlikely to make any policy changes at next week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meeting, we expect the statement to reiterate the FOMC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s plan to continue gradually raising interest rates, with the next move coming in December. With the latest data showing that activity has continued to expand at a rapid pace, hopes that the recent plunge in the stock market will prompt a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcPowell put\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 are likely to prove misplaced. The US dollar is also surging today, making gains against emerging market currencies such as the Brazilian real and the Turkish lira. Last night, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg hailed the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcStories\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 product as a key future source of growth, and admitted Facebook has reached saturation point in \u00e2\u20ac\u0153developed countries\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Facebook missed analyst forecasts for revenue growth (despite pulling in 33% more than a year ago), but smashed forecasts for earnings. Wall Street is giving Facebook the thumbs-up today, with Royal Bank of Canada providing a list of five reasons to be bullish: Facebook stills owns two of the largest media assets in the world (Facebook and Instagram) and the two largest messaging assets in the world (Messenger &amp; WhatsApp); Our checks and management commentary suggest no material change in Marketer views of the attractiveness of Facebook platforms; Monetization of core Facebook and Instagram assets still has material upside potential and Messenger and WhatsApp are beginning early stages of monetization; Facebook\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s aggressive investments are improving platform security and creating future revenue streams; Even under pressure, Facebook\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s producing impressive growth.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Richard Dickie Hodges, Manager of Nomura Global Dynamic Bond fund, blames US interest rate rise fears for October\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s market slump. Getting firmly into the Halloween spirit, he writes: \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcThe Federal Reserve remains the biggest, scariest vampire in the markets today. As it sucks the life-blood of investment markets with interest rate rises, the so-called \u00e2\u20ac\u0153risk-free rate\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd becomes more attractive, the cost of funding risk rises and all risky assets must adjust to offer higher returns. In other words, they must sell off. \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcBut our Nosferatu is a complex villain \u00e2\u20ac\u201c it cares deeply for its victim. As rates climb, it forces volatility into the stock markets, especially emerging markets with US dollar funding requirements that fear the higher greenback. It is this volatility that may cause the Fed to slow or pause the blood-letting in 2019.\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Halloween is a time for fangs, so it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s appropriate that the FAANG stocks are rallying in New York. With Facebook now up 6.8%, Netflix also up 6.8%, Amazon up 4% and Alphabet up over 3.1%, technology stocks are in demand. But this treat comes after a very tricky October, which saw tech stocks slump by around 10% during the month. Microsoft is leading the Dow\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rally, up 3%, followed by credit card firm VISA (+2.7%), industrial equipment firm Caterpillar (+2.4%) and Apple (+2.1%). There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a Happy Halloween spirit on the New York stock exchange, as the final trading day of a brutal October kicks off. The Dow Jones industrial average has leapt by 251 points, or 1%, to 25,125. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s on top of Tuesday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 400-point leap, and might cheer spirits on Wall Street. But it won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t fix October\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bad losses on its own. The Nasdaq index has surged by 1.6%, as technology stocks rally. Facebook shares have jumped by 5%, as investors show they like last night\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s results from the social network giant. General Motors have surged by 6%, after beating profit and revenue estimates today. European markets are still sharply higher, as traders prepare for Wall Street to open.... Global stock markets is up 0.6% already today, thanks to gains in Asia and Europe. The MSCI All Country World Index has risen to 481.03 points, up from 478 last night. But October has still been a pretty horrific month for stocks. The ACWI ended September at 524 points, meaning it has lost over 8% this month. In points terms, this looks like the biggest destruction of value since the financial crisis of 2008. In percentage terms, it looks like the worst month since May 2012 (when the ACWI fell from 328 points to 297, down 9.4%). The US president reckons shares are going up again today... Boom! The FTSE 100 just nudged a new three-week high after a strong morning\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trading. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s blue-chip index is now up 113 points, or almost 1.67%, at 7153 points, as traders try to shake off their October blues. Mining groups such as Antofagasta and Glencore are among the top risers, along with equipment rental firm Ashtead and banking group Standard Chartered (after its strong results this morning). Retailers are struggling, though, after Next reported slower growth this morning. Remember: The FTSE 100 started the month over 7,500 points, so it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s still down 5% this month alone. Connor Campbell of SpreadEx says traders are hoping for peace in the global trade wars: The unspooked celebrations continued on Wednesday, the markets wringing all they can from Donald Trump commenting on Tuesday that a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcgreat deal\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 with China is on its way, undoing some of the renewed trade war fears that had hit on Monday night. With basically every major sector in the green \u00e2\u20ac\u201c spare a thought for Next, languishing at the bottom of the index following its latest high street woes \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the FTSE could jump more than 100 points as the day progressed. That lifted it above 7150 for the first time in 3 weeks, the index scraping off the top layer of October\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s losses while coming nowhere close to mounting a full on recovery. Another reason for optimism: Canada\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy expanded by 0.1% in August, a better performance than expected. Newsflash: American companies took on staff at a healthy pace this month. US firms created 227,000 new jobs this month, beating expectations of 189,000 fresh hires. Services companies led the way, expanding their payrolls by 189,000 to the total while construction and manufacturing firms both hired 17,000 new workers. That suggests the US economy remains robust, and could mean this Friday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Non-Farm Payroll (employment report) is strong too. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a little early for 2019 market predictions, but we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll make an exception for this one: It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a Happy Halloween for carmaker General Motors, which has just smashed Wall Street expectations. GM has also raised expectations for the months ahead, which should cheer US investors. Reuters has the details: General Motors on Wednesday posted far stronger-than-expected quarterly profit and said its full-year earnings forecast would come in at the high end of its forecast due to strong demand in North America. The Detroit automaker reported third-quarter net income of $2.53 billion, or $1.75 a share, compared with a loss last year of $2.98 billion, or $2.03 a share. Last year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s quarter included a charge related to Europe. Excluding one-time items, GM earned $1.87 a share in the third quarter, easily beating the $1.25 analysts polled by Refinitiv estimates had expected. Revenue in the quarter rose 6.4 percent to $35.8 billion, above the $34.85 billion analysts had expected. A quick catch-up on the markets: Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE 100: Up 105 points or 1.5% at 7141, a 3-week high Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Stoxx 600: Up 5 points or 1.6% at 361, a nine-day high Japan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Nikkei: Closed 463 points higher at 21,920, up 2.16% China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Shanghai Composite index: Closed 35 points higher at 2,602, up 1.35% The latest inflation data has given eurozone policymakers a Halloween headache. Consumer prices across the single-currency bloc rose by 2.2% this month, the fastest rate since 2014, up from 2.1% in September Core inflation, which measures underlying price pressures, jumped to 1.1% from 0.9% a month ago. That suggests the European Central Bank is right to rein in its stimulus plans, and halt bond-buying at the end of 2018. However, we learned yesterday that the eurozone economy slowed sharply over the summer -- which might mean more stimulus is needed. Separately, unemployment rate across the eurozone was unchanged last month at 8.1%. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the joint-lowest rate in a decade, but also much higher than America (3.7%) and the UK (4%). It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a grim day for UK butchers chain Crawshaw Group. The supplier of sausages, chops, joints and pies is falling into administration. This puts 600 jobs at risk across 54 stores, which could close unless a buyer can be found. My colleague Julia Kollewe explains: The Yorkshire-based company, which was founded in 1954, has been talking to investors over the past month but has failed to raise the funds it needed. It expects to appoint administrators later on Wednesday who will then try to find buyers for the business and its assets. Crawshaw has 42 high street stores and 12 factory outlet stores across the Midlands and the north of England. Full marks to the Bond Vigilante\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s team at M&amp;G, who have produced some spooktacular charts today. The first shows the remorseless march of US student debt, which has tripled over the last decade. Laura Frost, fixed interest investment specialist at M&amp;G, says this debt burden can undermine the wider economy. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153US Federal Reserve (Fed) Chairman Jerome Powell recently warned about the ever-increasing amount of US student debt outstanding: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153You do stand to see longer-term negative effects on people who can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t pay off their student loans. It hurts their credit rating, it impacts the entire half of their economic life.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Student debt also impacts the overall economy: as graduates seek to repay their loans, they are forced to make concessions to their financial consumption, leading to an ever-growing drag on the economy. They buy fewer goods and services and are delayed in joining the housing ladder, with many choosing (or having) to rent instead. On top of this, student debt sees the highest 90+ day delinquency rate of all US consumer credit.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Readers of a nervous disposition should take a deep breath, before looking at the next chart -- the interest rate on longterm US bonds. After falling steadily for decades, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s started going up! Frost explains why it matters: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The long-end of the US Treasury market has often been described as a giant anaconda: it draws little attention as it sleeps most of the time, but the minute it wakes up, everybody around shakes. US 30-year bonds don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t bite, but their moves can be as poisonous as they basically determine millions of mortgage rates, as well as the price that governments and companies around the world pay for debt. The 30-year Treasury yield has remained within the support and resistance level shown for over 30 years, rallying 6% over the period and giving investors a long bull run. Does the recent breach through this level mean that the anaconda is beginning to stir?\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Finally, a picture that might scare Donald Trump - it shows how US central bankers have struggled to maintain full employment, without triggering a recession. Frost explains: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153With US unemployment at rock-bottom levels and the stock market at near record highs, the Fed has begun hiking rates in an attempt to engineer a soft landing: it wants to slow the economy enough to avoid an overheating, but not so much that it causes a recession. How many times over the past 70 years has the Fed successfully managed to do this and return unemployment (green line) back up to its natural level (blue line) without a recession ensuing (vertical bars)? You\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be scared after counting\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The slump in Red October has dragged many global stock markets into negative territory for this year. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a selection of the best and worst performers in 2018: Bovespa Stock Index (Brazil) +9.7% NASDAQ 100 +6.5% (US) Dow Jones Industrial Average (US) +0.6% S&amp;P 500 +0.3% (US) Nikkei 225 (Japan) -3.7% CAC 40 (Paris) -4.5% FTSE 100 (UK) -7.3% DAX Xetra (Germany) -11.4% Hang Seng (Hong Kong) -16.5% SSE Composite (China) -22.3% But there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s still time for a turnaround. Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell, says: The markets are racing ahead following a very good session last night in the US where the S&amp;P, Nasdaq and Dow Jones all posted gains in excess of 1.5%. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s now the turn of European and Asian stocks to join the rally with the FTSE 100 shooting up 1.5% in early trading on Wednesday and Japan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Nikkei 225 index jumping 2.2%. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The latest rally means the S&amp;P, NASDAQ and Dow Jones are all back in positive territory for the year. The only other major index to share this status is Brazil\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Bovespa index, up 9.7% so far this year. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The upturn in the market is positive for investors, although the main UK indices still have some way to go before they get back into the black. The FTSE 100 is currently down 7.3% year-to-date, and the FTSE 250 down 8.7%. Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets, says markets may be turning the corner, after a rough October: Asia markets managed to close out the month of October and post their second consecutive day of gains in what has been a pretty poor month for equity markets in general. This rebound could well be down to some end of month position adjusting, however there have been some indications in the past few days that we might be starting to see a bit of a short term base, with most of the bad news already priced in to some extent. American\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get enough of Halloween, so Wall Street is eager to join today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rally. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the pre-market calls from CMC Markets: Dow Jones is expected to open 136 points higher at 25,010 S&amp;P500 is expected to open 18 points higher at 2,700 The FTSE 100 is continuing to push higher. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s now up 115 points, or 1.6% to 7150. Nearly every sector is up, led by manufacturers, energy firms, tech stocks and banks: Here are the top risers on the Footsie this morning However, this still leaves the FTSE 100 nursing a 5% loss for October (it started the month at 7,510). Despite today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Halloween rally, global markets are still on track for their worst month since the financial crisis. Figures calculated earlier this week showed that $8 trillion had been wiped off global stocks in October. Trade wars, the slowdown in China, tensions in the eurozone and Brexit have all encouraged investors to ditch risky stocks. Naeem Aslam of Think Markets says: Smart money is running for the hill and this was the message which October brought for the global equity market. Global stocks lost over $8 trillion in October, a headline which suits the best on the Halloween day. Investors are refusing to be spooked on Halloween, says Connor Campbell of SpreadEX: With October containing as much red as the goriest of slasher flicks, the markets oddly chose to rebound on what would have been an entirely calendar-appropriate day to continue the month\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trading horrors. Building on Tuesday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s gains, the FTSE shot up 1.3% after the bell, allowing the index to cross 7100 for the first time in 3 weeks. It benefited from the market-wide shift in sentiment, which itself came despite further evidence that the trade war is hurting the Chinese economy, as the country suffered a slide in manufacturing activity. Overnight, China got the shivers, as manufacturing activity fell and the yuan was fixed at a new 10-year low to the dollar. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rally is welcome, but it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not enough to wipe out this month\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s losses. October has been particularly bad for US investors, with the main indices falling sharply. CNBC has crunched the numbers, and explains: After Tuesday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s comeback, the Dow is down 5.9 percent this month, still its worst performance since August 2015. The S&amp;P 500 is off by 7.9 percent in October, on track for its worst month since May 2010. On Monday, the S&amp;P 500 closed in correction territory, down 10.2 percent from its record. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Obviously we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re in a correction phase of the stock market and I think investors have to realize that,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Bruce Bittles, chief investment strategist at Baird. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The monetary environment has changed. As you can see, even with a 10 percent change in the stock markets, interest rates have barely moved lower.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd European stocks are all jumping - fortunately not with fright. Weeeee! The FTSE 100 is flying faster than a rocket. The blue-chip index has gained 88 points, or 1.2%, to 7124, clawing back some of this month\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s losses. Bank Standard Chartered is leading the charge, up 4% after reporting that profits rose from $557m to $752m in the last quarter. Retailer Next is struggling, though, down almost 5%. Next reported that full priced shares are up 2% year-on-year, but retail sales (at its high street stores) have plunged by 8.0% in the last quarter. Online sales growth has slowed, to just +12.7% compared to +14.8% in the year to date. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the financial markets, the world economy, the eurozone and business. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Halloween - a dark time of ritual, dressing-up, and trick-or-treating. But any children touring the City of London must make a special effort to scare investors; they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re well used to shocks and scares this month. October has been a torrid month for equities. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE 100 has shed 6% over the last 30 days, even hitting a 22-month low last week, as global markets took a collective chilly bath. If you really want to make a investor quiver, wave a chart showing how world markets have lose almost 8.5% this month, wiping out trillions of dollars of value. Craig Erlam of trading firm OANDA says there is fear on the trading floors: October has well and truly lived up to its chilling reputation, with stock markets around the globe suffering one of their worst months in recent memory. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been a wild ride for investors and there is no guarantee it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s over yet. Markets may have recovered their early losses and some indices may even be in the green for the week but volatility has not eased and that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a concern. But after a month of gory red, things might be turning. Wall Street rallied last night, with the Dow gaining more than 400 points. Stocks have strengthened in Asia too, with Japan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Nikkei gaining 2% and China up nearly 1.5%. Thea main European markets are also up in early trading. There are still reasons to hide under the bedsheets, though. Yesterday, we learned that eurozone growth has halved. Later today we get fresh unemployment and inflation figures for the eurozone. David Madden of CMC Markets says this data could set the mood for the day, and beyond: The stand-off between the Italian government and the EU continues. Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy grew 0.8% in the third-quarter on an annual basis, which was below the forecast of 0.9%. Matteo Salvini, Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s joint deputy prime minister claimed the underwhelming update is a reason the government needs to increase spending, and in turn increase the budget deficit. The Italian situation could spark another round of the eurozone debt crisis, and given that the country has the third-largest government bond market in the world, the fallout could be enormous. Dealers will be keeping an eye out for the eurozone CPI and unemployment reports which are due out at 10am (UK time). The CPI rate is tipped to be 2.2%, and the jobless rate is expected to hold steady at 8.1%.
