And in case you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re wondering what all this is about, you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re in good company ... the US economist Paul Krugman doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have a clue either. Some reaction to the Australian housing market numbers, which are quite bad. Less lending = lower house prices as one tweeter neatly up sums. But at least the number of first-time buyers is the highest for six years. The bank hearings have wound up in Canberra. In final questions, ANZ chief Shayne Elliott said fewer customers used physical banks to do their business and so ANZ plans on closing about 12 of its 650 or so branches. That follows a trend, Elliott says, which had been set over the last couple of years, with 30 to 50 branches being closed a year. Elliott now heads to his meetings with bank customers who have come to Canberra to discuss their issues with him. Next Friday, Andrew Thorburn, the head of NAB, will face the committee. The positive moves in the Chinese markets come despite the Singapore central bank announcing a tightening of monetary policy. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a sign of the times. Singapore, which manages policy through exchange rate settings rather than interest rates, noted that it expected steady growth despite the possibility of trade tensions disrupting the global outlook. Monetary Authority of Singapore said: In 2019, trade frictions between some major economies and the uncertainty they pose could weigh more discernibly on global economic activity. Barring a significant setback in global growth, the Singapore economy should expand at a pace close to potential in 2019. The Chinese markets have opened up. Hong Kong has managed a gain of 0.5% while the Shanghai Composite is up 0.16%. As far as Australia is concerned, the RBA says the economy is at risk from external shocks and says the incipient US-China trade war or a slowdown in growth in China could trigger a domestic problem. Australia would be sensitive to a sharp contraction in global growth or dislocation in global financial markets because of the importance of trade and capital inflows. A worsening in external conditions could see a downturn in the domestic economy, reduced availability and higher cost of offshore funding and falls in asset prices, with a resulting deterioration in the performance of borrowers and lenders. As for the housing market, it says it has turned a little and says it could be \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a positive development for financial stability\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd However, it could also be bad news for people who have borrowed too much and find themselves in negative equity as lending requirements tighten and house prices fall. Some existing borrowers may find they do not meet new lending standards and so have difficulty refinancing. Similarly, while most borrowers with loans transitioning from interest-only to principal and interest payments are well placed to meet the higher payments, a small share could struggle. The Reserve Bank of Australia has issued its financial stability review today. It says the rise in US interest rates blamed for the current market volatility are not causing much disruption. But it says that some risks are emerging as the Fed moves away from the low-interest environment: The extended period of low-interest rates has seen some financial stability risks emerge. Notably compensation for risk is very low with asset prices in a range of markets at high levels, underpinned by low long-term interest rates. Household, corporate and sovereign debt has also risen to high levels in some jurisdictions. For emerging market economies \u00e2\u20ac\u201c especially those with structural or cyclical vulnerabilities \u00e2\u20ac\u201c there are concerns about the implications of a tightening in financial conditions in the advanced economies. Those housing finance figures are not great news for Australia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s banks, which have built their huge profitability in recent years on some heroic mortgage lending. The financial sector of the ASX 200 is down 0.77% today in a market off 0.25% overall. Things go from bad to worse in the Australian housing market. Figures just released by the bureau of statistics show that total dwelling finance dropped by 2.1% in August to just over $30bn \u00e2\u20ac\u201c much worse than the -1% expected and a big drop on the 0.4% increase in July. Another big fall in investor lending. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s down -1.2%. On the currency markets, the yen has continued to hold up against the dollar at 112 to the greenback. A stronger yen is usually not so good for the Nikkei, which is a stronghold of Japan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s big exporters. The Aussie dollar \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a key proxy for emrging markets in the Asia Pacific region \u00e2\u20ac\u201c has also fought back during the big stock selloff, going from around US70.5 to US71.27 this morning. The Nikkei has dropped a modest amount this morning. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re currently off by 0.22%, or 50 points, at 22,541 points. The Kospi in Seoul is up 0.47%. Sydney is now down only 0.15%. Elliott also admits that ANZ\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s profits have been hit by the aftermath of the commission, explaining that the bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s return on equity has fallen from 17-18% to 11% in the past few years. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153ANZ\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s profitability is dramatically lower than it was,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he says. Labor MP Matt Keogh has scored a direct hit against ANZ boss Shayne Elliott bringing applause from the audience in Canberra, which includes people from the Bank Reform Now group. It came after the bank boss seemed to suggest that money being paid out as compensation to customers belonged to investors (\u00e2\u20ac\u0153it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s their money\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said). But Keogh said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not \u00e2\u20ac\u201c it should have been in the customer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pocket the whole time,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to which Elliott puts his hands up: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I accept that I misspoke there, fair point. The bulk of the money is not refunds actually, the bulk of the money is actually the cost of going back and finding and recalculating the money and doing the data search - that was the piece I was talking about, the cost of remediation, the work, costs significant amounts of money, that is what I was referring to \u00e2\u20ac\u201c but you are quite right, the refund money obviously belongs to customers.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd In commodities, gold has benefited from falling stocks as investors seek familiar safe havens for their money. Business Insider tells us that on Thursday gold had its best day since Brexit. Talking of Brexit, just a quick diversion here which readers might find depressing or amusing, or perhaps a bit of both. The UK transport department has announced that part of the M26 motorway in Kent will be closed while work is carried out on figuring out how to turn it into a truck park in the event of Brexit causing huge delays at the Channel ports and tunnel. You couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t make it up, as they say. More from Amy in Canberra. Shayne Elliott says he has met some ANZ customers who felt abused by the bank, and was personally answering emails from customers. He also gives his personal email to the committee and asks people to contact him directly with their concerns. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Shayne.Elliott@anz.com The committee members, including Liberal MP Trevor Evans, are giving personal cases to Elliott and asking about those customers who still say they are not receiving responses from the bank. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Every case is unique and they should expect a response,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Elliott said, who is appearing before the committee for the fourth time. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I give my commitment that I will be personally involved in the response from the bank.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd He says he won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t always be the person who speaks directly with the customer, but he makes the commitment that he \u00e2\u20ac\u0153will stay on top\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd of responding to customer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s concerns. But he also says, in terms of time frames, some of the matters are exceptionally complicated, mentioning one case which goes back to 1992. But he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meeting with more customers this afternoon - including the case Evans just raised. ANZ chief Shayne Elliott is getting his grilling from a parliamentary committee. My colleague in Canberra, Amy Remeikis is watching and says that Elliott has told the committee that renumeration had absolutely been part of the ANZ culture - which follows on from Commissioner Kenneth Hayne\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s interim report which found \u00e2\u20ac\u0153greed\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd had led to a lot of the misconduct issues. Elliott said there had been changes, and he admits, again, that he was wrong to have dismissed the need for a royal commission, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153given what has been uncovered so far.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd ANZ has engaged in misconduct and conduct falling below community standards and expectations. It is completely unacceptable that we have caused financial harm and emotional distress to our customers. He also said there was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153no pride\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd being the subject of regulator Asic\u00e2\u20ac\u2122sfocus and that it caused reputational damage and was seen as a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153major fail\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. He said \u00e2\u20ac\u0153fear\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd was a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153strong word\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd when it came to Asic, but the bank \u00e2\u20ac\u0153certainly respects Asic\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Overall, he wants you to know that the bank has changed. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The bank needs to be able to generate capital so we can fulfil our social obligations, but we need to get that balance right and we clearly failed at that in the past, and we are moving away from that. As I said, revenue, and the generic terms for \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcsales\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t been part of the group score card in the last three years, so we don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have that same middle layer, saying \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcmiddle management have a sales target, but the juniors don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t. We don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have that today. But we can certainly improve and I agree that we need to do more work in getting that balance right. Not a bad start for the ASX after yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s big moves. Losses are easing back already but it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s early days. Volatility could be the name of the game today. Jonathen Chan, market analyst, CMC Markets, thinks so, and flags today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s data (see below) as key set points:. Futures markets are pointing to a mixed start for Asia Pacific equities. Regional markets may fluctuate in a similar fashion to the overnight action in the US markets. In particular, the Australia housing finance data due this morning may influence the banking sectors, as well the appearance of senior executives at the royal commission inquiry. The Shanghai stock markets may have a chance to rebound if the trade balance data due this afternoon illustrates growth, or potentially lesser impact from the trade war. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re off. The ASX 200 has slipped 47 points or 0.8% at the open. I should say that the Australian stock market opens in Sydney at 10am local time (00.00BST) followed by Tokyo and Seoul an hour later. Then at 02.30GMT trading starts in Hong Kong and Shanghai. And in Australia this morning it is the turn of ANZ bank boss Shayne Elliott to face questioning by MPs in the wake of the damaging revelations of the banking royal commission. The inquiry has exposed a widespread culture of greed in an industry once revered for having avoided the worst ravages of the global financial crisis. Matt Comyn, the boss of the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest bank Commonwealth, was jeered from the public gallery during his apperance yesterday. If you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re reading outside Australia and you haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t followed the course of the commission, here is an excellent wrap of the preliminary findings. Aside from what happens on the markets, there is a lot of data being released today which will keep us busy. At 11.30 Sydney time (01.30BST) we have Australian mortgage lending figures for August which will speak to the state of the housing market. In July they were up 0.4% but the market forecast is -1%. The Reserve Bank of Australia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s financial stability review comes at the same time which could contain commentary on the markets. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re also expecting China trade data later which could shed some light on the state of the Chinese economy. When Europe awakes, we will get industrial production figures for the eurozone. One of the biggest talking points of the past 24 hours has been Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s comments about the Federal Reserve and interest rate hikes. The president has described the Fed as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153out of control\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd because he thinks it is increasing borrowing costs too quickly and putting pressure on the economy. Greg McKenna, the independent Australian market strategist, has this salient point: President Trump has captured the narrative by blaming the Fed for all these market ructions. But the reality is the economy his policies have overheated does need more rate hikes. Markets know that he knows that, but the Fed is the perfect foil in the run-up to the mid-terms. The New Zealand stock market is up and running. A bit like how they are among the very the first to celebrate New Year, the Kiwis are first out of the blocks for finance. The benchmark NZX-50 index is currently down about 1% after dropping 3.64% yesterday. Remarkably, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s still positive for the year, unlike most others. If you need a more in-depth catch up on a dramatic day\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trading on Wall Street, you can read the wrap by my colleague Dominic Rushe here. Good morning to everyone in Australia and Asia, and good evening to everyone else. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m Martin Farrer and I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m taking over the blogging reins from the the indefatigable Graeme Wearden. The news from here is that more falls are expected in markets across the region, but so far not as dramatic as yesterday. The ASX in Sydney is seen falling 1.1% with around the same mark expected for the Nikkei in Tokyo. But who knows where they might end up if the dramatic swings in the Dow Jones today are anything to go by. What we do know for sure is that the Aussie dollar has had a good crisis. Like Usman Khawaja, it is has risen to task and climbed nearly 1% in the past 24 hours to stand at US71.2c. A quick recap Wall Street has suffered its second day of heavy losses, as the global stock market correction continues. The Dow Jones industrial average has fallen by 2.1%, or 545 points, on top of Wednesday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 830-point tumble. The S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq indices also weakened sharply again. The sell-off followed a bruising session in Europe. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE 100 slumped by almost 2% into a correction, down 10% since its peak, while European stocks languished at a 21-month low. Italy lurched into a bear market. Earlier, Asia-Pacific markets suffered sharp losses too, with China down over 5% and Japan losing almost 4%. Traders fear fresh losses on Friday, with Australia called down another 1.1%. Economists have blamed a series of factors for the selloff, from trade war angst to rising US government borrowing costs. Neil Wilson of Markets.com argued there are five key factors: Rising bond yields \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the sharp rally last week was the cue for a sustained period of declines which culminated in yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s selloff. Now we have a lot of momentum \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the breadth of the decline \u00e2\u20ac\u201c we could see things get worse before rallying. China and trade \u00e2\u20ac\u201c we thought that Nafta was important but really the fear is that we see the Sino-US tensions get worse. Comments around currency manipulation have not helped risk sentiment. No resolution can be expected until after the mid-terms. Fears around luxury stocks and comments from LVMH on Chinese demand have raised some concerns around earnings. Italy \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the ongoing Rome-Brussels spat is keeping European investors in a risk-off stance. Fresh valuation concerns heading into earnings season A deepening row between the White House and the US Federal Reserve is also looming over the markets. Donald Trump has unleashed a series of attacks on the Fed, blaming its interest rate policy for spooking the markets. On Thursday Trump said he was \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcdisappointed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 in Fed chair Jay Powell, but insisted he didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t intend to fire him, Apprentice-style. The president explained that the strong dollar was driving shares down: It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a correction that I think is caused by the Fed and interest rates. The dollar is very strong, very powerful \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and it causes difficulty doing business. IMF chief Christine Lagarde rode to Powell\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s defence, insisting that the Fed was doing a good job. But still, Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s claim that the central bank is making a mistake has raised the pressure building on the Fed. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m now handing over to my colleague Martin Farrer who will cover developments in the Asia Pacific markets. Markets will be opening in Australia in less than three hours, followed by Tokyo and Seoul an hour after that. Traders throughout the region are braced for another rough ride. Some $50bn was wiped off values in Australia on Thursday as the benchmark ASX 200 plunged 2.74%, its worst day since February. It is set to fall 1.1% at the opening on Friday, according to futures trading. Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s attack(s) on Fed chair Jay Powell make the front of Friday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Financial Times: US and European stock markets have been a veritable sea of electronic ink today, following the overnight rout in Asia. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the damage...... Phew! Traders in New York can finally catch their breath, after another rough day. And there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s nothing to celebrate -- instead, we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re staring at big losses for the second day running. The Dow has closed down 2.1%, or 545 points lower, at 25,052, on top of Wednesday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 830-point slide. The S&amp;P 500 provisionally closed 2.06% lower, while the Nasdaq lost around 1.2%. Unless something remarkable happens in the last 10 minutes, Wall Street is going to end the day deep in the red. The Dow is having another wobble, now down 485 points at 25,119 Another twist! The Washington Post is now reporting that President Trump will meet with President Xi at the G20 meeting of world leaders next month. This is lifting Wall Street off its lows, on hopes that relations between Washington and Beijing might be melting. Things have been worse, though... The S&amp;P 500 index has had a bad day too, currently down almost 2% as market volatility spikes. Some photos from in and around Wall Street today: Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our news story about the market mayhem: The City has felt the full impact of a sell-off in global financial markets with shares in the FTSE 100 index of leading companies now more than 10% below their record peak in May. On a second day of turbulence, aftershocks from panic-selling on Wall Street rippled through Asian and European bourses as dealers took fright at trade tensions, the prospect of higher inflation and Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s attempts to put pressure on America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s central bank over interest rates. The FTSE 100 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the index of UK blue-chip shares \u00e2\u20ac\u201c closed almost 2% lower after dropping 138.81 points to 7006.93. After a closing peak of 7877 in late May, the FTSE has now lost more than 10% of its value \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the definition of a market correction. Boom! The Nasdaq has tallen into correction territory, a journey which Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE 100 travelled a few hours ago. The tech-focused index has shed 2% today, or 151 points, to 6,892. That meaning it has lost more than 10% since its record high of 7,700 at the start of this month! Nearly every one of the 30 companies which make up the Dow has lost ground today. Pharmaceuticals firm Pfizer, fast food chain McDonalds, and energy companies Chevron and Exxon are among the big fallers. Make that 500 points off the Dow! The sell-off is accelerating as we head towards the final hour of trading. Oh dear, the Dow is taking another leg downwards in afternoon trading. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s now shed 424 points, or 1.66%, 25,174 points. That means the Dow has lost more than 1,200 points since the start of trading yesterday - a reminder that what went up can come down rather abruptly.... Fast FT points out that mining stocks have had a particularly bad 2018: That partly reflects concerns over economic growth prospects, especially if a protracted trade war rumbles on. More drama in the markets, this time involving Turkey: Donald Trump regularly hailed the stock market boom as a sign that he was dong a good job. Now shares are falling, he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s determined to pin the blame on the Federal Reserve. Bloomberg suspects the president has a motive.... Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s criticisms mark a stunning departure from the practices of his recent predecessors. Presidents for more than two decades had avoided public comments on the Fed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s interest-rate policies as a way of demonstrating respect for the institution\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s independence. For a president who has frequently invoked rising stock prices as affirmation for his economic policies, criticism of the Fed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s monetary policies lays ground for shifting blame elsewhere if the market slide continues. He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s escalating his attacks on the Fed with less than a month to go before elections that will determine whether Republicans maintain control of Congress. More here: Trading on Wall Street remains choppy. The Dow is back in the red, down around 115 points (or -0.45%), while the tech-focused Nasdaq index is now slightly higher... Jay Powell, incidentally, was Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pick to run the Fed. The president could have reappointed Janet Yellen, Powell\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s predecessor, but instead he favoured a change (even though Yellen had done a good job helping to heal the economy from the financial crisis). Jay Powell may regret ever agreeing to become Fed chair! Donald Trump has unleashed another attack on America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s top central banker, reiterating that he thinks the Federal Reserve is making a mistake. And once again, Trump is breaching the concept that central banks such as the Fed are independent (which is meant to reassure investors). Speaking as Wall Street wobbles today, Trump said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a correction that I think is caused by the Fed and interest rates. The dollar is very strong, very powerful \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and it causes difficulty doing business.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Asked if he might sack the Fed chair, Trump replied: No, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m not going to fire him. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m just disappointed. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the big picture tonight, and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not pretty: The braver, or riskier, among you may see today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s losses as a buying opportunity. I certainly don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t give investment advice. But Trevor Greetham of Royal London Asset Managment believes there are bargains out there: It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not surprising to see a sharp rise in volatility given the negative cross currents for markets. Global growth is slowing, US interest rates are rising and Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade war rhetoric is hotting up ahead of next month\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s midterm elections. Longer term, we expect the economic expansion to continue into 2019 and this should ultimately propel stock markets higher. Investors should note that US tax cuts and spending increases are still feeding through, interest rates elsewhere in the world are very low and China is easing policy to offset trade war fears. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Our multi asset funds have been defensively positioned since the early summer but we have started to buy equities on weakness after our investor sentiment gauge hit its most pessimistic reading since April. As another old saying goes, investors should be fearful when others are greedy and greedy when others are fearful.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd After a day of hectic selling, Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s blue chip index has ended the day deep in the red. The blue chip FTSE 100 index has shed almost 2% today, sending it solidly into a correction (10% below its all-time high of 7093 back in May). It has closed 138 points lower at 7,006, its lowest level since April. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no brighter across the channel either, where markets have ended at a 21-month low. Ouch! Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s main stock index seems to have plunged into a BEAR market - meaning it has fallen by 20% from its recent peak. That shows how worried investors are about its government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s budget plans, and the row with the EU over fiscal targets. European stocks market are also suffering deeper losses as the closing bell looms. The Stoxx 600 index of top European companies is now down 2%, as shares get another mauling. So much for the recovery! The New York stock market has turned south again. The Dow is now down 336 points, or 1.3%, at 25,262 points, adding to yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 830-point tumble. The broader S&amp;P 500 is also down 1.3%, while the Nasdaq has shed 1%. So far today, the market has opened lower, recovered, and now taken another leg down. This zig-zag trading shows nervousness and volatility is high. Issues such as the US-China trade wars, Brexit and the Italian budget row are all weighing on markets. Professor Costas Milas of the University of Liverpool argues that this week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u0153financial market turmoil is (long) overdue\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. He has sent over this chart, from Policyuncertainty.com, which shows how uncertainty has risenL Profess Milas explains: Global policy uncertainty has hit its highest level for more than 18 months now. In fact, September 2018 saw global policy uncertainty at a level comparable to what we saw during the Referendum vote!!! The chart measures policy uncertainty in 18 countries that account for more than 70% of global GDP. Based on this plot information, I am surprised market reaction did not happen in late September or the very first days of October! Hello... Larry Kudlow, the US president\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chief economic advisor, seems to have suggested that Donald Trump could meet with China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s president Xi soon. Speaking on CNBC, Kudlow indicated that talks could take place at the G20 summit in November. However, it seems that nothing is \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcconcrete\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, so don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t count on a breakthrough in the trade war yet.... If such Wall Street is gyrating, as investors struggle to decide whether to stick or twist. The Dow has now shaken off its early malaise, and is now up 50 points or 0.2%. It could be a testing day.... Stuart Clark, manager at Quilter\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s WealthSelect, reckons automatic trading systems helped to fuel Wednesday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s losses. The sell-off really gained momentum quickly, especially toward the end of trading. That can be a tell-tale sign that algorithm based strategies are kicking in and chasing a trend, which can fuel a rally or a sell-off. While that can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be ignored, it is important to remember that reflects high volume, short-term trading and isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t necessarily a reflection of the fundamental case for any given stock.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s treasury secretary has called for calm. Speaking at the IMF meeting in Bali, Stephen Mnuchin steered away from the president\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s criticism of the Federal Reserve. Instead, Mnuchin suggested that Wednesday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sell-off was a fairly normal event. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Markets go up. Markets go down. I see this as a normal correction.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sell-off was bad, but it was hardly horrific. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s some context: The S&amp;P 500 index, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq, have also dipped into the red in very early trading.... The New York stock exchange has reopened, after suffering its biggest loss in eight months yesterday. And the Dow has opened..... LOWER, dropping by around 100 points in the opening moments. Don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t panic too much, though - it usually takes several minutes before trading is fully underway. Hold onto your hats... Wall Street is about to open for trading. Will Hobbs, head of investment strategy at Barclays Smart Investor, reckons investors should \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcstay calm\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 today, rather than panicking. He argues that the world economy isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t on the brink of a recession, so there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no reason to dump your portfolio: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Isolating the causes of sharp falls in stock markets is always a hazardous game. The reality is that such drops, as gut churning as they tend to be, are best seen as part and parcel of investing in capital markets. For long term investors, the rising trend is of course more important to focus on than the bumps in the road. For those trying to more actively trade the economic cycle, the key question is whether such volatility speaks of a darker economic turn for the US and world economy, a recession even. For our part we still cannot see the next recession on the horizon in the indicators that we look at. Recessions can, of course, rain from clear blue economic skies, so humility is always appropriate. This is particularly the case as we enter a period where US interest rates approach levels where, if still some distance from asphyxiate, are certainly no longer accommodative for the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s most important capitalist economy. After a nasty pummelling, European stock markets are trying to climb off the mat. The FTSE 100 has clawed back some losses, following today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s weaker-than-expected US inflation data. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s still having a bad day, though, currently down 91 points at 7054. Investors are pondering whether today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sell-off is the start of a downturn, or a buying opportunity.... Newsflash: Donald Trump has renewed his attack on the US Federal Reserve. Speaking to Fox News this morning, the president repeated his claim that the Fed has been too aggressive with its interest rate hikes. Trump said the Fed was getting \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a little bit too cute,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd adding: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153They\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re making a big mistake.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd More news: the number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefit has risen. Some 214,000 US citizens filed an \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcinitial claim\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 for jobless help last week, up from 207,000. That could be another reason for the Fed to keep its hand off the trigger.. NEWSFLASH: US inflation didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t rise as fast as expected last month. This might bring some relief to the troubled markets. Core inflation (which strips out volatile items like oil and food) only rose by 0.1% in September, versus forecasts of a 0.2% rise. The means that annual core inflation was unchanged, at 2.2%. The headline inflation measure, the Consumer Prices Index, is also weaker than expected. It dropped to 2.3% year-on-year, down from 2.7%. Why does this matter? Because core inflation is a key measure used by the Federal Reserve when setting interest rates. So if prices aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t rising as fast as feared, the Fed might be more reluctant to raise rates aggressively. And that might act as a balm to anxious investors around the globe..... Time for a quick recap. World stock markets are suffering one of their biggest slumps in months, after a shock slide on Wall Street on Wednesday. A wave of selling has sent Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE 100 into correction territory, meaning it has lost most than 10% from its recent record high. It is currently down 113 points, or 1.6%, with house-builders and financial companies leading the rout. There are losses across Europe too; the French CAC is down 1.5% while Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s DAX has lost 0.9%. Photos of the sell-off are here. Investors across the globe have been shaken by the losses in New York yesterday - the shock sent Japan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Nikkei down almost 4%, while China tumbled over 5% to a four-year low. The VIX \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcfear index\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, which tracks anxiety in the markets, has spiked. Analysts are blaming various factors, including the US-China trade war, recent rises in US borrowing costs, and the prospect of several more American interest rate rises. Technology stocks, and luxury goods makers, have been hit hard. The sight of Donald Trump blurring the lines around central bank independence, branding the Federal Reserve \u00e2\u20ac\u02dccrazy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t helped the mood. The world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s top emerging nations have also weighed in, warning that trade wars are hurting their economies. Wall Street could suffer further losses when trading begins in around 80 minutes. Lukman Otunuga, research analyst at FXTM, says: While U.S. President Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s renewed criticism of the Federal Reserve for hiking interest rates played a role behind the steep selloff, there were other key factors brewing in the background. It is becoming clear that global equity markets are facing a perfect storm of headwinds such as rising U.S. bond yields, U.S.-China trade disputes, global growth concerns and prospects of higher U.S. interest rates. For as long as these themes remain, appetite for stocks are likely to diminish further consequently fueling speculation over the bull party coming to an end. Asian stocks fell sharply during early trade to close in the red while European shares slumped this morning. With the negative sentiment from Asian and European markets deterring investors from riskier assets, Wall Street is at threat of trading lower this afternoon. The oil price has also been dragged down today. Brent crude has sled $1.5 per barrel, or almost 2%, to $81.57. That reflects concerns that trade wars and higher US interest rates could hurt global growth. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a video clip of the head of the IMF defending America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s top central banker against Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s claim that the Federal Reserve has \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcgone crazy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122: Tech has been the golden child for markets this year. But now it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s being disowned by investors, who rushed to ditch internet giants like Amazon (down 6% yesterday), Apple (which dropped 4.8%) Netflix (which shed 8%). One theory is that people are taking profits - there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a temptation to cash in your winning stocks when you see shares diving. Another theory is that tech firms will suffer particularly badly from a full-blown trade war, which looks increasingly likely unless Washington and Beijing start mending fences. Thirdly, some technology stocks are highly-leveraged, having issued large amounts of debt to fund their growth. So if US interest rates keep rising, their borrowing costs could become rather higher. Even crypto-currencies are being caught up in today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s selloff. Bitcoin has shed 5% today to trade around $6,200 at present, down $300 today. Here some photos showing how the stock sell-off has ripped around the world. It started in New York yesterday when a late slump wiped 3% off the value of the US stock market, while tech stocks suffered particularly badly. This set Asia up for a fall - with Japan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s main indices losing over 3.5% Australia was also pulled into the mire; its S&amp;P/ASX index shed 2.7%, led by energy and technology companies. Cue more pain in China, where stocks slumped by over 5%. This dragged the market down to its lowest level since 2014, as traders worried that the economy is suffering from the trade war with America. European investors then picked up the baton, and conducted a selling operation of their own. Heavy losses on all the main exchanges has wiped almost 2% off the Stoxx 600 index, down to to lowest level since the end of 2016. And with Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE 100 still down over 100 points, and in correction territory (10% below its record high), it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been a bad morning in the City. Helal Miah, investment research analyst at The Share Centre, says investors have been speculating for weeks that a correction was coming - and now \u00e2\u20ac\u0153we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve talked ourselves into a sell-off\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Miah pins the blame on trade war fears, and the prospect of higher US borrowing costs: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The sell-off has been gathering strength for about two weeks now lead by the Asian markets as concerns were raised about China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s growth rate, but fingers will also point at the hike in tariffs between the US and China and the impending trade wars. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153But for us and many other analysts, a market sell-off was always going to be most likely as a result of the rising interest rate environment, especially in the US. We had the much expected hike in September from the US Federal Reserve now taking interest rates to 2.25% with the expectation that the policy makers will keep in their path of steady rate hikes as the US economy strengthened. But with unemployment recently hitting 3.7%, and as signs slack in the economy and with the labour market disappearing, there is the expectation that prices and inflation could start running ahead of the Fed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s expectations. As a result, the policymakers may now think about increasing rates at a faster pace than anticipated. Over in New York, financial workers will be rising early and inspecting the damage across the global markets. Wall Street got an early taste of the rout, of course, when the Dow plunged by over 800 points in late trading on Wednesday. US traders can now see that the shockwave rippled to Asia, sending major indices down by 3%, and then Europe, where the Stoxx 600 is down 1.8% now. And the bad news is that New York is expected to suffer fresh losses today. The futures market suggests the Dow will fall by another 1%, when trading begins again, in three and a half hours time. Just in: A group of leading developing countries are calling for an end to the trade wars that have gripped the global economy this year. The G24, which includes China, India, Brazil, Mexico and Argentina, say the global trading system should be reformed, not smashed up. In a statement issued in Bali, alongside the IMF\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meeting his week, the G24 warn that emerging markets are suffering: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Trade uncertainties and financial and monetary conditions compound rising debt vulnerabilities. Improving debt sustainability depends on a supportive external trade and financial environment, timely contingency financing and the adequate flow of concessional financing for low income countries.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Back in the UK, a new Bank of England survey shows that it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s harder to get access to credit, as lenders tighten up: There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no relief in the City. After two hours of bruising trading, the FTSE 100 sinking deeper into correction territory, down 123 points or 1.7% at 7022. Fiona Cincotta, senior market analyst at City Index, says investors have been perturbed by New York\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 3% slump yesterday. Wednesday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s plunge on Wall Street came as a shock and global markets are now readjusting. Sellers shaved 830 points off the Dow Jones Industrial Average and 4% of Nasdaq with big tech names like Amazon, Intel and Microsoft bearing the brunt of the decline. The picture is not looking much better this morning. The Nikkei and the Shanghai Composite closed over 4% and 5.7% lower respectively, the FTSE started the day with a 1.19% decline and continued to sink from there. She also explains how the recent rise in US bond yields - because investors expect higher inflation and interest rates - is now hurting stocks: The plunge in US stock markets comes after a long run of almost undisrupted gains on Wall Street which were bound to come up for a correction. The strong US economic background that has supported share prices this year is now working against that same market. Rising interest rates are fuelling concerns that higher borrowing costs will erode the margins of US companies and with the domestic labour market at its strongest in nearly 50 years, wage pressures are filtering into companies\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 costs. The 10-year Treasury yield is used as a reference price for mortgages, car loans and other consumer debt and a spike in those yields is hitting industries like car makers and house builders that are exposed to consumer borrowing. The VIX volatility index has hit its highest level since April, following the hefty losses seen in the markets in recent days. The number of contracts for trading the VIX has also jumped, showing that traders expect the current market volatility to continue. Paul Donovan of UBS Wealth Management blames the Wall Street sell-off on Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision to impose tariffs on Chinese goods: US equities seem to be (finally) reflecting the cost of US President Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade taxes. Around 80% of global trade involves multinational (generally listed) companies. A bit less than half of S&amp;P earnings come from outside the US. However, listed companies are only 25% of the US economy. Equities are at greater risk than the economy if trade is taxed aggressively. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a taste of the mood on the trading floors today: China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock market has closed at its lowest level in almost four years, as the trade war with America continues to bite. The Shanghai composite index ended the day down 5.2% its heftiest rout in over two years. Trading screens were a sea of green, not red, though (as red is a lucky colour, it is used to show rising prices in China) Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sell-off has dragged the FTSE 100 index into a correction! The blue-chip index has now lost more than 10% of its value since May, when it traded at an all-time high of 7,903 points. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a blow to anyone whose invested money in UK stocks in recent months. Neil Wilson of Markets.com has helpfully drawn up a list of the key factors behind the sell-off: Rising bond yields \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the sharp rally last week was the cue for a sustained period of declines which culminated in yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s selloff. Now we have a lot of momentum \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the breadth of the decline \u00e2\u20ac\u201c we could see things get worse before rallying. China and trade \u00e2\u20ac\u201c we thought that Nafta was important but really the fear is that we see the Sino-US tensions get worse. Comments around currency manipulation have not helped risk sentiment. No resolution can be expected until after the mid-terms. Fears around luxury stocks and comments from LVMH on Chinese demand have raised some concerns around earnings. Italy \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the ongoing Rome-Brussels spat is keeping European investors in a risk-off stance. Fresh valuation concerns heading into earnings season Yikes! World stock markets have slumped to their lowest level since February. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s according to data provider MSCI, whose \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcall country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 index has careered down to an eight-month low this morning. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s thanks to the triple-whammy of losses in Wall Street, the rout on Asia, and this morning\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s heavy early losses in Europe. Craig Erlam of trading firm OANDA says some frightened investors are ditching stocks: European stocks are the latest casualty in the global sell-off that has rattled markets over the last 24 hours, as investors worry about the potential for a sharper correction on the back of rising bond yields. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been something of a bloodbath overnight, as investors saw what occurred in the US \u00e2\u20ac\u201c despite there being no clear catalyst for such a move - and dashed for the exits as fears grow that global risks are mounting and the bill is coming due. While people are naturally pointing to the bond market to explain the sudden panic \u00e2\u20ac\u201c most notably Trump who\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been laying the groundwork for blaming the Fed for the last couple of months \u00e2\u20ac\u201c I wonder whether the underlying risk in the markets for some time has left market primed for a correction and investors have simply fled at the first sign of danger. Paras Anand, head of asset management for Asia Pacific at Fidelity International, argues the sell-off in America isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t a shock: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The sharp sell-off in the US has likely caught no one by surprise. If anything, investors have been wondering how, in the face of tighter monetary policy, a contracting labour market and rising oil prices, the US has continued to be so resilient. Ouch! European stock markets have plunged to their lowest level in 20 month. The Stoxx 600 index, which tracks the largest shares in the region, has slumped by 1.6% today to its lowest level since the start of February 2017. Every sector is taking a chilly bath: Eurozone stocks are being dragged down the row between Rome and Brussels over Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new budget, on top of today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s other concerns. Housebuilders and financial stocks are among the big fallers in London this morning: Newsflash: Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE 100 index has hit a new six-month low at the start of trading. The wave of selling that began in Wall Street last night, and swept through Asia today, has now reached the City. The Footsie has shed 113 points, or 1.58%. That takes it down to 7032 points, its lowest level since early April. Nearly every share has fallen. One rare exception being gold miner Randgold (as traders scramble for safe-haven assets). David Madden of CMC Markets says: The prospect of higher interest rates has left trader worried, as it means higher borrowing costs for companies and individuals. Homebuilders are under pressure as mortgage rates are likely to increase. Retailers are suffering for the same reason. Investors in Asia are reeling after a rather brutal day in the markets. China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Shanghai index is now down over 6%, as worries over the US trade war intensify. Chinese stocks have now lost more than a fifth of their value this year. Naeem Aslam of Think Markets fears that the sell-off will continue: This slump is not going to be over that easily as Asia have already borne the burnt of this year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade war, which is fuelled with nothing but uncertainty. The Chinese markets are already in the bear territory so I expect the U.S. markets to continue to face the selling pressure. Boom! Christine Lagarde, the head of the International Monetary Fund, has waded in. Speaking at the Fund\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meeting in Bali, Lagarde insisted that it was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153legitimate and necessary\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd for the Federal Reserve to be raising interest rates. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a rebuke to Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s claim that the Fed is going crazy. Touching on the slide in the markets, Lagarde pointed out that US stocks have hit record levels recently - suggesting that a correction should be expected. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It is fair to observe and all people are observing that the US equity market and stock markets in general have been extremely high\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. The FT has more details. Hussein Sayed, chief market strategist at FXTM, argues that Trump must take some of the blame for the market losses: While I agree with President Trump that Wednesday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s selloff is the fault of the Fed, he should be reminded that the trade war he started with China and re-imposing sanctions on Iran is also to blame. His actions helped building inflationary pressures and the Fed cannot stand still when it sees the economy overheating. A steeper selloff in equity markets will probably lead to a pause in hiking rates, but the Fed will be more concerned about the overall economy performance than just equity prices. The widening rift between the US and China is driving shares down, says J.P. Morgan Asset Management global market strategist Marcella Chow: Headlines around the broadening US-China conflict also continue to worsen as the U.S. arrested and extradited a Chinese official in Belgium to face espionage charges. There are concerns over a 3Q earnings rise following recent profit warnings and weak reports. In particular, Fastenal\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s CEO said the trade war with China is raising material costs that will crimp profit margins and hurt US consumers, and French luxury goods maker LVMH confirmed Chinese border guards are more actively searching travelers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 suitcases for undeclared goods added to fears of a slowdown in spending by Chinese consumers. Charles Ripley, senior strategist at Allianz Investment Management, blames the prospect of higher interest rates: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s equity selloff is a reaction from investors finally realizing we are in a higher interest-rate environment, and given the elevated level of stocks, market participants were likely looking for a reason to sell. Higher interest rates typically bring on tighter financial conditions which could dampen growth going forward and equity markets are reacting to that.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Ari Shrage, chief executive of Aliya Capital, agrees: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This is much more interest-rate related than anything going on specifically with tech. Interest rates are moving higher, so stocks that are the most expensive typically are the ones that roll over. Steven Friedman, senior economist at BNP Paribas Asset Management, points to recent falls in the value of US government debt (or Treasury Bills). That has pushed up the yield on these bonds - a sign that investors expect inflation and interest rates to rise The rise in Treasury yields has been the primary catalyst for the sell-off in equities, since higher yields suggest a lower present value of future dividend streams, assuming an unchanged economic outlook. It is also possible that equity investors are growing concerned that the Federal Reserve\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s projected rate path will choke off the expansion.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Good morning from London. World stock markets are sliding today as the anxiety that has been building in recent days explodes into a wave of selling. Shares have fallen sharply across Asia, after Wall Street suffered their worst sell off in eight months overnight, wiping 800 points, or 3%, off the Dow Jones industrial average. The rout has sent Japan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Nikkei into a tailspin, shedding 4%. Stocks in Hong Kong are down 3.8%, and there are chunky losses in Australia (-2.8%) and South Korea (4%) too. My colleague Martin Farrer explains from Australia: A jittery, volatile week on global financial markets has burst into a frenzy of selling, triggered by heavy losses on Wall Street and comments by Donald Trump describing US interest rate hikes as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153crazy\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd.... \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a bit of a bloodbath,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Ed Campbell, senior portfolio manager at QMA, the asset management branch of Prudential Financial in New York. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s primarily the cumulative effect of interest rate moves over the past five days and news reports about trade impacting companies.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd European markets had already endured a bad week, and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s about to get worse. Traders are predicting that Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE 100 will plunge to a new six-month low this morning, perhaps shedding more than 100 points. The rout is being fuelled by concerns that US interest rates are heading higher, as the Federal Reserve tries to keep a lid on American inflation. Donald Trump added to the pressure overnight, branding the Fed \u00e2\u20ac\u02dccrazy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 for planning to keep raising interest rates in the months ahead. Trump told reporters in Pennsylvania that: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The Fed has gone crazy. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153No, I think the Fed is making a mistake. They\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re so tight.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a correction we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve been waiting for, for a long time, but I really disagree with what the Fed is doing.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The president neglected to mention that its his relaxed fiscal policy, and recent tax cuts, are one factor pushing Federal Reserve governors to hike. Worries over the US trade war with China (another Trump \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcachievement\u00e2\u20ac\u2122), are also worrying investors, after the IMF slashed its growth forecasts earlier this week. Kit Juckes of French bank Societe Generale says Wall Street has finally caught up with events: For much of 2018, the US economy has been oblivious to a turn in the global economic cycle, and the US equity market has been unaffected as emerging market equities and currencies have come under pressure. This week has seen the S&amp;P, and the Nasdaq, sit up and pay attention to what\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s going on. The President\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s criticism of the Fed adds colour, but no real substance to the situation. Later today we get new US inflation figures, which could also move the markets. If price pressures keep mounting, the Fed will feel that it needs to keep raising borrowing costs, despite chuntering from the White House.

The concept of a UK \u00e2\u20ac\u201c EU customs union seems to offer the holy grail of frictionless trade and providing a workable solution to the Irish border conundrum. </p> <p>However what has not been clarified, as yet, is whether the UK would remain part of the Customs Union and trade with the EU-27 as it does today i.e. no customs administrative requirements or whether the UK will form a new customs union with the EU. Should the UK and EU agree on a new customs union arrangement with the EU this will eliminate tariffs but does not mean no customs administration and paperwork. There will highly likely still be a requirement to file a declaration that the goods are in UK or EU free circulation and provide a customs value and classification for those goods. This is not frictionless trade as some would no doubt envisage. It offers a trading arrangement for customs purposes that is closer to a free trade agreement without delivering any of the wider benefits.</p> </blockquote> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/oct/11/second-kent-motorway-is-possible-post-brexit-lorry-park\">Kent motorway to shut as work begins on possible post-Brexit lorry park</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Bernardine Adkins, head of EU trade and competition law, Gowling WLG, is more scathing about the government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s plans:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The guidance published today is pure fantasy. The government say that they will \u00e2\u20ac\u0153seek to bring into force bilateral UK-third country agreements from exit day, or as soon as possible thereafter\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd.

Worse still \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcas soon as possible thereafter\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 will be the time it takes to negotiate deals \u00e2\u20ac\u201c this is at least 5 years if not longer.

It grossly underestimates the time it takes to negotiate free trade deals, and glibly notes that \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcthere may be practical changes\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 to how current users of EU free trade agreements will deal with third countries. Importantly, however, the government has dropped its fantastical stance of simply rolling over EU free trade agreements on exit day. The problem is that there is no viable option to avoid increased tariffs or other impediments to trade in a no deal scenario.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2018-10-12T14:27:24.433Z\">at 3.27pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5bc0a8dbe4b05798be94c236\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-10-12T13:59:59.072Z\">2.59pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/AP/status/1050741015609581568\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">BREAKING: Stocks open sharply higher on Wall Street following a two-day rout; Dow industrials jump almost 400 points.</p>&mdash; The Associated Press (@AP) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AP/status/1050741015609581568?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">October 12, 2018</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5bc0a23ee4b02837e97b0f84\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-10-12T13:39:15.925Z\">2.39pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Wall Street rebounds</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Ding Ding!

                "bodyText":"Phew! After some rocky days, the New York stock market has ended the day higher. The Dow Jones industrial average has closed 287 points higher at 25,339, a gain of 1.15%. The wider S&amp;P 500 has risen by 1.4%, while the Nasdaq jumped by 2.3%. A sense of calm seems to have returned to the markets, with investors suspecting that this week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s losses have created some bargains As Laura Kane, head of Americas thematic investing at UBS Global Wealth Management, puts it: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Generally what we were seeing is more momentum and technology names selling off. Now buyers are coming back to say some of these are babies that were thrown out with the bath water. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Now we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve had the pullback, valuations look attractive. But lets not forget what a bad few days it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been. The three main US stock indices have all suffered their worst week since March, with the Dow shedding 4.2%, the S&amp;P losing 4.1% and the Nasdaq off 3.7%. Opinion is split over whether it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s merely a healthy correction, or the start of a major sell-off. Given Europe managed to fall again today, there may be more drama ahead. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll get a better feeling next week. Until then, goodnight! GW With less than 10 minutes to go, Wall Street is on track to end firmly higher. Traders on the floor of Wall Street look a little cheerier today, as they watched shares rise rather than slide... Wall Street traders are licking their wounds tonight after a bruising few days, which has knocked 5% off the Dow. That sharp decline, after a series of record highs of late, is making some investors reassess the health of the markets. But did the fall go too far? Some analysts are predicting better times ahead, at least in the short term. As Marketwatch puts it: Late-Thursday stock trading was characterized by powerful gyrations amounting to hundreds of points that took place within minutes. The Journal reported the Dow tumbled about 240 points in the final 90 minutes of trade, representing about half of Thursday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s losses. However, some technical analysts make the case that the market has reached an oversold condition, where further declines may not be justified. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re certainly expecting a bounce in the short term,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd wrote Justin Waltes, co-founder of research firm Bespoke Investment Group, in a Thursday report. However, he warned that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the longer term that we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re more concerned about now given the technical breakdown we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve seen. Expect a rally soon, but don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t go loading up on cyclicals with the expectation that the pain is over once we bounce. There is likely more volatility to come in the weeks ahead.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Back in the UK, the chairman of cake and cafe chain Patisserie Valerie has dipped, deep, into his pocket to keep it afloat. Entrepreneur Luke Johnson (whose future columns for the Sunday Times are eagerly awaited) is putting \u00c2\u00a320m into the company, as a loan. This follows the alleged \u00e2\u20ac\u0153fraudulent activity\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd revealed this week that has left the business\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s future in serious doubt. At least two of its shops closed today, and finance director Chris Martin was arrested. Technology, consumer goods and basic materials companies are all pushing the Dow higher today. Credit card firm Visa is the top riser, up 3.6%, followed by Walgreen Boots (+3%), then three tech firms - Cisco, Microsoft and Apple all up around 2%. But energy firms Chevron and Exxon are lagging, down over 1% each. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s because the number of US oil rigs has jumped, according to new figures today, suggesting suppliers are trying to boost output. Wall Street is still managing to rally, though. Just. The Dow is currently up 90 points, or 0.37%, on track for its first gain after six days of losses. Tech stocks are recovering, pushing the Nasdaq up by 109 points or 1.5%. European stock markets have suffered their worst week in eight months. After jumping in early trading, shares dipped through the afternoon as traders became edgier again. Most indices have ended the day in the red, again, meaning the Stoxx 600 index of top European companies has lost 4.8% this week. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the worst weekly performance sine February, when it lost 5.1%. Reuters says: There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a rotten trend\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in Europe, a trader complained, noting that U.S. shares have outperformed their European peers since the beginning of the year with the Trump administration\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fiscal cuts boosting earnings. Europe lags far behind the United States in terms of earnings growth, and stronger results will be critical in luring back some of the billions that have been pulled out of European stocks this year. The rally in London\u001f has petered out. The FTSE 100 has closed 11 points lower at 6995.91, a dip of 0.16%. That takes it to a new six-month low, and deeper into a correction. Still, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a rather smaller loss than on in recent days. The European stock market rally is running out of steam! After a strong start, the major indices are heading back to earth as the closing bell approaches. The FTSE 100 is now up only 9 points, or 0.1%. Germany and France are also subsiding. David Madden of CMC Markets thinks traders are keen to protect themselves from any more volatility on Wall Street tonight (where stocks are still higher) The equity markets got off to a strong start following a mixed session in Asia, but now the gains are evaporating as we approach the close. Traders are keen to square up their books ahead of the weekend. The global equity rout originated in the US, and the moves continue to be US driven, and European dealers are keen to cash in their holdings as Wall Street still has several hours more trading left. The pound has lost ground today, as traders continue to watch Brexit developments nervously. The UK government is currently trying to reassure sceptical MPs, and ministers, over a proposed backstop arrangement that could effectively keep the whole UK inside the customs union. Downing Street insists that it would never agree to an \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcindefinite\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 backstop, in an attempt to placate Brexit-supporting MPs who insist on a clean break with the EU. But with time running out, the pound has lost half a cent against the US dollar to $1.318. Ursula Johnston, head of customs, Gowling WLG, warns that such an arrangement may not would actually deliver frictionless trade. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a crucial issue, as the government begins work on turning motorways in Kent into parking lots for lorries after Brexit... She explains: The UK newspapers are filled today with reports of Theresa May closing in on a deal with the EU whereby the whole of the UK would remain in \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, or, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd customs union with the EU for an indefinite period. This is on the face of it promising news for those that would like the UK to keep the closest possible trading ties with the EU without being a member of the Single Market. The concept of a UK \u00e2\u20ac\u201c EU customs union seems to offer the holy grail of frictionless trade and providing a workable solution to the Irish border conundrum. However what has not been clarified, as yet, is whether the UK would remain part of the Customs Union and trade with the EU-27 as it does today i.e. no customs administrative requirements or whether the UK will form a new customs union with the EU. Should the UK and EU agree on a new customs union arrangement with the EU this will eliminate tariffs but does not mean no customs administration and paperwork. There will highly likely still be a requirement to file a declaration that the goods are in UK or EU free circulation and provide a customs value and classification for those goods. This is not frictionless trade as some would no doubt envisage. It offers a trading arrangement for customs purposes that is closer to a free trade agreement without delivering any of the wider benefits. Bernardine Adkins, head of EU trade and competition law, Gowling WLG, is more scathing about the government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s plans: The guidance published today is pure fantasy. The government say that they will \u00e2\u20ac\u0153seek to bring into force bilateral UK-third country agreements from exit day, or as soon as possible thereafter\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. There is no mention that the UK is currently unable to negotiate bilateral deals, so there is absolutely no possibility of bilateral agreements being in place on exit day. Worse still \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcas soon as possible thereafter\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 will be the time it takes to negotiate deals \u00e2\u20ac\u201c this is at least 5 years if not longer. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s at least 5 years in which UK businesses will face increased costs for customs clearance and compliance. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s guidance on free trade agreements is telling. It grossly underestimates the time it takes to negotiate free trade deals, and glibly notes that \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcthere may be practical changes\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 to how current users of EU free trade agreements will deal with third countries. Importantly, however, the government has dropped its fantastical stance of simply rolling over EU free trade agreements on exit day. The problem is that there is no viable option to avoid increased tariffs or other impediments to trade in a no deal scenario. Ding Ding! The opening bell of Wall Street is ringing out, setting us up for a strong open. The Dow Jones industrial average has jumped by 1.5%, or over 360 points. That follows two days of big losses that wiped out almost 1,400 points. The S&amp;P 500 is also up around 1.5%. The tech-focused Nasdaq index is rallying hard too, up almost 2.5%. After six days of losses, New York is trying to end this week on the front foot. Financial stocks are among the top risers, after decent results from JP Morgan, Citi and Wells Fargo earlier today. Stephen Mnuchin has also played down the suggestion that China could dump its holdings of US government debt. He claimed such a move would be costly for Beijing, and that there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d be plenty of other buyers anyway. More soothing words, this time from US treasury secretary Stephen Mnuchin. Asked about the markets, Mnuchin told CNBC that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153markets tend to go too far in both directions\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd - suggesting he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not too worried about this week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s losses. Mnuchin also insisted that the US economy was in good shape. arguing: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The fundamentals are still very strong. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The U.S. economy is strong. U.S. earnings are strong. I see this as just a natural correction after the markets were up a lot.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Unlike his boss, Mnuchin didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t blame the Federal Reserve for the sell-off. Asked about Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s criticism of Fed chair Jerome Powell, Mnuchin replied: I think Jay is doing a good job. Maybe all is forgiven, now shares are are going up again.... Financial titan JP Morgan has given the markets a boost, by releasing stronger financial results than expected. JP Morgan earned $2.34 per share in the last quarter, beating forecasts of $2.25 per share. Revenues were 5% higher too, at $27.8bn, suggesting Wall Street is managing to navigate the choppy waters of 2018. Jamie Dimon, Chairman and CEO, says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153JPMorgan Chase delivered strong results this quarter with top-line growth in each of our businesses, demonstrating the power of our platform. The U.S. and the global economy continue to show strength, despite increasing economic and geopolitical uncertainties, which at some point in the future may have negative effects on the economy.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Wall Street traders have woken up in a better mood .... Stock markets in emerging economies are recovering some ground today, after suffering their biggest fall in two years on Thursday. The MSCI index of developing market stocks has jumped by 2.2% today, led by Taiwan (up 2.4%), India (+2.1%), the Philippines (+1.75%) and South Korea (+1.5%). Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Reuters take: Those moves tracked a general improvement in appetite for risk among investors globally, with developed world stock markets recovering after a dramatic two-day slide on Wall Street. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re seeing a bit of a rebound in EM stock markets today...we saw a similar occurrence earlier this year when U.S.stocks came under pressure and that automatically improved, and that might be what we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re seeing this time around as well,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Jason Tuvey, senior emerging markets economist at Capital Economics. US tech stocks may have a better day too... Wall Street is expected to rally when trading begins in four hours. Dow futures are showing a 350 point gain, which would claw back a chunk of yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 545-point losses. Fiona Cincotta of City Index thinks the worst is over, for now anyway.... The global selloff seems to have come to an end and the market is picking up the pieces after the hurricane. The tally: the Dow has lost 1,400 points in two days, Brent Crude is back down at $81 and the dollar is trading at 1.1579 against the euro. Key indices have fallen below their 200-day moving averages and are beginning to look oversold but the underlying economic reasons for a rise in interest rates that had triggered the spike in bond yields and the selloff in equities is still in place. For the moment though, European markets are back in the black and the recovery in Dow futures indicates a stronger start on Wall Street later today. Investors should be wary before diving back into the market today, argues Peter Dixon of Commerzbank. He writes: The sharp correction in stock markets in the last couple of days should be seen as a warning shot against the market complacency which has been one of the predominant themes of the last 12 months. Indeed, measures of equity volatility continue to suggest that investors are underpricing risk. We pointed out at the start of the year that equity investors appeared to be increasingly reluctant bulls and were driven more by the FOMO factor (fear of missing out) than the fundamentals, and advised investors to take risk off the table. Dixon points out that shares still look pricy, even though the Footsie has shed almost 10% since the start of the year. Having enjoyed a great run since March 2009, with global equities having generated returns of 300%, it is difficult to imagine that there is much more juice to be squeezed out of the lemon. On a conventional valuation basis, long-term P/E ratios suggest that equities are extremely expensive. The cyclically adjusted P/E (CAPE) popularised by Robert Shiller suggests that the S&amp;P500 has only once been more overvalued than it is today \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the late-1990s tech boom \u00e2\u20ac\u201c on a dataset going back 130 years: Despite today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s recovery, stock markets are heading for their worst week since February, Reuters points out. The markets are breathing a sigh of relief this morning, says Rebecca O\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Keeffe, Head of Investment at interactive investor. But while some investors are piling back into shares, others are being more cautious. Trade wars, rising interest rates and slowing growth have been front and centre in terms of big macro reasons for the rout, but the reality is that investors need to be asking whether valuations can be justified by company profits or have markets got ahead of themselves? The start of the US earnings season sees JP Morgan, Wells Fargo and Citibank all reporting today, and good results could provide the catalyst that sees markets recover their recent losses, while disappointing numbers are likely to jeopardise any positive sentiment. Newsflash: stricken UK cafe chain Patisserie Valerie has told the City that its finance chief was arrested last night. This follows the discovery earlier this week of a \u00c2\u00a320m black hole in the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s balance, sheet, and \u00e2\u20ac\u0153accounting irregularities\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. The company told shareholders that: The Company has been made aware that Chris Marsh, who is currently suspended from his role as Company Finance Director, was arrested by the police last night and has been released on bail. Further updates will be released in due course as appropriate. Yesterday, Patisserie Valerie warned that it needs \u00e2\u20ac\u0153an immediate injection of capital\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to survive. It also revealed earlier this week that it faces a winding-up order from HMRC over an unpaid tax bill of more than \u00c2\u00a31m that was filed in the high court in mid-September but which the firm\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s directors had been unaware of. In another sign of easing tensions, the Vix volatility index has dropped this morning. The VIX is now hovering at 21.74% this morning, down from Thursday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s eight-month high of 25% yesterday. Reports that the leaders of US and China could hold fresh talks over trade next month are also helping the markets shake off their losses. Mike van Dulken of Accendo Markets explains: The Washington Post reported Trump and Xi agreeing to a side-lines meet at next month\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s G20 summit, fuelling hopes for a trade war truce to offset rising bond yields mounting pressure on the US economy. Global markets have calmed down overnight, says Kit Juckes of French bank Soci\u00c3\u00a9t\u00c3\u00a9 G\u00c3\u00a9n\u00c3\u00a9rale. His morning note to clients is titled \u00e2\u20ac\u0153A day off for the horsemen of the apocalypse?\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, suggesting he expects less drama today... European trading is underway, and markets are bouncing back from yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s slumps. The FTSE 100 is sitting up in bed and taking some soup. The blue-chip index has gained 30 points at the open, or 0.4%, taking it back to 7035. However, that still means it has suffered a correction (down more than 10% since May). The German market is looking perkier too - the Dax has gained 1.2% at the open. France is up 1%, while Spain is 0.9% higher. Confidence may be returning to the markets, after some panicky moments earlier this week. But is it a proper recovery, or just a classic \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcdead cat bounce\u00e2\u20ac\u2122? Neil Wilson of Markets.com sees reasons for optimism: The breadth and depth of the decline in the US market is a concern and suggest earnings and valuations are a factor. In addition to the yield narrative, in many ways this selloff could reflect real angst about the third-quarter earnings season and what outlook is painted by corporates on earnings calls. ... However, on the fundamentals the reasons to be positive remain in place. The fact that the US inflationary pressures are not running out of control continue to suggest this is a picture of good news and fundamental strength. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been a cheerier end to the week in Asia. China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s benchmark index, the Shanghai Composite, has jumped by 1% - a recent performance, until you remember it slumped by 5% on Thursday. Hong Kong\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Hang Seng index is 2% higher, while Japan and Australia have stabilised. Stephen Innes of trading group OANDA reckons traders need the weekend to recuperate, after some draining days: This market is exhausted from all after the most significant sell-off in global equities since February. Its large shake out the landscape remains no less uncertain and while the current narrative is likely to rage on until Novembers G20 summit at least, prudence suggesting keeping one\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s powder dry on this recovering Friday and live to fight another day after yesterday most unpleasant experiences. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. After two days of heavy losses, the financial markets are catching their breath and assessing the situation today. Asian markets have rallied a little overnight, and traders are predicting a bounce-back in Europe this morning too. But there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s still a lot of anxiety in the City today, after investors watched the FTSE 100 lurch down by 2% into a correction yesterday. That set up Wall Street for another big slump last night; the Dow lost another 545 points, taking its two-day losses to over 1,300 points, or 5%. Anxiety over US interest rates, the trade war between America and China, and signs that the world economy is slowing are all being blamed. Plus, Donald Trump is adding to the uncertainty by firing a series of pot-shots at the Federal Reserve, who he blames for fuelling the sell-off. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s liveblog, covering all the drama from Europe, to the US and then Asia: David Madden, market analyst at CMC Markets, says investors remain nervous..... while also wondering if this week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s turmoil is actually a buying opportunity. It was a choppy day yesterday as traders remained cautious about the prospect of higher interest rates in the US, mounting political pressure in Italy, and deteriorating global trading relationships. We saw huge swings in European and US stock markets as traders were battling with the age old emotions of fear and greed. Traders love to snap up relatively cheap stocks, but sharp moves to the downside have left some traders worried this could be the beginning of a major decline. Stocks in Europe and the US finished the day firmly in the red. On the economic front, we get a new healthcheck on Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s factories today, plus a new measure of US confidence. Plus it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the start of the bank reporting season, with Citi, JP Morgan, and Wells Fargo all reporting results. That could well move the markets....

Europe then had a wobbly session, before the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE 100 managed to close nearly 0.5% higher. Brexit remained a worry, as UK PM Theresa May warned that she can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t accept Brussels\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 proposal for a backstop for Northern Ireland. The US market failed to sparkle, after the latest US retail sales figures were weaker than expected - only growing by 0.1% in September. There was no big sell-off in New York, but the main indices did end the day lower. The tech sector remained under pressure, due to its exposure to global growth, and its vulnerability to disruption from a trade war. Hardware maker Cisco Systems was the biggest faller on the Dow, down 2.2%, followed by Apple (-2.1%), Visa (2%) and Microsoft (-1.8%). The disappearance of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi in Turkey also loomed over the markets.

And on the fiscal side, America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s budget deficit has jumped to $779bn, thanks to a burst of spending. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s all from us today. Goodnight. So much for the rally! A late swirl of selling has sent Wall Street into the red at the closing bell. The Dow shed 89 points, or 0.35%, back down to 25,250. The Nasdaq had a worse day, losing 1%.

America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s budget deficit jumped by over $100bn in the last fiscal year, to nearly $780bn. Higher defence and social security spending helped to drive up the deficit, even though the economy grew strongly too. Marketwatch has the details: The U.S. recorded a $779 billion deficit in the fiscal year ending Sept. 30, an increase of $113 billion, as spending climbed while revenue remained nearly flat, the Treasury Department announced Monday. Outlays grew by $127 billion, or 3.2%, while government receipts rose 0.4%, or $14 billion. Compared to GDP, the deficit rose to 3.9%, up by 0.4 percentage points. In September alone, the U.S. recorded a surplus of $119.1 billion. UK defence firm BAE Systems saw its shares fall today, as traders pondered the implications of the Khashoggi case. Earlier, Donald Trump told reporters that the Saudi king had firmly denied being responsible for the journalist\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s disappearance - indeed, Trump suggested that rogue elements could be to blame (inside the Saudi consulate in Ankara?). Trump has now dispatched his Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo, to the Middle East to investigate. Fiona Cincotta of City Index says the Saudi tensions loomed over the City: Ironically, it was UK defence giant BAE Systems that bore the brunt of the dispute, trading down 3.46% on the day, as a conflict with the oil producing country could threaten its \u00c2\u00a310 billion deal for 48 Typhoon jets. The oil market was surprisingly placid about rising political tensions with Brent crude trading up 0.35% and WTI up 0.39%. Instead some investment went into gold and gold shares, notably Rangold and Anglo American. Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock market also had a better day, with the DAX gaining 90 points or 0.8%. France ended slightly lower, though. A day that started with blustery rain and deep puddles in the City of London has ended with a modest recovery. The FTSE 100 has nudged its way back over the 7,000 point mark, gaining 33 points or 0.45% to finish at 7,029. This means the Footsie has avoided setting another six-month closing low, as looked possible this morning. Wall Street is attempting to push higher, and add to Friday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s recovery. The Dow is now up 84 points, or 0.3%, while the Nasdaq is coming off its lows. Last week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s market sell-off was partly due to worries that the global economy is slowing. And Capital Economics has added to those concerns, by predicting that the next recession could be closer than previously thought. Neil Shearing, their chief economist, believes it will be triggered in America, as the Federal Reserve raises rates to calm inflation (as Donald Trump has warned). Shearin\u001cg writes: The next global downturn is likely to come much sooner than the current consensus anticipates \u00e2\u20ac\u201c indeed, we think that world GDP growth is already peaking in this cycle and that it will slow relatively sharply in 2019-20. The downturn itself is likely to be led by the US, where higher interest rates will begin to weigh on rate-sensitive sectors of the economy, and China, which is undergoing a structural slowdown. And while we anticipate that the next global downturn will be relatively short and mild compared to previous cycles, there is a long and growing list of threats that mean there is a significant risk of a sharper adjustment. The newswires are reporting that Janet Yellen, the former chair of the US Federal Reserve, has criticised Donald Trump for his attacks on her predecessor, Jerome Powell. Nick Timiraos of the Wall Street Journal has the details: Yellen also cited the danger that the US economy is running too hot, and also cautioned that the US trade dispute with China could hurt the global economy. Back in New York, the sell-off is gathering momentum. The Nasdaq tech index is now down 1%. Pharmaceuticals giant AstraZeneca has frozen investment in the UK until it knows what\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s happening with Brexit, according to the firm\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chairman. Leif Johansson told French newspaper Le Monde that the UK-Swedish firm has activated its contingency plans. It is now stockpiling medicines at national borders and has duplicated some of its UK operations in Sweden. Johansson, whose company has operations in Cambridge and Macclesfield, adds: We have also stopped investing in the UK. More here. The chimes of the opening bell are ringing out across Wall Street, teeing up a fresh week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trading. Traders are edgy following the worst week since March, and in the face of rising tensions around Saudi Arabia. And...shares are dipping in early trading. The Dow Jones industrial average has shed 20 points, or 0.1%, while the Nasdaq is 0.3% lower. Big tech stocks, including Facebook, Netflix and Amazon, are among the big fallers: Back in London, the FTSE 100 has struggled back from his morning\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s six-month low. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s now up 19 points , or 0.3%, at 7015. But the FTSE 250 index, which contains smaller UK companies, is having a worse day. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s down 199 points, or 1%, at 18,774, partly due to those nasty profit warnings from SuperDry and ConvaTec this morning. The weak US retail sales growth in September has surprised City economics and investors - here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s some early reaction: Just in: Americans spent less in restaurants and malls than expected last month. US retail sales only rose by 0.1% in September, much weaker than the 0.6% growth which economists had expected. This is partly due to a 1.8% fall in spending at restaurants and bars, the biggest drop since December 2016. That wiped out a 0.8% surge in car purchases. Clothing sales rose by 0.5%, while online and mail-order shopping jumped by 1.1%. Such a big drop in spending in bars and eateries could worry economists - it may signal that US consumers are cutting back. However, it could also be due to one-off factors, such as the hurricanes which hit the US last month. Two more top US executives have pulled out of Saudi Arabia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcDavos in the desert\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 event, over the disappearance of Jamal Khashoggi. Blackstone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Stephen Schwarzman and BlackRock\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Larry Fink have both withdraw from the high-profile Saudi Arabian investment conference taking place later this month (with a shrinking guest list). Over the weekend, the CEO of JP Morgan and the chairman of Ford both cancelled, as the furore over Khashoggi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s disappearance intensified. Other top bosses are still weighing up their next move -- but I suspect we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re reaching where attending the event is more controversial than finding a previous engagement in the diary (or even subsequent one...) Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shadow foreign secretary, Emily Thornberry, has called for Britain to rethink its relationship with Riyadh too: We should not be in league with a brutal dictatorship that beheads its own citizens for standing up for their rights, which rains down airstrikes on civilian areas in Yemen with no concern for innocent children, and that thinks it can assassinate dissident journalists in other countries with impunity. We must apply the same standards to countries such as Saudi Arabia, Israel and Egypt that we apply to Iran, Russia and Syria. Where any of them abuse human rights and breach international humanitarian law, we must be prepared to call it out in the same measure, rather than treating it as one rule for our supposed friends and another for our supposed enemies. Just in: Bank of America has beaten Wall Street forecasts, which might calm some investors\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 nerves. The second-largest US bank make profits of 66 cents per share in the last quarter, ahead of the 62 cents expected by analysts. Revenues grew by 4%, as Bank of America benefitted from higher interest rates and recent US tax cuts. Chief executive officer Brian Moynihan sounds upbeat, declaring: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Responsible growth, backed by a solid U.S. economy and a healthy U.S. consumer, combined to deliver the highest quarterly pre-tax earnings in our company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s history.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd More UK retail gloom: Fashion accessories retailer Claire\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s is considering a raft of store closures in the UK, according to a report on the Press Association. The US stock market is expected to lose ground when trading begins in three hours. The futures market is indicating the Dow Jones industrial average will shed 106 points, or 0.4%, at the open. New retail sales figures (at 1.30pm UK time) and financial results from Bank of America could both move the markets. The main Asian stock markets have all closed in the red today. Japan fell by almost 1.8%, Hong Kong lost 1.5%, Shanghai shed 1.4% and Australia finished 1% lower (our earlier summary has more details) The oil price is pushing higher this morning, amid rising tensions between Saudi and the US over the disappearance of journalist Jamal Khashoggi. Brent crude has risen 1% to $81.25 per barrel, back towards the four-year high set earlier this month. Bloomberg is reporting that the Saudi King has ordered an \u00e2\u20ac\u0153internal probe\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd into the Khashoggi - who is presumed to have been murdered after entering the Saudi consulate in Istanbul. On Saturday, US president Donald Trump vowed \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcsevere punishment\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 if it was confirmed that the Saudi regime had killed Khashoggi. This was a hardening of Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s original position, that he didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to risk investment and jobs over the case. Saudi Arabia, though, denies being involved -- and has now vowed to retaliate if sanctions are imposed. In theory, Saudi could hurt America badly by cutting crude production -- in a repeat of the 1970s oil shock. That would send transport costs soaring, drive inflation higher, and hurt growth. Saudi is the biggest single producer in the Opec cartel, producing over 10 million barrels today (global demand is 100 barrels/day), so it could have a major impact on prices. However, there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s an argument that rival suppliers, such as the US shale industry, could step in to fill a production shortfall. Ouch. Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock exchange has now overcome its technical issues, and traders are sending shares lower. The DAX has dipped by 20 points, or 0.18%, to 11,503 points, a new 20-month low. The gold price has jumped by 1% today to $1,231 per ounce. Bullion is benefiting from a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153flight to safety\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd as nervous investors look for a safer place for their money, says Stephen Innes of trading firm OANDA: While the market\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s version of a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Red October \u00e2\u20ac\u0153 makes it way into the South China Sea, echoes of Octobers past are reverberating throughout global capital markets as risk off continues to linger with equity market look ever so fragile. The US Treasury is set to release the semi-annual FX report. While China doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t meet the historical criteria to be named a currency manipulator who is to say, President Trump, my not rewrite the requirements so that China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s inclusion in the future is assured? Geopolitical embers are smouldering, threatening to ignite the middle east powder over the disappearance of journalist Jamal Khashoggi. The UK FTSE 100 has just hit a new six-month low, as its early gains fizzle out. The blue-chip index of leading sharews in London is now down 27 points at 6968. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s its lowest level since the end of March, adding to last week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s losses. This follows the weak trading in Asia (where Japan lost 1.8% and China fell 1.4%). Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell explains: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153There is a noticeable lack of bargain hunters on Monday morning as last Friday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rebound in select parts of the market fails to extend into the new working week. The FTSE 100 was down 0.1% in early trading at 6,988 with investors clearly lacking confidence to snap up stocks whose share prices were badly damaged in last week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s market sell-off. The biggest riser is gold producer Randgold \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a traditional \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcsafe-haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 in troubled times, with other \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcdefensive\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 stocks such as British American Tobacco and BT Group also in demand. Engineering firms such as Melrose and BAE are among the big fallers: Pakistan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock market has made a bad start to the new week, falling over 2% in early trading. That follows a 4% tumble last week, as investors fretted about Pakistan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economic outlook. Prime Minister Imran Khan is seeking an emergency bailout from the International Monetary Fund, who may demand tough austerity measures in return. Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock exchange has been hit by a technical glitch that has prevented trading getting underway. The Financial Times explains: The opening of trade in Deutsche B\u00c3\u00b6rse\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock market, the primary trading venue for German equities, was delayed on Monday by \u00e2\u20ac\u0153technical problems\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Deutsche B\u00c3\u00b6rse\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Xetrastock exchange, one of Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest, faced issues with its \u00e2\u20ac\u0153trading infrastructure\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd which meant the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153trading start will not take place according to the usual trading schedule.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd So, we can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t see how the German DAX is faring yet.... As feared, there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no recovery in Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock market this morning. The Stoxx 600 index, which tracks the largest European companies, has dropped by another 0.4% to a fresh 22-month low. With traders reluctant to take risks, there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a jittery feel in the trading floors again. Kit Juckes of Societe Generale says: The Swiss franc and yen are stronger. Hard Brexit risks are mounting, global political risks are ever-present and equities and bond yields are lower ex-Italy. The breakdown in Brexit talks, the disappearance of dissident Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi, the demise of the CSU in Bavarian elections, the impasse over Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s budget and the worried tone coming from the IMF/World Bank meetings in Bali all combine to give financial markets an uncomfortable feel this morning. Shares in UK fashion group SuperDry have plunged by 20% after it shocked the City with a profits warning. SuperDry says that the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153unseasonably hot weather conditions\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in the UK, Continental Europe and on the East Coast of America has hit demand for its autumn ranges, and wipe \u00c2\u00a310m off profits. In another blow, the company is taking an \u00c2\u00a38m hit on foreign exchange costs, after discovering that its \u00e2\u20ac\u0153hedging mechanisms\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd have not protected it from volatility in the currency markets. Investors aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t impressed - sending SuperDry shares sliding from \u00c2\u00a310.15 to just \u00c2\u00a38.12. At the start of the year they were worth \u00c2\u00a320. Astonishingly, that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not enough to make SuperDry the worst-performing stock today. That \u00e2\u20ac\u02dchonour\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 goes to medical equipment maker ConvaTec, whose shares have lurched 30% lower. The colostomy and wound bag manufacturer has slashed its profit forecasts, due to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153challenging market dynamics\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, and its CEO is retiring. In London, the FTSE 100 index has opened 20 points higher (+0.3%), as traders try to put last week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s losses behind them. Artjom Hatsaturjants at City firm Accendo Markets says the pound\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s weakness is helping multinational companies: The muted open comes after a negative start to the week in Asia, where concerns over rising US interest rates continued weighing on equities. Brexit negotiations suffered another setback over the weekend, as PM Theresa May rejected key EU proposals over the Irish border, dealing a blow to negotiations to avert a hard Brexit. This has sent the GBP [the pound] sharply lower ahead of an EU leaders summit on Wednesday, helping FTSE\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s international names. After another day of losses, China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock market has sunk to its lowest closing level in almost four years. CHINA\u00e2\u20ac\u2122S SHANGHAI COMPOSITE INDEX CLOSES DOWN 1.49% TO 2568.1 CHINA\u00e2\u20ac\u2122S CSI 300 INDEX FALLS 1.4% TO 3,126.45 AT CLOSE A cocktail of risks are weighing on the markets, says Jasper Lawler of London Capital Group: Concerns over higher US borrowing costs were the catalyst for last week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s heavy sell off. However, there were plenty of other risk factors which were also dampening sentiment. Those risk factors, including US- Sino trade tensions, Brexit, Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Budget proposal and now increased political tensions between the US and Saudi Arabia, are set to keep pressure on risk appetite this week. Good morning from a wet and grisly London. Last week wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t a pretty one for the City - the FTSE 100 fell steadily to a six-month low, while European stock sank to their lowest in 21 months. And as the rain tips down, there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s little sign of optimism in the markets today. Germany traders have been rattled by yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Bavarian state parliament election, which saw the ruling Christian Social Union lose its majority. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s another blow to Angela Merkel (whose CDU party are partners with the CSU) There are tensions in Italy too, where the government is expected to approve its new budget, despite complaints from Brussels that it will breach EU fiscal rules. Yesterday, Italian prime minister Giuseppe Conte announced the budget would be \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a change of gear for Italy\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Conte suggests Europe would soften its view, once Rome has explained its growth strategy to them.... But until that happens, investors will fear another episode in the eurozone debt crisis. Spread-betting firm IG predicts fresh losses in Frankfurt and Milan today: The losses continue to mount up on financial markets amid uncertainty across the world about trade, rising US interest rates and now a potential clash between the US and Saudi Arabia over the fate of missing journalist Jamal Khashoggi. The Saudi tension has sent the price of oil up and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also been a rough night for the pound ahead of this week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s crunch Brexit summit with sterling slipping. The yen meanwhile has strengthened a touch against the dollar. Stock markets fell in Asia overnight led by the Nikkei in Japan. It is off 1.85% (not helped by the rising yen). Seoul -0.7%, the Hang Seng -1.24% and Shanghai is off 0.83%. The ASX200 in Sydney closed down 0.99%. Futures trade suggests a flat start later today for the FTSE100 while the Dax30 in Germany is seen dropping 0.25%. Wall Street is tipped to fall too. The pound is down 0.3% to $1.31 and \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.135. Brent crude is up 1.25% amid Saudi tensions. JP Morgan and Ford bosses have joined the boycott of the Future Investment Intiative conference in Riyadh next week in the wake of the Khashoggi affair. China says it faces \u00e2\u20ac\u0153uncertainties\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd but has \u00e2\u20ac\u0153plenty of room\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd for fiscal manoeuvre if thin gs get sticky. Which they nevertheless say they won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t. The US dollar rose against the euro and other currencies. These included the Aussie dollar, a proxy for emerging market sentiment, which slipped to US71.06c from US71.26c on Friday. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m signing off now. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been an interesting day but it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time to hand over to Graeme Wearden in London. Thanks for joining us. It will be fascinating to see where the price of oil goes this week. Brent futures have risen 1.255 today to $81.5 a barrel and that could rise to $100 according to one analyst. Kazuhiko Fuji, senior fellow at the Japanese government thinktank, the Research Institute of Economy, Trade and Industry, said: Oil prices could rise to $100 on worries about Saudi Arabia. People had thought the Saudis will make up for fall in Iran\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s output. If they are starting to use oil as their weapon, that will be a whole new chapter. Apologies - I jumpped the gun on the Aussie market. The final settlemtn pushed it deeper into the red to end down 58.6 points, or 0.99%, at 5837.1 points. Sears, the venerable US retailer, has gone into administration. It has filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy, according to a filing in a New York court, Reuters reports. The filing says Sears, which once dominated US retailing in the golden age of catalogues, has assets in the range of $1bn to 10bn and liabilities in the range of $10bn to $50bn. The ASX200 is done for the day. It finishes down 46 points, or 0.79%, at 5,849 points. Saudi Arabia has threatened to retaliate against the world economy if western nations impose sanctions or similar if it emerges that the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s security forces murdered the journalist Jamal Khashoggi. But what form could Saudi action take? Our business reporter Rob Davies has been looking at the issues and his main points are The Saudis have the obvious power to push up oil prices. it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest producer and reducing output would see prices rise, possibly causing a devastating oil shock to the world economy. Second, the Saudis support thousands of US jobs through their extensive arms imports. Loss of those contracts would damage Donald Trump and he has already flagged that he doesnn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to jeopradise those deals for companies such as Boeing and Lockheed. Saudi funds are also important to planned US infrastructure development. And it is a key strategic ally in the Middle East On the other side of the ledger, the Saudis are relying on western companies to reform the kingdom\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stagnant economy and diversify it away from oil. The growing boycott of next week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Future Investment Initiative conference in Riyadh (now including JP Morgan and Ford) shows possible leverage. it will be a blow to Prince Mohammed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s prestige if more high-profile names pull out. You can read Rob\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s full piece here: We seem to have hit a fairly quiet spot in the trading day. The ASX200 in Sydney is down around 1% and is due to close in a few minutes. The Nikkei hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t moved from the -1.5% mark for a couple of hours. Ditto the Kospi (-0.5%) and the Hang Seng ( -0.1%). The CSI300 in Shanghai is probably the biggest mover, sliding from positive territory a couple of hours ago to now being off 0.8%. Talking of China, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s worth revisiting comments by the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s central bank governor at the close of the IMF meeting in Bali on Sunday. Yi Gang said China still had plenty of room for adjustment in interest rates and the reserve requirement ratio (RRR) in the face of any negative impact from trade tensions with the United States. He admitted China faced \u00e2\u20ac\u0153tremendous uncertainties\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd but was seeking a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153constructive solution\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to the current trade tensions. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We still have plenty of monetary policy instruments in terms of interest rate policy, in terms of RRR. We have plenty of room for adjustment, just in case we need it,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Yi said, indicating that Beijing feels it has plenty of ammunition to fire up the economy if needed. He added that he expected GDP to print at least 6.5% on Friday. Chris Weston of Pepperstone in Melbourne has weighed with some commentary, saying things could quite ugly on stock markets if data out of China \u00e2\u20ac\u201c inflation, GDP and retail sales \u00e2\u20ac\u201c disappoints later in the week. After last week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s volatility shock to markets, we start the week on a negative tone, with broad weakenss through Asia and the ASX 200 falling out of bed. The weekend news flow has centred on a lack of progress in the Brexit negotiations, a deterioration in Saudi/US relations, which have resulted in a 1.1% rally in crude, and the loss of majority for the CSU party in the German regional elections. Here are the latest scores, courtesy of IC Markets (although I think they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve missed the minus sign off the Hang Seng price): Summing up nicely, Masayuki Kubota, chief strategist at Rakuten Securities says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t say the shock is over.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The pound is set for a volatile few days as the wrangling over Brexit intensifies ahead of the meeting of European leaders starting on Wednesday night. It sits at $1.31 at the moment after losing 0.3% today. The key issue is how to prevent a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic. The EU wants the North to remain essentially bound by EU customs rules but that is facing pushback from Brexiters. Theresa May is hoping a temporary \u00e2\u20ac\u0153backstop\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd can be put in place where the whole country remains in the customs deal for the time being. (There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a good explainer here from Daniel Boffey, or Brussels correspondent.) Meanwhile, former foreign secretary and would-be Tory leader, Boris Johnson, has sounded off again in his Telegraph column. He says the backstop idea should be rejected completely and says the EU is treating the UK \u00e2\u20ac\u0153with contempt\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd: In presuming to change the constitutional arrangements of the United Kingdom, the EU is treating us with naked contempt. Like some chess player triumphantly forking our king and our queen, the EU commission is offering the UK government what appears to be a binary choice. It is a choice between the break-up of this country, or the subjugation of this country, between separation or submission. So seems like a good moment to run this brilliant picture of UK foreign secretary Jeremy Hunt and other foreign ministers in the maze at his country retreat Chevening this weekend. Still with Australia and interesting to note that Shane Oliver, the high-profile chief economist at AMP, has suggested that he might have to revise downwards his forecasts on house prices. He tweeted on Saturday that the auction results weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t good but his forecast of a peak to trough fall of 15% out to 2020 remained in place. But he told the AFR that he might hve to rethink that forecast on the downside. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The risks are skewing to greater than 5% declines per year, which is what I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve been assuming,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he told the Financial Review on Sunday. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I am thinking about revising down again.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd In Australia the ASX200 has had a torrid morning. At one point it was down more than 1.5% but it has recovered at bit and is now at 5,829, a fall of 66 points or 1.1%. The financial sector has been battered amid concern about the impact of the royal commission on the big four and the amount of compensation they will have to pay. Commonwealth is the worst performing, down more than 2%. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also the question of the impact from a deteriorating housing market. According to the AFR this morning, less than half of properties at auction this weekend were sold. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a bad outcome during what should be one of the busiest times of the year. Agents are blaming lack of credit for buyers pulling out. The Chinese trading day has kicked off. The Hang Seng is down nearly 1% while the Shanghai Composite is up a fraction. Another major factor in stock market losses this week has been the prospect of a full-blown US-China trade war. But calls for calm from leaders gathered at the IMF conference in Bali last week seem to have fallen on deaf ears. The Chinese currency fell again against the dollar today. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s now at 6.92. That is sure to rattle Washington where there is a widespread view that beijing manipulates the currency to benefit exporters. In Sunday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s IMF communique, members agreed to debate ways to improve the World Trade Organization so it can better address trade disputes and that countries would \u00e2\u20ac\u0153refrain from competitive devaluations and will not target our exchange rates for competitive purposes\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. The latter point address concern that China will allow the yuan to depreciate in order to make its exports more competitive to cope with any downside from US tariffs. Hmm ... While the Ssudi government has come out fighting on the prospect of US sanctions in the Khashoggi case, the boss of the Saudi-owned Al-Arabiya satellite news network has gone a few steps further. Turki Aldakhil paints an apocalyptic picture of world affairs if the US tries to get tough on the Saudis. He says the kingdom would respond by slashing oil output and would team up with Russia and stop buying US arms. The US would be \u00e2\u20ac\u0153stabbing itself to death\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Imposing any type of sanctions on Saudi Arabia by the West will cause the kingdom to resort to other options, US President Donald Trump had said a few days ago, and that Russia and China are ready to fulfill Riyadh\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s military needs among others. No one can deny that repercussions of these sanctions will include a Russian military base in Tabuk, northwest of Saudi Arabia, in the heated four corners of Syria, Israel, Lebanon and Iraq. At a time where Hamas and Hezbollah have turned from enemies into friends, getting this close to Russia will lead to a closeness to Iran and maybe even a reconciliation with it. The list of marquee speakers at the Future Investment Intiative conference in Saudi Arabia next week makes interesting reading because a few of them have now said they will not be going. Jamie Dimon has pulled out along with the boss of Uber and the editor of the Economist, Zanny Minton-Beddoes, while US treasury secretary Steve Mnuchin is under pressure not to go. Watch this space for more. The rise in oil prices is gathering pace too. Brent futures are up 1.3% to $81.54 a barrel. The sellers are gaining the upper hand in stock markets around Asia Pacific today. Hong Kong and China open later this morning. But this is how it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s looking so far: The Nikkei is now down 1.56%, or 353 points at 22,341 The Kospi is off 12 points, or 0.55% at 2,150 The ASX200 is down 62 points at 5,833, a fall of 1.07% so far Bill Ford, the chief executive of Ford, has become the latest high-profile business leader to pull out of the Future Investment Initiative conference in Riyadh later this month, Reuters reports. He joins JP Morgan boss Jamie Dimon in announcing his withdrawal on Sunday. Neither cited a reason but it is suspected that the diplomatic standoff over the Khashoggi affair would be high on the list. Uber chief executive Dara Khosrowshahi, Viacom boss Bob Bakish and billionaire Steve Case, one of the founders of AOL, have also said they won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be going to the event dubbed \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Davos in the desert\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, Reuters said. Bloomberg and CNN have also pulled out of covering the event. Read the full story on the growing row by our diplomatic editor Patrick Wintour: Trading is under way in Japan and Korea. The Nikkei is off 1% and the Kospi is down 0.5% in Seoul. That seems par for the course today given the poor start in Sydney, where it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s now off 0.89% for the day. The question is whether the markets can bounce back or they are dragged lower by a compound of problems ... The price of Brent crude has risen this morning to $80.5 a barrel. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s surely connected to the Saudi issue, so it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s worth looking again at what the kingdom has said about possibly retaliating to external pressure over the Khashoggi affair. A statement from Riyadh on Sunday said: The kingdom affirms its total rejection of any threats and attempts to undermine it, whether through economic sanctions, political pressure or repeating false accusations. The kingdom also affirms that if it is [targeted by] any action, it will respond with greater action. Crucially, the statement also pointed out that the oil-rich kingdom \u00e2\u20ac\u0153plays an effective and vital role in the world economy\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. That has to be an implicit threat to cut oil production and push up the price of a barrel, doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t it? The standoff between Saudi Arabia and just about everyone else in the world over the disappearance of journalist Jamal Khashoggi looks like intensifying. The Saudis have promised pushback if Donald Trump carries out his threat of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153severe Punishment\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd if the kingdom is found to have disposed of Khashoggi, as alleged by Turkey. Now, Reuters report that JP Morgan Chase chief executive Jamie Dimon has cancelled plans to attend a Saudi Arabian investor conference later this month. The bank did not give any more details for Dimon\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision not to attend the Future Investment Initiative conference in Riyadh, and did not comment on whether concerns about the disappearance of Khashoggi were a factor. In currencies, the US dollar has gained a bit today. That means the Aussie dollar is down slightly at US71.07 while the yen has slipped to 112.2. The pound is at $1.31. The benchmark ASX200 has slipped around 1% in the first few minutes. The banks, as usual of late, have been sold with the financial sector down 1.47%. Same for resources which are down more than 1% but utilities are off 2%. More commentary on the Australian market from Michael McCarthy at CMC Markets. His thrust is that this week sees a lot of data from China including lending, retail sales and GDP which should give us a picture of where the superpower is heading, ie is it in good enough shape to survive a trade-war inspired downturn? There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also inflation and trade data from Japan, retail sales in the UK and in the US, retail sales, housing numbers and Fed minutes. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s what Michael says: Australian investors face a challenge at this morning\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s opening. Despite positive moves for US shares and buoyant industrial commodities SPI futures were belted at the New York close, suffering a 51 point loss for the session. The first hour of trading may indicate whether this was an error or the beginning of further underperformance for Australian shares. Greg McKenna, the independent market strategist, says the markets narrative has been hijacked by the Saudi pushback and Brexit but reckons it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a close call on what direction things will take. This is what he says in his morning note: Much water to flow here especially for the Pound and oil prices. Looking back to Friday though and while stocks in the US rallied into the close it was a messy day and hardly a convincing bounce. Is it the bottom? Many think so and the medium-term charts recovered to hold channel bottoms. But we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll see. Good morning and welcome to the Guardian business live blog. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re firing up a bit earlier than usual today because it looks like being an interesting session in Asia Pacific markets. In Australia, the ASX200 has dropped 51 points after opening a few minutes, or just under 1%. The Nikkei in Japan in expected to fall 0.83% and the Hang Seng will also dip slightly. China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s CSI300 is set for a bounce though. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s only part of the picture today though because Saudi Arabia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s threat to disrupt the global economy will likely send the oil price higher today. Stocks on the Saudi market fell on Sunday. Meanwhile, the Brexit talks in the UK remain very tense with questions about whether Theresa May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s government can seal a deal on its backstop solution for the Irish border. Senior members of her Tory party are threatening to rebel over the matter and that has seen the pound drop substantially. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s buying $1.309 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c down more than 1% on Friday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s close. A forecast showing that the UK economy is going to have its worst year since the financial crisis hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t helped.",

                "bodyText":"Time to wrap up: The US stock market has suffered another day of big losses, as investors worry about the state of the economy, trade wars, and possible interest rate rises. The Dow shed more than 600 points, wiping out all its gains for 2018, while the Nasdaq dropped into a correction. Analysts warned that further losses are possible, as fear grips the markets. Manufacturers warned that Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade wars are pushing up their costs. Tariffs are making raw materials and imports more expensive, eating into profits. However two companies - Boeing and Tesla - bucked the trend with forecast-beating results. European companies have suffered a worrying slowdown in growth this month. Trade wars may be to blame here too, with manufacturers suffering a drop in orders. Brexit angst is weighing on the pound. Sterling fell to a seven week low, below $1.29, as Theresa May struggles to reach an agreement on Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s transition deal. Goodnight! Tesla has addressed a lot of criticism with its results tonight, says Alan Boyle of Geekwire. He writes: Tesla shares jumped more than 10 percent in after-hours trading today after the controversial electric-car company posted a surprisingly positive quarterly report, including a profit rather than a loss. Adjusted net income for the third quarter amounted to $312 million, which translated into earnings of $2.90 a share. Analysts had expected a loss of around 19 cents per share. Total revenue hit $6.8 billion, exceeding expectations of $6.3 billion. And Tesla\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s cash on hand increased by $731 million, even though Tesla repaid $82.5 million in bonds during the quarter. That cash position could take some of the pressure off Tesla, which had been burning through its reserves by the billions during what CEO Elon Musk called \u00e2\u20ac\u0153production hell\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd for the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Model 3 electric car. Analysts had worried that Tesla would have to borrow more money to stay afloat. But Tesla said \u00e2\u20ac\u0153our cash position should remain at least flat in spite of our plan to repay $230 million of convertible notes in cash\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd during the current quarter. Shares in Tesla have surged 12% in after-hours trading. Investors are scrambling to grab a stake in the company following its surprise move to profitability. Amid the gloom tonight, electric car company Tesla has stunned the markets with much better results than expected. Elon Musk\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s company made a profit of $312m in the last quarter, surprising analysts who expected another loss. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s its first profit in two years. Revenues hit a record, at $6.82 billion, beating expectations of $6.33bn. After a long struggle to meet production targets for its Model 3, and Musk\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s well-known run-ins with regulators, has Tesla finally turned the corner? Nicholas Hyett, equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, believes it has. He writes: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Production numbers earlier this month meant we already knew Tesla could churn out the cars, the question was whether it could it do it profitably, and even more importantly, could Musk wean the company off a constant flow of cash from investors. To say Tesla\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s answer is emphatic is an understatement. Gross margins on the Model 3 are above even the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s own lofty expectations and its position as the 5th most popular car by volume in the US suggests it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s drawing in a wide range of customers despite its comparatively high price point. Drivers will pay more for Musk it would seem. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s important because the premium end alone won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t deliver the impressive growth Tesla needs in the coming years to justify its premium valuation. Normally we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d tell investors to avoid reading too deeply into a single quarter\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s numbers, but this quarter really counted at Tesla. Reading deeply is something of pleasure today.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a scent of fear in the air in the markets tonight, according to Chris Zaccarelli, chief investment officer at Independent Advisor Alliance. Zaccarelli says (via Reuters) that there may be more turmoil ahead: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153At this point it seems selling is begetting selling. The VIX [volatility index] has doubled in the last couple of weeks. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a bit more fear in the air and you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re seeing the acceleration of growth to value. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It looks like more panic and fear as the selling has continued to roll.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s now Marketwatch sums up today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Wall Street wobble: Stocks ended sharply lower Wednesday, as losses accelerated into the close and put both the Dow and the S&amp;P 500 into the red for the year, and the Nasdaq into correction territory. Upbeat results from Boeing Co. were credited with briefly pushing the Dow higher in early morning trading, before investors took an increasingly defensive stance, fleeing for the relative safety of utilities and consumer nondurable shares. Another day, another big loss on Wall Street! The Dow Jones industrial average managed to lose 608 points by the close, meaning it has lost all its gains for 2018. It closed 2.4% lower at 24,583. Technology shares, such as Microsoft (-5%) and Intel (-4.6%), fell sharply, while construction equipment group Caterpillar shed another 5.8%. In another blow, the Nasdaq index slumped by over 4%, putting it into correction territory (more than 10% off its recent high). Investors seem to again be gripped by worries about global trade, geopolitical tensions, and the state of the US economy -- with new home sales slowing, and manufacturers warning that cost pressure are going up. Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s row with the Federal Reserve over future interest rate rises, and the ongoing Brexit deadlock, can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have helped the mood either. Paul Zemsky, chief investment officer of multi-asset strategies and solutions at Voya Investment Management in New York, explained: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a big global risk-off trade. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve had some headwinds, higher interest rates affecting housing, tariffs causing input costs for manufacturers to go up, which makes earnings look not as stellar ... but that doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t mean the whole economy is rolling over,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Those weak home sales figures haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t helped the mood in New York. The Dow is having another down day, currently off 221 points (-0.9%) at 24,969. Fiona Cincotta of City Index sees nervousness on the trading floors: Despite clawing back heavy losses on turnaround Tuesday, Wall Street has once again opened on the back foot. With a long list of risk factors, including Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s growing tensions with Brussels, Saudi Arabia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s increased isolation over Jamal Khashoggi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s killing, global growth worries and some earnings disappointments investors are struggling to find reasons to buy in. The Federal Reserve may ignore Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s complaints, but they should heed the latest US housing data. New home sales fell to an annual rate of just 553,000 in September, 13.2% less than a year ago, and the weakest rate since December 2016. That could suggest the housing market is cooling - perhaps in response to recent Fed rate hikes which have made borrowing more expensive. A late sell-off has sent most European markets into the red tonight. At the close of trading, Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s DAX was down 0.7% while the French CAC shed 0.3%. This morning\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s weaker than expected PMI reports rather dampened the mood (and the Euro!) Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB had yet another bad day, losing 1.7% as the clash with Brussels over its 2019 budget rages. Markets had been higher this morning, but it seems that investors didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t trust the recovery - especially with so many risks (Italy, Brexit, Saudi Arabia) to think about. In London, the FTSE 100 has closed 7 points higher, as the weaker pound propped up shares. Some snap reaction: The Bank of Canada has hiked borrowing costs, taking its benchmark interest rate up to 1.75%, from 1.5%. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largely as expected, but shows that the Federal Reserve isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t the only central bank moving away from crisis-era policies. America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s companies are still growing, but they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re also facing tough price pressures. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s according to the latest healthcheck from data firm Markit, just released. It shows US output growth hitting a three-month high, encouraging firms to take on more staff. However, they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re also having to pay more for raw materials, and imports, as Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade wars kick in. Chris Williamson of Markit explains: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The domestic economy remained the main driver of demand, with exports stagnating amid growing signs of trade being subdued by tariffs. Tariffs also drove a further marked rise in prices, exacerbating an upward trend in price pressures borne out of robust domestic demand. Just in: Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s steel industry has been hit by a surge in imports from overseas. The steel tariffs imposed by Donald Trump seem to have had a knock-on effect, with metals that was destined for America ending up in Europe instead. According to European steel association Euroferi, imports from Turkey have increased by 57% this year, while those from Russia are up 56%. Trump impose a 50% tariff on Turkish steel, as part of a diplomatic row with Ankara, making it very uncompetitive. That had a knock-on effect on Russia, which sells a chunk of its steel to Turkey (which is now swimming in the stuff). Ding ding goes the opening bell in New York....and the markets aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t doing very much. The Dow has risen by 0.3%, or 71 points, to 25,262 in early trading, with Boeing gaining 3%. European stock markets are pushing higher, as Boeing\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decent results brings some cheer to the trading floors. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE 100 is up 80-odd points, recovering yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s losses, and the other indices are also looking healthier. By hiking its profit forecasts, Boeing has brought some confidence that corporate earnings - and economic growth - is holding up well. European multinational companies are also getting a currency boost. With the euro and pound dropping against the dollar today, their overseas earnings are more valuable. Abi Oladimeji, Chief Investment Officer at Thomas Miller Investment, thinks investors should be cautious, though: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The current double-digit pace of earnings growth (expected to be circa 20% in Q3) is clearly unsustainable and this will create a headwind in the months ahead. For this reason, as well as the ongoing elevated levels of political and policy uncertainty in key regions of the world, we retain a cautious outlook on equities for now and await better opportunities to add to holdings. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Reuters\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 take on Boeing\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s strong results today. Boeing topped analysts\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 forecasts for quarterly profit on Wednesday and raised its forecasts for annual profit as it continued to benefit from a boom in global air travel and demand for airplanes. Shares of the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest planemaker were up 3.1 percent at $361 in premarket trading, helping brighten the mood on Wall Street after a handful of shaky results outlooks on Tuesday from U.S. manufacturers hurt by concerns over global trade. Soaring demand from commercial airlines has driven another surge in revenues for Boeing over the past year, pushing shares in the company up by roughly a third over the past 12 months. Those moves have been dented somewhat by a combination of the trade worries, this year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s greater market volatility and a series of recurring charges for its KC-46 tanker program. More here. (Sonic) Boom! Aircraft maker Boeing has posted strong results and raised its forecast for earnings this year. In a boost to morale on Wall Street, Boeing posted earnings of $3.58 per share, beating forecasts of $3.47 per share. With plane sales looking robust, the company now expects to make $14.90-$15.10 per share this financial year, up from $14.30-$14.50 per share. This optimism has sent Boeing shares up by 4% in pre-market trading. That might be enough to push the Dow higher at the open, in an hour\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time. The pound\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s weakness today is partly because the dollar is strengthening against a basket of currencies. The dollar index has hit a nine-week high today, as the greenback rallied across the board. I can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t spot a particular reason why. But it may suggest investors expect the Federal Reserve will ignore Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s latest attack on Jay Powell, and raise interest rates in December. Newsflash: The pound has hit a new six-week low, as Brexit anxiety swirls to new heights. Sterling has fallen by three quarters of a cent today to $1.291, its weakest point since 10th September. The sell-off comes as Theresa May struggles to reach an agreement on Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s transition deal. Yesterday, she couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get the whole cabinet onside, making traders wonder how she will get an agreement through parliament. My colleague Dan Sabbagh explains: No 10 sources conceded that the discussion, which came a day before the prime minister was due to plead for support from Tory MPs at a meeting of the party\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 1922 Committee, was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153impassioned\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Others characterised it as a row. A group of ministers, including Jeremy Hunt, the foreign secretary; Liz Truss, the chief secretary to the Treasury; and Michael Gove, the agriculture secretary, were among half a dozen who emphasised their concern over imposing a time limit on any backstop, which is designed to avoid a hard border in Northern Ireland. Later today, the PM will meet with Conservative MPs to plead for their support. That could be another stormy session, after some anonymous MPs unpleasantly told the Sunday papers that she should \u00e2\u20ac\u0153bring her own noose\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to the 1922 committee meeting. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s National Audit Office (the government watchdog) has piled more pressure on, saying a no-deal Brexit could undermine security at the UK border and increase delays. Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s latest attack on Fed chair Jerome Powell hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t cheered Wall Street. The New York stock exchange is expected to open lower in a few hours, with the Dow called down 0.8%. European stock markets are actually up this morning, with the FTSE 100 gaining 50 points or 0.7%. Craig Erlam of foreign exchange firm OANDA says there is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a huge amount of anxiety in the markets\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd today, partly due to anxiety over US interest rate hikes. The US has been late to the game when it comes to the stock market sell-off, having been sheltered by last year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tax cuts but they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re wasting no time in playing catch-up, with the S&amp;P and Dow both fast closing in on 10% declines from the peak in a matter of weeks, while the Nasdaq has already ticked that box. Trump has been quick to point the finger of blame at the Fed, with the President desperately not wanting to be associated with a stock market sell-off in the run up to the mid-term elections. Especially when he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s spent the last two years taking credit for the colossal gains. Rising interest rates has clearly been a factor in the loss of confidence in the stock market in recent weeks, with trade wars, Brexit, Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s budget issues and the Khashoggi murder also being important contributing factors. Some good jobs news amid the gloom: car rental chain Enterprise are taking on 800 new graduate trainees. The roles are scattered across Enterprise\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 470 branches across the UK. Do well, and you could be assistant manager within a year, they say. More details here. Back in the UK, new mortgage approvals have fallen to a six-month low. Industry figures show that 38,505 home loans were approved in September, down from 39,241 in August, and 6.7% less than a year ago. This may show that the Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s interest rate rise, in August, has chilled the housing market. UK Finance\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s managing director of personal finance, Eric Leenders, suggests people raced to get new mortgages before the BoE rate hike: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The mortgage market softened slightly in September, following strong remortgaging activity in the months preceding the recent base rate rise.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Brexit uncertainty may be another factor, of course. As Stephen Pegge, UK Finance\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s managing director for commercial finance, puts it: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Economic uncertainty continues to impact on businesses\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 appetite for finance as overall lending remains slightly below the same period last year. This morning\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s weak eurozone PMI report has hurt the euro. The euro has fallen by half a cent against the US dollar, to $1.141, as investors fear that the eurozone is weakening. If so, it could make it harder for the European Central Bank to normalise monetary policy and raise interest rates above their record low of zero (a level Donald Trump can only dream of....) Mike Dolan of Reuters shows how German firms are particularly downbeat, according to today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s PMI report. Oliver Rakau of Oxford Economics says European carmakers are struggling to meet new tougher emissions rules (which has also hurt car sales recently). Markit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Chris Williamson fears the eurozone economy could be heading for choppier waters: Newsflash: Eurozone corporate growth is stumbling this month, as tariffs and trade wars hit economic demand. Data firm Markit reports that business growth is the slowest for over two years, while optimism has hit a four-year low in October. Firms reported a slowdown in exports, particularly in manufacturing, where new export orders for goods decreased for the first time since June 2013. This has pulled Markit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Flash Eurozone PMI Composite Output Index down to 52.7, a 25 month low, down from 54.1 in September. Any reading over 50 shows growth. Germany, the eurozone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest economy, was hit particularly hard. Factory output rose by the smallest in almost four years, while service sector growth was the slowest since May. Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit, says the eurozone appears to be slowing as the economic outlook darkens. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The pace of Eurozone economic growth slipped markedly lower in October, with the PMI setting the scene for a disappointing end to the year. The survey is indicative of GDP growth waning to 0.3% in the fourth quarter, and forward-looking indicators, such as measures of future expectations and new business inflows, suggest further momentum could be lost in coming months. The slowdown is being led by a drop in exports, linked in turn by many survey respondents to trade wars and tariffs, which appears to have darkened the global economic environment and led to increased risk aversion. It is therefore not surprising to see the slowdown broadening out across the economy, hitting the service sector. Paul Donovan of UBS isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t impressed by this latest attack on the Federal Reserve. He told clients that the real risk comes from trade wars or excessive tax cuts, not monetary policy. US President Trump has suggested the Fed is the greatest threat to the US economy. An economist would suggest recessions arise from overheating (caused by deficit financed tax cuts, perhaps), or policy error (disrupting supply chains on which an economy depends, perhaps). Zero real rates with full employment are probably not a (restrictive) policy error. The big question is whether Donald Trump could reprise his days on The Apprentice, and tell Jerome Powell that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re fired\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. And the answer? Probably not. The Federal Reserve Act only permits the President to remove a Governor \u00e2\u20ac\u0153for cause\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, and no chairman has ever been fired. But we live in interesting times. Elsa Lignos of Royal Bank of Canada says you can hardly sack a Fed chair for raising borrowing costs. Overnight Trump stepped up criticism of Powell, saying \u00e2\u20ac\u0153every time we do something great, he raises the interest rates\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and that it is the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153biggest risk\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to the US economy, despite this being the slowest ever Fed tightening cycle. He didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t answer what would make him try and replace the Fed chair. By law he can only fire governors \u00e2\u20ac\u0153for cause\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and raising interest rates can hardly be considered a cause \u00e2\u20ac\u201c whether Congress would stop him perhaps depends on whether Democrats manage to take the house. David Madden of CMC Markets points out that Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s recent tax cuts are also putting pressure on the Fed to raise interest rates: President Trump attacked Jerome Powell, the head of the Federal Reserve, for hiking interest rates. Mr Trump is ignoring the fact that his tax cuts helped spur on US economic growth, which warrant higher rates. I fear Donald Trump is on shaky ground when he complains that the Fed blessed president Obama with record low interest rates, but hiked on his watch. When Obama took office, America had fallen into a deep recession as the financial crisis raged. This forced the Fed to slash borrowing costs to stimulate growth. Today, the US economy is running at its fastest pace since 2014 - something Trump isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t bashful about taking credit for. US inflation hit 2.7% in August, over the Fed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s target, and policymakers fear that rising prices could get out of hand, unless borrowing costs rise. As CNN puts it: Obama took office after the Great Recession began in December 2007. The Federal Reserve at that time put historically low interest rates in place, and took other measures besides, in an effort to inject money into the faltering economy. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the financial markets, the world economy, the eurozone and business. Donald Trump may want to Make America Great Again, but he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also showing a talent for making the markets nervous. Overnight, the president has launched a new barrage at America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s central bank, accusing it of being too trigger-happy when raising US interest rates. In an interview with the Wall Street Journal, Trump intensified his criticism of the Federal Reserve and its chairman Jerome Powell, for hiking borrowing costs. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s all terribly unfair, the president griped, saying: I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m just saying this: I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m very unhappy with the Fed because Obama had zero interest rates. Every time we do something great, he raises the interest rates.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd In another jibe, the president added that Powell \u00e2\u20ac\u0153almost looks like he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s happy raising interest rates\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, even though it could threaten EU economic growth. And when asked if he regretted making Powell America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s top central banker last year, Trump replied: Too early to tell, but maybe.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd These comments are totally at odds with the principle of central bank independence. The Fed is meant to be free to change monetary policy to manage inflation and employment without worrying about a blast from the White House. So far this year the Fed has raised interest rates three times; Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s attacks sound like an attempt to ward off a fourth hike in December. Reaction to follow... Also coming up today Stocks may be volatile again today, as October continues to be a testing time for investors. Asia-Pacific markets have risen today after Tuesday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sell-off, and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re expecting Europe to open higher - after the FTSE 100 hit a seven-month low last night. Italy will be in focus, after being given three weeks to resubmit its 2019 budget for EU approval. Rome insists there is no Plan B, though, so further clashes seem inevitable. Traders will also be watching for a new healthcheck on the eurozone economy, the latest UK mortgage figures, plus a likely interest rate hike by the Bank of Canada.

                "bodyText":"Alphabet also missed Wall Street forecasts. The company behind Google posted revenue of $33.74bn in the last quarter, missing estimates of $34.05 billion. Still, Alphabet also reported net profit of $9.19 billion, or $13.06 per share, up from $9.57 per share a year ago. eMarketer analyst Monica Peart says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re seeing a larger than expected slowdown in Google properties\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 revenue, representing its core search business. This is likely related to the ramp-up in competition from Amazon, as consumers increasingly turn to the ecommerce giant for their product searches.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s all for tonight! GW Amazon has taken a bite out of Wall Street\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new-found optimism tonight, by missing analyst expectations: Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Bloomberg\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s take: Amazon.com Inc. reported sales that missed analysts\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 estimates, and issued a disappointing revenue forecast for the busy holiday quarter, suggesting the online marketplace may be reaching a saturation point in the U.S. Revenue gained 29 percent to $56.6 billion in the third quarter, the e-commerce giant said Thursday in a statement. Analysts\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 projected $57.1 billion. Sales will be from $66.5 billion to $72.5 billion in the current period, falling short of analysts\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 average estimate of $73.8 billion. Shares declined as much as 6.5 percent in extended trading. Ut-oh... Amazon and Alphabet have just released results as the echo of the closing bell fade. And Wall Street is NOT happy..... Intel has smashed earnings forecasts, though: Breaking: After Wipeout Wednesday, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Turnaround Thursday. October has maintained its run of wild swings tonight, as Wall Street bounces back. The Dow Jones industrial average has closed 401 points higher, a gain of 1.6%, at 24,984. Technology, industrials companies and banks led the rally. Microsoft closed 6% higher, while Intel gained 4.8%. With tech stocks romping ahead, the Nasdaq has posted its biggest one-day jump in seven months. The Nasdaq\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s recovery is even punchier than the Dow\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s. The tech-focused index has leapt by 3%, with just a few minutes to go. Tesla, Twitter and Microsoft have all done their bit, with forecast-beating results in the last 24 hours. The rebound has legs! With just 30 minutes to go, the Dow is up an impressive 490 points, or 2%, at 25,073. That means its recovered a large chunk of the Wednesday wobble. Traders in New York must be dizzy! The Dow is holding onto its gains. With two hours to go, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s up 380 points at 24,963, up 1.5%. Microsoft is leading the charge, up 5.7% after impressive results last night. Intel (+5%) and VISA (+3.45%) are close behind. The ongoing market turbulence hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t deterred US company Yeti from floating on the stock market today. Yeti makes high end coolers and outdoor gear, popular with outdoor types like hunters and surfers, and pitmasters who spend time tending barbecues (important work!). Their kit isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t cheap. The Tundra 125 cooler retails at $549 -- for that, you get enough space for 73 cans or dozens of hot dogs, hamburger patties and cold cuts. Yeti floated at $18 per share -- so far, they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve slipped by 7% to $16.80. Not a great start - still, a yeti makes a change from all those Wall Street bears. After tumbling in early trading, European stock markets have recovered to end the day higher. In London, the FTSE 100 has climbed back over the 7,000 point mark, ending up 41 points at 7,004. It would be higher, but for WPP\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s woes. Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB had a good day, gaining 1.8% after Mario Dragji said he was confident that the deadlock over Rome\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s budget plans would be resolved. The French CAC gained 1.6%, and Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s DAX rose 1%, as traders welcomed the rally in New York. On Wall Street, the Dow is now up 350 points - trying to put Wednesday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shocker behind it. Asia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tumble into a bear market overnight is still a concern, though, as market volatility remains high. Fiona Cincotta of City Index says this month\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s losses could be a buying opportunity...... Wall Street started on the front foot with tech stocks on the rise after falling sharply in the previous session. Upbeat results from Microsoft and Telsa have gone some way to calming investor nerves after disappointments from Caterpillar and 3M earlier in the week. Whilst a slew of risk factors have hit traders confidence hard this month, investors will be looking searching for the bottom of this recent shake out. So far market shake out\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s this year have been buying opportunities and whilst we are still in a bull market, we don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t see why this one should be any different right now. Neil MacKinnon, Global Macro Strategist at VTB Capital, says today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s governing council meeting came at a tricky time for the ECB. The ECB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision to hold current interest rate levels at 0% takes place at a time of a cyclical slowdown in the Eurozone economies, as well as persistently subdued core CPI inflation. Business growth is at its slowest in two years and companies\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 expectations of future growth have slipped to the lowest in four years. The Italian budget drama is also high on the agenda and the stand-off between Rome and Brussels is unlikely to be resolved. Also noteworthy is the risk of a worsening \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcdoom-loop\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 between Italian banks and their holdings of domestic sovereign debt. Italy is not Greece and Rome will react badly if the ECB resorts to its \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcenforcement tools\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 of closing down bond purchases and turning off the liquidity tap for the Italian banking system.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s some expert reaction to the European Central Bank press conference today: Anna Stupnytska, global economist at Fidelity International, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153At today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s press conference Draghi chose to strike a relatively hawkish note, while acknowledging somewhat weaker economic momentum as of late. There has been some concern in the market about a number of disappointing data prints this month, including the flash PMIs yesterday, but evidence so far has not been strong enough to change the ECB stance. Anthony Kurukgy, Senior Sales Trader at Foenix Partners Mario Draghi stuck to the script again at today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ECB Press Conference, delivering yet another \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcbalanced\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 assessment of the eurozone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy. The ECB President quelled recent concerns of weaker economic data as merely a slowdown of growth momentum, not a downturn. This aside, the ECB remain committed to ending the central bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bond-buying programme come December. Transitory or not, Draghi and Co. will need to buy themselves more time to distinguish what effect trade wars, Brexit and the recent Italian budget crisis will have on its interest rate hike timeline in 2019. Silvia Dall\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Angelo, Senior Economist, Hermes Investment Management The bottom line is that the ECB is on a gradual path of monetary policy normalisation for now, but risks from protectionism, a further slowdown in external demand, domestic political instability, Brexit and volatility in financial markets cast a dark shadow on the ECB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s plans. Policy uncertainty has increased both externally and domestically: international trade tensions have remained high, there is no solution for the Brexit issue in sight, and the Italian government seems determined to defy the European fiscal rules. The recent turmoil in financial markets is a new addition to the list of downside risks. Marina Mensah-Afoakwah, Senior Economist at the CEBR Between Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s budget drama and the precarious nature of Brexit, there is a lot that threatens the Eurozone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stability. For the time being these pressures haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t risen to a level requiring ECB intervention. Time will tell however, as latest figures suggest cracks are beginning to show in the region\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bounceback on Wall Street means some investors may be snaffling up bargains. Or at least, what they hope are bargains. CNBC explains why traders may be putting their toes into the water again: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The technical picture has turned increasingly bearish this month,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Ed Yardeni, president and chief investment strategist at Yardeni Research. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The percentage of S&amp;P 500 companies trading above their 200-day moving averages was down to 37% after yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s debacle.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd He noted, however, that prior similar declines during this bull market have \u00e2\u20ac\u0153marked buying opportunities.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Yardeni added: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153If this is still a bull market, as we believe it is, then the latest bearish technicals and October\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s swoon should mark the latest buying opportunity.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Back in the markets, shares are rising in New York as traders return to the fray after yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s alarming late sell-off. The Dow Jones industrial average jumped by 192 points at the open, or 0.8%. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s an encouraging start, after Wednesday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 608-point slide. The Nasdaq is also recovering, after slumping ingloriously into a correction yesterday, in its worst day since 2011. The strong results from Twitter today, plus Microsoft and Tesla yesterday, may be calming nerves. Tesla has surged by over 8% in early trading, with other carmakers also up (Ford has gained almost 6%). Twitter has leapt by 15%, after beating profit and revenue forecasts today. But it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s early days. Investors will be watching nervously to see if Wall Street can hold onto these gains, or be dragged down again. Mario Draghi warns that there could be \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcuneasiness\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 in the financial markets, unless Britain and the EU make progress towards a Brexit deal. Asked about Brexit at today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s press conference, the ECB president says he is confident that a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153good, common sense solution\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd will be found. But he also warns that time is running out - if a deal isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t reached, banks and other businesses will be forced to trigger their contingency plans. As Draghi puts it: If this lack of a solution continues, and approaches the end date, the the private sector itself will have to prepare on the assumption that it will be a hard Brexit. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s where there will be financial uneasiness in markets. Boom! Mario Draghi has admonished politicians, such as Donald Trump, who put pressure on central banks to change their policy. He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been asked the pressure on the European Central Bank and the Fed to maintain their stimulus programmes, or do more. Draghi tells reporters in Frankfurt that these attacks threaten central bank independence. He says: Central bank independence is a precious thing. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s precious because it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s essential for the credibility of the central banks, and credibility is essential for effectiveness. That means giving central banks the independence to deliver their mandates, and to choose which instruments are most effective. If that is eroded, then a central bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s effectiveness is reduced, he warns. Earlier this week, Trump blasted the Fed for being too keen to raise interest rates, accusing it of threatening the US economy. In Europe, the ECB has faced criticism from Germany, for example, over its stimulus programme and record low interest rates. Draghi suggests that politicians should see the big picture: Actually the legislators themselves, who are often the very same people who are arguing for the central bank to do this or that, should be the first ones to care about monetary policy effectiveness and central banks achieving their goals. Q: What options do you have if the financial markets continue to fall, if economic data worsens, or if relations between Italy and the EC deteriorate further? We still have tools in the toolbox, Draghi replies. He reveals that two speakers at this week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Governing Council meeting mentioned its TLTRO programme -- which provides cheap financing to eurozone banks. Mario Draghi is fending off several questions about Italy, and whether he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s worried about the rise in its bond yields. He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s arguing that the spillover impact from Italy onto other countries is limited so far. Q: Are you worried that the spread between Italian and German bonds could continue to widen, perhaps to 400 basis points? Would that cause impairments to Italian banks\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 balance sheets? I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have a crystal ball, Draghi snaps back briskly. But yes, there is a linkage betweem Italian sovereign debt and its banks (which hold a lot of it). If they lose value, they are denting into the capital position of the banks. Mario Draghi adds that he is \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcconfident\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 that an agreement between Italy and the European Commission over its budget will be found . [reminder, the EC rejected Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s plans on Tuesday, but Rome is refusing to rewrite them] Q: What does the ECB think about the clash between Rome and Brussels over Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 2019 budget? Italy is a fiscal discussion, Draghi replies, so it wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t discussed much at today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meeting. Onto questions.. Q) Did the ECB discuss downgrading their assessment of the eurozone economy today? Mario Draghi speaks at some length, explaining that the governing council agreed that economic momentum has weakened, but we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re not facing a downturn. Various \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcidiosyncratic\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 reasons are to blame - such as the slowdown in Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s car sector as manufacturers get to grips with new emission rules. There are also a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcbunch of uncertainties\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, such as the stalemate between the US and China over trade, Brexit, and Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 2019 budget. Plus, Draghi adds, growth is returning to potential when it was clearly above potential in 2017. These risks are not considered enough to merit changing our balance of risks, he insists firmly. Draghi ends his statement with his traditional call for eurozone government to \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcsubstantially step up\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 their structural reforms, to take advantage of the ECB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stimulus measures. Eurozone states must raise their long-term growth potential, he adds. Over in Frankfurt, ECB president Mario Draghi is explaining today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s interest rate decision. He has singled out protectionism, emerging market vulnerabilities and financial market volatility as important risks to the eurozone recovery. However, overall risks are \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcbroadly balanced\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, he says. On inflation, the ECB thinks domestic cost pressures are strengthening and broadening, as wage increases feed through to prices. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Bloomberg\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s take on those durable goods figures: Newsflash: Orders for durable goods at American firms has fallen for the second month running (if you strip out aircraft and defence sales). Core durable goods orders shrank by 0.1% last month, new data shows, following a 0.2% decline in August. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s only a small move, of course, but it suggests US manufacturing isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t sizzling. Perhaps tariffs are having an effect. Twitter\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s earnings beat is going to help drive Wall Street up again, after yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s late rout. The tech-focused Nasdaq is now forecast to jump by 1.7% when trading begins. The Dow is on track to gain 220 points (or more than a third of yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s slump). Electric carmaker Tesla is also likely to surge, after surprising investors with a return to profitability last night. Microsoft also beat forecasts last night, partly thanks to strong growth at its Azure cloud computing division. Twitter isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t the only company beating forecasts today. Comcast, which recently won the battle for Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Sky News, has also impressed investors. Net income jumped by 9% in the last three months, as it attracted more broadband customers. NEWSFLASH: The European Central Bank has (to no-one\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s surprise) left eurozone interest rates at their current record lows. That means the headline borrowing rate remains at zero, while banks face a negative interest rate of -0.4% on their deposits at the ECB (to encourage them to lend the money instead). It also makes three important points: The ECB is still \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcanticipating\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 it will end its bond-buying programme in December, after buying \u00e2\u201a\u00ac15bn of securities each month until the end of the year. The ECB reiterated that it expects to leave rates on hold until at least the summer of 2019, to ensure that inflation returns sustainably to its target of just below 2%. It also restated its plan to reinvest the proceeds of bonds bought under its QE stimulus programme. That would avoid the risk of tightening monetary policy too quickly, even if the ECB has stopped printing any more electronic money. Dr Ben Marder, Senior Lecturer in Marketing at University of Edinburgh Business School, is concerned that Twitter\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s active user base is shrinking. He thinks that the site\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Fake News problem is hurting: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Donald Trump, no matter your opinion of the man, is Twitter gold. His tweets attract vast swathes of traffic to the site and he has no doubt had a positive effect on Twitter\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock price in the past few years. This was a mutually beneficial relationship as Twitter was pivotal for Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 2016 presidential election success. However, despite Twitter posting higher than expected earnings and revenue in Q3 2018, monthly active users have fallen for a second quarter in a row as the company continues to purge bots and fake accounts. It seems Trump is now biting the hand that used to feed him. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Twitter, much like other social media giants are starting to bleed-out from the large thorn in their side which is \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcfake news\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. Worsening the wound are world-wide governments, including the US who are threatening regulatory action against the tech giants for facilitating the dissemination of fake news. Adding to the many great ironies for Trump, he is largely rumoured to be a not so secret proponent of \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcfake news\u00e2\u20ac\u2122.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Par exemple..... Twitter is benefitting from a surge in advertising deals, explains Anthony Capano, managing director of Europe for Rakuten Marketing: While Twitter focused its efforts earlier this year on cleaning the platform of fraudulent actors, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s clear that the focus has returned to investing in global opportunities for advertisers. Earlier in Q3 the platform revealed a host of content partnerships including Bloomberg, Sony Music and NBCUniversal that would bring hundreds of hours of livestreams and other videos to the platform in the Asia-Pacific region. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s important UK marketers see how relevant these opportunities are to their operation. In Britain alone, as many as 35% of our client transactions are now taking place overseas. Some Silicon Valley early risers are waking up to the news that Twitter did better than expected last quarter: Newsflash: Twitter has smashed Wall Street forecasts with its latest financial results. The social network site grew its earnings to 21 cents per share in the last quarter, well ahead of estimates of 14 cents. Revenues came in at $758, beating forecasts of $702m, thanks to a 29% leap in advertising sales. However, Twitter also revealed that the number of monthly active users fell to 326 million; analysts expected 331.5 million. That may be due to Twitter\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s efforts to eradicate trolls, and malicious accounts created to pump out fake news and influence elections. Twitter also warned that it expects to keep losing active users in the current quarter. Shares are soaring in pre-market trading, as investors cheer the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s earnings growth. 2018 has been a pretty rough year for the markets, with nearly $7 trillion (!) wiped off stock values since the end of January. So, the 42 trillion dollar question is whether we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re heading towards a proper, old-fashioned crash... or if these lower prices actually give value. Neil Wilson of Markets.com suggests the long-running bull market hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t run out of steam yet. Stocks could rally if the Federal Reserve decides to slow the pace of future interest rate rises - as Donald Trump has been demanding. Wilson writes: We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re in a period of pressure building to the downside as we get more down days than up and the breadth of the decline is important as is the volume. However whilst the recent spike in volatility may be seen as meaning we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re past the peak, there may yet be a few breaths left in this old bull. Valuations - while not going for a song - are a lot more attractive at about 16x forward earnings. Confidence is clearly lacking however and it may require a softening tone from the Fed to assuage concerns on rates. Softer inflation figures would help greatly and the autumn/winter may provide respite on that front. If we go back a couple of weeks we must recall that this selling started on some very hawkish jawboning by Jerome Powell on rates. This may be the start of the age of the Bears but it may equally be just a tantrum. The macro outlook is not great - China, trade, Italy are all weights but for most of 2018 US investors were able to shrug off any global worries. Advertising giant WPP is having a torrid day, as its new boss gets to grips with the business\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s problems. Shares are down 16%, at their lowest level since December 2012, after it missed sales forecasts and slashed its guidance. CEO Mark Read, who replaced industry veteran Sir Martin Sorrell earlier this year, was blunt about WPP\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s problems, saying: Clearly we have underperformed our competition in the third quarter. We are not going to sugarcoat the reality.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd More here: Facebook has been buffeted by the stock market sell-off. Its shares slid by 5% yesterday, and are down 17% this year as the social network giant faces tough questions about extremism and election interference. In another blow, it has just been fined half a million pounds by Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s information commissioner for not protecting users\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 data. This follows the Cambridge Analytica scandal, which exposed how third party developers had been allowed to access user information without sufficient consent. In monetary terms, \u00c2\u00a3500k is barely a mosquito bite on a mammoth company worth $421bn. But it comes with a stern rebuke from information commissioner Elizabeth Denham, who says: Facebook failed to sufficiently protect the privacy of its users before, during and after the unlawful processing of this data. A company of its size and expertise should have known better and it should have done better. After that shaky start, European stocks have now turn positive for the day! Germany, France and Italy have all rebounded from this morning\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s lows, with Italian banks are leading the rally. Even the FTSE 100 is getting a boost, clawing its way back from that seven-month low. One factor - Wall Street is currently expected to rally in a few hours. The Dow futures show a gain of 224 points, following Wednesday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 608-point rout. Another factor: One of Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s coalition leaders has vowed to step in if a bank or other company needs help. Deputy PM Matteo Salvini, who also leads the right-wing Northern League party, said any help provided would be different from past interventions. Salvini also suggested that investors are too pessimistic about Italy, having driven its bond yields higher in recent weeks. Reuters has more details: Salvini, who is also the leader of the ruling League party, said on the sidelines of a conference in the northern city of Verona that the Italy/Germany bond yield spread would inevitably fall if it followed the real economy. Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell, says investors are nervous about the state of the world. He explains: The chief concerns are the potential negative impacts of higher interest rates, weaker global growth and the knock-on effects of trade tariffs. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The FTSE 100 fell 0.7% in early trading on Thursday to 6,912 with pharmaceuticals, insurers and oil companies the biggest contributors to the index\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decline. Japan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Nikkei index incurred heavy losses, falling 3.7% in a single session.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Back in Australia, insurance group AMP\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shares crashed by 25% today, as it paid the price for past misdeeds. AMP shocked investors by revealing that its wealth management business suffered a $1.5bn asset withdrawal in the last quarter. The company suffered badly from Australia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Royal Commission into banking, earlier this year. That inquiry exposed that AMB had charge customers who had died, and imposed fees even if it didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t provide a services. More here: Our latest Brexit dashboard shows how consumer spending slowed last month, even before the stock market turmoil hit confidence. Two leading economists argue that the government needs to take bold action, by ending austerity and helping businesses navigate Brexit uncertainty: Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s troubled retail sector is reeling from another blow this morning, as Debenhams outlines plans to shut up to 50 stores. The closure plan puts thousands of jobs at risk, on top of tens of thousands of redundancies at fellow chains such as Toys R Us, Mothercare, Carpetright and Maplin. Debenhams dropped the bad news as it reported a \u00c2\u00a3500m annual loss, partly due the cost of writing off unwanted shop leases and IT systems. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s an astonishing amount, for a company only valued at \u00c2\u00a3100m. The closures will take place over the next three to five years, Debs says, as it pulls out of unprofitable stores. Simon Underwood, business recovery partner at accountancy firm Menzies LLP, warns that the days of the traditional department store are numbered. Instead, they will become \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcexperimental showrooms\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, or places for meetings etc. Underwood adds: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The decision to focus on a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcprofitable core\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 of stores is a good one. However, the question is whether closing just ten stores now, with a view to reducing store numbers further over the next three to five years will be enough in view of the speed of changes in the marketplace as consumers shift to buying online. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The high street needs support, but some of the ideas being mooted by Government could prove counterproductive. For example, the Chairman of John Lewis, Sir Charlie Mayfield has recently spoken out against the Amazon tax and many bricks and mortar retailers fear that a blanket levy on online sales would be tantamount to hitting the high street when it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s down, as most of them sell goods online too. German firms are also anxious about the danger that Britain leaves the EU without a deal, says IFO. The row between Italy and the EU over its 2019 budget is another worry, it adds. Just in: business morale in Germany has taken a tumble this month. The German business climate index produced by the IFO institute dropped to 102.8 this month, down from 103.7 in September. Company bosses said business conditions had deteriorated, while their expectations also become gloomier. Geopolitical tensions, such as the trade wars between the US and China, seem to be hurting. Ifo chief Clemens Fuest blamed \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcglobal uncertainty\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 for the drop in confidence, adding: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Firms were less satisfied with their current business situation and less optimistic about the months ahead. Growing global uncertainty is increasingly taking its toll on the German economy.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Worryingly, there doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t seem to be a single cause for the current sell-off (unlike in 2008, say, or in 2015 when investors fretted about China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy). Instead, a cocktail of problems are being blamed, as traders worry that the long bull market in shares may be petering out. Kerry Craig, global market strategist at JP Morgan Asset Management, says the lack of a single cause for the current volatility is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153troubling\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. There are many symptoms but no one can diagnose the illness. Geopolitics, rising bond U.S. bond yields, a more hawkish looking U.S. Federal Reserve (the Fed), slowing Chinese growth, a strong U.S. dollar and the already well known problems in some emerging economies have all contributed to the market unease. The focus for investors had been on corporate earnings. Against all the macro headwinds, the micro factor of strong U.S. corporate earnings had been enough to insulate the market. So far the U.S. earnings season has been decent, with approximately 30% of the S&amp;P 500 companies by market capitalization having reported and 83% of those having beaten analyst\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s expectations for earnings. The anxiety now in markets stems from whether this is the peak in earnings and growth, as higher input costs from rising wages, the impact of tariffs and higher funding costs start to impinge on corporate margins. The problems in the U.S. market are having knock-on effects on global equities, and the rising U.S. dollar is exacerbating difficulties for emerging markets and Asia. However, the global economy is still growing and corporate earnings are still positive. They may not grow as fast or be as positive from here on out, but these are still reasons to favour risk assets and equities. Markets are likely to remain jittery for the rest of the year. The upcoming G20 meeting is not likely to result in a resolution of the trade dispute between the U.S. and China. Both sides are caught in a case of political brinkmanship. There are heavy losses in Europe too. Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s DAX index has fallen by 0.8%, to its lowest level since December 2016. France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s CAC hit its lowest level since March 2017, down another 0.4% in early trading. Here are the best and worst performing shares on the FTSE 100 this morning. Utilities, precious metal miners, and other defensive stocks are in - most other companies are out! Boom! Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE 100 has hit a seven-month low at the start of trading in London. The blue-chip index has fallen by 75 points to 6887, a drop of over 1%, its lowest level since late March. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s now lost around 8% of its value in the last four weeks, as the market sell-off has gathered pace. Advertising giant WPP are leading the selloff, slumping by 18% after reporting that revenues 1.5% fell in the last quarter. Consumer goods producers, technology companies, miners and energy firms are also in the red, as Europe picks up the sell-off baton from Asia. Some context: Stephen Innis of foreign exchange firm OANDA fears that the US stock markets are on the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153verge of crumbling\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, after last night\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s late rout. If people are struggling to find a driver I suggest, they wake up and smell the coffee. The catalysts are nothing new -- Tariffs, Italy, Brexit, Saudi Arabia. But with the towering pillars of market strength, the US equity markets, is looking ever so fragile and on the verge of crumbling. The air is so thick with a sense of foreboding that you can cut it with a dull butter knife. Maybe there are too many things going sideways clouding investor judgement, but things could turn nasty in a heartbeat. With risk sentiment tanking, we could be facing \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the early stages of a protracted equity market meltdown\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, he adds. Yesterday was the worst day for tech stocks on Wall Street for seven years, dragging the Nasdaq into bear-market territory and wiping out the Dow\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 2018 gains. And today, markets were in retreat from Sydney to Shanghai, my colleague Martin Farrer reports: In Australia the benchmark ASX200 closed down 164 points or 2.8% as it suffered its fifth straight day of losses. In Japan the Nikkei was off 3.7% and has now dropped around 13% from a 27-year peak of 24,448.07 touched in early October. A broad indicator of shares in the region \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the MSCI Asia Pacific index \u00e2\u20ac\u201c has now fallen 20.3% from the year-to-date high set on 29 January, representing an official bear market. The Vix \u00e2\u20ac\u0153fear\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd index, which measures volatility across the market, has spiked sharply this week and was up 21% overnight. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t thought that selling would be this steep. This sell-off makes us think the market may be set for capitulation,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Shoji Hirakawa, chief global strategist at Tokai Tokyo Research Center. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. The sell-off in global stock markets is accelerating today, as stocks keep sliding across the globe. Asian stock markets have plunged into bear market territory, meaning they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve shed 20% of their value since their highs in January. Fears over the health of the global economy, future US interest rate rises, Jamal Khashoggi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s murder, and America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade war with China are all being blamed as investors try to grab the nearest tin hat to ride out the storm. Some disappointing corporate results this week - including from industry bellwether Caterpillar - have also dampened the mood, and raised fears that growth is slowing. After a very bruising session, Japan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Nikkei has tumbled by 3.7%, while Australia has lost 2.8%. China suffered fresh losses too, taking it deeper into its own bear market. Analysts are worried that the sell-off has further to run, and could turn into a full-blown collapse. As Greg McKenna, an independent markets strategist in Australia, put it: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The fear is palpable in stock markets at the moment,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This could get much worse before it gets better. Collapses happen after falls. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the danger.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd That follows another rocky session on Wall Street, where the Dow slumped by another 600 points (-2.4%). That wipes out all its gains for this year, as a wave of worry swept the trading floors. Optimism is out, and volatility is back. Bears are prowling the trading floors this morning in Europe too. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE 100 is expected to fall, and could hit a new seven-month low. Other European markets are expected to slide too, as the spat between Rome and Brussels over next year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s budget continues. The EU has asked for a new version within three weeks, but Italy is refusing to rewrite its plans. Also coming up The European Central Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s governing council is meeting today to set monetary policy. No change is expected, but Mario Draghi will be quizzed by journalists.

                "bodyText":"Time for a recap Global stock markets are on track for their worst month in five years ,after another day of losses. In London, the FTSE 100 has lost nearly 1% to close at its weakest level since March. At one point it hit a 22-month low. The US stock markets is also in the red today. Technology stocks are leading the sell-off, after Amazon and Alphabet underwhelmed Wall Street with their results last night. Investors have not taken much cheer from the latest US GDP report, which showed a slightly faster acceleration in growth than expected. Consumer spending and government spending both boosted growth, but trade was a drag. Asia-Pacific markets also ended the week with another bout of volatility, and fears that contagion was spreading through the markets. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our latest news story on the markets, after a turbulent week: Shares in New York are also climbing back from their earlier lows. The Dow is now down just 140 points, or 0.6%, as a degree of calm returns to Wall Street. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE 250, an index of smaller companies, also lost almost 1% today: As European traders count their losses and head to the pub, their counterparts on Wall Street have just endured a rough morning Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the latest damage: Dow Jones industrial average: down 279 points or 1.1% at 24,715 S&amp;P 500: down 43 points or 1.6% at 2,661 Nasdaq: down 153 points or 2.2% at 6,862 Neil Wilson of Markets.com says the FAANG stocks (Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix and Google) are doing the damage. He writes: Bloody FAANGs means Halloween comes early in nightmare month for equities. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153No respite for equity markets today as the weight of the FAANGs dragged on the wider market and raises a real risk that this selloff is about to turn into a full bear market. The S&amp;P 500 has now dipped into correction territory in little over a month \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a steep selloff. Amazon and Alphabet earnings disappointed with less upbeat outlooks casting a cloud over tech stocks in particular. Bear in mind that it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s still the only real bright spot out there YTD and now it looks as though it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s starting to rollover. If FAANGs are rolling over the weaker sector stocks are very vulnerable \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Snap off 15% today after reporting another quarter of declining users and offered a pessimistic outlook. Snap\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s investment thesis was always shaky and the truth is it was never going to deliver. Quality like Microsoft and Intel are holding relatively firm \u00e2\u20ac\u201c they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve not seen sky high valuations as some of the FAANGs so are seen a bit safer, while both have delivered on earnings. Just in: Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock market has ended the day solidly in the red, at the end of a volatile week. However, the losses aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t quite as bad as earlier in the day, when stocks were languishing at a 22-month low. The FTSE 100 closed 64 points lower, or -0.92%, at 6,939 points. Things looked worse an hour ago, before shares rallied into the closing auction in London. Evraz was the biggest faller, down 6.3%, followed by online supermarket chain Ocada (-5%) and BT (-4.5%). There are losses in Europe: Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s DAX: -0.94% French CAC: -1.3% Italian FTSE MIB: -0.7% Fiona Cincotta of City Index says: The large-scale volatility that we have seen across the week was certainly not packing away for the weekend early. The bloodbath continued with markets across the globe slamming lower as concerns over US corporate results overshadowed a robust US GDP figure. As shares slide, investors are piling into the safety of government bonds. Debt issued by Germany and America is always attractive on these occasions. So as prices leap, bond yields (the interest on the bond) are dropping. Newsflash: The FTSE 100 just hit its lowest level since December 2016. It fell 152 points, or over 2%, to 6851, as markets end the week on a low. Technology stocks had been a stellar performer earlier this year. But now they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re sliding, and dragging the wider markets down, according to David Madden of CMC Markets: The S&amp;P 500 has fallen into correction territory as the decline in stocks intensifies. Amazon and Alphabet shares are in the red after both companies missed on revenue forecasts last night, and Amazon\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s guidance was also below the consensus estimate. US tech stocks set a series of record-highs throughout the summer, and they were the first to fall in the recent market rout. There is a sense that the tech sector is setting the pace for the rest of the world. The sell-off is gathering pace, again. The S&amp;P 500 index, which covers a broader spread of the US economy than the Dow, is down 2.2%. That puts the S&amp;P 500 into correction territory, more than 10% off its peak in September. The good news for City investors is that this week of pain is almost over. The bad news is that the FTSE 100 is wallowing close its lowest level since December 2016. The blue-chip Footsie index is down 117 points, or almost 1.7%, at 6887. Steel and mining company Evraz is the biggest faller, down 7.6% after mixed production numbers yesterday. WPP has shed another 4.6%, after Thursday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rout following a profits warning. Several economists are predicting that the US economy will slow in the quarters ahead, after six months of solid growth. Capital Economics believes tighter monetary policy is already having an impact: At 3.5% annualised, GDP growth remained unusually strong in the third quarter, thanks partly to this year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fiscal stimulus, but there are signs that higher interest rates are beginning to have a bigger restraining effect. Once the boost from fiscal stimulus fades next year, we expect economic growth to slow below its potential rate, forcing the Fed to the side-lines by mid-2019. Kay Daniel Neufeld, managing economist of CEBR, believes the trade war with China will also hurt growth. Q3 growth surprised on the upside, showing that the US economy continues to perform with considerable momentum in the second half of the year. However, house-made problems including the deteriorating global trading conditions and the fast pace of monetary tightening spell trouble for the coming quarters.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Ouch! The Dow Jones industrial average is now down 400 points, or 1.7%, as the market turmoil continues. Another tech firm, Cisco, is the biggest faller on the Dow (down 2.1%), followed by Home Depot (-1.9%) and American Express (-1.7%). Technology stocks are sliding in New York, particularly those which have disappointed Wall Street. Hard drive maker Western Digital has tumbled by 17%, after reporting a 3% drop in revenues for the last quarter. Profits shrank by 24%. Amazon has slumped by 7.5% after giving disappointing guidance for the holiday period last night. Google parent company Alphabet has shed 3%. This is all weighing on the Nasdaq, of course, which is down over 2%. The bell has rung and stronger-than-expected US growth in Q3 has failed to cheer investors. Opening scores: Dow Jones: -242 points or -1% at 24,742 S&amp;P 500: -39 points or -1.5% at 2,666 Nasdaq: -186 points or -2.5% at 7,132 Three minutes until the opening bell on Wall Street... Balraj Sroya, trader at currency firm Foenix Partners, says the US growth figures are key to both Trump and the Federal Reserve: Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s mantra of \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcMaking America Great Again\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 is echoing across the US economy as third quarter GDP growth outpaced market consensus with a print of 3.5%. Consumer spending and businesses increasing their inventories aided the strongest back to back quarters for growth in over two years. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s print was crucial for Trump and the GOP ahead of the Midterm elections as GDP seems to be aligning with the President\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s target for 2018, however it could spark the Fed to consider a more aggressive monetary policy. The detail behind the headline GDP growth figure, published by the US Commerce Department, shows that consumer spending boosted the economy in the third quarter, but net trade was a drag as exports fell but imports rose. The Department said: The increase in real GDP in the third quarter reflected positive contributions from personal consumption expenditures, private inventory investment, state and local government spending, federal government spending, and nonresidential fixed investment that were partly offset by negative contributions from exports and residential fixed investment. Imports, which are a subtraction in the calculation of GDP, increased. The deceleration in real GDP growth in the third quarter reflected a downturn in exports and a deceleration in nonresidential fixed investment. Imports increased in the third quarter after decreasing in the second. These movements were partly offset by an upturn in private inventory investment. Nancy Curtin, chief investment officer at Close Brothers Asset Management, said Donald Trump is likely to jump on the US growth figures: We can expect President Trump to wax lyrical about these results in the run up to the congressional midterm elections, adding evidence to his promise on expanding the economy. However, growth has already moderated and will continue to do so in 2019 as the tax cut boost dissipates and inflation tightens its grip as a result of Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tit for tat with China. (No Trump tweet about Q3 as yet...) Pre-trading on Wall Street has picked up after the news that US growth slowed less than expected in the third quarter, to 3.5%. US futures are still down before the opening bell, but less so: Dow Jones: -177 points or -0.7% S&amp;P 500: -24 points or -0.9% Nasdaq: -124 points or -1.8% Breaking: The US economy grew by 3.5% in the third quarter, faster than the 3.3% predicted by economists. It was a slowdown compared with the second quarter, when the economy grew by 4.2% on an annual basis. Economists at Investec have taken a step back from this week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s market mayhem to look at prospects in the months ahead for the global economy. In a month full of uncertainties, a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcglass half full\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 approach might be to say that there has been some respite in global trade tensions. However the pause looks to be because the Chinese and US authorities are eyeing more constructive talks after the US mid-terms. Even with this respite, risk assets are currently under pressure amid continuing concerns that the Fed may embark on a more aggressive tightening path, concerns over earnings and equity valuations and as other global political concerns have arisen. Furthermore some signs have emerged that suggest recent protectionist actions have spilt over into confidence and growth. But as yet we do not judge risks related to the above to be substantial enough to shift our world GDP forecasts, particularly given supportive fiscal policy in the US and China. We continue to look for 3.8% world growth this year and 3.7% next. Risks though lie to the downside for 2019. The pound is down 0.3% against the dollar at a two-month low of $1.2784. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s partly a story of a stronger dollar, which is up against a basket of currencies ahead of the US GDP number at 1.30pm UK time. Another day, another statement from Patisserie Valerie, the troubled cafe and bakery chain which earlier this month discovered a black hole in its accounts and a \u00c2\u00a31m unpaid tax bill that threatened the firm\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s collapse. The latest news is that Chris Marsh, the firm\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s finance director who was arrested on suspicion of fraud and subsequently bailed, has resigned. Pat Val\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s parent company, Patisserie Holdings, issued a brief statement: Patisserie Holdings plc announces that following the suspension of Chris Marsh on 9 October 2018, the company has now accepted his resignation as the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s finance director with immediate effect, while reserving its position in respect of any potential claims it may have against him. The latest announcement isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t quite surprising as the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s other ones over the past month. Thursdays rebound on Wall Street - with the Dow Jones surging 401 points - is nowhere to be seen today, with global markets on course for their longest losing streak in more than five years. European markets are sharply lower and US futures suggest the Dow could lose another 300-or-so points when the bell goes on Wall Street. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a look at US futures: Dow Jones: -271 points or -1.1% S&amp;P 500: -38 points or -1.4% Nasdaq: -174 points or -2.5% The MSCI all-country index, which tracks shares in 47 countries, was earlier down 0.3% and on track for a fifth week of losses - the longest losing streak since May 2013. Royal Bank of Scotland is weighing on the FTSE 100 this morning, with shares down nearly 5%. The bailed-out bank published third-quarter results this morning, and the detail has underwhelmed investors. Attributable profit - the figure which determines the dividend - was up 14% in the three months to the end of September, at \u00c2\u00a3448m, but it was below expectations of \u00c2\u00a3507m. Operating costs also increased as the bank set aside another \u00c2\u00a3200m for payment protection insurance claims. In better news, pre-tax profit rose 10% in the third quarter, to \u00c2\u00a3961m. But that has not been enough for traders, and RBS is among the top FTSE fallers: Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell, says that hopes appear to have been dashed for a positive end to the week for the FTSE . Any suggestion UK stocks might end the week on a more positive note has been swatted aside after the third quarter sales performance of Amazon and Google\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s parent company Alphabet disappointed after the market close in the US. Given the technology sector helped lead US indices to fresh highs in 2018 and is so dominant, its performance in the current earning season was always likely to be pivotal to investor sentiment. As if traders didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have enough to contend with, later today we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll get US GDP data for the third quarter. Figures are expected to show the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest economy grew by 3.3% in the third quarter, on an annual basis. It would be a slowdown from 4.2% in the second quarter. The figures will be published at 1.30pm, UK time. Connor Campbell, analyst at Spread Ex, says the number could weigh on investor moods: Given that the slightest thing sets the markets off at the moment, it is going to be interesting to see how they deal with this afternoon\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s first look at the US third quarter GDP figure. Analysts are expecting a slowdown from 4.2% in Q2 to 3.3% in Q3, a decline that may only cause further problems at the end of a tiring and tricky week. Let\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s take a closer look at the markets in Europe, where losses are accelerating this morning: As well as the disappointing results (on some measures) from Amazon and Alphabet, investors are also concerned by a number of other risks. To name a few - the US/China trade war, rising US interest rates, instability in emerging markets, and Brexit. Here is our story on how the market volatility has gripped Asian and Australian markets overnight: Opening bells have rung across Europe and the mood is gloomy: FTSE 100: -0.8% Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s DAX: -1.1% France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s CAC: -1% Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB: -0.5% Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s IBEX: -0.6% Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s STOXX 600: -0.6% David Madden, analyst at CMC Markets, explains why Amazon and Alphabet disappointed investors: We heard from tech giants Amazon and Alphabet after the closing bell last night. Amazon topped the earnings per share forecast, but missed on revenue and the guidance. Google\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s parent, Alphabet, exceeded estimates on EPS, but undershot the revenue forecast. Both stocks dropped heavily in the post-market session, and in turn sparked selling across major US indices. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re almost at the end of what has been a hugely volatile week for global stock markets. Wall Street bounced back on Thursday, with the Dow Jones surging 401 points, a gain of 1.6%, to close at 24,984. It followed sharp falls on Wednesday, and the turnaround in sentiment was largely down to technology stocks - after positive Twitter and Microsoft results - industrials companies and banks. But sentiment soured when US tech giants Amazon and Alphabet reported disappointing revenues after the closing bell on Wall Street. It was enough to send US futures lower, which in turn triggered a sell-off in Asia where shares hit 20-month lows. Markets across Europe are expected to open sharply lower this morning as the gloomy sentiment spreads across the Atlantic: We will be following the markets and all the latest business news as this volatile week for global markets draws to a close.",

                "bodyText":"Be gone, October! Wall Street has closed for the day, and the month, with a two-day rally. The Dow and the S&amp;P 500 had both gained around 1% as the closing bell rang. The Nasdaq jumped by 2%, driven by the revival in FAANG stocks. Slightly worryingly, the rally did soften in the last few minutes (like a chocolate in the warm hand of a trick-or-treater). And the monthly losses are still alarming. The S&amp;P fell almost 7% in October, its worst month since 2011. The Dow shed 5%, its roughest month since January 2016. The Nasdaq had a real month to forget, down over 9% in its worst month since November 2008. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s an up-sum of today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trading in London, from Fiona Cincotta of City Index: The FTSE rallied for a third straight session on Wednesday despite a stronger pound, jumping 115 points after a dismal October. October is traditionally a difficult month for equities but the FTSE shedding 4.8% is a significantly larger drop than what we would normally expect. How the beginning of November pans out will be interesting. Of the geopolitical issues which have be weighing on the market, namely Brexit, the Italian standoff with Brussels over spending, the US \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Sino trade war or the slowing global, none have been resolved and we also have the US mid-term elections thrown into the mix. Gains were broad based on the FTSE with Standard Chartered a notable riser following impressive results with profits surging 37% on last year. Standard Chartered reported a pre-tax profit of $1.06 billion, up from $774 million a year before and 9% ahead of estimates. By focusing on what is does best \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Asia \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the bank has managed to sharpen its competitive edge. Costs have been a concern in previous years, but the bank has shown its capabilities at reigning these in. Next fell following lacklustre results. The bellwether dropped close to 3% after results underwhelmed. The retailer confirmed that in store sales fell further in the third quarter, whilst overall sales grew by 2% thanks to a strong performance in online sales. Back in New York, tech shares are still on a tear - pushing the Nasdaq up by almost 3% today. By my maths, that still leaves the Nasdaq down 8% for the month. Good news: October is over, at least for traders in Europe. Better news: European stock markets have all ended today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s session higher, clawing back some of this month\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s losses. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the closing prices: UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE 100: UP 92 points or 1.3% at 7,128 Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s DAX: UP 160 points or 1.4% at 11,447 France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s CAC: UP 51 points of 2.3% at 5,093 That still means European stocks have lost around 5% of their value this month. Could the worst be over? Possibly, but it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s worth noting that nothing has really changed. All the factors blamed for the sell-off - from US interest rate policy to the Italian budget row - are in place. On the other hand, maybe there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s relief that the earnings season hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t been worse. Neil Wilson of Markets.com has a good take: Earnings are not universally strong and outlooks have betrayed some murkiness. But, on the whole, we have more companies beating earnings estimates than missing, and more than the average. Fundamentals are still strong but there are questions about earnings growth from here. So, if the US-China trade war pushes prices up (inflationary), and US wage growth picks up (also inflationary), does the Federal Reserve keep hiking? Or does it hold off, to protect asset prices? Wilson says: The stock market is telling the Fed to stop raising rates. Janet Yellen has come out to urge the Fed to keep to its course, but the signs are the equity market is highly susceptible to a more aggressive course of hiking. The Fed has been here before \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the question is do we get 1998 Greenspan Fed that listens to the equity market, or 2007/08 Bernanke Fed? October was a horrid month despite the gains of the last two days. We could see seasonal factors support further gains into the year-end but the primary trend could remain bearish.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The Dow is holding onto its gains, now up 286 points (+1.15%) at 25,160 points. Wall Street traders are doing their best to end October on a positive note. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decent results from GM, and strong ADP jobs figures, seem to be helping. October\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s volatility probably won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t spook the Federal Reserve out of raising US interest rates again in December. Capital Economics expect Fed chair Jay Powell will pave the way for a pre-Christmas hike, arguing: Although the Fed is unlikely to make any policy changes at next week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meeting, we expect the statement to reiterate the FOMC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s plan to continue gradually raising interest rates, with the next move coming in December. With the latest data showing that activity has continued to expand at a rapid pace, hopes that the recent plunge in the stock market will prompt a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcPowell put\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 are likely to prove misplaced. The US dollar is also surging today, making gains against emerging market currencies such as the Brazilian real and the Turkish lira. Last night, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg hailed the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcStories\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 product as a key future source of growth, and admitted Facebook has reached saturation point in \u00e2\u20ac\u0153developed countries\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Facebook missed analyst forecasts for revenue growth (despite pulling in 33% more than a year ago), but smashed forecasts for earnings. Wall Street is giving Facebook the thumbs-up today, with Royal Bank of Canada providing a list of five reasons to be bullish: Facebook stills owns two of the largest media assets in the world (Facebook and Instagram) and the two largest messaging assets in the world (Messenger &amp; WhatsApp); Our checks and management commentary suggest no material change in Marketer views of the attractiveness of Facebook platforms; Monetization of core Facebook and Instagram assets still has material upside potential and Messenger and WhatsApp are beginning early stages of monetization; Facebook\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s aggressive investments are improving platform security and creating future revenue streams; Even under pressure, Facebook\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s producing impressive growth.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Richard Dickie Hodges, Manager of Nomura Global Dynamic Bond fund, blames US interest rate rise fears for October\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s market slump. Getting firmly into the Halloween spirit, he writes: \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcThe Federal Reserve remains the biggest, scariest vampire in the markets today. As it sucks the life-blood of investment markets with interest rate rises, the so-called \u00e2\u20ac\u0153risk-free rate\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd becomes more attractive, the cost of funding risk rises and all risky assets must adjust to offer higher returns. In other words, they must sell off. \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcBut our Nosferatu is a complex villain \u00e2\u20ac\u201c it cares deeply for its victim. As rates climb, it forces volatility into the stock markets, especially emerging markets with US dollar funding requirements that fear the higher greenback. It is this volatility that may cause the Fed to slow or pause the blood-letting in 2019.\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Halloween is a time for fangs, so it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s appropriate that the FAANG stocks are rallying in New York. With Facebook now up 6.8%, Netflix also up 6.8%, Amazon up 4% and Alphabet up over 3.1%, technology stocks are in demand. But this treat comes after a very tricky October, which saw tech stocks slump by around 10% during the month. Microsoft is leading the Dow\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rally, up 3%, followed by credit card firm VISA (+2.7%), industrial equipment firm Caterpillar (+2.4%) and Apple (+2.1%). There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a Happy Halloween spirit on the New York stock exchange, as the final trading day of a brutal October kicks off. The Dow Jones industrial average has leapt by 251 points, or 1%, to 25,125. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s on top of Tuesday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 400-point leap, and might cheer spirits on Wall Street. But it won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t fix October\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bad losses on its own. The Nasdaq index has surged by 1.6%, as technology stocks rally. Facebook shares have jumped by 5%, as investors show they like last night\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s results from the social network giant. General Motors have surged by 6%, after beating profit and revenue estimates today. European markets are still sharply higher, as traders prepare for Wall Street to open.... Global stock markets is up 0.6% already today, thanks to gains in Asia and Europe. The MSCI All Country World Index has risen to 481.03 points, up from 478 last night. But October has still been a pretty horrific month for stocks. The ACWI ended September at 524 points, meaning it has lost over 8% this month. In points terms, this looks like the biggest destruction of value since the financial crisis of 2008. In percentage terms, it looks like the worst month since May 2012 (when the ACWI fell from 328 points to 297, down 9.4%). The US president reckons shares are going up again today... Boom! The FTSE 100 just nudged a new three-week high after a strong morning\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trading. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s blue-chip index is now up 113 points, or almost 1.67%, at 7153 points, as traders try to shake off their October blues. Mining groups such as Antofagasta and Glencore are among the top risers, along with equipment rental firm Ashtead and banking group Standard Chartered (after its strong results this morning). Retailers are struggling, though, after Next reported slower growth this morning. Remember: The FTSE 100 started the month over 7,500 points, so it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s still down 5% this month alone. Connor Campbell of SpreadEx says traders are hoping for peace in the global trade wars: The unspooked celebrations continued on Wednesday, the markets wringing all they can from Donald Trump commenting on Tuesday that a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcgreat deal\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 with China is on its way, undoing some of the renewed trade war fears that had hit on Monday night. With basically every major sector in the green \u00e2\u20ac\u201c spare a thought for Next, languishing at the bottom of the index following its latest high street woes \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the FTSE could jump more than 100 points as the day progressed. That lifted it above 7150 for the first time in 3 weeks, the index scraping off the top layer of October\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s losses while coming nowhere close to mounting a full on recovery. Another reason for optimism: Canada\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy expanded by 0.1% in August, a better performance than expected. Newsflash: American companies took on staff at a healthy pace this month. US firms created 227,000 new jobs this month, beating expectations of 189,000 fresh hires. Services companies led the way, expanding their payrolls by 189,000 to the total while construction and manufacturing firms both hired 17,000 new workers. That suggests the US economy remains robust, and could mean this Friday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Non-Farm Payroll (employment report) is strong too. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a little early for 2019 market predictions, but we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll make an exception for this one: It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a Happy Halloween for carmaker General Motors, which has just smashed Wall Street expectations. GM has also raised expectations for the months ahead, which should cheer US investors. Reuters has the details: General Motors on Wednesday posted far stronger-than-expected quarterly profit and said its full-year earnings forecast would come in at the high end of its forecast due to strong demand in North America. The Detroit automaker reported third-quarter net income of $2.53 billion, or $1.75 a share, compared with a loss last year of $2.98 billion, or $2.03 a share. Last year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s quarter included a charge related to Europe. Excluding one-time items, GM earned $1.87 a share in the third quarter, easily beating the $1.25 analysts polled by Refinitiv estimates had expected. Revenue in the quarter rose 6.4 percent to $35.8 billion, above the $34.85 billion analysts had expected. A quick catch-up on the markets: Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE 100: Up 105 points or 1.5% at 7141, a 3-week high Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Stoxx 600: Up 5 points or 1.6% at 361, a nine-day high Japan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Nikkei: Closed 463 points higher at 21,920, up 2.16% China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Shanghai Composite index: Closed 35 points higher at 2,602, up 1.35% The latest inflation data has given eurozone policymakers a Halloween headache. Consumer prices across the single-currency bloc rose by 2.2% this month, the fastest rate since 2014, up from 2.1% in September Core inflation, which measures underlying price pressures, jumped to 1.1% from 0.9% a month ago. That suggests the European Central Bank is right to rein in its stimulus plans, and halt bond-buying at the end of 2018. However, we learned yesterday that the eurozone economy slowed sharply over the summer -- which might mean more stimulus is needed. Separately, unemployment rate across the eurozone was unchanged last month at 8.1%. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the joint-lowest rate in a decade, but also much higher than America (3.7%) and the UK (4%). It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a grim day for UK butchers chain Crawshaw Group. The supplier of sausages, chops, joints and pies is falling into administration. This puts 600 jobs at risk across 54 stores, which could close unless a buyer can be found. My colleague Julia Kollewe explains: The Yorkshire-based company, which was founded in 1954, has been talking to investors over the past month but has failed to raise the funds it needed. It expects to appoint administrators later on Wednesday who will then try to find buyers for the business and its assets. Crawshaw has 42 high street stores and 12 factory outlet stores across the Midlands and the north of England. Full marks to the Bond Vigilante\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s team at M&amp;G, who have produced some spooktacular charts today. The first shows the remorseless march of US student debt, which has tripled over the last decade. Laura Frost, fixed interest investment specialist at M&amp;G, says this debt burden can undermine the wider economy. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153US Federal Reserve (Fed) Chairman Jerome Powell recently warned about the ever-increasing amount of US student debt outstanding: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153You do stand to see longer-term negative effects on people who can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t pay off their student loans. It hurts their credit rating, it impacts the entire half of their economic life.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Student debt also impacts the overall economy: as graduates seek to repay their loans, they are forced to make concessions to their financial consumption, leading to an ever-growing drag on the economy. They buy fewer goods and services and are delayed in joining the housing ladder, with many choosing (or having) to rent instead. On top of this, student debt sees the highest 90+ day delinquency rate of all US consumer credit.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Readers of a nervous disposition should take a deep breath, before looking at the next chart -- the interest rate on longterm US bonds. After falling steadily for decades, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s started going up! Frost explains why it matters: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The long-end of the US Treasury market has often been described as a giant anaconda: it draws little attention as it sleeps most of the time, but the minute it wakes up, everybody around shakes. US 30-year bonds don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t bite, but their moves can be as poisonous as they basically determine millions of mortgage rates, as well as the price that governments and companies around the world pay for debt. The 30-year Treasury yield has remained within the support and resistance level shown for over 30 years, rallying 6% over the period and giving investors a long bull run. Does the recent breach through this level mean that the anaconda is beginning to stir?\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Finally, a picture that might scare Donald Trump - it shows how US central bankers have struggled to maintain full employment, without triggering a recession. Frost explains: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153With US unemployment at rock-bottom levels and the stock market at near record highs, the Fed has begun hiking rates in an attempt to engineer a soft landing: it wants to slow the economy enough to avoid an overheating, but not so much that it causes a recession. How many times over the past 70 years has the Fed successfully managed to do this and return unemployment (green line) back up to its natural level (blue line) without a recession ensuing (vertical bars)? You\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be scared after counting\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The slump in Red October has dragged many global stock markets into negative territory for this year. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a selection of the best and worst performers in 2018: Bovespa Stock Index (Brazil) +9.7% NASDAQ 100 +6.5% (US) Dow Jones Industrial Average (US) +0.6% S&amp;P 500 +0.3% (US) Nikkei 225 (Japan) -3.7% CAC 40 (Paris) -4.5% FTSE 100 (UK) -7.3% DAX Xetra (Germany) -11.4% Hang Seng (Hong Kong) -16.5% SSE Composite (China) -22.3% But there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s still time for a turnaround. Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell, says: The markets are racing ahead following a very good session last night in the US where the S&amp;P, Nasdaq and Dow Jones all posted gains in excess of 1.5%. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s now the turn of European and Asian stocks to join the rally with the FTSE 100 shooting up 1.5% in early trading on Wednesday and Japan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Nikkei 225 index jumping 2.2%. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The latest rally means the S&amp;P, NASDAQ and Dow Jones are all back in positive territory for the year. The only other major index to share this status is Brazil\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Bovespa index, up 9.7% so far this year. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The upturn in the market is positive for investors, although the main UK indices still have some way to go before they get back into the black. The FTSE 100 is currently down 7.3% year-to-date, and the FTSE 250 down 8.7%. Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets, says markets may be turning the corner, after a rough October: Asia markets managed to close out the month of October and post their second consecutive day of gains in what has been a pretty poor month for equity markets in general. This rebound could well be down to some end of month position adjusting, however there have been some indications in the past few days that we might be starting to see a bit of a short term base, with most of the bad news already priced in to some extent. American\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get enough of Halloween, so Wall Street is eager to join today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rally. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the pre-market calls from CMC Markets: Dow Jones is expected to open 136 points higher at 25,010 S&amp;P500 is expected to open 18 points higher at 2,700 The FTSE 100 is continuing to push higher. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s now up 115 points, or 1.6% to 7150. Nearly every sector is up, led by manufacturers, energy firms, tech stocks and banks: Here are the top risers on the Footsie this morning However, this still leaves the FTSE 100 nursing a 5% loss for October (it started the month at 7,510). Despite today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Halloween rally, global markets are still on track for their worst month since the financial crisis. Figures calculated earlier this week showed that $8 trillion had been wiped off global stocks in October. Trade wars, the slowdown in China, tensions in the eurozone and Brexit have all encouraged investors to ditch risky stocks. Naeem Aslam of Think Markets says: Smart money is running for the hill and this was the message which October brought for the global equity market. Global stocks lost over $8 trillion in October, a headline which suits the best on the Halloween day. Investors are refusing to be spooked on Halloween, says Connor Campbell of SpreadEX: With October containing as much red as the goriest of slasher flicks, the markets oddly chose to rebound on what would have been an entirely calendar-appropriate day to continue the month\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trading horrors. Building on Tuesday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s gains, the FTSE shot up 1.3% after the bell, allowing the index to cross 7100 for the first time in 3 weeks. It benefited from the market-wide shift in sentiment, which itself came despite further evidence that the trade war is hurting the Chinese economy, as the country suffered a slide in manufacturing activity. Overnight, China got the shivers, as manufacturing activity fell and the yuan was fixed at a new 10-year low to the dollar. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rally is welcome, but it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not enough to wipe out this month\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s losses. October has been particularly bad for US investors, with the main indices falling sharply. CNBC has crunched the numbers, and explains: After Tuesday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s comeback, the Dow is down 5.9 percent this month, still its worst performance since August 2015. The S&amp;P 500 is off by 7.9 percent in October, on track for its worst month since May 2010. On Monday, the S&amp;P 500 closed in correction territory, down 10.2 percent from its record. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Obviously we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re in a correction phase of the stock market and I think investors have to realize that,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Bruce Bittles, chief investment strategist at Baird. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The monetary environment has changed. As you can see, even with a 10 percent change in the stock markets, interest rates have barely moved lower.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd European stocks are all jumping - fortunately not with fright. Weeeee! The FTSE 100 is flying faster than a rocket. The blue-chip index has gained 88 points, or 1.2%, to 7124, clawing back some of this month\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s losses. Bank Standard Chartered is leading the charge, up 4% after reporting that profits rose from $557m to $752m in the last quarter. Retailer Next is struggling, though, down almost 5%. Next reported that full priced shares are up 2% year-on-year, but retail sales (at its high street stores) have plunged by 8.0% in the last quarter. Online sales growth has slowed, to just +12.7% compared to +14.8% in the year to date. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the financial markets, the world economy, the eurozone and business. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Halloween - a dark time of ritual, dressing-up, and trick-or-treating. But any children touring the City of London must make a special effort to scare investors; they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re well used to shocks and scares this month. October has been a torrid month for equities. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE 100 has shed 6% over the last 30 days, even hitting a 22-month low last week, as global markets took a collective chilly bath. If you really want to make a investor quiver, wave a chart showing how world markets have lose almost 8.5% this month, wiping out trillions of dollars of value. Craig Erlam of trading firm OANDA says there is fear on the trading floors: October has well and truly lived up to its chilling reputation, with stock markets around the globe suffering one of their worst months in recent memory. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been a wild ride for investors and there is no guarantee it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s over yet. Markets may have recovered their early losses and some indices may even be in the green for the week but volatility has not eased and that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a concern. But after a month of gory red, things might be turning. Wall Street rallied last night, with the Dow gaining more than 400 points. Stocks have strengthened in Asia too, with Japan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Nikkei gaining 2% and China up nearly 1.5%. Thea main European markets are also up in early trading. There are still reasons to hide under the bedsheets, though. Yesterday, we learned that eurozone growth has halved. Later today we get fresh unemployment and inflation figures for the eurozone. David Madden of CMC Markets says this data could set the mood for the day, and beyond: The stand-off between the Italian government and the EU continues. Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy grew 0.8% in the third-quarter on an annual basis, which was below the forecast of 0.9%. Matteo Salvini, Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s joint deputy prime minister claimed the underwhelming update is a reason the government needs to increase spending, and in turn increase the budget deficit. The Italian situation could spark another round of the eurozone debt crisis, and given that the country has the third-largest government bond market in the world, the fallout could be enormous. Dealers will be keeping an eye out for the eurozone CPI and unemployment reports which are due out at 10am (UK time). The CPI rate is tipped to be 2.2%, and the jobless rate is expected to hold steady at 8.1%.
