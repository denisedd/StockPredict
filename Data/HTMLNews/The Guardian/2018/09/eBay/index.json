                "bodyText":"The collapse of Lehman Brothers was such a landmark moment in corporate history that a lucrative business has sprung up auctioning off company-branded memorabilia online. Ten years after the bank\u2019s collapse, eBay is offering a motley collection of Lehman merchandise, from baby bibs to paperweights and baseball caps, with price tags in the hundreds of dollars. Collectors seeking a talking point for their office desk would have to fork out $500 (starting price) for a pad of sticky memo notes, printed to celebrate the bank\u2019s 150-year anniversary in 2000. A more modest $55 could buy a Lehman-branded \u201cemergency evacuation kit\u201d, apparently handed out by the company to employees including evacuation instructions, goggles, a flashlight and a whistle. The seller, whose eBay handle is bidearlybidoften, cannot guarantee that the flashlight still works but points out that the kit is more a \u201chistoric relic\u201d than a practical item. \u201cI have given these as special gifts to VIP clients and friends, many of whom are quite wealthy and they time after time are blown away by this novelty item,\u201d runs the promotional blurb. There are also ring binders, a coffee mug and copies of the companies\u2019 annual reports from 2003 to 2005, all for under $130. Most of the Lehman gear on eBay is sold by one man, calling himself Ric Cam, who told the Guardian that he spotted his opportunity when Lehman was on its last legs. Cam said he paid thousands of dollars to a warehouse distribution manager who had access to the Lehman merchandise. Responding to an inquiry sent via eBay, he said: \u201cI had the opportunity to buy the leftovers after the 2008 financial collapse of the Lehman empire. Everything came directly from their promotional division before their demise. \u201cThere was an opportunity and a hunch that just maybe these items would sell as memorabilia and my hunch payed [sic] off.\u201d The result was a treasure trove of Lehman Brothers items that Cam swears are the genuine article, including a laptop bag or a crystal paperweight, both on offer for $89.89. \u201cEverything I sell is authentic Lehman Brothers memorabilia,\u201d said Cam, adding: \u201cI own the last of it.\u201d The items may be rare but demand is slow enough that if you buy a Lehman Brothers baby bib \u2013 for the investment banker\u2019s infant who has everything \u2013 he will throw in a black duffel bag for free.",
