Further escalation is deemed likely because Trump is facing low approval ratings ahead of the US midterm elections in November, while China will not want to be seen to back down.

                "bodyText":"If you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re just tuning in, here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s my colleague Richard Partington on today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade war action: China is to slap tariffs on an additional $60bn (\u00c2\u00a356bn) of imports from the US in retaliation against $200bn of new US import tariffs announced by Donald Trump. The latest moves represent a new step towards a full-scale trade war between the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s two biggest economies. Further escalation is deemed likely because Trump is facing low approval ratings ahead of the US midterm elections while China will not want to be seen to back down. Trump announced his latest escalation of the bitter trade standoff between the two countries late on Monday, promising to introduce the additional border taxes of 10% on Chinese goods from next week. The tariffs \u00e2\u20ac\u201c designed to make US domestic products more competitive against foreign imports \u00e2\u20ac\u201c apply to almost 6,000 items, including consumer goods such as luggage and electronics, housewares and foods. The US president threatened further tariffs on an additional $276bn of goods if Beijing unveils retaliatory measures \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a step that would mean tariffs on all Chinese imports to the US and equate to 4% of world trade. The trade war was already unpopular with some US citizens, even before today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s escalation. CNBC explains: A quarter of registered voters nationally think raising tariffs will do more to protect American jobs and help the U.S. economy, according to an NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll in July. Meanwhile, about half of registered voters said duties will do more to raise the costs of goods or hurt the economy. Sixteen percent responded that levies will not have much of an effect. More here. President Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s attack on China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s alleged electoral interference may be an attempt to rally public support for the plan. My colleague Simon Tisdall fears that the trade war could spark a deeper dispute between the US and China. He points out that president Xi is under growing pressure to respond to Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s actions, and fault lines are building... Stepped-up efforts by Chinese air and naval forces to intercept or prevent \u00e2\u20ac\u0153freedom of navigation\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd patrols by American (and British) warships in the South China Sea could be another unintended consequence of Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade war. Until now, the two issues have been kept separate. But what if a frustrated Xi, who has been attacked at home for being both too hardline and too soft over tariffs, decided to conflate them? Likewise, the Trump administration last week criticised China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s repression of the Muslim Uighur minority in Xinjiang. That unexpected intervention, though backed by the UN and human rights organisations, was seen in Beijing as another gratuitously provocative (and ill-timed) assault on its sovereignty and national interests. Growing US-China strategic rivalry is a fact of 21st century life. Yet at present, Trump is relying on Chinese restraint in a wide range of problem areas as he focuses obsessively on his trade vendetta. It cannot be assumed Xi will be content indefinitely to play the role of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153adult in the room\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. His patience could snap. Few people predict a new cold war, just yet. But the warning signs are there for all to see. Reuters has analysed China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new tariffs on US goods, and found that they are less severe than Beijing proposed last month. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the details: China will levy tariffs on a total of 5,207 U.S. products, at 5% and 10%, instead of the previously proposed rates of 5%, 10%, 20% and 25%, even as the products remain unchanged from the previous plan, the finance ministry said. China will impose a 10% tariff on U.S. products it previously designated for a rate of 20% and 25%, and 5% tariffs on goods previously under the 5% and 10% rates. Items previously designated to be hit by 20% or 25% tariffs included products ranging from liquefied natural gas and mineral ores to coffee and various types of edible oil. Those goods will now be taxed 10%. Goods previously marked under the 10% category included products such as frozen vegetables, cocoa powder and chemical products. Those products will now be taxed 5%. That all adds up to less of an impact on US exporters, and also less pain for Chinese customers (because tariffs are paid by domestic consumers). The boss of Apple, Tim Cook, says he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s optimistic that the US and China will reach a ceasefire in the trade war. Reuters has the details: Apple Inc chief executive Tim Cook, whose products have been spared from new U.S. tariffs imposed on Chinese goods, said on Tuesday he was optimistic that the United States and China will eventually work through their trade differences. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m optimistic because trade is one of those things where it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not a zero-sum game,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Cook told ABC News\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Good Morning America\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd program on Tuesday. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We can trade something and we can both win. So I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m optimistic that the two countries will sort this out and life will go on.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Fawad Razaqzada of Forex.com says global investors are relieved that China hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t unleashed a more severe reaction against Donald Trump today. China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s latest move is measured and not over-aggressive as it now plans to impose 10% tariffs on US goods that it had previously listed for a 20-25% tariff rate. Likewise, the items that were listed for 10% will now only face a 5% tariff. So it looks like China has blinked first, and this puts the US government in a great position to agree on a new trade deal. Over in New York, investors are shrugging off these latest blows in the trade war. Wall Street has opened higher, sending the Dow Jones industrial average up 85 points or 0.33%. China adds that it will \u00e2\u20ac\u0153respond accordingly\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in future, if the US insists in raising tariff rates. So it doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t agree that it is out of bullets, as commerce secretary Wilbur Ross claims. The Chinese government says it hopes America stops creating \u00e2\u20ac\u0153trade frictions\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, and instead maintains a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153mutually beneficial trade relationship\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Boom! China has announced retaliatory action against America, as the trade war intensifies further. Beijing says it will impose tariffs of up to 10% on $60bn of US imports, starting on 24 September. These new levies will cover around 5,000 American products, including aircraft, soya bean oil, smoked beef, coffee and flour (according to a provisional list released last month) In a statement, the Chinese government says this is a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153forced response\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new tariffs on $200bn of its goods overnight. More to follow! Boom: Donald Trump has promised to impose further economic retaliations against China, if it tries to hurt his patriotic supporters. The US president has tweeted that China is trying to interfere in US elections (it makes a change from Russia....), and pledged to retaliate: Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a clip from Wilber Ross\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s interview, arguing that American families won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t really notice the impact of 10% tariffs on $200bn of good from China. By my reckoning, it works out as an extra $160 for every family in the US ($20bn of levies / 126m US households). Of course, some retailers might swallow the tariff themselves, or simply refuse to pay it and buy goods from elsewhere instead. Wilbur Ross also claims that the trade war has strengthened the bonds between the US, the European Union and Japan: The US and the EU didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t look particularly close this summer, when president Trump imposed tariffs on steel imports, and Europe retaliated with levies on orange juice, motorbikes and cranberries from America..... Is Wilbur Ross correct to claim that China is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153out of bullets\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to fight a trade war? By one measure, yes. The US only exported $130bn to China last year. Beijing already imposes tariffs on $50bn worth, so it can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t match America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s $200bn move. But such a narrow view ignores the full interconnected nature of the global economy. China can use other tools if it really wants to make things hot for America. For example it could: Launch a currency war by letting the yuan tumble against the US dollar. That would counter the impact of higher tariffs. Limit US firms from accessing China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s market. That would hurt manufacturers who hope to profit from China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economic revolution, and the sharp increase in middle-class consumers Stop buying US government debt, or even dump its huge stock of Treasury bills onto the market. That would force up America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s cost of borrowing, and potentially rock the markets (currently, China recycles some of the dollars it receives from trade back into US bonds, helping America to service its huge national debt). President Xi might have other ideas to thwart America in the international sphere, of course (last week he was making a big show of friendship with Russia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s president Putin). US Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross is up early, appearing on CNBC to discuss the new tariffs on $200bn of Chinese imports announced by Donald Trump last night. Ross declared it is up to Beijing to decide whether to address America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s concerns over free trade and intellectual property rights. He says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Our purpose is to have constructive negotiations with the Chinese to resolve the fundamental issues. So the question about whether or when to have a discussion is very importantly in their ballpark.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Ross also argued that the tariffs (on everything from frozen turbot to bicycle speedometers) had been carefully chosen to create the smallest disruption to consumers. Ross also dipped into the firearms metaphor bucket, denying that America was shooting from the him and claiming that Beijing was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153out of bullets\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd (because it imports so little, relatively, from America). Larry Hatheway, chief economist at asset manager GAM, believes investors aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t taking the trade war seriously enough. Having seen markets rise in Asia and Europe today, Hatheway warns that the situation could deteriorate sharply, hurting the global economy. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Without question, tariffs are economically counterproductive and create inefficiencies in supply chains, location of production and add costs to firms and consumers. Criticism of the new tariffs from key US business and consumer groups was immediate. Investors may also be hoping that the US mid-term election outcome might temper the Trump Administration\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s willingness to escalate trade tensions. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153But risks remain. One is the unclear rhetoric from the US Trump Administration, which has put forward a variety of explanations for tariffs (elimination of bilateral trade deficits, measures to counter intellectual property right infringement, objections to China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s investment in new technologies, etc). That makes it difficult to know what the basis for an agreement to diffuse the situation might look like. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153In light of today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s market reaction, investors risk being overly complacent about the eventual outcome, which could still escalate with potentially very adverse spill over effects on broader economic activity.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade commissioner, Cecilia Malmstr\u00c3\u00b6m, has criticised Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new tariffs, telling reporters (in Brussels, I think) that they are \u00e2\u20ac\u0153very unfortunate\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. She also disputed Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s claim earlier this year that trade wars are \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcgood and easy to win\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 (if you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re running a big trade deficit) The FT\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Jim Brunsden has the details: This escalation is very unfortunate\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, Cecilia Malmstrom, the EU\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade commissioner, told reporters. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Trade wars are not good and they are not easy to win\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd.... \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We agree with some of the criticism the US has advanced vis-\u00c3\u00a0-vis China\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, Ms Malmstrom said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153But we disagree with the methods the US is using\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. Companies are starting to scramble to protect themselves from trade war damage, says Chris Towner, director at JCRA, a financial risk management consultancy. He reports: We are certainly seeing an increase in firms looking to review their foreign exchange exposures and put together hedging strategies to help them cope with the volatility. In reaction to the trade disputes and follow-up actions, we have seen the Chinese yuan weaken by almost 10% against the US dollar, since the outset of this year. This will act as a buffer for Chinese exporters dealing in the international markets. In other words, a weaker yuan makes Chinese imports more competitive in US markets. Not what Donald Trump is aiming for.... Asian stock markets ended the day on a strong note, despite the latest trade war escalation. China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock market gained almost 2%, Japan rose by 1.8%, and Hong Kong shrugged off its earlier losses to close 0.5% higher. Shares have also risen in Europe with morning, with the FTSE 100 gaining 0.2% and Germany up 0.3%. Arnaud Masset of Swissquote bank says traders have shrugged off trade tensions: The renewed appetite for risky assets suggests that investors are getting tired of this situation and are paying less and less attention to Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tweets and public comments. Analyst at ABN Amro suggest that a 10% tariff might not chuck too much sand in the wheels of global trade: Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade war has already impacted on 2.5% of world trade, says Timme Spakman, economist at Dutch bank ING. And it could get worse, if the White House follows through on its threats to impose even more tariffs on China. Spakman predicts that the trade war will intensify, writing: As President Trump pulled the trigger on 10% additional tariffs on imports from China last night, the percentage of world trade affected by it all just went up to 2.5%. If the US acts on further tariff threats, this could go up to 4% The new measures will cover USD 200bn worth of US imports from China, including jet engines, electronics, and fish. These tariffs, which were announced in June, are a reaction to the tariffs imposed by China in August, which in themselves were retaliatory measures. Given that, China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ministry of commerce has already pledged it will \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcguard its interests\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 and has announced retaliatory tariffs earlier in the year, we don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t expect a deal anytime soon and instead expect further elevation in 2019. We expect the US to impose further tariffs on the remaining imports from China (worth $267bn) and China to retaliate further. Newsflash: Jack Ma, the founder of Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba, has warned that the US-China trade war could rumble on for decades. Speaking at a conference for Alibaba investors in Shanghai, Ma warned that the dispute would be \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a mess\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd for all parties, and could last for 20 years. The full list of Chinese products that will hit with an extra 10% tariff next week (rising to 25% eventually) is online here. Nearly 200 pages long, the list covers almost 6,000 individual items. Some are quite dull, such as coal, printing ink, pneumatic tires and spark plugs. Others are more exotic, from live eels and frogs legs to rail locomotives and chandeliers. But some products have been removed, following public consultation, including devices that receive and transmit voice data. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s good news for Apple, as CNBC explains: Apple\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s smart watch, wireless headphones, and smart speaker will not be affected by the Trump administration\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s latest tariffs on Chinese imports, according to a list of affected products listed on Monday. Some Apple products, including its MacMini, will still be affected. Reuters points out that some consumer safety products made in China, such as bicycle helmets sold by Vista Outdoor and baby car seats and playpens from Graco Inc also were taken off the list. Importantly, rare earth minerals have also been dropped from the provisional list. They\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re used in a wide range of consumer electronics products, so an extra tariff could have hurt US manufacturers. More here. Bloomberg has estimated that the trade war will knock around half a percentage point off China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s growth rate this year. The impact could rise to almost one percentage point, though, once these latest tariffs rise from 10% to 25% in 2019. China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy is growing at around 6.5% per year, so it could absorb such a hit. Paul Donovan of UBS Wealth Management has a good take on the US tariffs: US President Trump announced a staggered increase in US consumer taxes. A 10% tax on goods partially made in China now, a 25% tax after the year-end orgy of consumer spending. It will take some months for the tax to work down supply chains. The burden of this tax will likely hit lower income US consumers. Trump threatened to tax all imports partially made in China if China retaliates. China will probably retaliate. The nuclear option of China selling US Treasuries is not likely at this stage. However, China might fail to appear at a US bond auction or two, to remind the US that the balance of payments is a two-way flow. The tax will slow US growth. Raising taxes normally does slow growth. How soon growth is hit will depend on inventory levels, and the speed with which the tax is passed down supply chains. There may be a fear about \u00e2\u20ac\u0153who is next?\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Once additional tariffs against China are imposed, there is nothing else about China to tweet. Something else will have to fill the Trump Twitter Feed. Reminder: China can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t simply retaliate by slapping a 10% tariff on $200bn of US goods, because it only buys around $130bn of stuff from America each year. And it already has new tariffs on \u00c2\u00a350bn-worth of those imports, meaning Beijing only has $80bn of firepower left. Beijing isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t out of options, though. It could impose a higher tariff on US goods. Or it could announce curbs on US companies operating in China. But either step risks provoking another response from the White House. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a flurry of activity in Beijing right now. The foreign ministry is giving a briefing on trade, and accusing the US of not being sincere. Foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang is telling reporters that America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcunilateral\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 trade actions can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be accepted. The only solution is to hold talks on an equal footing, Geng says. Geng also confirms that China will respond, but doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t outline what these countermeasures might be. Newsflash: China has announced it will retaliate against America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new tariffs....without saying how. The Chinese commerce ministry says it has no choice but to respond to the new 10% tariff on thousands of goods entering the US. And more in sorrow than in anger, the ministry adds that it hopes the US realises the negative consequences of its actions, and corrects its behaviour. America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Information Technology Industry Council (ITI), which represents major tech firms, was quick to criticise these new tariffs. ITI president Dean Garfield said Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153reckless\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd , and would hurt US communities: China must change, but this is not the way to achieve the needed market access in China. More tariffs not only punish American consumers, manufacturers, and businesses of all sizes, they will also diminish the opportunity to negotiate with the Chinese and address longstanding trade issues. If implemented, these tariffs will have both short- and long-term effects on the United States \u00e2\u20ac\u201c from increased prices at the checkout counter to decreased leadership on the emerging technologies that will shape our future.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The US Retail Industry Leaders Association also gave the tariffs the thumbs down. It warned they would dive up the cost of more than $1bn worth of gas grills from China, $843m worth of luggage and travel bags, $825m worth of mattresses, and $1.9bn of vacuum cleaners. Elsa Lignos of RBC Capital Markets believes Americans will soon feel the impact of Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tariffs in the shops: Market reaction was muted as the tariffs had been widely telegraphed (and some cling to hope that the delay of 25% tariffs until January will mean more time for negotiation and reconciliation post midterms \u00e2\u20ac\u201c an idea we think is unlikely). We have now reached a level of affected imports where it will necessarily start to impact consumer prices. The oil price, which is often a good barometer for growth prospects, has dipped since the US tariffs were announced. Brent crude has fallen to $77.78 per barrel, down 0.35% today. Wang Xiao, head of crude research at Guotai Junan Futures, blamed the US-China trade war: The growing trade dispute has hurt trading sentiment. The impact on economic growth is slowly dripping in, which again hurts oil prices,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Somewhat surprisingly, China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock market has actually risen since Donald Trump escalated the trade war. The benchmark Shanghai composite index has jumped by 1.7% today, having slumped to a four-year low on Monday. There is speculation that Beijing could boost its stimulus programme to support the economy through the trade war, which could boost corporate profits. Traders are also relieved that these new tariffs will start at 10%, not at the 25% level floated by Trump recently. And frankly, they may simply be pleased that the uncertainty is over; these tariffs were first floated in July..... A senior Chinese regulator has accused Donald Trump of creating a toxic atmosphere that could undermine efforts to reach a trade pact. Fang Xinghai, vice chairman of China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s securities regulator, also claimed that China wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t cave in to these latest tariffs. Speaking at the port city of Tianjin, Fang criticised Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s negotiating strategy, saying: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153President Trump is a hard-hitting businessman, and he tries to put pressure on China so he can get concessions from our negotiations. I think that kind of tactic is not going to work with China.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Fang added he hopes the two sides can sit down and talk, but warned that the latest U.S. move has \u00e2\u20ac\u0153poisoned\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd the atmosphere, Reuters reports. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. The trade war between America and China has escalated, fuelling fears that the global economy could be dragged down. Overnight, president Donald Trump announced a new 10% tariff of $200bn on Chinese goods arriving in the US from next week. It will rise to 25% at the end of the year. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the latest move in Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s push against \u00e2\u20ac\u0153unfair\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd trade policies, which economists fear will prove counterproductive. Trump hit out at China last night as he announced the move, saying: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153For months, we have urged China to change these unfair practices, and give fair and reciprocal treatment to American companies. We have been very clear about the type of changes that need to be made, and we have given China every opportunity to treat us more fairly. But, so far, China has been unwilling to change its practices.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd And in a typical Trumpian flourish, he added: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I urge China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s leaders to take swift action to end their country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s unfair trade practices. Hopefully, this trade situation will be resolved, in the end, by myself and President Xi of China, for whom I have great respect and affection.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Thousands of Chinese products will now be more expensive in America, from fish, meat and vegetables to chemicals, furniture, metals and electric goods. This will cut demand for these products (hurting the Chinese economy), and also probably drive up prices in US shops (hurting Americans). The move will disappoint the City, where traders had been clinging to hopes of a peace deal. Instead, we are now awaiting China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s retaliation. Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s move means that America will now have tariffs on roughly half of its imports from China (which totalled over $500bn last year). China only imports around $130bn from America, meaning it can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t simply announce a tit-for-tat retaliation. According to Bloomberg, Chinese Vice Premier Liu He will hold a meeting in Beijing on Tuesday morning to discuss the government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s response. China could decide to pull out of planned trade talks in Washington next week, if it feels Trump isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t showing sufficient goodwill.

                "body":"<p>Jack Ma\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s prediction that the US-China trade war could last 20 years sounds plausible. At the very least, the Alibaba billionaire\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s opening analysis is surely correct: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153If you want a short-term solution, there is no solution.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd</p> <p>First, an immediate climbdown by either side is out of the question. Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s imposition of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/sep/17/donald-trump-united-states-threatens-to-impose-200bn-import-tariffs-on-china-in-trade-war\">10% tariffs on $200bn of Chinese imports</a> was quickly followed by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/sep/18/china-us-new-tariffs-donald-trump-trade-war\">China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s retaliation</a> \u00e2\u20ac\u201c duties of up to 10% on $60bn worth of US goods travelling in the other direction. Beijing\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s response was weaker than some had expected but could not be described as a step backwards. China seems to be saying that it has been drawn reluctantly into this tit-for-tat exchange but is prepared to keep going if necessary.</p> <p>Second, the Trump administration structured its tariffs to suggest it is settling in for a long battle \u00e2\u20ac\u201c 10% now, which is too late to increase prices in shops during Thanksgiving, with a threat to go to 25% in 2019. This staggered process seems designed to ease the hit to low-income US consumers, which is tactically sensible from the president\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s point of view. A backlash from swing voters is probably the reaction he fears most.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/sep/18/donald-trumps-reliance-on-chinese-restraint-is-risky\">Donald Trump's reliance on Chinese restraint is risky</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Third, there is no strategic reason for China to back down at this stage. Tariffs will threaten Chinese jobs but Beijing can always try to boost domestic demand to offset the likely fall in exports to the US. Within limits, it can also let the yuan slide against the US dollar to regain competitive clout. In short, it can wait to see what happens. An authoritarian one-party regime doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have to worry about the electoral cycle.</p> <p>Fourth, the pure rhetoric does not suggest compromise. US commerce secretary Wilbur Ross declared that China is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153out of bullets\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, as if taunting Beijing. On the Chinese side, they probably wonder whether Washington is even interested in a negotiated settlement, which was a fair line of speculation even before Tuesday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s escalation. As Keith Wade, chief economist at Schroders, puts it: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The red lines on each side are too ideological and entrenched to allow much room for manoeuvre.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd China sees its trade policies as essential to its next stage of economic growth; Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u0153America First\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd approach blames China for hollowing out large parts of the US economy.</p> <p>So settle back and expect more of the same. Financial markets haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t been panicked so far, either because the short-term damage to global trade looks modest, or because it is still possible to cling to the idea that Trump won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t follow through on his threat to raise tariffs to 25% in the new year. But it seems more likely that Trump discovers that a trade war with China cannot be \u00e2\u20ac\u0153won\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd quickly and opts for more extreme measures. He needs something to show his supporters, which he doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t seem close to getting yet. A bigger trade war, with other countries drawn in, is suddenly a real risk.</p> <h2>Bitcoin is a sideshow for regulators</h2> <p>The Treasury select committee has got one thing right: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153cryptocurrencies\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd like bitcoin aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t really currencies because they don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t do most of the things expected of a currency.</p> <p>They don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t store value since the price can halve suddenly.

                "bodyText":"Jack Ma\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s prediction that the US-China trade war could last 20 years sounds plausible. At the very least, the Alibaba billionaire\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s opening analysis is surely correct: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153If you want a short-term solution, there is no solution.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd First, an immediate climbdown by either side is out of the question. Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s imposition of 10% tariffs on $200bn of Chinese imports was quickly followed by China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s retaliation \u00e2\u20ac\u201c duties of up to 10% on $60bn worth of US goods travelling in the other direction. Beijing\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s response was weaker than some had expected but could not be described as a step backwards. China seems to be saying that it has been drawn reluctantly into this tit-for-tat exchange but is prepared to keep going if necessary. Second, the Trump administration structured its tariffs to suggest it is settling in for a long battle \u00e2\u20ac\u201c 10% now, which is too late to increase prices in shops during Thanksgiving, with a threat to go to 25% in 2019. This staggered process seems designed to ease the hit to low-income US consumers, which is tactically sensible from the president\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s point of view. A backlash from swing voters is probably the reaction he fears most. Third, there is no strategic reason for China to back down at this stage. Tariffs will threaten Chinese jobs but Beijing can always try to boost domestic demand to offset the likely fall in exports to the US. Within limits, it can also let the yuan slide against the US dollar to regain competitive clout. In short, it can wait to see what happens. An authoritarian one-party regime doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have to worry about the electoral cycle. Fourth, the pure rhetoric does not suggest compromise. US commerce secretary Wilbur Ross declared that China is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153out of bullets\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, as if taunting Beijing. On the Chinese side, they probably wonder whether Washington is even interested in a negotiated settlement, which was a fair line of speculation even before Tuesday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s escalation. As Keith Wade, chief economist at Schroders, puts it: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The red lines on each side are too ideological and entrenched to allow much room for manoeuvre.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd China sees its trade policies as essential to its next stage of economic growth; Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u0153America First\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd approach blames China for hollowing out large parts of the US economy. So settle back and expect more of the same. Financial markets haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t been panicked so far, either because the short-term damage to global trade looks modest, or because it is still possible to cling to the idea that Trump won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t follow through on his threat to raise tariffs to 25% in the new year. But it seems more likely that Trump discovers that a trade war with China cannot be \u00e2\u20ac\u0153won\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd quickly and opts for more extreme measures. He needs something to show his supporters, which he doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t seem close to getting yet. A bigger trade war, with other countries drawn in, is suddenly a real risk. Bitcoin is a sideshow for regulators The Treasury select committee has got one thing right: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153cryptocurrencies\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd like bitcoin aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t really currencies because they don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t do most of the things expected of a currency. They don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t store value since the price can halve suddenly. They\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re not a true medium of exchange since most shops won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t accept them. And they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re not a practical unit of account because the processing of transactions is so energy-intensive. The committee prefers the term \u00e2\u20ac\u0153crypto-assets\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, which is technically better \u00e2\u20ac\u201c just don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t expect it to catch on. The real point of the report, however, is to ponder the troubled question of how much regulation is required. Much more, conclude the MPs, before adding the hopeful thought that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153proportionate regulation could see UK as well placed to become global centre for crypto-assets\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. The first half of the prescription is easy to agree with. Some of the marketing of crypto-asset coin offerings is plainly misleading and it would be a good thing if the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) imposed proper standards, as opposed to issuing general warnings that punters could lose everything.

                "bodyText":"And finally, European stock markets have also racked up gains today, as trade war fears faded. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE 100 index gained 36 points to close at 7367, up 0.5%. There were bigger gains in France and Germany, as traders watched Wall Street soar to record levels. Over in New York, the Dow continues to rally. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s currently up 257 points or 1% at 26,662, on track for a record close. Connor Campbell of SpreadEx says: With investors choosing to view the current state of play between the US and China as a smidge better than initially feared, the Dow Jones led a substantial charge higher on Thursday. Despite the recent tit-for-tat tariff attacks between Beijing and Washington, Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s accusations that China is trying to undermine US democracy, AND the rather high likelihood that the Federal Reserve will raise rates next Wednesday, the Dow Jones managed to hit an all-time peak after the bell rang on Wall Street. The oil price continues to slide, following Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s call for Opec to take action this weekend. Brent crude is down almost 1% at $78.75 per barrel, while US crude has dipped by 0.3% to $70.92. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s all for today. Thanks for reading and commenting. GW Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s record highs on Wall Street suggest investors are less worried about a US-China trade war. Chemicals company DowDuPont is leading the way, up 2.2%, followed by chipmaker Intel (+2%), software giant Microsoft (+1.7%) and construction machinery maker Caterpillar (+1.5%). David Madden of CMC Markets says traders are relieved that the US and China didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t take more punitive measures this week: The rally has returned as the Dow Jones and S&amp;P 500 have set fresh record highs. The latest round of tariffs that were announced during the week weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t as severe has some traders were anticipating, and the market has breathed a sigh of relief. The fear of new tariffs proved to be worse than the tariffs themselves, and even though the US and China now have a worse trading relationship, dealers are still optimistic as there is no sign of additional tariffs in sight. Brexit continues to loom over the City, after European council president Donald Tusk warned that Theresa May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Chequers deal won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t work. The lack of a breakthrough at today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s leaders\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 summit in Salzburg may increase the risk that Britain leaves the EU without a deal. How bad would that be? Oxford Economics warn it would create a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153significant slowdown\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, with the pound tumbling and trade hit by new barriers. They reckon 2% would be knocked off the UK economy by 2020: Deutsche Bank are even more gloomy. They believe the UK would be tipped into a two-year recession, wiping 4% off GDP, as household consumption and business spending both shrink. President Trump has moved on from rebuking Opec, to welcome today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock market rally: Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s dislike of higher oil prices is well known -- he fears they will hurt US consumers by driving up the cost of gasoline. But Charles Bond, natural resources partner at law firm Gowling WLG, suggests the president should see the bigger picture, rather than fire tweets at Opec. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s motive here is clearly to bring the price of oil down but that may have a wider effect in transactional terms. The recent return to higher oil prices has meant that companies in the sector globally can start to benefit from capital investment again and the benefits that come with it, such as business expansion and increased economic activity. Any artificial attempt to stem this would need to be balanced very carefully given the likely consequences for the wider industry.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our latest take on the Danske Bank money-laundering scandal: Donald Trump has also channeled his inner Norman Tebbit today, by telling Americans to take advantage of the strong labor market and look for a better job. The S&amp;P 500, which covers a wider range of companies than the Dow, has also hit a record high in early trading. Boom! America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dow Jones industrial average has hit a new all-time high. Shares have jumped at the start of trading in New York, sending the Dow up by over 230 points to 26,643 points. That takes the index over its previous record, set in January this year (just as Donald Trump was speaking at Davos). Technology stocks are driving the index higher. There is also optimism that the US-China trade war could be resolved -- earlier today, Beijing argued that talks, not tariffs, were the solution. Shares are also benefitting from the recent weakness of the US dollar, which has dropped to its lowest level since July today. Dean Popplewell, vice president of Market Analysis at OANDA, points out that oil stockpiles have been falling recently, helping to underpin prices. EIA data Wednesday showed that U.S crude oil stockpiles fell for a fifth consecutive week to a three-year low in the week to Sept. 14, while gas stocks also showed a larger than expected draw on unseasonably strong demand. Crude inventories fell by -2.1m barrels, compared with expectations for a decrease of -2.7m. OPEC and other producers, including Russia, meet on Sunday in Algeria to discuss how to allocate supply increases to offset the loss of Iranian barrels. Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s claim that Opec is a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcmonopoly\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t really stand up to scrutiny. The countries which make up Opec produce around 40% of the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s crude oil, and around 60% of the total petroleum traded internationally. So it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s big enough to influence the market, but it doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t control the whole thing. The president would have been on stronger ground if he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d called Opec a cartel -- there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no argument that it agrees production levels in an attempt to influence the oil price. But... the more Opec pushes the oil price up, the more profitable America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shale oil industry becomes.... What a difference a tweet makes. Brent crude has fallen by one dollar per barrel since Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tweet, from almost $79.75 per barrel to below $79. Some traders may have concluded that Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s intervention raises the chances that Saudi Arabia pushes for an increase in output at this weekend\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Opec meeting. Donald Trump appears to be trying to prevent the oil price rising over $80 per barrel. Bloomberg\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s James Herron explains: Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fresh intervention in the oil market comes before a meeting of ministers from the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies in Algeria on Sunday. His complaint follows signals from Saudi Arabia that it was content to see prices climb above $80 a barrel. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been a red line for the White House in the past, provoking the president to direct his first social-media barb against the cartel since July 4. Boom! The US president has demanded that the OPEC oil cartel take action to bring the oil price down. Donald Trump has tweeted that Middle Eastern countries aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t showing sufficient gratitude for America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s military support, by pushing crude prices to their current levels. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a clear nudge to Opec members, such as Saudi Arabia, to agree a production boost when they meet this weekend. Brent crude is currently trading near to $80 per barrel, close to its highest level since November 2014. Oil prices have been climbing sharply since Opec agreed a historic deal to curb production in late 2016. That output freeze has helped to remove over-capacity from the market, meaning producers benefit from higher prices. Opec members will meet with non-Opec countries, such as Russia, over the weekend to examine their production quotas. Oil analysts believe they are unlikely to lift production limits, despite pressure from America. Iran, for example, has indicated it is happy with oil at $80 per barrel, so would presumably oppose a production increase. Tehran also doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t enjoy military protection from the US, of course, so Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s threat may not carry much weight. Iran\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s oil production is likely to drop as US sanctions kick in. That creates a new dilemma for Opec, as one source told Reuters: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s complicated. Saudi Arabia has to balance oil supply and demand, and it has to balance oil prices so they don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t rise too much before the U.S. elections,. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also political because the Saudis don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to pump too much oil then the Iranians complain to OPEC that it (Saudi Arabia) is taking (Iran\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s) market share. They also don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want oil prices to fall too much.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Uh oh. Sky News are reporting that high street bicycle chain Evans Cycles is looking for a new buyer, as the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153toxic\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd retail environment threatens to claim another victim. Clearly the upturn in retail spending last month hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t given Evans much of a boost. More here. Ryanair investors are calling on the budget airline to heed today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s revolt at its AGM. Campaign group ShareAction says the fact that nearly one in three shareholders fail to back chairman David Bonderman is proof that change is needed, following a year marked by pilot strikes. Mara Lilley, senior campaigns officer at ShareAction, says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It might not sound like it, but 30% of Ryanair shareholders wanting to oust Bonderman \u00e2\u20ac\u201c up from 11% last year \u00e2\u20ac\u201c is a clear signal that business cannot and must not continue as usual. His cosy relationship with O\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Leary has allowed the chief executive to get away with tantrums in the face of serious workforce issues and poor industrial relations which will end up hitting profits. We predict next year Bonderman\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s long-haul tenure will finally come to a well-deserved end.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Alison Kennedy of Aberdeen Standard Investments made a similar point at the AGM. Although ASI backed Bonderman, and independent director Kyran McLaughlin today, their patience is running thin. Kennedy warned: Given the challenges the company faces, for example in union and labour relations, it is clear that governance needs to evolve. Strong, independent and visible board leadership is more important than ever. So, we expect that there will be clear progress on succession for these two key board positions by the time of the AGM next year. If not, others things being equal, we will vote against the re-election of Mr Bonderman, Mr McLaughlin and the other members of the Nominations Committee. Drinks giant Diageo, whose tipples include Johnnie Walker, Baileys and Smirnoff, says today that it has been hit by the recent turmoil in emerging market currencies. This is expected to reduce sales by \u00c2\u00a3175m and cut operating profits by \u00c2\u00a345m in the year to 30 June, the company reported today. Money laundering at Denmark\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest bank is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the biggest scandal\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in Europe and could prompt action from regulators in Brussels, the European commission has said. V\u00c4\u203ara Jourov\u00c3\u00a1, the European commissioner for justice, said she wanted to know if a failure of banking supervision led to lapses that allowed \u00e2\u201a\u00ac200bn (\u00c2\u00a3178bn) of illegally-laundered funds to flow through Danske Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Estonian branch. The bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chief executive, Thomas Borgen, resigned on Wednesday, after admitting the bank had failed \u00e2\u20ac\u0153to live up to its responsibilities\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, allowing dirty money to flow out of Russia, the UK and the British Virgin Islands, through its Estonian branch. The commissioner will meet ministers from Denmark, Estonia and Finland on 2 October to investigate what went wrong. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I want to understand better where the main errors happened, whether it was purely a fault of the due diligence done by the bank itself, or whether there was some mistake of the supervisory authority,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Jourov\u00c3\u00a1 told reporters. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This is the biggest scandal, which we have now in Europe, which is also a very unpleasant lesson, which shows the need to be much more vigilant and much more prudent in checking.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd If there had been a mistake in supervision, she said, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153we will have to act\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. The European Banking Authority, an EU agency based in London, tightened controls on Malta\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Pilatus Bank, after its Iranian owner was charged by US authorities with evading sanctions and money laundering. The commissioner said action by the EBA had led to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153precise results\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd on Pilatus bank. But EU authorities want more powers for the agency: last week the commission called for the EBA to be able to order national authorities to tackle suspected money laundering. In a rather unusual move, the long-running battle to take control of UK broadcaster Sky will go to an auction this weekend. The Takeover Panel has decided that Rupert Murdoch\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 21st Century Fox, and rival bidder Comcast, should each make new bids in a three-round contest. Each can choose to raise their offers (currently \u00c2\u00a314 and \u00c2\u00a314.75 respectively). This will resolve the uncertainty that has been swirling over Sky since December, when Fox attempted to buy the 61% of Sky which it doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t already own. With neither side making a final offer, this auction should resolve Sky\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fate. This rise in UK retail spending is a little hard to square with the gloomy picture on UK high streets. Last week, for example, John Lewis reported that its profits had been virtually wiped out in the last six months. House of Fraser fell into administration in August, while Debenhams warned that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153underlying trends deteriorated through the summer months.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Hardly a rosy picture...but yet the ONS believes consumers are still spending. Given that inflation is rising, and wage growth has been modest, some consumers may be falling into deeper debt to sustain this spending. Josie Dent, Economist at the CEBR think tank, believes a squeeze is coming: While today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s headline figure paints a rosy picture for retail, more timely indicators show that the high street is struggling this month. John Lewis Partnership figures for last week show that the total value of sales was 2.2% lower than the same week a year ago, while for their financial year-to-date, sales are down 0.5% on the same time period last year. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s report also confirms that the unusually warm weather - and unusually successful England football team - boosted spending. The ONS says: Household goods stores also reported strong growth during the summer of 5.8% compared with a fall in the previous year, with anecdotal evidence from retailers suggesting that the FIFA World Cup had boosted sales of televisions alongside the positive impact of the warm weather. Food sales also did well with the good weather when compared with the previous summer, with a growth of 3.2% in comparison with a fall of 0.7% in summer 2017. August\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s retail sales are a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153mixed bag\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, argues Tom Stevenson, investment director for Personal Investing at Fidelity International. He points to the drop in clothing and food sales, as a sign that consumers are feeling the pinch: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The headline level of retail sales data was unexpectedly strong for August, although buoyant household goods volumes were offset by declines in food, clothing and petrol. Food and clothing retreated after benefiting from the unusually warm weather in July. The rising cost of fuel is also starting to bite. So this is a mixed bag, which paints an unconvincing picture of recovery on the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s struggling high streets. Strong online sales suggest that far-reaching structural changes in UK retail continue apace. Sam Tombs of Pantheon Economists reckons this spending splurge won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t last: Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s forecast-beating retail sales figures suggest the UK economy grew robustly in the last quarter, says economist Howard Archer of the EY Item Club: Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s more details: The surprise rise in UK retail sales last month has pushed the pound back to $1.32, a gain of half a cent. Newsflash: UK shoppers kept spending in August despite rising inflation and worries over Brexit. Retail sales volumes (the amount of stuff people bought) rose by 0.3% in August compared with July, the Office for National Statistics says. That beats forecasts of a 0.2% decline. The ONS says that household goods sales jumped by 4.5%, while other non-food stores enjoyed a 2.8% rise. However, food sales dropped by 0.6% and clothing fell by 1.9%. Yesterday we learned that UK inflation jumped to 2.7% in August, from 2.5% in July, partly due to a jump in clothing and transport costs. This doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t seem to have dampened demand for goods, though. On an annual basis, sales in June-August were 3.4% up than a year earlier - partly thanks to the summer heatwave. Office for National Statistics senior statistician, Rhian Murphy, says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Retail sales remained strong in the three months to August, with continued growth across all sectors. Food and household goods stores particularly benefitted from the warm weather when compared with last summer. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The figures for the month of August were a little more mixed, with food sales falling after strong sales earlier in the summer and clothing sales declining following a strong July, as suggested by clothing retailers. On the other hand, household goods grew strongly.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Back to the US-China trade war, and billionaire Jack Ma has ditched his goal of creating a million new jobs for Americans. Ma blamed the rising protectionist conflict between Beijing and Washington, saying the lack of friendly relations make the pledge unviable. CNBC has the details: Jack Ma, founder and chairman of Chinese retail giant Alibaba, says the company no longer plans to create 1 million jobs in the United States in the wake of the ongoing trade conflict between the U.S. and China. Ma made his original job creation pronouncement during a high-profile meeting with Donald Trump in January 2017 before Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s inauguration as president. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The promise was made on the premise of friendly US-China partnership and rational trade relations,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Ma told Chinese news site Xinhua on Wednesday. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153That premise no longer exists today, so our promise cannot be fulfilled.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Ryanair\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s AGM is underway. In a surprise twist, the airline lifted its ban on journalists attending (just as well, as hacks were congregating outside anyway). Ryanair is now revealing the results of the shareholder votes. Founder Michael O\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Leary is re-elected with 98.5% support from proxy votes (votes made in advance by investors). But there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a rebellion against the chairman; only 70.5% of votes are cast in favour of David Bonderman\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s re-election. Independent director Kyran McLaughlin received just 66.8pc of votes in favour of his reappointment. Major investor Aberdeen Standard is now warning that Ryanair needs a proper succession plan, or it will rebel next year too. Back in the UK, luxury carmaker Aston Martin has unveiled plans to float on the stock market. The company, famous for its links to the James Bond franchise, reckons it could be worth over \u00c2\u00a35bn. But will investors agree, given the uncertainty over how Brexit will affect the UK car industry?.... Newsflash: Switzerland\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s central bank has warned that trade disputes and the emerging markets crisis are threatening economic growth. Following its latest monetary policy meeting, the SNB said the economic outlook remains favourable - but protectionism could change that. It warns: To date, the crises of confidence in Turkey and Argentina have not materially impacted the global economic outlook. The risks to this positive baseline scenario are more to the downside. Chief among them are political uncertainties in some countries as well as potential international tensions and protectionist tendencies. The SNB has left interest rates on hold at their current record low of minus 0.75%. China has also hit back at Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s claim that it is trying to undermine US democracy. Commerce ministry spokesman Gao Feng insists that the new tariffs on $60bn of US goods, which kick in next week, had \u00e2\u20ac\u0153nothing to do\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd with US politics. Gao was responding to the US president\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s claim that China is targeting voters such as farmers, ranchers and factory workers. These tweets from Tuesday, for example, show that Trump believes Beijing is trying to hurt his supporters, by putting tariffs on US agricultural products and machinery. China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s commerce ministry has vowed not to launch a currency war with America. Speaking to journalists, spokesman Gao Feng says that it will not use the yuan as a tool to resolve its trade dispute, and will maintain it at a reasonable level. Gao points out that a depreciating yuan is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153more detrimental than beneficial\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade war with China remains the biggest story in the markets today (although Brexit is doing its best to share the spotlight). After the flurry of tit-for-tat tariffs earlier this week, global investors are watching nervously to see whether the conflict escalates further, or if officials can negotiate a truce. In the last few minutes, China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s government has launched a stinging attack on Washington, saying America hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t been sincere over trade. Clearly Beijing isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t happy that Donald Trump signed off 10% tariffs on $200bn of their goods, at the same time as the White House was pushing for new talks. Reuters has the details: China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s foreign ministry said on Tuesday that talks on an equal footing are the only correct way to resolve trade issues with the United States, after U.S.President Donald Trump imposed 10% tariffs on about $200bn worth of Chinese imports. The United States\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 current unilateral trade actions cannot be accepted by China, and the United States has not been sincere, ministry spokesman Geng Shuang told a daily news briefing. The commerce ministry also said it is studying \u00e2\u20ac\u0153targeted measures\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to help foreign firms in its economy. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a sign that Beijing is taking steps to protect itself from the impact of the trade war. Bloomberg is reporting that China is planning to cut the average tariff rates on imports from the majority of its trading partners as soon as next month. That would help Chinese consumers, who face paying more for US imports. Also coming up today The Office for National Statistics publishes Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s retail sales figures for August this morning. They\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re expected to show a 0.2% decline, following a 0.7% jump in July, as household spending power remains squeezed. David Madden of CMC Markets says: Traders will be watching this report closely as consumer appetite needs to be healthy to drive the economy along. There could be turbulence (sorry) at Ryanair\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s annual general meeting today. One investors, Royal London Asset Management, has vowed to vote against the airline\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chairman and two other board members. The agenda 8.30am BST: Swiss central bank interest rate decision 9am BST: Ryanair AGM in Gormanstown, County Meath 9.30am BST: UK retail sales for August 3pm BST: Eurozone consumer confidence",
