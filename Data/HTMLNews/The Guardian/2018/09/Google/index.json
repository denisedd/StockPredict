                "body":"<p>The IPPR commission on economic justice sets out a 10-point plan to improve the British economy and make it fairer for its participants. The policy proposals include reviving trade unions in workplaces and raising the minimum wage. Here is a summary of the recommendations.</p> <h2>Reshaping the economy</h2> <p>The report calls for an activist government with an expanded industrial strategy, focused on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2010/jun/16/government-recession-lord-myners\">spurring economic growth through investment</a> in infrastructure such as transport links. The expectation is that this will improve Britain\u2019s industrial base, drive up exports, raise productivity (the amount of economic output generated per hour worked) and address the regional imbalances in the UK economy.</p> <p>The commission also proposes an industrial strategy act to set out clear goals and criteria for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/dec/11/keynesian-economics-is-it-time-for-the-theory-to-rise-from-the-dead\">state support for industry</a>, and create an independent industrial strategy committee to provide oversight and guidance. A national investment bank would invest in infrastructure and innovation, and over time should become the main mechanism through which government spends on industrial strategy.</p> <h2>Securing good pay and good jobs</h2> <p>The commission calls for an immediate increase of around \u00a31 an hour in the government-mandated <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/apr/13/how-much-is-an-hour-worth-the-war-over-the-minimum-wage\">minimum wage</a>, which stands at \u00a37.83 per hour for over-25s, in order to bring it up to the levels of the \u201creal\u201d living wage. This is a voluntary measure adopted by companies including consumer goods firm Unilever, which is set at \u00a38.75 an hour outside London and \u00a310.20 an hour in the capital.</p> <p>The role of trade unions is flagged by the commission. It says collective bargaining \u2013 union-led pay negotiations carried out on behalf of a workforce \u2013 is a route to higher productivity. Ministers should adopt a target of doubling the amount of collective bargaining in the UK economy to 50% of workers by 2030, with a focus on the lowest paid sectors. <br></p> <h2>Improving the private sector</h2> <p>The report calls for company directors to be given duties that go wider than just addressing the interests of shareholders. The commission believes that investors extract more cash from UK businesses than they put in through dividends and share buyback programmes, which holds back investment and improvements in productivity.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/nov/29/government-defends-apparent-u-turn-over-workers-on-boards\">inclusion of workers on company boards</a> and remuneration committees, a proposal that has gathered momentum in recent years, also features. </p> <p></p> <h2>Promoting competition and protecting consumers</h2> <p>The remit of the competition watchdog, the CMA, should be broadened to include a focus on protecting the public from companies that become too powerful, alongside <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/jun/28/hotel-booking-sites-cma-investigation-areas-of-concern\">existing commitments</a> to promote consumer welfare.</p> <p>To arrest the growing power of Google, Facebook and other internet platforms, there should be a new regulator, the office of digital platforms, which will give the public greater access to their own data.</p> <h2>Increasing public investment</h2> <p>Public investment spending <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/may/22/uk-needs-big-digital-upgrade-to-thrive-after-brexit-says-hammond\">in areas such as broadband</a> should be increased by at least \u00a315bn over and above the latest government forecasts to 3.5% of GDP. This is the average level for economies in the G7 between 1997 and 2017.</p> <p>The commission calls for a revised remit for the Bank of England that ties interest rates to the level of unemployment and economic growth, as well as inflation.<br></p> <h2>Strengthening the financial system</h2> <p>There should be a clampdown on borrowing by financial institutions to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/aug/30/financial-crash-capitalism-banking-crisis\">limit the damage to the City in a crisis</a>, the commission says, adding that the government must go further in tackling tax avoidance and stopping illicit money flowing into Britain\u2019s financial system.</p> <p>The commission addresses the role of housing in banking speculation \u2013 a key cause of the 2008 crash \u2013 by calling for UK regulators to set a house price inflation target, which would enable the Bank of England to regulate property lending more closely.</p> <h2>Tackling wealth inequality</h2> <p>Sovereign wealth funds \u2013 state owned investment firms \u2013 are a feature of many emerging market economies such as China and Qatar, and developed ones such as Norway and New Zealand. The commission suggests setting up a sovereign wealth fund with the sale of Royal Bank of Scotland shares and gains from wealth taxes that could be worth \u00a3186bn in next 10 years. The fund would use its proceeds to pay 25-year-olds a lump sum of \u00a310,000 as a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/apr/02/pay-all-uk-25-year-olds-a-10000-inheritance-says-thinktank\">\u201cuniversal minimum inheritance\u201d</a>.</p> <p>To build more homes, the government should allow local authorities to buy land prior to giving planning permission. This would reduce property speculation and allow councils to prioritise affordable homes.</p> <h2>Fair and simple taxes</h2> <p>Work and wealth should be taxed on the same basis with a new, single, income tax schedule for all types of income. This would mean the abolition of capital gains tax and dividend tax. It would <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/mar/04/has-the-time-come-for-a-wealth-tax-in-the-uk\">tax the gains from wealth more heavily</a>, the commission claims.</p> <p>Replace business rates, which are levied on properties like shops, with a new land value tax.

                "bodyText":"The IPPR commission on economic justice sets out a 10-point plan to improve the British economy and make it fairer for its participants. The policy proposals include reviving trade unions in workplaces and raising the minimum wage. Here is a summary of the recommendations. Reshaping the economy The report calls for an activist government with an expanded industrial strategy, focused on spurring economic growth through investment in infrastructure such as transport links. The expectation is that this will improve Britain\u2019s industrial base, drive up exports, raise productivity (the amount of economic output generated per hour worked) and address the regional imbalances in the UK economy. The commission also proposes an industrial strategy act to set out clear goals and criteria for state support for industry, and create an independent industrial strategy committee to provide oversight and guidance. A national investment bank would invest in infrastructure and innovation, and over time should become the main mechanism through which government spends on industrial strategy. Securing good pay and good jobs The commission calls for an immediate increase of around \u00a31 an hour in the government-mandated minimum wage, which stands at \u00a37.83 per hour for over-25s, in order to bring it up to the levels of the \u201creal\u201d living wage. This is a voluntary measure adopted by companies including consumer goods firm Unilever, which is set at \u00a38.75 an hour outside London and \u00a310.20 an hour in the capital. The role of trade unions is flagged by the commission. It says collective bargaining \u2013 union-led pay negotiations carried out on behalf of a workforce \u2013 is a route to higher productivity. Ministers should adopt a target of doubling the amount of collective bargaining in the UK economy to 50% of workers by 2030, with a focus on the lowest paid sectors. Improving the private sector The report calls for company directors to be given duties that go wider than just addressing the interests of shareholders. The commission believes that investors extract more cash from UK businesses than they put in through dividends and share buyback programmes, which holds back investment and improvements in productivity. The inclusion of workers on company boards and remuneration committees, a proposal that has gathered momentum in recent years, also features. Promoting competition and protecting consumers The remit of the competition watchdog, the CMA, should be broadened to include a focus on protecting the public from companies that become too powerful, alongside existing commitments to promote consumer welfare. To arrest the growing power of Google, Facebook and other internet platforms, there should be a new regulator, the office of digital platforms, which will give the public greater access to their own data. Increasing public investment Public investment spending in areas such as broadband should be increased by at least \u00a315bn over and above the latest government forecasts to 3.5% of GDP. This is the average level for economies in the G7 between 1997 and 2017. The commission calls for a revised remit for the Bank of England that ties interest rates to the level of unemployment and economic growth, as well as inflation. Strengthening the financial system There should be a clampdown on borrowing by financial institutions to limit the damage to the City in a crisis, the commission says, adding that the government must go further in tackling tax avoidance and stopping illicit money flowing into Britain\u2019s financial system. The commission addresses the role of housing in banking speculation \u2013 a key cause of the 2008 crash \u2013 by calling for UK regulators to set a house price inflation target, which would enable the Bank of England to regulate property lending more closely. Tackling wealth inequality Sovereign wealth funds \u2013 state owned investment firms \u2013 are a feature of many emerging market economies such as China and Qatar, and developed ones such as Norway and New Zealand. The commission suggests setting up a sovereign wealth fund with the sale of Royal Bank of Scotland shares and gains from wealth taxes that could be worth \u00a3186bn in next 10 years. The fund would use its proceeds to pay 25-year-olds a lump sum of \u00a310,000 as a \u201cuniversal minimum inheritance\u201d. To build more homes, the government should allow local authorities to buy land prior to giving planning permission. This would reduce property speculation and allow councils to prioritise affordable homes. Fair and simple taxes Work and wealth should be taxed on the same basis with a new, single, income tax schedule for all types of income. This would mean the abolition of capital gains tax and dividend tax. It would tax the gains from wealth more heavily, the commission claims. Replace business rates, which are levied on properties like shops, with a new land value tax. This would be a fairer tax than business rates, the report states. It would also force landowners to register and value their land, making ownership more transparent. Environmental sustainability The commission makes the case for legislation to limit the environmental damage caused by individual industries. The law would require industries to set long-term plans to reduce pollutants and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Expanding on the government\u2019s \u201cclean growth\u201d plan and the Climate Change Act, ministers would adopt a green industrial strategy to promote reducing carbon dioxide, increasing use of recycled materials and conserving natural habitats. Devolution The commission backs a new \u201ceconomic constitution\u201d for the UK, devolving more economic powers to the nations and regions through new economic zones for the north, midlands, south-west, and south-east of England. It also calls for a \u00a310bn state fund to help narrow the gap between the regions over a five year period. This would replace the \u00a310.9bn due to be spent by the European Union on regional British development between 2014 and 2020.",

Too many home loans had been extended to borrowers with no chance of ever repaying them. There was even a nickname for them \u2013 \u201cninja\u201d loans \u2013 for people with no income and no job or assets. Those risky loans were sliced up and bundled with less risky ones and sold off in parcels to banks around the world.

That belief was wrong.</p>\n    <p>Lehman\u2019s fate was sealed when Alistair Darling, the then chancellor, refused to provide state guarantees for the bank\u2019s takeover by Barclays. Bob Diamond, who was then the head of Barclays\u2019 investment bank, had been trying to broker over the weekend of 13-14 September. Darling later recalled: \u201cI could not imagine standing up in the House of Commons on the Monday morning explaining that we had put the UK taxpayer in hock so that Barclays could buy Lehman. Half the Barclays board was relieved.\u201d&nbsp;</p>\n    <p>At 1am in New York on Monday 15 September the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers was declared.

According to the Forum for Sustainable and Responsible Investment, US-based assets managed using SRI strategies <a href=\"https://www.ussif.org/files/Trends/US%20SIF%202016%20Trends%20Overview.pdf\">more than doubled</a> to $8.7tn between 2012 and 2016, and now account for more than <a href=\"https://www.ussif.org/files/Infographics/Overview%20Infographic.pdf\">one in five</a> dollars under professional management in the country.</p> <p>The rise in SRI investment comes amid questions about whether corporate boards are adequately evaluating environmental and social justice concerns when they look at their company\u2019s long-term financial prospects. PwC\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.pwc.com/us/en/governance-insights-center/annual-corporate-directors-survey/assets/pwc-2017-annual-corporate--directors--survey.pdf\">2017 survey</a> of corporate officials found \u201cthat directors are clearly out of step with investor priorities in some critical areas\u201d and the report added that \u201cone of these areas is environmental issues\u201d.</p> <p>High-profile initiatives like the Just fund are a chance for the industry to tout its eagerness, as the Goldman Sachs executive Timothy O\u2019Neill put it in a <a href=\"https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180612005943/en/Goldman-Sachs-Asset-Management-Announces-Launch-Exchange-Traded\">press release</a>, to \u201c[allow] investment to flow toward a more sustainable and equitable future, while seeking to generate attractive returns for investors\u201d.</p> <p>The trend has given Wall Street an opportunity for an image makeover in a time of growing public distrust in the financial system: According to a <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2018/08/14/fewer-than-half-of-young-americans-are-positive-about-capitalism.html\">Gallup poll</a> conducted last month, fewer than half of Americans under 30 report having a positive view of capitalism, a 12-point drop in just the past two years.</p> <p>For some activists and investors, though, the rapid expansion of the market for SRI-branded financial products has raised concerns about <a href=\"http://www.greenwashingindex.com/about-greenwashing/\">greenwashing</a> \u2013 the practice by which companies market themselves as socially or environmentally responsible without actually adopting business practices that meet those goals.</p> <p>\u201cPutting the word \u2018ethical\u2019 or \u2018sustainable\u2019 in the name of a fund does not make it so,\u201d said a report by British investment advisory firm Castlefield, whose <a href=\"http://www.castlefield.com/media/1957/winners-and-spinners-report-2017-final.pdf\">recent</a> <a href=\"http://www.castlefield.com/news-media/company-news/winners-and-spinners-report-2015/\">reports</a> documented how some environmental funds include investments in fossil fuel firms. \u201cIt is increasingly important to differentiate between those funds genuinely responding to customer demand for a sustainable approach and those which use terms like ethical, Socially Responsible Investment or stewardship in their name but include companies such as British American Tobacco or Shell in their key holdings.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Goldman\u2019s </strong><strong>record on </strong><strong>socially </strong><strong>responsible </strong><strong>investing</strong></h2> <p>Amid surging interest in SRI funds, Goldman\u2019s Just US Large Cap Equity ETF aims to convince investors that the company is serious about injecting a spirit of ethics and morality into its financial strategies. To that end, the fund says it directs money only into companies that are ranked highly by <a href=\"https://justcapital.com/\">Just</a><a href=\"https://justcapital.com/\"> Capital</a>.</p> <p>The 426 companies featured in the Just index were selected on the basis of their performance across seven different criteria, including labor practices, customer service and environmental impacts. Goldman itself ranks in the top tenth of the Just rankings, despite the company being <a href=\"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/global-fossil-fuels-banks-report_us_5aba989fe4b04a59a3122636\">attacked</a> for supporting the fossil fuel industry and also being <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/goldman-sachs-agrees-pay-more-5-billion-connection-its-sale-residential-mortgage-backed\">fined</a> $5bn in 2016 by the Department of Justice for \u201cserious misconduct in falsely assuring investors that securities it sold were backed by sound mortgages, when it knew that they were full of mortgages that were likely to fail\u201d.</p> <p>Whether Goldman\u2019s new Just fund represents a step in a larger shift towards socially responsible investment remains to be seen. Baruch College\u2019s Jared Peifer says that one way to judge a firm\u2019s commitment to social responsibility is to watch how it deals with resolutions brought by shareholders, whereby investors attempt to force management to adopt socially responsible policies.</p> <p>\u201cThere is variance to the degree that SRI funds are ethically motivated versus a more greenwashing approach,\u201d Peifer said. \u201cIs the fund dialoguing with management? Issuing shareholder proxy votes, voting on others? If so, that seems like a more ethically motivated fund to me, because they are exerting additional effort many other funds do not bother with.\u201d</p> <p>In recent years, Goldman executives have been fighting off SRI resolutions at their own company, including initiatives that have asked management to more transparently disclose their <a href=\"https://www.goldmansachs.com/s/2018-proxy-statement/images/Goldman_Sach-Proxy2018.pdf\">political lobbying</a> and create a <a href=\"https://www.goldmansachs.com/investor-relations/financials/archived/proxy-statements/docs/2013-proxy-statement-pdf.pdf\">human rights committee</a> to review the company\u2019s policies regarding doing business with governments engaged in censorship and repression. Only three months before Goldman announced the Just fund, Goldman successfully <a href=\"https://www.sec.gov/divisions/corpfin/cf-noaction/14a-8/2018/harringtoninvestments031218-14a8.pdf\">pressed</a> the Securities and Exchange Commission to bless its move to block shareholders from voting on a resolution asking the company to honor indigenous peoples\u2019 rights.</p> <p>\u201cThe company\u2019s extraordinary no action request shows the notable lengths that the company is willing to go, and to stretch credulity, in order to prevent its directors from shouldering fiduciary obligations on indigenous and human rights,\u201d wrote shareholder proponents at the time.</p> <p>Last year, Goldman was lauded by <a href=\"https://shareaction.org/warming-up-to-climate-resolutions/\">Share Action</a>, an SRI activist group, for switching its position and using its holdings to support a series of climate-change-related shareholder initiatives. In its <a href=\"https://www.gsam.com/content/dam/gsam/pdfs/us/en/miscellaneous/voting_proxy_policy.pdf?sa=n&amp;rd=n\">proxy voting guidelines</a>, Goldman says it will generally vote for proposals asking companies to report on \u201cpolicies, initiatives and oversight mechanisms related to environmental sustainability, or how the company may be impacted by climate change\u201d.</p> <p>However, those guidelines do not make the same commitment when it comes to initiatives requiring companies to actually reduce their carbon emissions. The guidelines also say the company will generally vote against \u201cproposals requesting increased disclosure of a company\u2019s policies with respect to political contributions\u201d. The company further says it will vote to remove representatives of employees or organized labor from a company\u2019s board if they are overseeing company audits or executive compensation, and if there is no legal requirement for them to be in that position.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"eb8e34e46eb40f84b582a75761928e2ba31e4b44\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/eb8e34e46eb40f84b582a75761928e2ba31e4b44/0_0_1359_1600/849.jpg\" alt=\"JUST Table\" width=\"849\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">JUST Table</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Handout</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>Goldman </strong><strong>votes </strong><strong>against </strong><strong>resolutions at Just</strong><strong> </strong><strong>fund </strong><strong>companies</strong></h2> <p>Goldman\u2019s hostility toward many SRI initiatives is illustrated by its votes on resolutions at the companies now in its Just fund.</p> <p>For example, there is Chevron Corporation, which ranks as the Just fund\u2019s 17th-largest holding as it <a href=\"http://www.csrwire.com/press_releases/41323-In-SLAPP-Attack-Chevron-Trying-to-Intimidate-Citizens-Who-Challenged-Company-Over-Massive-Pollution-In-Amazon\">faces</a> <a href=\"https://www.greenpeace.org/international/story/16448/chevrons-slapp-suit-against-ecuadorians-corporate-intimidation/\">accusations</a> that it is trying to intimidate environmentalists and avoid cleaning up pollution in the Amazon rainforest.</p> <p>In May, the oil giant\u2019s shareholders were asked to vote on a slate of <a href=\"https://www.chevron.com/-/media/shared-media/documents/chevron-proxy-statement-2018.pdf\">seven proposals</a>, including a requirement for the company\u2019s board to nominate a director with environmental experience; the preparation of a report on transitioning to a low-carbon business model; increased transparency relating to lobbying activities; and stronger prohibitions on Chevron\u2019s interests overseas from doing business with governments that are complicit in genocide or crimes against humanity.</p> <p>As shareholders in Chevron, 14 different Goldman Sachs Asset Management (GSAM) funds voted on these proposals. The majority of funds voted in support of just one, a request for the company to prepare a report on its efforts to minimize methane emissions. In every other case, the funds unanimously or overwhelmingly opposed the proposals.</p> <p>Proxy-voting records from dozens of shareholder meetings reviewed by Capital &amp; Main show a similar pattern. In rare cases, Goldman funds did vote in favor of some shareholder reforms, including the preparation of a report on the gender pay gap at Facebook and Google. At several pharmaceutical companies, including AbbVie, Amgen and Eli Lilly, Goldman funds supported increased accountability for executives regarding high drug prices.</p> <p>Such votes, however, were few and far between. Of the 10 companies that make up the largest share of Goldman\u2019s Just fund, eight considered shareholder-proposed reforms that were overwhelmingly opposed by Goldman-managed funds at their most recent annual meetings. The proposals included prohibitions on offshore tax avoidance schemes, increased transparency on lobbying activities and requirements that companies appoint an independent board chair \u2013 a governance model that advocates say leads to more responsible corporate behavior. The remaining two companies, Microsoft and Visa, did not consider any shareholder proposals.</p> <p>At JPMorgan, the recipient of Just\u2019s fourth-largest investment, Goldman funds voted unanimously against a requirement for the company to release a report on its investments in PetroChina, a firm that <a href=\"https://www.investorsagainstgenocide.org/\">activists accuse</a> of helping to fund crimes against humanity due to its ongoing business relationships with oppressive regimes in Syria and Sudan. Goldman made that move despite its own <a href=\"https://www.gsam.com/content/dam/gsam/pdfs/us/en/miscellaneous/voting_proxy_policy.pdf?sa=n&amp;rd=n\">proxy voting guidelines</a> saying the company would \u201cgenerally vote for proposals requesting a report on company or company supplier labor and/or human rights standards and policies, or on the impact of its operations on society\u201d.</p> <p>Eighteen of the 19 Goldman funds with shares in JPMorgan also voted against an effort to prohibit the accelerated vesting of awards for executives who enter government service, a practice often <a href=\"https://newrepublic.com/article/120967/wall-street-pays-bankers-work-government-and-wants-it-secret\">criticized</a> for fueling the revolving door between Wall Street and financial regulators.</p> <p>A <a href=\"http://www.investor.jnj.com/_document/2018-proxy-statement?id=00000162-2469-d298-ad7a-657f7bcf0000\">shareholder proposal</a> to the board of pharmaceutical manufacturer Johnson &amp; Johnson, expressing concern that the company\u2019s compensation practices \u201cmay insulate senior executives from legal risks\u201d relating to the opioids crisis, recommended that opioid-related litigation costs be factored into executive pay. All 16 Goldman funds with stock in Johnson &amp; Johnson voted to defeat the proposal.</p> <p>Goldman asserts that its fund is designed to invest in firms that rank well in Just Capital\u2019s ratings. But even that assertion is not what it seems.</p> <p>Because the index features companies ranked in the top half of their respective industries, it includes dozens of firms in sectors like energy and financial services that score poorly overall. For example, the fund invests in both National Oilwell Varco, a drilling equipment firm, and Entergy, a Louisiana utility, despite the fact that the companies rank 626th and 676th, respectively, among the 875 companies evaluated by Just Capital.</p> <p>\u201cEvery industry is represented at approximately the same weight as [in] the Russell 1000,\u201d said Just Capital\u2019s Hernando Cortina, referring to the best-known index fund tracking the largest publicly traded companies. Cortina added that the Just fund is designed to feature responsible companies \u201cwhile providing diversified equity exposure to every industry\u201d.</p> <p>Lisa Lindsley of SumOfUs said the situation spotlights how socially responsible investing is seen on Wall Street not as a values-based cause, but as yet another way to trick investors into believing that the investment industry has reformed itself a decade after the financial crisis.</p> <p>\u201cThe reason they\u2019re going into this is that there\u2019s money there. It\u2019s all driven by greed,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty easy to do some greenwashing and call yourself a responsible investment manager.\u201d</p> <p>As Goldman now markets its Just fund, it remains unclear whether the company will change its proxy voting or its posture towards shareholder resolutions in general. Those resolutions, though, could be more rare, if congressional Republicans pass their legislation that would make it more difficult for shareholder resolutions to qualify for a vote. Federal <a href=\"https://soprweb.senate.gov/index.cfm?event=getFilingDetails&amp;filingID=529E9269-FC6B-4457-B821-E9A91D030A34&amp;filingTypeID=60\">records</a> show that the American Bankers Association \u2013 which <a href=\"https://www.aba.com/supplierdirectory/SupplierDetail.aspx?id=462466\">lists</a> Goldman Sachs as a member \u2013 has been lobbying on that bill, which critics say could undermine the SRI movement.</p> <p>\u201cShareholder proposals play an important role in ensuring that owners get a say in how their companies are run, and in setting the broader agenda across the market,\u201d <a href=\"http://www.glasslewis.com/legislative-update-hr-5756-threatens-shareholder-proposal-resubmission-thresholds/\">wrote</a> Dimitri Zagoroff of the shareholder advisory firm Glass Lewis. \u201cMaking it harder for shareholder proposals to be resubmitted from year to year would make it that much harder for proponents to refine their ideas and build a coalition of support.

                "bodyText":"When Goldman Sachs and billionaire Paul Tudor Jones announced a partnership three months ago to help socially conscious investors support \u201cjust business behavior\u201d, they promised that their new index fund would generate solid returns for savers while directing their investment dollars towards truly humane companies. \u201cCapitalism should be a positive force for change,\u201d said Jones in a press release announcing the fund, which is designed to track an index of socially responsible companies identified by his non-profit Just Capital. \u201cIts future will be driven by a new definition of corporate success that is aligned with the values and priorities of the public.\u201d The partnership comes as pension funds, university endowments and other institutional investors increasingly seek to put their financial weight behind ethical and sustainable corporate behavior. So far, the rebrand seems to be working: the Just fund debuted in June to rave reviews from the financial press and ended its first day of trading with over $250m in assets, making its launch one of the most successful in recent history. However, a Capital &amp; Main review of corporate documents shows that some of Just\u2019s largest investments are in fossil fuel firms that have been sued for suppressing global climate research, Wall Street behemoths fined for defrauding investors, a social media platform accused of helping rig elections and a tech industry giant criticized for paying its workers starvation wages. Moreover, proxy voting records reveal that even as Goldman Sachs now markets itself as a champion of social responsibility, the firm has been using its existing stakes in many Just fund companies to help CEOs block key environmental and social justice reforms proposed by their shareholders. Those initiatives range from gender pay gap and diversity initiatives to corporate governance reforms; from efforts to increase lobbying transparency to prohibitions on doing business with companies tied to genocide and other human rights violations. Meanwhile, in the months before Just fund\u2019s launch, Goldman was slammed for blocking a human rights resolution at its own company \u2013 and one of Goldman\u2019s key lobbying groups in Washington was working to shape Republican legislation that would make it far more difficult for shareholders to file environmental, human rights and other socially minded initiatives in the future. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t be able to, with a straight face, invest in the Dakota Access Pipeline with your left hand, and with your right hand tell people that you\u2019re doing responsible investing,\u201d Lisa Lindsley, capital markets adviser for the shareholder advocacy group SumOfUs, told Capital &amp; Main. \u201cThe compartmentalization is very hypocritical.\u201d Through a spokesperson, Goldman Sachs declined to comment on the process by which its equity funds vote on shareholder proposals, and how that process may differ with the Just fund \u2013 which, as a newly launched fund, has not yet participated in proxy voting for any of the companies in which it holds stock. \u2018Ethically motivated versus a more greenwashing approach\u2019 Goldman\u2019s new fund spotlights socially responsible investing (SRI) \u2013 a financial strategy that represents Wall Street\u2019s more affirmative answer to negative or exclusionary \u201cscreening\u201d tactics like divestment from fossil fuel producers and tobacco firms. While a recent directive by the Trump administration has been viewed by some experts as an effort to limit SRI strategies, the market for such investments remains strong. According to the Forum for Sustainable and Responsible Investment, US-based assets managed using SRI strategies more than doubled to $8.7tn between 2012 and 2016, and now account for more than one in five dollars under professional management in the country. The rise in SRI investment comes amid questions about whether corporate boards are adequately evaluating environmental and social justice concerns when they look at their company\u2019s long-term financial prospects. PwC\u2019s 2017 survey of corporate officials found \u201cthat directors are clearly out of step with investor priorities in some critical areas\u201d and the report added that \u201cone of these areas is environmental issues\u201d. High-profile initiatives like the Just fund are a chance for the industry to tout its eagerness, as the Goldman Sachs executive Timothy O\u2019Neill put it in a press release, to \u201c[allow] investment to flow toward a more sustainable and equitable future, while seeking to generate attractive returns for investors\u201d. The trend has given Wall Street an opportunity for an image makeover in a time of growing public distrust in the financial system: According to a Gallup poll conducted last month, fewer than half of Americans under 30 report having a positive view of capitalism, a 12-point drop in just the past two years. For some activists and investors, though, the rapid expansion of the market for SRI-branded financial products has raised concerns about greenwashing \u2013 the practice by which companies market themselves as socially or environmentally responsible without actually adopting business practices that meet those goals. \u201cPutting the word \u2018ethical\u2019 or \u2018sustainable\u2019 in the name of a fund does not make it so,\u201d said a report by British investment advisory firm Castlefield, whose recent reports documented how some environmental funds include investments in fossil fuel firms. \u201cIt is increasingly important to differentiate between those funds genuinely responding to customer demand for a sustainable approach and those which use terms like ethical, Socially Responsible Investment or stewardship in their name but include companies such as British American Tobacco or Shell in their key holdings.\u201d Goldman\u2019s record on socially responsible investing Amid surging interest in SRI funds, Goldman\u2019s Just US Large Cap Equity ETF aims to convince investors that the company is serious about injecting a spirit of ethics and morality into its financial strategies. To that end, the fund says it directs money only into companies that are ranked highly by Just Capital. The 426 companies featured in the Just index were selected on the basis of their performance across seven different criteria, including labor practices, customer service and environmental impacts. Goldman itself ranks in the top tenth of the Just rankings, despite the company being attacked for supporting the fossil fuel industry and also being fined $5bn in 2016 by the Department of Justice for \u201cserious misconduct in falsely assuring investors that securities it sold were backed by sound mortgages, when it knew that they were full of mortgages that were likely to fail\u201d. Whether Goldman\u2019s new Just fund represents a step in a larger shift towards socially responsible investment remains to be seen. Baruch College\u2019s Jared Peifer says that one way to judge a firm\u2019s commitment to social responsibility is to watch how it deals with resolutions brought by shareholders, whereby investors attempt to force management to adopt socially responsible policies. \u201cThere is variance to the degree that SRI funds are ethically motivated versus a more greenwashing approach,\u201d Peifer said. \u201cIs the fund dialoguing with management? Issuing shareholder proxy votes, voting on others? If so, that seems like a more ethically motivated fund to me, because they are exerting additional effort many other funds do not bother with.\u201d In recent years, Goldman executives have been fighting off SRI resolutions at their own company, including initiatives that have asked management to more transparently disclose their political lobbying and create a human rights committee to review the company\u2019s policies regarding doing business with governments engaged in censorship and repression. Only three months before Goldman announced the Just fund, Goldman successfully pressed the Securities and Exchange Commission to bless its move to block shareholders from voting on a resolution asking the company to honor indigenous peoples\u2019 rights. \u201cThe company\u2019s extraordinary no action request shows the notable lengths that the company is willing to go, and to stretch credulity, in order to prevent its directors from shouldering fiduciary obligations on indigenous and human rights,\u201d wrote shareholder proponents at the time. Last year, Goldman was lauded by Share Action, an SRI activist group, for switching its position and using its holdings to support a series of climate-change-related shareholder initiatives. In its proxy voting guidelines, Goldman says it will generally vote for proposals asking companies to report on \u201cpolicies, initiatives and oversight mechanisms related to environmental sustainability, or how the company may be impacted by climate change\u201d. However, those guidelines do not make the same commitment when it comes to initiatives requiring companies to actually reduce their carbon emissions. The guidelines also say the company will generally vote against \u201cproposals requesting increased disclosure of a company\u2019s policies with respect to political contributions\u201d. The company further says it will vote to remove representatives of employees or organized labor from a company\u2019s board if they are overseeing company audits or executive compensation, and if there is no legal requirement for them to be in that position. Goldman votes against resolutions at Just fund companies Goldman\u2019s hostility toward many SRI initiatives is illustrated by its votes on resolutions at the companies now in its Just fund. For example, there is Chevron Corporation, which ranks as the Just fund\u2019s 17th-largest holding as it faces accusations that it is trying to intimidate environmentalists and avoid cleaning up pollution in the Amazon rainforest. In May, the oil giant\u2019s shareholders were asked to vote on a slate of seven proposals, including a requirement for the company\u2019s board to nominate a director with environmental experience; the preparation of a report on transitioning to a low-carbon business model; increased transparency relating to lobbying activities; and stronger prohibitions on Chevron\u2019s interests overseas from doing business with governments that are complicit in genocide or crimes against humanity. As shareholders in Chevron, 14 different Goldman Sachs Asset Management (GSAM) funds voted on these proposals. The majority of funds voted in support of just one, a request for the company to prepare a report on its efforts to minimize methane emissions. In every other case, the funds unanimously or overwhelmingly opposed the proposals. Proxy-voting records from dozens of shareholder meetings reviewed by Capital &amp; Main show a similar pattern. In rare cases, Goldman funds did vote in favor of some shareholder reforms, including the preparation of a report on the gender pay gap at Facebook and Google. At several pharmaceutical companies, including AbbVie, Amgen and Eli Lilly, Goldman funds supported increased accountability for executives regarding high drug prices. Such votes, however, were few and far between. Of the 10 companies that make up the largest share of Goldman\u2019s Just fund, eight considered shareholder-proposed reforms that were overwhelmingly opposed by Goldman-managed funds at their most recent annual meetings. The proposals included prohibitions on offshore tax avoidance schemes, increased transparency on lobbying activities and requirements that companies appoint an independent board chair \u2013 a governance model that advocates say leads to more responsible corporate behavior. The remaining two companies, Microsoft and Visa, did not consider any shareholder proposals. At JPMorgan, the recipient of Just\u2019s fourth-largest investment, Goldman funds voted unanimously against a requirement for the company to release a report on its investments in PetroChina, a firm that activists accuse of helping to fund crimes against humanity due to its ongoing business relationships with oppressive regimes in Syria and Sudan. Goldman made that move despite its own proxy voting guidelines saying the company would \u201cgenerally vote for proposals requesting a report on company or company supplier labor and/or human rights standards and policies, or on the impact of its operations on society\u201d. Eighteen of the 19 Goldman funds with shares in JPMorgan also voted against an effort to prohibit the accelerated vesting of awards for executives who enter government service, a practice often criticized for fueling the revolving door between Wall Street and financial regulators. A shareholder proposal to the board of pharmaceutical manufacturer Johnson &amp; Johnson, expressing concern that the company\u2019s compensation practices \u201cmay insulate senior executives from legal risks\u201d relating to the opioids crisis, recommended that opioid-related litigation costs be factored into executive pay. All 16 Goldman funds with stock in Johnson &amp; Johnson voted to defeat the proposal. Goldman asserts that its fund is designed to invest in firms that rank well in Just Capital\u2019s ratings. But even that assertion is not what it seems. Because the index features companies ranked in the top half of their respective industries, it includes dozens of firms in sectors like energy and financial services that score poorly overall. For example, the fund invests in both National Oilwell Varco, a drilling equipment firm, and Entergy, a Louisiana utility, despite the fact that the companies rank 626th and 676th, respectively, among the 875 companies evaluated by Just Capital. \u201cEvery industry is represented at approximately the same weight as [in] the Russell 1000,\u201d said Just Capital\u2019s Hernando Cortina, referring to the best-known index fund tracking the largest publicly traded companies. Cortina added that the Just fund is designed to feature responsible companies \u201cwhile providing diversified equity exposure to every industry\u201d. Lisa Lindsley of SumOfUs said the situation spotlights how socially responsible investing is seen on Wall Street not as a values-based cause, but as yet another way to trick investors into believing that the investment industry has reformed itself a decade after the financial crisis. \u201cThe reason they\u2019re going into this is that there\u2019s money there. It\u2019s all driven by greed,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty easy to do some greenwashing and call yourself a responsible investment manager.\u201d As Goldman now markets its Just fund, it remains unclear whether the company will change its proxy voting or its posture towards shareholder resolutions in general. Those resolutions, though, could be more rare, if congressional Republicans pass their legislation that would make it more difficult for shareholder resolutions to qualify for a vote. Federal records show that the American Bankers Association \u2013 which lists Goldman Sachs as a member \u2013 has been lobbying on that bill, which critics say could undermine the SRI movement. \u201cShareholder proposals play an important role in ensuring that owners get a say in how their companies are run, and in setting the broader agenda across the market,\u201d wrote Dimitri Zagoroff of the shareholder advisory firm Glass Lewis. \u201cMaking it harder for shareholder proposals to be resubmitted from year to year would make it that much harder for proponents to refine their ideas and build a coalition of support. This often takes several years, both to generate interest in the underlying topic, and to convince other shareholders that the specific proposal offers the appropriate means of addressing the topic.\u201d Co-published by Capital &amp; Main, a non-profit investigative news site based in Los Angeles.",
