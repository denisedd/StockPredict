                "bodyText":"And finally, European stock markets have also racked up gains today, as trade war fears faded. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE 100 index gained 36 points to close at 7367, up 0.5%. There were bigger gains in France and Germany, as traders watched Wall Street soar to record levels. Over in New York, the Dow continues to rally. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s currently up 257 points or 1% at 26,662, on track for a record close. Connor Campbell of SpreadEx says: With investors choosing to view the current state of play between the US and China as a smidge better than initially feared, the Dow Jones led a substantial charge higher on Thursday. Despite the recent tit-for-tat tariff attacks between Beijing and Washington, Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s accusations that China is trying to undermine US democracy, AND the rather high likelihood that the Federal Reserve will raise rates next Wednesday, the Dow Jones managed to hit an all-time peak after the bell rang on Wall Street. The oil price continues to slide, following Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s call for Opec to take action this weekend. Brent crude is down almost 1% at $78.75 per barrel, while US crude has dipped by 0.3% to $70.92. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s all for today. Thanks for reading and commenting. GW Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s record highs on Wall Street suggest investors are less worried about a US-China trade war. Chemicals company DowDuPont is leading the way, up 2.2%, followed by chipmaker Intel (+2%), software giant Microsoft (+1.7%) and construction machinery maker Caterpillar (+1.5%). David Madden of CMC Markets says traders are relieved that the US and China didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t take more punitive measures this week: The rally has returned as the Dow Jones and S&amp;P 500 have set fresh record highs. The latest round of tariffs that were announced during the week weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t as severe has some traders were anticipating, and the market has breathed a sigh of relief. The fear of new tariffs proved to be worse than the tariffs themselves, and even though the US and China now have a worse trading relationship, dealers are still optimistic as there is no sign of additional tariffs in sight. Brexit continues to loom over the City, after European council president Donald Tusk warned that Theresa May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Chequers deal won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t work. The lack of a breakthrough at today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s leaders\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 summit in Salzburg may increase the risk that Britain leaves the EU without a deal. How bad would that be? Oxford Economics warn it would create a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153significant slowdown\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, with the pound tumbling and trade hit by new barriers. They reckon 2% would be knocked off the UK economy by 2020: Deutsche Bank are even more gloomy. They believe the UK would be tipped into a two-year recession, wiping 4% off GDP, as household consumption and business spending both shrink. President Trump has moved on from rebuking Opec, to welcome today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock market rally: Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s dislike of higher oil prices is well known -- he fears they will hurt US consumers by driving up the cost of gasoline. But Charles Bond, natural resources partner at law firm Gowling WLG, suggests the president should see the bigger picture, rather than fire tweets at Opec. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s motive here is clearly to bring the price of oil down but that may have a wider effect in transactional terms. The recent return to higher oil prices has meant that companies in the sector globally can start to benefit from capital investment again and the benefits that come with it, such as business expansion and increased economic activity. Any artificial attempt to stem this would need to be balanced very carefully given the likely consequences for the wider industry.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our latest take on the Danske Bank money-laundering scandal: Donald Trump has also channeled his inner Norman Tebbit today, by telling Americans to take advantage of the strong labor market and look for a better job. The S&amp;P 500, which covers a wider range of companies than the Dow, has also hit a record high in early trading. Boom! America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dow Jones industrial average has hit a new all-time high. Shares have jumped at the start of trading in New York, sending the Dow up by over 230 points to 26,643 points. That takes the index over its previous record, set in January this year (just as Donald Trump was speaking at Davos). Technology stocks are driving the index higher. There is also optimism that the US-China trade war could be resolved -- earlier today, Beijing argued that talks, not tariffs, were the solution. Shares are also benefitting from the recent weakness of the US dollar, which has dropped to its lowest level since July today. Dean Popplewell, vice president of Market Analysis at OANDA, points out that oil stockpiles have been falling recently, helping to underpin prices. EIA data Wednesday showed that U.S crude oil stockpiles fell for a fifth consecutive week to a three-year low in the week to Sept. 14, while gas stocks also showed a larger than expected draw on unseasonably strong demand. Crude inventories fell by -2.1m barrels, compared with expectations for a decrease of -2.7m. OPEC and other producers, including Russia, meet on Sunday in Algeria to discuss how to allocate supply increases to offset the loss of Iranian barrels. Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s claim that Opec is a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcmonopoly\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t really stand up to scrutiny. The countries which make up Opec produce around 40% of the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s crude oil, and around 60% of the total petroleum traded internationally. So it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s big enough to influence the market, but it doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t control the whole thing. The president would have been on stronger ground if he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d called Opec a cartel -- there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no argument that it agrees production levels in an attempt to influence the oil price. But... the more Opec pushes the oil price up, the more profitable America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shale oil industry becomes.... What a difference a tweet makes. Brent crude has fallen by one dollar per barrel since Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tweet, from almost $79.75 per barrel to below $79. Some traders may have concluded that Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s intervention raises the chances that Saudi Arabia pushes for an increase in output at this weekend\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Opec meeting. Donald Trump appears to be trying to prevent the oil price rising over $80 per barrel. Bloomberg\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s James Herron explains: Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fresh intervention in the oil market comes before a meeting of ministers from the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies in Algeria on Sunday. His complaint follows signals from Saudi Arabia that it was content to see prices climb above $80 a barrel. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been a red line for the White House in the past, provoking the president to direct his first social-media barb against the cartel since July 4. Boom! The US president has demanded that the OPEC oil cartel take action to bring the oil price down. Donald Trump has tweeted that Middle Eastern countries aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t showing sufficient gratitude for America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s military support, by pushing crude prices to their current levels. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a clear nudge to Opec members, such as Saudi Arabia, to agree a production boost when they meet this weekend. Brent crude is currently trading near to $80 per barrel, close to its highest level since November 2014. Oil prices have been climbing sharply since Opec agreed a historic deal to curb production in late 2016. That output freeze has helped to remove over-capacity from the market, meaning producers benefit from higher prices. Opec members will meet with non-Opec countries, such as Russia, over the weekend to examine their production quotas. Oil analysts believe they are unlikely to lift production limits, despite pressure from America. Iran, for example, has indicated it is happy with oil at $80 per barrel, so would presumably oppose a production increase. Tehran also doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t enjoy military protection from the US, of course, so Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s threat may not carry much weight. Iran\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s oil production is likely to drop as US sanctions kick in. That creates a new dilemma for Opec, as one source told Reuters: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s complicated. Saudi Arabia has to balance oil supply and demand, and it has to balance oil prices so they don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t rise too much before the U.S. elections,. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also political because the Saudis don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to pump too much oil then the Iranians complain to OPEC that it (Saudi Arabia) is taking (Iran\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s) market share. They also don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want oil prices to fall too much.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Uh oh. Sky News are reporting that high street bicycle chain Evans Cycles is looking for a new buyer, as the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153toxic\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd retail environment threatens to claim another victim. Clearly the upturn in retail spending last month hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t given Evans much of a boost. More here. Ryanair investors are calling on the budget airline to heed today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s revolt at its AGM. Campaign group ShareAction says the fact that nearly one in three shareholders fail to back chairman David Bonderman is proof that change is needed, following a year marked by pilot strikes. Mara Lilley, senior campaigns officer at ShareAction, says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It might not sound like it, but 30% of Ryanair shareholders wanting to oust Bonderman \u00e2\u20ac\u201c up from 11% last year \u00e2\u20ac\u201c is a clear signal that business cannot and must not continue as usual. His cosy relationship with O\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Leary has allowed the chief executive to get away with tantrums in the face of serious workforce issues and poor industrial relations which will end up hitting profits. We predict next year Bonderman\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s long-haul tenure will finally come to a well-deserved end.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Alison Kennedy of Aberdeen Standard Investments made a similar point at the AGM. Although ASI backed Bonderman, and independent director Kyran McLaughlin today, their patience is running thin. Kennedy warned: Given the challenges the company faces, for example in union and labour relations, it is clear that governance needs to evolve. Strong, independent and visible board leadership is more important than ever. So, we expect that there will be clear progress on succession for these two key board positions by the time of the AGM next year. If not, others things being equal, we will vote against the re-election of Mr Bonderman, Mr McLaughlin and the other members of the Nominations Committee. Drinks giant Diageo, whose tipples include Johnnie Walker, Baileys and Smirnoff, says today that it has been hit by the recent turmoil in emerging market currencies. This is expected to reduce sales by \u00c2\u00a3175m and cut operating profits by \u00c2\u00a345m in the year to 30 June, the company reported today. Money laundering at Denmark\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest bank is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the biggest scandal\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in Europe and could prompt action from regulators in Brussels, the European commission has said. V\u00c4\u203ara Jourov\u00c3\u00a1, the European commissioner for justice, said she wanted to know if a failure of banking supervision led to lapses that allowed \u00e2\u201a\u00ac200bn (\u00c2\u00a3178bn) of illegally-laundered funds to flow through Danske Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Estonian branch. The bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chief executive, Thomas Borgen, resigned on Wednesday, after admitting the bank had failed \u00e2\u20ac\u0153to live up to its responsibilities\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, allowing dirty money to flow out of Russia, the UK and the British Virgin Islands, through its Estonian branch. The commissioner will meet ministers from Denmark, Estonia and Finland on 2 October to investigate what went wrong. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I want to understand better where the main errors happened, whether it was purely a fault of the due diligence done by the bank itself, or whether there was some mistake of the supervisory authority,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Jourov\u00c3\u00a1 told reporters. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This is the biggest scandal, which we have now in Europe, which is also a very unpleasant lesson, which shows the need to be much more vigilant and much more prudent in checking.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd If there had been a mistake in supervision, she said, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153we will have to act\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. The European Banking Authority, an EU agency based in London, tightened controls on Malta\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Pilatus Bank, after its Iranian owner was charged by US authorities with evading sanctions and money laundering. The commissioner said action by the EBA had led to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153precise results\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd on Pilatus bank. But EU authorities want more powers for the agency: last week the commission called for the EBA to be able to order national authorities to tackle suspected money laundering. In a rather unusual move, the long-running battle to take control of UK broadcaster Sky will go to an auction this weekend. The Takeover Panel has decided that Rupert Murdoch\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 21st Century Fox, and rival bidder Comcast, should each make new bids in a three-round contest. Each can choose to raise their offers (currently \u00c2\u00a314 and \u00c2\u00a314.75 respectively). This will resolve the uncertainty that has been swirling over Sky since December, when Fox attempted to buy the 61% of Sky which it doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t already own. With neither side making a final offer, this auction should resolve Sky\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fate. This rise in UK retail spending is a little hard to square with the gloomy picture on UK high streets. Last week, for example, John Lewis reported that its profits had been virtually wiped out in the last six months. House of Fraser fell into administration in August, while Debenhams warned that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153underlying trends deteriorated through the summer months.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Hardly a rosy picture...but yet the ONS believes consumers are still spending. Given that inflation is rising, and wage growth has been modest, some consumers may be falling into deeper debt to sustain this spending. Josie Dent, Economist at the CEBR think tank, believes a squeeze is coming: While today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s headline figure paints a rosy picture for retail, more timely indicators show that the high street is struggling this month. John Lewis Partnership figures for last week show that the total value of sales was 2.2% lower than the same week a year ago, while for their financial year-to-date, sales are down 0.5% on the same time period last year. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s report also confirms that the unusually warm weather - and unusually successful England football team - boosted spending. The ONS says: Household goods stores also reported strong growth during the summer of 5.8% compared with a fall in the previous year, with anecdotal evidence from retailers suggesting that the FIFA World Cup had boosted sales of televisions alongside the positive impact of the warm weather. Food sales also did well with the good weather when compared with the previous summer, with a growth of 3.2% in comparison with a fall of 0.7% in summer 2017. August\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s retail sales are a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153mixed bag\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, argues Tom Stevenson, investment director for Personal Investing at Fidelity International. He points to the drop in clothing and food sales, as a sign that consumers are feeling the pinch: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The headline level of retail sales data was unexpectedly strong for August, although buoyant household goods volumes were offset by declines in food, clothing and petrol. Food and clothing retreated after benefiting from the unusually warm weather in July. The rising cost of fuel is also starting to bite. So this is a mixed bag, which paints an unconvincing picture of recovery on the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s struggling high streets. Strong online sales suggest that far-reaching structural changes in UK retail continue apace. Sam Tombs of Pantheon Economists reckons this spending splurge won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t last: Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s forecast-beating retail sales figures suggest the UK economy grew robustly in the last quarter, says economist Howard Archer of the EY Item Club: Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s more details: The surprise rise in UK retail sales last month has pushed the pound back to $1.32, a gain of half a cent. Newsflash: UK shoppers kept spending in August despite rising inflation and worries over Brexit. Retail sales volumes (the amount of stuff people bought) rose by 0.3% in August compared with July, the Office for National Statistics says. That beats forecasts of a 0.2% decline. The ONS says that household goods sales jumped by 4.5%, while other non-food stores enjoyed a 2.8% rise. However, food sales dropped by 0.6% and clothing fell by 1.9%. Yesterday we learned that UK inflation jumped to 2.7% in August, from 2.5% in July, partly due to a jump in clothing and transport costs. This doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t seem to have dampened demand for goods, though. On an annual basis, sales in June-August were 3.4% up than a year earlier - partly thanks to the summer heatwave. Office for National Statistics senior statistician, Rhian Murphy, says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Retail sales remained strong in the three months to August, with continued growth across all sectors. Food and household goods stores particularly benefitted from the warm weather when compared with last summer. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The figures for the month of August were a little more mixed, with food sales falling after strong sales earlier in the summer and clothing sales declining following a strong July, as suggested by clothing retailers. On the other hand, household goods grew strongly.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Back to the US-China trade war, and billionaire Jack Ma has ditched his goal of creating a million new jobs for Americans. Ma blamed the rising protectionist conflict between Beijing and Washington, saying the lack of friendly relations make the pledge unviable. CNBC has the details: Jack Ma, founder and chairman of Chinese retail giant Alibaba, says the company no longer plans to create 1 million jobs in the United States in the wake of the ongoing trade conflict between the U.S. and China. Ma made his original job creation pronouncement during a high-profile meeting with Donald Trump in January 2017 before Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s inauguration as president. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The promise was made on the premise of friendly US-China partnership and rational trade relations,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Ma told Chinese news site Xinhua on Wednesday. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153That premise no longer exists today, so our promise cannot be fulfilled.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Ryanair\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s AGM is underway. In a surprise twist, the airline lifted its ban on journalists attending (just as well, as hacks were congregating outside anyway). Ryanair is now revealing the results of the shareholder votes. Founder Michael O\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Leary is re-elected with 98.5% support from proxy votes (votes made in advance by investors). But there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a rebellion against the chairman; only 70.5% of votes are cast in favour of David Bonderman\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s re-election. Independent director Kyran McLaughlin received just 66.8pc of votes in favour of his reappointment. Major investor Aberdeen Standard is now warning that Ryanair needs a proper succession plan, or it will rebel next year too. Back in the UK, luxury carmaker Aston Martin has unveiled plans to float on the stock market. The company, famous for its links to the James Bond franchise, reckons it could be worth over \u00c2\u00a35bn. But will investors agree, given the uncertainty over how Brexit will affect the UK car industry?.... Newsflash: Switzerland\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s central bank has warned that trade disputes and the emerging markets crisis are threatening economic growth. Following its latest monetary policy meeting, the SNB said the economic outlook remains favourable - but protectionism could change that. It warns: To date, the crises of confidence in Turkey and Argentina have not materially impacted the global economic outlook. The risks to this positive baseline scenario are more to the downside. Chief among them are political uncertainties in some countries as well as potential international tensions and protectionist tendencies. The SNB has left interest rates on hold at their current record low of minus 0.75%. China has also hit back at Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s claim that it is trying to undermine US democracy. Commerce ministry spokesman Gao Feng insists that the new tariffs on $60bn of US goods, which kick in next week, had \u00e2\u20ac\u0153nothing to do\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd with US politics. Gao was responding to the US president\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s claim that China is targeting voters such as farmers, ranchers and factory workers. These tweets from Tuesday, for example, show that Trump believes Beijing is trying to hurt his supporters, by putting tariffs on US agricultural products and machinery. China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s commerce ministry has vowed not to launch a currency war with America. Speaking to journalists, spokesman Gao Feng says that it will not use the yuan as a tool to resolve its trade dispute, and will maintain it at a reasonable level. Gao points out that a depreciating yuan is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153more detrimental than beneficial\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade war with China remains the biggest story in the markets today (although Brexit is doing its best to share the spotlight). After the flurry of tit-for-tat tariffs earlier this week, global investors are watching nervously to see whether the conflict escalates further, or if officials can negotiate a truce. In the last few minutes, China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s government has launched a stinging attack on Washington, saying America hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t been sincere over trade. Clearly Beijing isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t happy that Donald Trump signed off 10% tariffs on $200bn of their goods, at the same time as the White House was pushing for new talks. Reuters has the details: China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s foreign ministry said on Tuesday that talks on an equal footing are the only correct way to resolve trade issues with the United States, after U.S.President Donald Trump imposed 10% tariffs on about $200bn worth of Chinese imports. The United States\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 current unilateral trade actions cannot be accepted by China, and the United States has not been sincere, ministry spokesman Geng Shuang told a daily news briefing. The commerce ministry also said it is studying \u00e2\u20ac\u0153targeted measures\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to help foreign firms in its economy. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a sign that Beijing is taking steps to protect itself from the impact of the trade war. Bloomberg is reporting that China is planning to cut the average tariff rates on imports from the majority of its trading partners as soon as next month. That would help Chinese consumers, who face paying more for US imports. Also coming up today The Office for National Statistics publishes Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s retail sales figures for August this morning. They\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re expected to show a 0.2% decline, following a 0.7% jump in July, as household spending power remains squeezed. David Madden of CMC Markets says: Traders will be watching this report closely as consumer appetite needs to be healthy to drive the economy along. There could be turbulence (sorry) at Ryanair\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s annual general meeting today. One investors, Royal London Asset Management, has vowed to vote against the airline\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chairman and two other board members.

To that end, the fund says it directs money only into companies that are ranked highly by <a href=\"https://justcapital.com/\">Just</a><a href=\"https://justcapital.com/\"> Capital</a>.</p> <p>The 426 companies featured in the Just index were selected on the basis of their performance across seven different criteria, including labor practices, customer service and environmental impacts. Goldman itself ranks in the top tenth of the Just rankings, despite the company being <a href=\"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/global-fossil-fuels-banks-report_us_5aba989fe4b04a59a3122636\">attacked</a> for supporting the fossil fuel industry and also being <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/goldman-sachs-agrees-pay-more-5-billion-connection-its-sale-residential-mortgage-backed\">fined</a> $5bn in 2016 by the Department of Justice for \u00e2\u20ac\u0153serious misconduct in falsely assuring investors that securities it sold were backed by sound mortgages, when it knew that they were full of mortgages that were likely to fail\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd.</p> <p>Whether Goldman\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new Just fund represents a step in a larger shift towards socially responsible investment remains to be seen. Baruch College\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Jared Peifer says that one way to judge a firm\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s commitment to social responsibility is to watch how it deals with resolutions brought by shareholders, whereby investors attempt to force management to adopt socially responsible policies.</p> <p>\u00e2\u20ac\u0153There is variance to the degree that SRI funds are ethically motivated versus a more greenwashing approach,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Peifer said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Is the fund dialoguing with management? Issuing shareholder proxy votes, voting on others? If so, that seems like a more ethically motivated fund to me, because they are exerting additional effort many other funds do not bother with.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd</p> <p>In recent years, Goldman executives have been fighting off SRI resolutions at their own company, including initiatives that have asked management to more transparently disclose their <a href=\"https://www.goldmansachs.com/s/2018-proxy-statement/images/Goldman_Sach-Proxy2018.pdf\">political lobbying</a> and create a <a href=\"https://www.goldmansachs.com/investor-relations/financials/archived/proxy-statements/docs/2013-proxy-statement-pdf.pdf\">human rights committee</a> to review the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s policies regarding doing business with governments engaged in censorship and repression. Only three months before Goldman announced the Just fund, Goldman successfully <a href=\"https://www.sec.gov/divisions/corpfin/cf-noaction/14a-8/2018/harringtoninvestments031218-14a8.pdf\">pressed</a> the Securities and Exchange Commission to bless its move to block shareholders from voting on a resolution asking the company to honor indigenous peoples\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 rights.</p> <p>\u00e2\u20ac\u0153The company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s extraordinary no action request shows the notable lengths that the company is willing to go, and to stretch credulity, in order to prevent its directors from shouldering fiduciary obligations on indigenous and human rights,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd wrote shareholder proponents at the time.</p> <p>Last year, Goldman was lauded by <a href=\"https://shareaction.org/warming-up-to-climate-resolutions/\">Share Action</a>, an SRI activist group, for switching its position and using its holdings to support a series of climate-change-related shareholder initiatives. In its <a href=\"https://www.gsam.com/content/dam/gsam/pdfs/us/en/miscellaneous/voting_proxy_policy.pdf?sa=n&amp;rd=n\">proxy voting guidelines</a>, Goldman says it will generally vote for proposals asking companies to report on \u00e2\u20ac\u0153policies, initiatives and oversight mechanisms related to environmental sustainability, or how the company may be impacted by climate change\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd.</p> <p>However, those guidelines do not make the same commitment when it comes to initiatives requiring companies to actually reduce their carbon emissions. The guidelines also say the company will generally vote against \u00e2\u20ac\u0153proposals requesting increased disclosure of a company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s policies with respect to political contributions\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. The company further says it will vote to remove representatives of employees or organized labor from a company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s board if they are overseeing company audits or executive compensation, and if there is no legal requirement for them to be in that position.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"eb8e34e46eb40f84b582a75761928e2ba31e4b44\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/eb8e34e46eb40f84b582a75761928e2ba31e4b44/0_0_1359_1600/849.jpg\" alt=\"JUST Table\" width=\"849\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">JUST Table</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Handout</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>Goldman </strong><strong>votes </strong><strong>against </strong><strong>resolutions at Just</strong><strong> </strong><strong>fund </strong><strong>companies</strong></h2> <p>Goldman\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hostility toward many SRI initiatives is illustrated by its votes on resolutions at the companies now in its Just fund.</p> <p>For example, there is Chevron Corporation, which ranks as the Just fund\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 17th-largest holding as it <a href=\"http://www.csrwire.com/press_releases/41323-In-SLAPP-Attack-Chevron-Trying-to-Intimidate-Citizens-Who-Challenged-Company-Over-Massive-Pollution-In-Amazon\">faces</a> <a href=\"https://www.greenpeace.org/international/story/16448/chevrons-slapp-suit-against-ecuadorians-corporate-intimidation/\">accusations</a> that it is trying to intimidate environmentalists and avoid cleaning up pollution in the Amazon rainforest.</p> <p>In May, the oil giant\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shareholders were asked to vote on a slate of <a href=\"https://www.chevron.com/-/media/shared-media/documents/chevron-proxy-statement-2018.pdf\">seven proposals</a>, including a requirement for the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s board to nominate a director with environmental experience; the preparation of a report on transitioning to a low-carbon business model; increased transparency relating to lobbying activities; and stronger prohibitions on Chevron\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s interests overseas from doing business with governments that are complicit in genocide or crimes against humanity.</p> <p>As shareholders in Chevron, 14 different Goldman Sachs Asset Management (GSAM) funds voted on these proposals. The majority of funds voted in support of just one, a request for the company to prepare a report on its efforts to minimize methane emissions. In every other case, the funds unanimously or overwhelmingly opposed the proposals.</p> <p>Proxy-voting records from dozens of shareholder meetings reviewed by Capital &amp; Main show a similar pattern. In rare cases, Goldman funds did vote in favor of some shareholder reforms, including the preparation of a report on the gender pay gap at Facebook and Google. At several pharmaceutical companies, including AbbVie, Amgen and Eli Lilly, Goldman funds supported increased accountability for executives regarding high drug prices.</p> <p>Such votes, however, were few and far between. Of the 10 companies that make up the largest share of Goldman\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Just fund, eight considered shareholder-proposed reforms that were overwhelmingly opposed by Goldman-managed funds at their most recent annual meetings. The proposals included prohibitions on offshore tax avoidance schemes, increased transparency on lobbying activities and requirements that companies appoint an independent board chair \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a governance model that advocates say leads to more responsible corporate behavior. The remaining two companies, Microsoft and Visa, did not consider any shareholder proposals.</p> <p>At JPMorgan, the recipient of Just\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fourth-largest investment, Goldman funds voted unanimously against a requirement for the company to release a report on its investments in PetroChina, a firm that <a href=\"https://www.investorsagainstgenocide.org/\">activists accuse</a> of helping to fund crimes against humanity due to its ongoing business relationships with oppressive regimes in Syria and Sudan. Goldman made that move despite its own <a href=\"https://www.gsam.com/content/dam/gsam/pdfs/us/en/miscellaneous/voting_proxy_policy.pdf?sa=n&amp;rd=n\">proxy voting guidelines</a> saying the company would \u00e2\u20ac\u0153generally vote for proposals requesting a report on company or company supplier labor and/or human rights standards and policies, or on the impact of its operations on society\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd.</p> <p>Eighteen of the 19 Goldman funds with shares in JPMorgan also voted against an effort to prohibit the accelerated vesting of awards for executives who enter government service, a practice often <a href=\"https://newrepublic.com/article/120967/wall-street-pays-bankers-work-government-and-wants-it-secret\">criticized</a> for fueling the revolving door between Wall Street and financial regulators.</p> <p>A <a href=\"http://www.investor.jnj.com/_document/2018-proxy-statement?id=00000162-2469-d298-ad7a-657f7bcf0000\">shareholder proposal</a> to the board of pharmaceutical manufacturer Johnson &amp; Johnson, expressing concern that the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s compensation practices \u00e2\u20ac\u0153may insulate senior executives from legal risks\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd relating to the opioids crisis, recommended that opioid-related litigation costs be factored into executive pay. All 16 Goldman funds with stock in Johnson &amp; Johnson voted to defeat the proposal.</p> <p>Goldman asserts that its fund is designed to invest in firms that rank well in Just Capital\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ratings. But even that assertion is not what it seems.</p> <p>Because the index features companies ranked in the top half of their respective industries, it includes dozens of firms in sectors like energy and financial services that score poorly overall. For example, the fund invests in both National Oilwell Varco, a drilling equipment firm, and Entergy, a Louisiana utility, despite the fact that the companies rank 626th and 676th, respectively, among the 875 companies evaluated by Just Capital.</p> <p>\u00e2\u20ac\u0153Every industry is represented at approximately the same weight as [in] the Russell 1000,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Just Capital\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Hernando Cortina, referring to the best-known index fund tracking the largest publicly traded companies. Cortina added that the Just fund is designed to feature responsible companies \u00e2\u20ac\u0153while providing diversified equity exposure to every industry\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd.</p> <p>Lisa Lindsley of SumOfUs said the situation spotlights how socially responsible investing is seen on Wall Street not as a values-based cause, but as yet another way to trick investors into believing that the investment industry has reformed itself a decade after the financial crisis.</p> <p>\u00e2\u20ac\u0153The reason they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re going into this is that there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s money there.

                "bodyText":"When Goldman Sachs and billionaire Paul Tudor Jones announced a partnership three months ago to help socially conscious investors support \u00e2\u20ac\u0153just business behavior\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, they promised that their new index fund would generate solid returns for savers while directing their investment dollars towards truly humane companies. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Capitalism should be a positive force for change,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Jones in a press release announcing the fund, which is designed to track an index of socially responsible companies identified by his non-profit Just Capital. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Its future will be driven by a new definition of corporate success that is aligned with the values and priorities of the public.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The partnership comes as pension funds, university endowments and other institutional investors increasingly seek to put their financial weight behind ethical and sustainable corporate behavior. So far, the rebrand seems to be working: the Just fund debuted in June to rave reviews from the financial press and ended its first day of trading with over $250m in assets, making its launch one of the most successful in recent history. However, a Capital &amp; Main review of corporate documents shows that some of Just\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest investments are in fossil fuel firms that have been sued for suppressing global climate research, Wall Street behemoths fined for defrauding investors, a social media platform accused of helping rig elections and a tech industry giant criticized for paying its workers starvation wages. Moreover, proxy voting records reveal that even as Goldman Sachs now markets itself as a champion of social responsibility, the firm has been using its existing stakes in many Just fund companies to help CEOs block key environmental and social justice reforms proposed by their shareholders. Those initiatives range from gender pay gap and diversity initiatives to corporate governance reforms; from efforts to increase lobbying transparency to prohibitions on doing business with companies tied to genocide and other human rights violations. Meanwhile, in the months before Just fund\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s launch, Goldman was slammed for blocking a human rights resolution at its own company \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and one of Goldman\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s key lobbying groups in Washington was working to shape Republican legislation that would make it far more difficult for shareholders to file environmental, human rights and other socially minded initiatives in the future. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153You shouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be able to, with a straight face, invest in the Dakota Access Pipeline with your left hand, and with your right hand tell people that you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re doing responsible investing,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Lisa Lindsley, capital markets adviser for the shareholder advocacy group SumOfUs, told Capital &amp; Main. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The compartmentalization is very hypocritical.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Through a spokesperson, Goldman Sachs declined to comment on the process by which its equity funds vote on shareholder proposals, and how that process may differ with the Just fund \u00e2\u20ac\u201c which, as a newly launched fund, has not yet participated in proxy voting for any of the companies in which it holds stock. \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcEthically motivated versus a more greenwashing approach\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Goldman\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new fund spotlights socially responsible investing (SRI) \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a financial strategy that represents Wall Street\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s more affirmative answer to negative or exclusionary \u00e2\u20ac\u0153screening\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd tactics like divestment from fossil fuel producers and tobacco firms. While a recent directive by the Trump administration has been viewed by some experts as an effort to limit SRI strategies, the market for such investments remains strong. According to the Forum for Sustainable and Responsible Investment, US-based assets managed using SRI strategies more than doubled to $8.7tn between 2012 and 2016, and now account for more than one in five dollars under professional management in the country. The rise in SRI investment comes amid questions about whether corporate boards are adequately evaluating environmental and social justice concerns when they look at their company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s long-term financial prospects. PwC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 2017 survey of corporate officials found \u00e2\u20ac\u0153that directors are clearly out of step with investor priorities in some critical areas\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and the report added that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153one of these areas is environmental issues\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. High-profile initiatives like the Just fund are a chance for the industry to tout its eagerness, as the Goldman Sachs executive Timothy O\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Neill put it in a press release, to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153[allow] investment to flow toward a more sustainable and equitable future, while seeking to generate attractive returns for investors\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. The trend has given Wall Street an opportunity for an image makeover in a time of growing public distrust in the financial system: According to a Gallup poll conducted last month, fewer than half of Americans under 30 report having a positive view of capitalism, a 12-point drop in just the past two years. For some activists and investors, though, the rapid expansion of the market for SRI-branded financial products has raised concerns about greenwashing \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the practice by which companies market themselves as socially or environmentally responsible without actually adopting business practices that meet those goals. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Putting the word \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcethical\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 or \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcsustainable\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 in the name of a fund does not make it so,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said a report by British investment advisory firm Castlefield, whose recent reports documented how some environmental funds include investments in fossil fuel firms. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It is increasingly important to differentiate between those funds genuinely responding to customer demand for a sustainable approach and those which use terms like ethical, Socially Responsible Investment or stewardship in their name but include companies such as British American Tobacco or Shell in their key holdings.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Goldman\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s record on socially responsible investing Amid surging interest in SRI funds, Goldman\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Just US Large Cap Equity ETF aims to convince investors that the company is serious about injecting a spirit of ethics and morality into its financial strategies. To that end, the fund says it directs money only into companies that are ranked highly by Just Capital. The 426 companies featured in the Just index were selected on the basis of their performance across seven different criteria, including labor practices, customer service and environmental impacts. Goldman itself ranks in the top tenth of the Just rankings, despite the company being attacked for supporting the fossil fuel industry and also being fined $5bn in 2016 by the Department of Justice for \u00e2\u20ac\u0153serious misconduct in falsely assuring investors that securities it sold were backed by sound mortgages, when it knew that they were full of mortgages that were likely to fail\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Whether Goldman\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new Just fund represents a step in a larger shift towards socially responsible investment remains to be seen. Baruch College\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Jared Peifer says that one way to judge a firm\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s commitment to social responsibility is to watch how it deals with resolutions brought by shareholders, whereby investors attempt to force management to adopt socially responsible policies. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153There is variance to the degree that SRI funds are ethically motivated versus a more greenwashing approach,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Peifer said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Is the fund dialoguing with management? Issuing shareholder proxy votes, voting on others? If so, that seems like a more ethically motivated fund to me, because they are exerting additional effort many other funds do not bother with.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd In recent years, Goldman executives have been fighting off SRI resolutions at their own company, including initiatives that have asked management to more transparently disclose their political lobbying and create a human rights committee to review the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s policies regarding doing business with governments engaged in censorship and repression. Only three months before Goldman announced the Just fund, Goldman successfully pressed the Securities and Exchange Commission to bless its move to block shareholders from voting on a resolution asking the company to honor indigenous peoples\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 rights. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s extraordinary no action request shows the notable lengths that the company is willing to go, and to stretch credulity, in order to prevent its directors from shouldering fiduciary obligations on indigenous and human rights,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd wrote shareholder proponents at the time. Last year, Goldman was lauded by Share Action, an SRI activist group, for switching its position and using its holdings to support a series of climate-change-related shareholder initiatives. In its proxy voting guidelines, Goldman says it will generally vote for proposals asking companies to report on \u00e2\u20ac\u0153policies, initiatives and oversight mechanisms related to environmental sustainability, or how the company may be impacted by climate change\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. However, those guidelines do not make the same commitment when it comes to initiatives requiring companies to actually reduce their carbon emissions. The guidelines also say the company will generally vote against \u00e2\u20ac\u0153proposals requesting increased disclosure of a company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s policies with respect to political contributions\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. The company further says it will vote to remove representatives of employees or organized labor from a company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s board if they are overseeing company audits or executive compensation, and if there is no legal requirement for them to be in that position. Goldman votes against resolutions at Just fund companies Goldman\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hostility toward many SRI initiatives is illustrated by its votes on resolutions at the companies now in its Just fund. For example, there is Chevron Corporation, which ranks as the Just fund\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 17th-largest holding as it faces accusations that it is trying to intimidate environmentalists and avoid cleaning up pollution in the Amazon rainforest. In May, the oil giant\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shareholders were asked to vote on a slate of seven proposals, including a requirement for the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s board to nominate a director with environmental experience; the preparation of a report on transitioning to a low-carbon business model; increased transparency relating to lobbying activities; and stronger prohibitions on Chevron\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s interests overseas from doing business with governments that are complicit in genocide or crimes against humanity. As shareholders in Chevron, 14 different Goldman Sachs Asset Management (GSAM) funds voted on these proposals. The majority of funds voted in support of just one, a request for the company to prepare a report on its efforts to minimize methane emissions. In every other case, the funds unanimously or overwhelmingly opposed the proposals. Proxy-voting records from dozens of shareholder meetings reviewed by Capital &amp; Main show a similar pattern. In rare cases, Goldman funds did vote in favor of some shareholder reforms, including the preparation of a report on the gender pay gap at Facebook and Google. At several pharmaceutical companies, including AbbVie, Amgen and Eli Lilly, Goldman funds supported increased accountability for executives regarding high drug prices. Such votes, however, were few and far between. Of the 10 companies that make up the largest share of Goldman\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Just fund, eight considered shareholder-proposed reforms that were overwhelmingly opposed by Goldman-managed funds at their most recent annual meetings. The proposals included prohibitions on offshore tax avoidance schemes, increased transparency on lobbying activities and requirements that companies appoint an independent board chair \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a governance model that advocates say leads to more responsible corporate behavior. The remaining two companies, Microsoft and Visa, did not consider any shareholder proposals. At JPMorgan, the recipient of Just\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fourth-largest investment, Goldman funds voted unanimously against a requirement for the company to release a report on its investments in PetroChina, a firm that activists accuse of helping to fund crimes against humanity due to its ongoing business relationships with oppressive regimes in Syria and Sudan. Goldman made that move despite its own proxy voting guidelines saying the company would \u00e2\u20ac\u0153generally vote for proposals requesting a report on company or company supplier labor and/or human rights standards and policies, or on the impact of its operations on society\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Eighteen of the 19 Goldman funds with shares in JPMorgan also voted against an effort to prohibit the accelerated vesting of awards for executives who enter government service, a practice often criticized for fueling the revolving door between Wall Street and financial regulators. A shareholder proposal to the board of pharmaceutical manufacturer Johnson &amp; Johnson, expressing concern that the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s compensation practices \u00e2\u20ac\u0153may insulate senior executives from legal risks\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd relating to the opioids crisis, recommended that opioid-related litigation costs be factored into executive pay. All 16 Goldman funds with stock in Johnson &amp; Johnson voted to defeat the proposal. Goldman asserts that its fund is designed to invest in firms that rank well in Just Capital\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ratings. But even that assertion is not what it seems. Because the index features companies ranked in the top half of their respective industries, it includes dozens of firms in sectors like energy and financial services that score poorly overall. For example, the fund invests in both National Oilwell Varco, a drilling equipment firm, and Entergy, a Louisiana utility, despite the fact that the companies rank 626th and 676th, respectively, among the 875 companies evaluated by Just Capital. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Every industry is represented at approximately the same weight as [in] the Russell 1000,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Just Capital\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Hernando Cortina, referring to the best-known index fund tracking the largest publicly traded companies. Cortina added that the Just fund is designed to feature responsible companies \u00e2\u20ac\u0153while providing diversified equity exposure to every industry\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Lisa Lindsley of SumOfUs said the situation spotlights how socially responsible investing is seen on Wall Street not as a values-based cause, but as yet another way to trick investors into believing that the investment industry has reformed itself a decade after the financial crisis. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The reason they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re going into this is that there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s money there. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s all driven by greed,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd she said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pretty easy to do some greenwashing and call yourself a responsible investment manager.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd As Goldman now markets its Just fund, it remains unclear whether the company will change its proxy voting or its posture towards shareholder resolutions in general. Those resolutions, though, could be more rare, if congressional Republicans pass their legislation that would make it more difficult for shareholder resolutions to qualify for a vote. Federal records show that the American Bankers Association \u00e2\u20ac\u201c which lists Goldman Sachs as a member \u00e2\u20ac\u201c has been lobbying on that bill, which critics say could undermine the SRI movement. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Shareholder proposals play an important role in ensuring that owners get a say in how their companies are run, and in setting the broader agenda across the market,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd wrote Dimitri Zagoroff of the shareholder advisory firm Glass Lewis. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Making it harder for shareholder proposals to be resubmitted from year to year would make it that much harder for proponents to refine their ideas and build a coalition of support. This often takes several years, both to generate interest in the underlying topic, and to convince other shareholders that the specific proposal offers the appropriate means of addressing the topic.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Co-published by Capital &amp; Main, a non-profit investigative news site based in Los Angeles.",
