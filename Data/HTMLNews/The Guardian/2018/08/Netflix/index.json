Markit said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>US manufacturing firms signalled a strong improvement in operating conditions in July, despite the headline PMI falling to a five-month low. Weaker rises in output and employment were seen in July, while export sales fell for the second month in a row. Meanwhile, companies reported the greatest deterioration in vendor performance since the series began and a faster rate of input cost inflation. That said, business confidence remained strongly positive, and was supported by hopes of further increases in overall new orders. </p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"229fcaf4943b426b3e0f5d17bf54c1384b6c92c5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/229fcaf4943b426b3e0f5d17bf54c1384b6c92c5/0_0_873_518/500.jpg\" alt=\"uspmi1aug\" width=\"500\" height=\"297\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit said: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The US manufacturing sector continued to expand in July, but shows increasing signs of struggling against headwinds of supply shortages, rising prices and deteriorating exports. </p> <p>The latest survey showed output rising at a rate roughly equivalent to an annualised 1% pace of expansion, which is the weakest since late last year. While a weakening of new export orders for a second successive month suggested foreign demand has waned compared to earlier in the year, the slowdown can be also in part attributed to increased difficulties in sourcing sufficient quantities of inputs. Suppliers\u2019 delivery delays were more widespread than at any time in the survey\u2019s history. With producers often scrambling to buy enough raw materials, suppliers enjoyed greater pricing power. Not surprisingly, with tariffs also kicking in, cost pressures spiked higher again.</p> <p>Some relief for manufacturers came from strong domestic demand, which meant firms were increasingly able to pass higher costs on to customers. Average prices charged for goods consequently rose at the steepest rate for seven years, which is likely to feed through to higher consumer prices in coming months.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5b61b799e4b0081aec3b9962\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-08-01T13:38:50.581Z\">2.38pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Apple\u2019s rise has helped lift technology stocks on Wall Street, pushing the Nasdaq Composite 0.39% higher.</p> <p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average - which also includes Apple - is marginally higher, up 0.04% while the S&amp;P 500 has opened 0.17% higher.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5b61b0b8e4b0081aec3b991c\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-08-01T13:31:22.438Z\">2.31pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Apple shares open up 4.4%</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Following its forecast-beating results and upbeat outlook, Apple shares have jumped 4.4% to $198.4. at the start of the day\u2019s trading, helping support a US market rattled by renewed concerns about a damaging trade war between the US and China.</p> <p>The move means Apple is close to becoming the first company to be valued at $1tn.

All eyes will be on Wall Street\u2019s open to see how the better than expected results are received. Will investors push Apple higher or decide to take profits? Neil Wilson, chief market analyst at Markets.com, says:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Apple shares leapt 4% in after-hours trade and are set to open at a record high just shy of the $200 level. Although it would be a bit of a stretch, a push up to the $1tn mark today is a possibility - it\u2019s only a matter of time before it achieves a valuation of $1tn. If it does, cue some big profit taking but it would be a moment to savour for Tim Cook.</p> <p> We need the share price to break $203 to hit $1tn in market cap \u2013 a little more than $5 above the after-hours level at $197-$198. Rather like the Dow at 25k, you kind of get the feeling investors will conspire to nudge it over the line. If you\u2019re in FAANGs now I don\u2019t see why you wouldn\u2019t rotate some equity out of more exposed companies like Facebook and Netflix and opt for relative safety in Apple, whose multiples remain well short of FAANG peers. What might weigh today is broader market fears about trade wars with China as the White House sets out fresh tariff plans on $200bn of Chinese goods. Tim Cook was pretty circumspect on trade and tariffs on the call.</p> <p> Results were very impressive with a beat on revenues and EPS. iPhone sales were a shade weaker than forecast but on a number of important fronts we saw excellent numbers.</p> </blockquote> <p>The FAANGs - Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix and Google-owner Alphabet - and the wider technology sector have been under pressure in recent days after poor results from Facebook and Twitter.

Of more concern is the weakest business confidence score for 21 months, indicating that the industry is desperate for a degree of clarity and progress on the Brexit negotiations and a better understanding of what the final outcome will mean for manufacturers.</p> <p>It looks like a tale of two markets at the moment, with export growth accelerating but domestic demand struggling to keep pace. Aside from the encouraging news for exporters, the only other real bright spot was more job growth, with two full years of consecutive monthly employment increases no mean feat.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5b617ad6e4b0081aec3b9657\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-08-01T09:22:04.728Z\">10.22am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Following the weaker than expected UK manufacturing report, things are unlikely to improve in the immediate future, says ING Bank economist James Smith. But the downbeat survey is unlikely to discourage the Bank of England from raising interest rates on Thursday, he says:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>At 54.0, the latest UK manufacturing PMI is the lowest in three months and is a far cry from the levels seen towards the end of 2017. Weaker domestic demand saw new orders fall and the rate of output growth slip to the lowest in 16 months. Interestingly though, demand from abroad hit a six-month high, implying that firms are still reaping the rewards of better global growth, despite the recent moderation in Europe.</p> <p>But over coming months, life for manufacturers is unlikely to get any easier. The recent escalation in trade tensions is clearly a challenge, but increasingly the biggest headache for businesses is likely to be the threat of a \u2018no deal\u2019 Brexit. This scenario would likely see huge congestion at ports and disruption to supply chains. While we suspect the probability of the UK leaving without an agreement in March next year is relatively low, an agreement may not come until late in the day.</p> <p>Until then, confidence could begin to fall as uncertainty increases \u2013 the latest PMI suggests the degree of positive sentiment is already at a 21-month low.</p> <p>Having said all of that, today\u2019s slip in the PMI is unlikely to faze Bank of England policymakers ahead of tomorrow\u2019s decision. Representing around 10% of output, manufacturing is a relatively small part of the UK growth mix. Importantly, the recent data flow \u2013 particularly in the much larger service sector \u2013 has largely backed up the Bank\u2019s view that the economy has regained poise after the weak first quarter.</p> <p>For that reason, we think the Bank of England will increase interest rates this week. But the key thing to watch is what the Bank has to say on its next steps. In an ideal world, we think policymakers would like to hike rates again much sooner than markets are currently pricing (towards the end of 2019). But with Brexit uncertainty considerably ramping up, realistically we think the Bank will struggle to raise rates again before the UK leaves the EU next March.</p> <p>After Thursday, we currently don\u2019t anticipate another hike before May 2019.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5b61725ee4b0353e1304fc95\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-08-01T08:43:22.623Z\">9.43am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The prospect of a trade war between the US and China is the biggest worry for UK manufacturers, says Dave Atkinson, UK head of manufacturing at Lloyds Bank Commercial Banking:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The dip in the [PMI] reading comes after an eventful month politically. But if manufacturers are not completely ignoring the Brexit uncertainty, they are nevertheless ploughing on regardless.</p> <p>If anything, the biggest current worry for a sector with so many exporters is the prospect of an all-out trade war between the world\u2019s two largest economies. The fear is that UK manufacturers become collateral damage in any tit-for-tat tariffs that are imposed at a time when firms are benefiting from their exposure to the still relatively buoyant global economy.</p> <p>The automotive industry is facing a particularly anxious time grappling as it is with weaker consumer sentiment, ambivalence towards diesel engines and uncertainty about those future trade arrangements. This is a real worry given the number of jobs and exports supported by the sector.</p> <p>But by contrast, UK aerospace enjoyed a good July, boosted by the Farnborough Airshow. Bumper orders for the major aircraft manufacturers will help the small- and medium-sized businesses in their supply chains and the launch of the new Tempest fighter jet has the potential to safeguard thousands of highly-skilled jobs.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5b617196e4b0353e1304fc92\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-08-01T08:40:22.303Z\">9.40am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The weaker than expected figures could give the Bank of England second thoughts if it really is planning to raise UK interest rates on Thursday, suggests IHS Markit director Rob Dobson:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The financial markets still seem to have an interest rate increase nailed on for August.

Overall production slowed, whilst new order growth took a leisurely pace, and it was the unbalanced reliance on export orders that kept the sector afloat with domestic clients keeping their distance. </p> <p>This general manufacturing malaise was compounded by a scarcity of essential raw materials and vendor delivery times lengthened at a pace not seen for ten months as supply chains stuttered and stumbled to meet contractual obligations. </p> <p>On the price front, firms raised client prices again in a bid to prevent another sudden increase in their own costs from gnawing away at hard-won profits.

The final 7% lift in the share price required to hit that trillion-dollar level shouldn\u2019t be so tough achieve after a set of figures like that.</p> </blockquote> <p>Here is our report on the Apple numbers:</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/jul/31/apple-q3-results-1-billion-threshold\">Apple reports new sales record for third quarter as it eases toward $1tn mark</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Elsewhere it is another big day for company results, with Lloyds Banking Group reporting a 23% rise in pre-tax profit and Next defying the current retail blues with a 2.8% increase in second quarter full-price sales, helped by the warm weather boosting demand for summer outfits.</p> <p>We will also get the first snapshot of how the manufacturing sector has performed in July, with PMI figures from the UK, Europe and US.

                "bodyText":"A host of manufacturing surveys for July showed a disappointing outcome for the UK, while eurozone growth was also sluggish. Over in the US factory growth slipped in July, while a jobs report was better than expected although it came with a warning on the outlook. The latest UK housing market report from Nationwide showed a 2.5% annual rise in July ahead of an expected Bank of England interest rate rise on Thursday. Overall markets were subdued after reports of an escalation in the trade dispute between the US and China, with President Trump said to be considering raising the existing 10% tariff on $200bn of imports from China to 25%. And following its positive results on Tuesday, Apple shares opened up 4.4%, pushing the company\u2019s value close to a record $1tn. On that note it\u2019s time to close for the day. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. US factory growth dipped slightly in July, according to the latest manufacturing survey, partly due to falling exports and supply problems. The IHS Markit US manufacturing PMI came in at 55.3 last month, down from 55.4 and lower than the initial estimate of 55.5. Markit said: US manufacturing firms signalled a strong improvement in operating conditions in July, despite the headline PMI falling to a five-month low. Weaker rises in output and employment were seen in July, while export sales fell for the second month in a row. Meanwhile, companies reported the greatest deterioration in vendor performance since the series began and a faster rate of input cost inflation. That said, business confidence remained strongly positive, and was supported by hopes of further increases in overall new orders. Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit said: The US manufacturing sector continued to expand in July, but shows increasing signs of struggling against headwinds of supply shortages, rising prices and deteriorating exports. The latest survey showed output rising at a rate roughly equivalent to an annualised 1% pace of expansion, which is the weakest since late last year. While a weakening of new export orders for a second successive month suggested foreign demand has waned compared to earlier in the year, the slowdown can be also in part attributed to increased difficulties in sourcing sufficient quantities of inputs. Suppliers\u2019 delivery delays were more widespread than at any time in the survey\u2019s history. With producers often scrambling to buy enough raw materials, suppliers enjoyed greater pricing power. Not surprisingly, with tariffs also kicking in, cost pressures spiked higher again. Some relief for manufacturers came from strong domestic demand, which meant firms were increasingly able to pass higher costs on to customers. Average prices charged for goods consequently rose at the steepest rate for seven years, which is likely to feed through to higher consumer prices in coming months. Apple\u2019s rise has helped lift technology stocks on Wall Street, pushing the Nasdaq Composite 0.39% higher. The Dow Jones Industrial Average - which also includes Apple - is marginally higher, up 0.04% while the S&amp;P 500 has opened 0.17% higher. Following its forecast-beating results and upbeat outlook, Apple shares have jumped 4.4% to $198.4. at the start of the day\u2019s trading, helping support a US market rattled by renewed concerns about a damaging trade war between the US and China. The move means Apple is close to becoming the first company to be valued at $1tn. It would need to hit $203.25 to reach that level. Here\u2019s IG index on the expected opening for Wall Street: In pre-trading Apple shares are currently up around 4%, not quite enough so far to push it above a $1tn valuation. US private sector employers took on more workers than expected in July, according to a new report, partly due to this year\u2019s hefty tax cuts. Ahead of the non-farm payroll numbers on Friday, ADP\u2019s employment report showed a 219,000 increase in private sector jobs last month, compared to expectations of a 185,000 rise. Ahu Yildirmaz, co-head of the ADP Research Institute, said: The labour market is on a roll with no signs of a slowdown in sight. Nearly every industry posted strong gains and small business hiring picked up. But there could be storm clouds ahead given President Trump\u2019s tariff plans and trade disputes. Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody\u2019s Analytics which helped compile the report, said: The job market is booming, impacted by the deficit-financed tax cuts and increases in government spending. Tariffs have yet to materially impact jobs, but the multinational companies shed jobs last month, signalling the threat. It\u2019s not all good news for Apple despite its upbeat results and its approach towards a $1tn valuation. Samuel Gibbs reports: Huawei overtook Apple to become the world\u2019s second-largest smartphone seller behind Samsung in the second quarter, the first time in seven years that any contender has managed to split the top two. Multiple market analysts said that Huawei\u2019s rise came as the slowdown in China, the world\u2019s largest market for smartphones, eased, with growing market share in Europe. Huawei failed in its recent bid to launch in the US after government action against companies deemed a security threat. Despite Apple being historically weak in the second quarter, analysts described the rise of Huawei as significant. \u201cThe importance of Huawei overtaking Apple this quarter cannot be overstated,\u201d said Canalys analyst Ben Stanton. \u201cIt is the first time in seven years that Samsung and Apple have not held the top two positions.\u201d Our full report is here: The FTSE 100 has taken a turn for the worse in the course of the morning. Trade tensions are uppermost in investors\u2019 minds following reports that the US plans to raise the tariffs it plans of $200bn worth of imports from China from the original 10% to 25%. So commodity stocks are among the leading fallers on concerns that any slowdown in China\u2019s economy would hit the sector hard. Sharp falls in the likes of Next, Direct Line and Rio Tinto after their latest updates is also hitting the market, leaving the UK\u2019s leading index 1% or 77 points lower at 7671. So is this the day Apple\u2019s market value hits $1tn? All eyes will be on Wall Street\u2019s open to see how the better than expected results are received. Will investors push Apple higher or decide to take profits? Neil Wilson, chief market analyst at Markets.com, says: Apple shares leapt 4% in after-hours trade and are set to open at a record high just shy of the $200 level. Although it would be a bit of a stretch, a push up to the $1tn mark today is a possibility - it\u2019s only a matter of time before it achieves a valuation of $1tn. If it does, cue some big profit taking but it would be a moment to savour for Tim Cook. We need the share price to break $203 to hit $1tn in market cap \u2013 a little more than $5 above the after-hours level at $197-$198. Rather like the Dow at 25k, you kind of get the feeling investors will conspire to nudge it over the line. If you\u2019re in FAANGs now I don\u2019t see why you wouldn\u2019t rotate some equity out of more exposed companies like Facebook and Netflix and opt for relative safety in Apple, whose multiples remain well short of FAANG peers. What might weigh today is broader market fears about trade wars with China as the White House sets out fresh tariff plans on $200bn of Chinese goods. Tim Cook was pretty circumspect on trade and tariffs on the call. Results were very impressive with a beat on revenues and EPS. iPhone sales were a shade weaker than forecast but on a number of important fronts we saw excellent numbers. The FAANGs - Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix and Google-owner Alphabet - and the wider technology sector have been under pressure in recent days after poor results from Facebook and Twitter. But Apple\u2019s figures could give some badly needed support to the sector. The pound is not getting much help from the prospect of an interest rate rise on Thursday. Against the dollar it is down 0.05% at $1.3117, while against the euro is has edged up 0.05% to \u20ac1.1229. The survey is positive about exports but less so about domestic demand, says Helena Sans, head of manufacturing at Barclays: A disappointing result for the manufacturing sector in July with PMI at a three-month low, although still firmly in positive territory. Of more concern is the weakest business confidence score for 21 months, indicating that the industry is desperate for a degree of clarity and progress on the Brexit negotiations and a better understanding of what the final outcome will mean for manufacturers. It looks like a tale of two markets at the moment, with export growth accelerating but domestic demand struggling to keep pace. Aside from the encouraging news for exporters, the only other real bright spot was more job growth, with two full years of consecutive monthly employment increases no mean feat. Following the weaker than expected UK manufacturing report, things are unlikely to improve in the immediate future, says ING Bank economist James Smith. But the downbeat survey is unlikely to discourage the Bank of England from raising interest rates on Thursday, he says: At 54.0, the latest UK manufacturing PMI is the lowest in three months and is a far cry from the levels seen towards the end of 2017. Weaker domestic demand saw new orders fall and the rate of output growth slip to the lowest in 16 months. Interestingly though, demand from abroad hit a six-month high, implying that firms are still reaping the rewards of better global growth, despite the recent moderation in Europe. But over coming months, life for manufacturers is unlikely to get any easier. The recent escalation in trade tensions is clearly a challenge, but increasingly the biggest headache for businesses is likely to be the threat of a \u2018no deal\u2019 Brexit. This scenario would likely see huge congestion at ports and disruption to supply chains. While we suspect the probability of the UK leaving without an agreement in March next year is relatively low, an agreement may not come until late in the day. Until then, confidence could begin to fall as uncertainty increases \u2013 the latest PMI suggests the degree of positive sentiment is already at a 21-month low. Having said all of that, today\u2019s slip in the PMI is unlikely to faze Bank of England policymakers ahead of tomorrow\u2019s decision. Representing around 10% of output, manufacturing is a relatively small part of the UK growth mix. Importantly, the recent data flow \u2013 particularly in the much larger service sector \u2013 has largely backed up the Bank\u2019s view that the economy has regained poise after the weak first quarter. For that reason, we think the Bank of England will increase interest rates this week. But the key thing to watch is what the Bank has to say on its next steps. In an ideal world, we think policymakers would like to hike rates again much sooner than markets are currently pricing (towards the end of 2019). But with Brexit uncertainty considerably ramping up, realistically we think the Bank will struggle to raise rates again before the UK leaves the EU next March. After Thursday, we currently don\u2019t anticipate another hike before May 2019. The prospect of a trade war between the US and China is the biggest worry for UK manufacturers, says Dave Atkinson, UK head of manufacturing at Lloyds Bank Commercial Banking: The dip in the [PMI] reading comes after an eventful month politically. But if manufacturers are not completely ignoring the Brexit uncertainty, they are nevertheless ploughing on regardless. If anything, the biggest current worry for a sector with so many exporters is the prospect of an all-out trade war between the world\u2019s two largest economies. The fear is that UK manufacturers become collateral damage in any tit-for-tat tariffs that are imposed at a time when firms are benefiting from their exposure to the still relatively buoyant global economy. The automotive industry is facing a particularly anxious time grappling as it is with weaker consumer sentiment, ambivalence towards diesel engines and uncertainty about those future trade arrangements. This is a real worry given the number of jobs and exports supported by the sector. But by contrast, UK aerospace enjoyed a good July, boosted by the Farnborough Airshow. Bumper orders for the major aircraft manufacturers will help the small- and medium-sized businesses in their supply chains and the launch of the new Tempest fighter jet has the potential to safeguard thousands of highly-skilled jobs. The weaker than expected figures could give the Bank of England second thoughts if it really is planning to raise UK interest rates on Thursday, suggests IHS Markit director Rob Dobson: The financial markets still seem to have an interest rate increase nailed on for August. However, if the combination of weaker growth and a softening of pipeline cost pressures at manufacturers is mirrored in the larger service sector, the Bank of England\u2019s decision will be far from unanimous and they may even yet find some cause for pause. The figure of 54 for July\u2019s UK manufacturing PMI is a three month low, albeit that any number over 50 shows the sector is expanding. Markit said: The softer growth patch of the UK manufacturing sector continued at the start of the third quarter. July saw slower rates of expansion in both output and new orders, as weaker growth of new work from domestic sources offset a stronger increase in new export orders. Price pressures also remained elevated as a strong increase in average input costs led to the steepest rise in selling prices since February... July saw the degree of positive sentiment dip to a 21-month low, amid reports of uncertainty regarding both Brexit and the exchange rate. Duncan Brock, group director at the Chartered Institute of Procurement &amp; Supply which co-compiles the survey, said: There was a flatline feel to manufacturing this month, as the sector held its ground, but only just. Overall production slowed, whilst new order growth took a leisurely pace, and it was the unbalanced reliance on export orders that kept the sector afloat with domestic clients keeping their distance. This general manufacturing malaise was compounded by a scarcity of essential raw materials and vendor delivery times lengthened at a pace not seen for ten months as supply chains stuttered and stumbled to meet contractual obligations. On the price front, firms raised client prices again in a bid to prevent another sudden increase in their own costs from gnawing away at hard-won profits. But, this strategy may not offer long-term solutions as uncertainty remains enemy no.1. Should operating conditions remain unchanged, this damp squib of a performance may persist and the UK has to look to other sectors to inject some vitality into its economic performance. Britain\u2019s factories have performed slightly worse than forecast in July. IHS Markit/CIPS\u2019s UK manufacturing purchasing managers index came in at 54 last month, less than the 54.2 expected. This was lower than the June figure of 54.3, itself revised down from the initial estimate of 54.4. Here\u2019s Markit\u2019s country by country manufacturing PMIs for July: The overall eurozone manufacturing sector was subdued in July, according to IHS Markit, and there could be worse to come. The final purchasing managers index edged up from 54.9 in June to 55.1 as trade tensions and rising prices dented optimism. The final figure was unchanged from the initial estimate, and follows disappointing second quarter eurozone GDP figures released on Tuesday. Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit said: A marginal uptick in the PMI provides little cause for cheer given it is the second weakest number for more than one-and-a-half years. The past two months have seen the most subdued spell of factory output growth since late-2016. Worse may be to come. Even this reduced rate of output growth continued to outpace order book growth, resulting in the smallest rise in order book backlogs for two years. The clear implication is that manufacturers may have to adjust production down in coming months unless demand revives. Clues to the current soft patch lie in the export growth trend, which has deteriorated dramatically since the start of the year across all member states to reach a near-two year low, with France and Austria seeing exports fall into decline in July. The survey responses indicate that the slowdown likely reflects worries about trade wars, tariffs and rising prices, as well as general uncertainty about the economic outlook. Optimism about the future remained at one of the lowest levels seen over the past two years. Germany\u2019s manufacturing sector recovered from June\u2019s 18 month low last month, albeit more slowly than initial estimates. IHS Markit\u2019s purchasing managers index rose from 55.9 in June to 56.9, lower than the initial reading of 57.3. IHS Markit\u2019s economist Sian Jones said: The beginning of the second half of the year brought a faster rise in manufacturing growth among German manufacturers. Following a dip in overall performance in June, the upturn in output and new orders strengthened. That said, the increase in production continued to outpace that of new orders as firms expanded their efforts to clear backlogs. Although slightly weaker than June, employment growth continued to grow sharply, with greater production requirements a key factor behind sustained job creation. Panellists also reported stronger optimism towards future output growth, the most robust since April. Concerns were raised however, with some respondents noting uncertainty surrounding tariffs and further marked rises in input costs as risks to future growth. In turn, pressure on supply chains remained significant as firms continued to comment on bottlenecks at suppliers. France\u2019s factories did better in July than analysts had been expecting. IHS/Markit\u2019s manufacturing purchasing managers index climbed from 52.5 in June to 53.3, compared to an initial reading of 53.1. Output and new orders increased but exports fell back amid global trade tensions. IHS Markit economist Alex Gill said: July saw renewed growth momentum in the French manufacturing sector, with output and new orders rising at sharper rates, moving off their recent lows seen in June. Stronger client demand encouraged firms to take on additional staff, raise their purchasing activity and boosted hopes of further near-term growth. The only slight blip was a first fall in new export orders since September 2016, as global trade tensions hamper foreign demand. With trade tensions on the rise again, investors are in a cautious mood despite Apple\u2019s better than expected results. The FTSE 100 is down 0.44%, while Germany\u2019s Dax has edged up 0.21% and France\u2019s Cac has climbed 0.35%. Among the companies reporting, Lloyds Banking Group is leading the FTSE 100 risers, up 1.8% but Next is down nearly 6% despite a good second quarter as it expressed caution about the prospects for August sales. Among the mid-caps in the FTSE 250, BBA Aviation has slumped 15% after saying it expected \u201cmodest growth\u201d this year. Outsourcing group Capita is down 9.5% as it said its turnaround plan was on track after a collapse in profits but it would be a long road ahead. Commenting on the Nationwide house price index, Jonathan Hopper, managing director of Garrington Property Finders, said: Two steps forward, one step back \u2013 Nationwide\u2019s annual rate of price growth has barely shifted from where it was a year ago. It\u2019s tempting to see such a meandering market as the fruit of a cautious consensus. Instead it\u2019s a byproduct of the collision of three conflicting forces; pent-up demand, low supply and patchy confidence. With activity levels slowly picking up, the rising tension is creating some big regional anomalies \u2013 making the national average as misleading as it is insipid. The future course of the market is balanced on a knife edge. With the Bank of England set to notch up interest rates tomorrow, the prospect of more expensive mortgages should jolt some previously hesitant buyers into action. Yet any extra impetus is likely to be immediate but ephemeral. By contrast, the forces holding back the market will get steadily stronger if the UK sleepwalks into a no-deal Brexit. If the prospect of Britain crashing out of the EU continues its shift from long shot to likely, the top end of the market could slip into full retreat as investment buyers go into lockdown. For everyone else, softening prices and better affordability will create buying opportunities \u2013 particularly for the bold and strategic \u2013 in what will become an increasingly fractured market. Signs of strength in the UK housing market. The Press Association reports: Annual house price growth accelerated in July as the average property value hit a new record high of \u00a3217,010, according to an index. Across the UK, house prices were up by 2.5% annually in July, compared with a 2% annual increase in June, Nationwide Building Society said. House prices increased by 0.6% month on month in July - the second month of increases in a row following a 0.7% upturn in June. With speculation that the Bank of England base rate could edge up on Thursday from 0.5% to 0.75%, Nationwide said a 0.25 percentage point rise is likely to have only a modest immediate impact on borrowers, many of whom are locked into fixed-rate deals. Robert Gardner, Nationwide\u2019s chief economist, said: \u201cProviding the economy does not weaken further, the impact of a further small rise in interest rates on UK households is likely to be modest. \u201cThis is partly because only a relatively small proportion of borrowers will be directly impacted by the change. \u201cMost lending on personal loans and credit cards is fixed or tends to be unaffected by movements in the bank rate. Similarly, in recent years, the vast majority of new mortgages have been extended on fixed interest rates.\u201d But, he continued: \u201cWhile the impact for most borrowers is likely to be modest, it\u2019s important to note that household budgets have been under pressure for some time because wages have not been rising as fast as the cost of living. \u201cIndeed, in real terms (after adjusting for inflation) wage rates are still at levels prevailing in 2005.\u201d Mr Gardner said that, overall, Nationwide continues to expect house prices to increase by 1% over the course of 2018. Here are IG\u2019s opening calls for European markets: Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Will Apple become the first company in history to be valued at $1tn? The company reported better than expected results after the market closed on Tuesday, helped by strong sales of the higher-cost iPhone X profits jumped 32%, and its shares rose 4% in the after-market, putting it tantalisingly close to the magic $1tn figure. Jasper Lawler, head of research at London Capital Group, said: Traders breathed a sigh of relief as Apple reported strong earnings after the close, putting a spark back into the Nasdaq... What was there not to like about these numbers? This was the news that the markets had been hoping for; there had been concerns going into this release that the iPhone X numbers just weren\u2019t going to stack up, but that wasn\u2019t the case and Apple has managed to pull it out of the bag again, proving why it should be the first trillion-dollar company. The final 7% lift in the share price required to hit that trillion-dollar level shouldn\u2019t be so tough achieve after a set of figures like that. Here is our report on the Apple numbers: Elsewhere it is another big day for company results, with Lloyds Banking Group reporting a 23% rise in pre-tax profit and Next defying the current retail blues with a 2.8% increase in second quarter full-price sales, helped by the warm weather boosting demand for summer outfits. We will also get the first snapshot of how the manufacturing sector has performed in July, with PMI figures from the UK, Europe and US. China has already reported, with its manufacturing sector growing at the slowest pace in eight months, with exports declining amid trade tensions. The Caixin/Markit PMI fell from 51 in June to 50.8 last month. The UK numbers are also expected to see a slight dip, from 54.4 to 54.2. But any figure above 50 shows expansion, and the decline is unlikely to deter the Bank of England if it really wants to raise interest rates on Thursday. As for Europe, Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets, said: It\u2019s also set to be another important day for economic data especially in light of yesterday\u2019s disappointing EU Q2 GDP numbers which came in unexpectedly lower than anticipated. For most of this year we\u2019ve been told that the slowdown that we saw in Q1 was going to be temporary, and likely weather related. The weak Q2 French GDP numbers and yesterday\u2019s weaker than expected EU numbers would appear to give the lie to that perception, and more worryingly inflation appears to be showing signs of picking up. This is likely to be a concern for the European Central Bank especially if we see no evidence that Q3 is gearing to pick up the slack, with today\u2019s July manufacturing PMI\u2019s taking on a much greater importance in terms of looking for a rebound in economic activity after the weaker readings we\u2019ve seen so far this year. Early indications aren\u2019t particularly encouraging if last week\u2019s flash numbers from Germany and France are any guide though Germany did show some improvement, which should be confirmed at 57.3. France slowed to 53.1, while Spain and Italy are also expected to do the same, coming in at 53.1 and 53 respectively, both lower than their June readings. Much later the US Federal Reserve will announce its latest rate decision, although no change is expected this month, with an increase more likely in September. Markets remain edgy, especially with the latest reports suggesting an escalation in the current trade tensions. The US is said to be considering increasing its 10% tariffs on $200bn worth of Chinese imports to 25%.

Their shares have been soaring since the start of the year, despite being buffeted by trade war fears as President Trump talked of limiting Chinese investments in the US and restricting American technology imports to China.</p> <p>But now there are signs that cracks may be starting to appear in some of the biggest firms in the sector. Facebook suffered the biggest ever one-day drop in a company\u2019s market value \u2013 losing more than \u00a390bn \u2013 after its growth slowed in the wake of the Cambridge Analytica scandal.</p> <p>Twitter lost 20%, or $5bn, as it reported a surprise fall in active monthly users, while streaming service Netflix missed its targets for subscriber numbers.</p> <p>On the other hand, electric car specialist Tesla managed to head in the right direction despite making a $717m second-quarter loss, as its controversial chief executive, Elon Musk, regained investor confidence after apologising for previous outbursts.

The total value of the five companies amounts to a staggering 19% of total US GDP.

Facebook, shaken by Cambridge Analytica and the election interference scandal, decided to slash its profits in half in order to fund a response: 50,000 new moderators, a substantial investment into its trust and safety engineering, and a commitment to carry on doing the same for at least another year. Wall Street, predictably, hated it, but it was the right thing to do. A weaker leader could have been toppled for doing it, or might never have tried in the first place. Yes, Zuckerberg led the company into this swamp, but maybe he\u2019s right that he\u2019s the only one who can get it back out.</p> <p>However, there are storm clouds on the horizon as well. In the future, look out for the shift from \u201cfeeds\u201d to self-deleting \u201cstories\u201d, which could be as momentous as its shift from desktop to mobile. Facebook believes it won\u2019t be that long before the majority of content across its four platforms is shared as stories, the format it cloned from Snapchat two years ago, but it\u2019s struggling to achieve advertiser buy-in.</p> <h2>Alphabet</h2> <p>Google\u2019s parent company smashed Wall Street\u2019s profit expectations, sending its <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/jul/23/google-alphabet-profits-5bn-fine-shares-surge\">shares soaring to a record high</a>. Net profit was actually lower than last year \u2013 down from $4.9bn to $3.5bn \u2013 but that included a $2.7bn fine levied on Google by the European commission for anti-competitive behaviour. The company is set to appeal, so could still get its money back. The business raked in more than $26bn of revenue in the three-month period \u2013 well up on the $21bn recorded in the same period last year.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive element--supporting\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2018/08/archive-zip/giv-39023vu72D1VPfPJ/\" data-alt=\"Alphabet shares\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2018/08/archive-zip/giv-39023vu72D1VPfPJ/\">Alphabet shares</a> </figure>  <p><strong>Verdict </strong>Even though the general tech sell-off hit Google\u2019s parent company, and profits fell year-on-year, the future looks fairly bright for Alphabet.

                "bodyText":"It has been a tumultuous couple of weeks for America\u2019s high-flying technology stocks, even by their own unique standards. Their shares have been soaring since the start of the year, despite being buffeted by trade war fears as President Trump talked of limiting Chinese investments in the US and restricting American technology imports to China. But now there are signs that cracks may be starting to appear in some of the biggest firms in the sector. Facebook suffered the biggest ever one-day drop in a company\u2019s market value \u2013 losing more than \u00a390bn \u2013 after its growth slowed in the wake of the Cambridge Analytica scandal. Twitter lost 20%, or $5bn, as it reported a surprise fall in active monthly users, while streaming service Netflix missed its targets for subscriber numbers. On the other hand, electric car specialist Tesla managed to head in the right direction despite making a $717m second-quarter loss, as its controversial chief executive, Elon Musk, regained investor confidence after apologising for previous outbursts. That was in marked contrast to a conference call for the company\u2019s previous set of figures, when he accused a Wall Street analyst of \u201cboring bonehead questions\u201d and ignored queries from investors. But the pick of the bunch remains Apple, which beat Amazon and Google to reach the landmark $1 trillion valuation on Thursday. Despite the recent rollercoaster ride, the five key tech stocks, known as the \u201cFaangs\u201d \u2013 Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix, and Alphabet-owned Google \u2013 have reached breathtaking heights. The total value of the five companies amounts to a staggering 19% of total US GDP. But their surge in value has prompted fears of a re-run of the dotcom boom of the late 1990s, when technology businesses dominated the stock market before coming crashing to earth. Russ Mould at investment group AJ Bell says: \u201cThat [19%] compares to the 15.5% of US GDP reached by the five biggest companies by value at the US stock market\u2019s peak in the fourth quarter of 1999, just before the technology, media and telecoms bubble burst and that particular mania came to grief.\u201d Here we look at where the big names stand \u2013 and where they could go from here. Facebook The social network\u2019s stock market value plunged by more than \u00a390bn \u2013 the largest one-day drop in corporate history \u2013 as it felt the effect of the Cambridge Analytica data scandal. The group made more than $5bn (\u00a33.8bn) profit in the last three months \u2013 slightly ahead of expectations \u2013 but some 3 million Europeans quit the website amid concerns about what Facebook does with personal data. Finance chief David Wehner warned revenue growth was likely to slow, while costs soared by 50% to $7.4bn as the company spent vast sums on improving data security. Verdict For all the bluster around the largest one-day fall in history, the reasons behind it make the case for a founder-leader with absolute control better than anything else Mark Zuckerberg has done in the past decade. Facebook, shaken by Cambridge Analytica and the election interference scandal, decided to slash its profits in half in order to fund a response: 50,000 new moderators, a substantial investment into its trust and safety engineering, and a commitment to carry on doing the same for at least another year. Wall Street, predictably, hated it, but it was the right thing to do. A weaker leader could have been toppled for doing it, or might never have tried in the first place. Yes, Zuckerberg led the company into this swamp, but maybe he\u2019s right that he\u2019s the only one who can get it back out. However, there are storm clouds on the horizon as well. In the future, look out for the shift from \u201cfeeds\u201d to self-deleting \u201cstories\u201d, which could be as momentous as its shift from desktop to mobile. Facebook believes it won\u2019t be that long before the majority of content across its four platforms is shared as stories, the format it cloned from Snapchat two years ago, but it\u2019s struggling to achieve advertiser buy-in. Alphabet Google\u2019s parent company smashed Wall Street\u2019s profit expectations, sending its shares soaring to a record high. Net profit was actually lower than last year \u2013 down from $4.9bn to $3.5bn \u2013 but that included a $2.7bn fine levied on Google by the European commission for anti-competitive behaviour. The company is set to appeal, so could still get its money back. The business raked in more than $26bn of revenue in the three-month period \u2013 well up on the $21bn recorded in the same period last year. Verdict Even though the general tech sell-off hit Google\u2019s parent company, and profits fell year-on-year, the future looks fairly bright for Alphabet. Yes, the EU\u2019s fine over Google\u2019s Android monopoly isn\u2019t good for the company, and it was large enough to hit profits directly \u2013 if it weren\u2019t for the $2.7bn penalty, Alphabet would have actually seen profits grow this quarter \u2013 but the most significant wrongs that Google was accused of are largely in the past, and it is unlikely to feel too constrained going forward. Meanwhile, the search business prints money. Almost every open-ended query on the web starts at Google, and that makes its advertising revenues enormous and secure. YouTube could be a shining gem \u2013 and certainly seems to be if you speak to anyone under 20, for whom it, not Netflix, is the new TV \u2013 but it will have problems down the line over the same dodgy content now causing such pain for Facebook. Amazon The globe-spanning online retailer announced record quarterly profits of $2.5bn \u2013 double the level Wall Street experts had expected \u2013 sending the share price to an all-time high. Advertising and cloud computing were the big growth areas. Verdict Remember when it just sold books? Well, Amazon is the AWS (Amazon Web Services) company now. The record profits of the cloud-computing division led to an astonishing 1,286% year-on-year growth in overall profits, thanks to the extremely high margins that Amazon makes on selling computing time. It now stretches from its own consumer retail business to the Marketplace platform \u2013 where it\u2019s building a shopping mall of internet stores \u2013 to AWS, which provides the backbone to the internet. And don\u2019t forget its bets on the future, particularly with Echo and Alexa. Voice control may yet prove to be a dead-end in the annals of computing, but if not, Amazon could well own the iPhone of the 2020s. Apple Apple made history on Thursday, becoming the first public company to be valued at $1 trillion, reaching the landmark 42 years after the company was founded and two decades after it almost went bust. Financial results for the most recent three months, filed earlier in the week, showed revenues topped $53bn. The company shipped more than 41m phones \u2013 slightly less than anticipated \u2013 but because the expensive iPhone X has proved popular, the average price consumers paid for them went up. Verdict Making nice things and selling them for a lot of money to tens of millions of people is a very good business to be in. The engine of Apple\u2019s business, the iPhone, generated 60% of the company\u2019s profits, and it shows no sign of letting up. The iPhone X has been a resounding success, proving the hypothesis that millions of people will pay whatever Apple asks for the best phone on the planet. The average selling price of an iPhone is now more than $700. More promisingly still, that has held up in the second quarter, usually the time when sales fall off as savvy customers hold on for the inevitable upgrade in September. But while the iPhone provides the reliable profit, it\u2019s not the growth opportunity.

But whether he\u2019s a responsible boss or an unpredictable tech genius, Musk still has an uphill struggle on his hands, turning Tesla from a niche maker of expensive cars for the Silicon Valley set into a mass-market manufacturer of electric cars that can compete on equal terms with the likes of BMW and Nissan. Tesla is finally producing its self-imposed quota of 5,000 of its mass-market Model 3s a week, but to do so it\u2019s had to shift production to an external \u201ctent\u201d, and take a record $700m loss for the quarter.

The latest milestone comes as the US economy goes through its second longest-ever unbroken expansion, helped by low interest rates set by the Federal Reserve and sluggish inflation. Stock markets have also benefited since the crisis from the world\u2019s biggest central banks pumping billions into their economies through quantitative easing. The rise of the tech firms has boosted the overall value of the US stock market. The five so-called Faangs \u2013 Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix and Google \u2013 are together worth more than $3tn (\u00a32.3tn), a sum that makes them more valuable than the entire FTSE 100. Donald Trump\u2019s corporate tax cuts have boosted US corporate profits, helping to drive the stock market higher. The president celebrated stocks reaching record levels earlier this year, tweeting: \u201cDow just crashes through 25,000. Congrats! Big cuts in unnecessary regulations continuing.\u201d The bull market run has, however, included sharp corrections \u2013 when shares fall by at least 10% \u2013 although it maintained its status because the declines did not exceed 20%. Little more than a month after the US president\u2019s tweet, the Dow Jones Industrial Average plunged by more than 1,000 points amid fears over rising inflation that could have prompted the Fed to raise interest rates faster than expected. Concerns over a global trade war instigated by Washington have also rocked markets in recent months and could still pose a threat. Analysts said US stocks could continue rising over the course of this year, although warned against placing faith in arbitrary definitions of strength, such as markets having risen for a period or reaching certain levels.",

                "body":"<p><a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-45285585\">Impeach me and the stock market gets it.</a> There were unmistakable echoes of a mob boss in a gangster movie when Donald Trump insisted that any such action against him would bring an abrupt end to what is now the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/aug/22/wall-street-record-longest-rally-history-bull-market\">longest bull market in history</a>.</p> <p>It is a sign of a backs-to-the-wall mentality at the White House that Trump felt the need to lash out in this way. Presidents usually go out of their way to avoid saying anything that might give Wall Street cause for concern. Not this one. The market would crash, Trump said. Everyone would be very poor.</p> <p>The warning shows just how crucial Trump thinks a rising stock market is to his political appeal. You might not like me much, he is suggesting, but look what\u2019s happened to your share portfolio since my election in November 2016.</p> <p>What\u2019s more, Trump is partly right. There is no doubt that a bitter impeachment battle \u2013 especially since it inevitably would be long drawn out \u2013 would rattle Wall Street. Financial markets hate uncertainty.</p> <p>It is also the case that Trump\u2019s agenda has helped to push up share prices. He has cut taxes on American corporations, which has boosted profits. He has also slashed regulation. Both are positive for markets. Trump campaigned as a man who would deliver for the little guy: he has governed in the interests of big business.</p> <p>But all bull markets come to an end sooner or later, and there are already signs that the second 18 months of Trump\u2019s presidency will be a choppier time for Wall Street than the first, impeachment or no impeachment. And if, as some believe, 2019 is a dire year for the stock market, Trump himself will have only himself to blame.</p> <p>First, his tax cuts were ill-timed. They have pumped up demand late in the business cycle, raising concerns at the Federal Reserve, America\u2019s central bank, that the economy is in danger of overheating. Trump\u2019s crude attempts to pressurise the Fed into slowing the pace of interest rate increases will not work. The next increase in borrowing costs will happen next month, and eventually tighter borrowing costs will slow the economy, affecting corporate earnings.</p> <p>The fact that the Fed has moved further and faster to normalise monetary policy has also led to a stronger dollar, and that affects the earnings that US companies make on their sales overseas. Trump seems to be setting up Jerome Powell, the chairman of the Fed, to be the fall guy if there is a market correction.</p> <p>Secondly, there is Trump\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/aug/23/us-china-escalate-trade-war-total-sum-levied-reaches-100bn\">aggressive trade agenda,</a> which is starting to affect the US economy in a number of ways. At the most basic level, tariffs push up the cost of imports, which add to business costs and so eat into corporate profit margins.</p> <p>Tariffs also hurt other countries, and the reduction in global growth has a knock-on effect on US exports. The companies in the S&amp;P 500 make 40% of their earnings outside America.</p> <p>Then there\u2019s the impact on business confidence. The psychological effects of protectionism were limited while US companies believed Trump\u2019s belligerence was all an act. But as the rhetoric has hardened and sabre-rattling has threatened to turn into a full-scale trade war, businesses have become more and more alarmed. The risk is that Trump may use trade as a diversionary tactic in order to deflect attention from the investigations into his dealings.</p> <p>Wall Street could continue to rise for a while. But by the start of next year the boost from tax cuts will be fading, interest rate increases will be starting to bite, the global economy will be slowing as a result of protectionism, and the midterm elections could result in a Congress much more hostile to Trump. The message to investors is clear: a big market correction is lurking out there. And it is not all that far away.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d9ed021437b74459e9fa716c0999f49d88392fcb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d9ed021437b74459e9fa716c0999f49d88392fcb/0_0_4108_2464/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Oil Rigs in the Cromarty Firth awaiting decommissioning.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Oil Rigs in the Cromarty Firth awaiting decommissioning.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jeff J Mitchell/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Oil and gas can\u2019t fuel Scottish independence</h2> <p>Higher oil prices have helped Scotland cut its deficit, giving Nicola Sturgeon, the country\u2019s first minister, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/aug/22/scotland-cuts-its-deficit-but-is-still-outspending-the-uk\">something to cheer last week</a>.</p> <p>The question of how much oil and gas revenues could power an independent Scotland <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/aug/21/questions-value-scotland-north-sea-oil-highlighted\">was debated during the referendum campaign four years ago</a>.

                "bodyText":"Impeach me and the stock market gets it. There were unmistakable echoes of a mob boss in a gangster movie when Donald Trump insisted that any such action against him would bring an abrupt end to what is now the longest bull market in history. It is a sign of a backs-to-the-wall mentality at the White House that Trump felt the need to lash out in this way. Presidents usually go out of their way to avoid saying anything that might give Wall Street cause for concern. Not this one. The market would crash, Trump said. Everyone would be very poor. The warning shows just how crucial Trump thinks a rising stock market is to his political appeal. You might not like me much, he is suggesting, but look what\u2019s happened to your share portfolio since my election in November 2016. What\u2019s more, Trump is partly right. There is no doubt that a bitter impeachment battle \u2013 especially since it inevitably would be long drawn out \u2013 would rattle Wall Street. Financial markets hate uncertainty. It is also the case that Trump\u2019s agenda has helped to push up share prices. He has cut taxes on American corporations, which has boosted profits. He has also slashed regulation. Both are positive for markets. Trump campaigned as a man who would deliver for the little guy: he has governed in the interests of big business. But all bull markets come to an end sooner or later, and there are already signs that the second 18 months of Trump\u2019s presidency will be a choppier time for Wall Street than the first, impeachment or no impeachment. And if, as some believe, 2019 is a dire year for the stock market, Trump himself will have only himself to blame. First, his tax cuts were ill-timed. They have pumped up demand late in the business cycle, raising concerns at the Federal Reserve, America\u2019s central bank, that the economy is in danger of overheating. Trump\u2019s crude attempts to pressurise the Fed into slowing the pace of interest rate increases will not work. The next increase in borrowing costs will happen next month, and eventually tighter borrowing costs will slow the economy, affecting corporate earnings. The fact that the Fed has moved further and faster to normalise monetary policy has also led to a stronger dollar, and that affects the earnings that US companies make on their sales overseas. Trump seems to be setting up Jerome Powell, the chairman of the Fed, to be the fall guy if there is a market correction. Secondly, there is Trump\u2019s aggressive trade agenda, which is starting to affect the US economy in a number of ways. At the most basic level, tariffs push up the cost of imports, which add to business costs and so eat into corporate profit margins. Tariffs also hurt other countries, and the reduction in global growth has a knock-on effect on US exports. The companies in the S&amp;P 500 make 40% of their earnings outside America. Then there\u2019s the impact on business confidence. The psychological effects of protectionism were limited while US companies believed Trump\u2019s belligerence was all an act. But as the rhetoric has hardened and sabre-rattling has threatened to turn into a full-scale trade war, businesses have become more and more alarmed. The risk is that Trump may use trade as a diversionary tactic in order to deflect attention from the investigations into his dealings. Wall Street could continue to rise for a while. But by the start of next year the boost from tax cuts will be fading, interest rate increases will be starting to bite, the global economy will be slowing as a result of protectionism, and the midterm elections could result in a Congress much more hostile to Trump. The message to investors is clear: a big market correction is lurking out there. And it is not all that far away. Oil and gas can\u2019t fuel Scottish independence Higher oil prices have helped Scotland cut its deficit, giving Nicola Sturgeon, the country\u2019s first minister, something to cheer last week. The question of how much oil and gas revenues could power an independent Scotland was debated during the referendum campaign four years ago. On the face of it, the latest deficit numbers and North Sea\u2019s mini-revival of four years of production growth, have strengthened the hand of Scottish nationalists. The region\u2019s firms have leaner operating costs after the oil price slump, smaller independent players are buying up fields to eke out the last hydrocarbons and crude prices are up. But to focus on the short-term would be to miss the bigger picture. The North Sea\u2019s renaissance is coming to an end, with production expected to resume its trajectory of long-term decline next year. Oil and gas output is projected to fall nearly a fifth in five years, to 1.38 million barrels of oil equivalent a day. After 2023, production is expected to decline 5% a year. Those are the projections of a boosterish regulator, not Greenpeace. The reality could be worse. Declining production is not the only issue. Oil prices might look bullish due to the geopolitics of today, but there are bearish elements too \u2013 Opec is pumping more and the US will eventually clear bottlenecks in shale regions. Crude prices are impossible to predict. Then there is the cost of cleaning up old rigs, a burden that falls on taxpayers to a certain extent because of tax relief. The government could also increase its tax take from the sector, a prospect that prompted apocalyptic warnings from the industry regulator. There are many strong arguments for why an independent Scotland could succeed. North Sea oil and gas revenues are unlikely to among them. Even 007 has to work hard to keep Hollywood happy In Hollywood, creative risk is always balanced against the necessity of a decent box office return. Even a character as cavalier as James Bond would appreciate that. And that no doubt was one of the factors behind Danny Boyle\u2019s decision to quit as director of the 25th 007 film, although the producers cited \u201ccreative differences\u201d. The James Bond franchise is a dependable hit machine for Hollywood in an era when, thanks to the rise of Netflix and YouTube, just foisting a big film and a large marketing budget on the public is no guarantee of ticket sales. But figures for the last entry in the Bond series, Spectre, show that 007 has to work very hard to generate a decent return on a big-budget investment. Spectre cost $245m (\u00a3190m) and made $880m at the global box office.
