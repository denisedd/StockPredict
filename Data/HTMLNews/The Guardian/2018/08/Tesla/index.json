The total value of the five companies amounts to a staggering 19% of total US GDP.

Facebook, shaken by Cambridge Analytica and the election interference scandal, decided to slash its profits in half in order to fund a response: 50,000 new moderators, a substantial investment into its trust and safety engineering, and a commitment to carry on doing the same for at least another year. Wall Street, predictably, hated it, but it was the right thing to do. A weaker leader could have been toppled for doing it, or might never have tried in the first place. Yes, Zuckerberg led the company into this swamp, but maybe he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s right that he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the only one who can get it back out.</p> <p>However, there are storm clouds on the horizon as well. In the future, look out for the shift from \u00e2\u20ac\u0153feeds\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to self-deleting \u00e2\u20ac\u0153stories\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, which could be as momentous as its shift from desktop to mobile. Facebook believes it won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be that long before the majority of content across its four platforms is shared as stories, the format it cloned from Snapchat two years ago, but it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s struggling to achieve advertiser buy-in.</p> <h2>Alphabet</h2> <p>Google\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s parent company smashed Wall Street\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s profit expectations, sending its <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/jul/23/google-alphabet-profits-5bn-fine-shares-surge\">shares soaring to a record high</a>. Net profit was actually lower than last year \u00e2\u20ac\u201c down from $4.9bn to $3.5bn \u00e2\u20ac\u201c but that included a $2.7bn fine levied on Google by the European commission for anti-competitive behaviour. The company is set to appeal, so could still get its money back. The business raked in more than $26bn of revenue in the three-month period \u00e2\u20ac\u201c well up on the $21bn recorded in the same period last year.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive element--supporting\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2018/08/archive-zip/giv-39023vu72D1VPfPJ/\" data-alt=\"Alphabet shares\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2018/08/archive-zip/giv-39023vu72D1VPfPJ/\">Alphabet shares</a> </figure>  <p><strong>Verdict </strong>Even though the general tech sell-off hit Google\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s parent company, and profits fell year-on-year, the future looks fairly bright for Alphabet. Yes, the EU\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fine over Google\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Android monopoly isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t good for the company, and it was large enough to hit profits directly \u00e2\u20ac\u201c if it weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t for the $2.7bn penalty, Alphabet would have actually seen profits grow this quarter \u00e2\u20ac\u201c but the most significant wrongs that Google was accused of are largely in the past, and it is unlikely to feel too constrained going forward.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the search business prints money. Almost every open-ended query on the web starts at Google, and that makes its advertising revenues enormous and secure. YouTube could be a shining gem \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and certainly seems to be if you speak to anyone under 20, for whom it, not Netflix, is the new TV \u00e2\u20ac\u201c but it will have problems down the line over the same dodgy content now causing such pain for Facebook.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"931af6ffd10fe477756d17cf40862818ea649179\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/931af6ffd10fe477756d17cf40862818ea649179/0_141_4644_2787/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Amazon Web Services inflatable display at a trade fair\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Amazon\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s cloud computing division has seen extraordinary growth in profits.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mauritz Antin/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Amazon</h2> <p>The globe-spanning online retailer announced <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/jul/26/amazon-profit-second-quarter-2018-advertising-cloud\">record quarterly profits of $2.5bn</a> \u00e2\u20ac\u201c double the level Wall Street experts had expected \u00e2\u20ac\u201c sending the share price to an all-time high.

Well, Amazon is the AWS (Amazon Web Services) company now. The record profits of the cloud-computing division led to an astonishing 1,286% year-on-year growth in overall profits, thanks to the extremely high margins that Amazon makes on selling computing time. It now stretches from its own consumer retail business to the Marketplace platform \u00e2\u20ac\u201c where it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s building a shopping mall of internet stores \u00e2\u20ac\u201c to AWS, which provides the backbone to the internet. And don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t forget its bets on the future, particularly with Echo and Alexa. Voice control may yet prove to be a dead-end in the annals of computing, but if not, Amazon could well own the iPhone of the 2020s.</p> <h2>Apple</h2> <p>Apple made history on Thursday, becoming the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/aug/02/apple-becomes-worlds-first-trillion-dollar-company\">first public company to be valued at $1 trillion</a>, reaching the landmark 42 years after the company was founded and two decades after it almost went bust. Financial results for the most recent three months, filed earlier in the week, showed revenues topped $53bn. The company shipped more than 41m phones \u00e2\u20ac\u201c slightly less than anticipated \u00e2\u20ac\u201c but because the expensive iPhone X has proved popular, the average price consumers paid for them went up.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive element--supporting\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2018/08/archive-zip/giv-3902KmLt1o6pmxWJ/\" data-alt=\"Apple shares\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2018/08/archive-zip/giv-3902KmLt1o6pmxWJ/\">Apple shares</a> </figure>  <p><strong>Verdict</strong> Making nice things and selling them for a lot of money to tens of millions of people is a very good business to be in. The engine of Apple\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s business, the iPhone, generated 60% of the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s profits, and it shows no sign of letting up.</p> <p>The iPhone X has been a resounding success, proving the hypothesis that millions of people will pay whatever Apple asks for the best phone on the planet. The average selling price of an iPhone is now more than $700. More promisingly still, that has held up in the second quarter, usually the time when sales fall off as savvy customers hold on for the inevitable upgrade in September.</p> <p>But while the iPhone provides the reliable profit, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not the growth opportunity. That lies in the two lines at the bottom of the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s report: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153services\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and \u00e2\u20ac\u0153other products\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Services \u00e2\u20ac\u201c which include the App Store, Apple Pay and income from Apple Music \u00e2\u20ac\u201c have been growing rapidly since the company stopped viewing them just as a tool for boosting phone sales and started seeing them as a business. Apple invented the idea of the App Store and is taking a 30% cut on everything in it.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"32d8f9963390ea58bbfb94ee79ad4680315df206\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/32d8f9963390ea58bbfb94ee79ad4680315df206/0_46_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Elon Musk\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Elon Musk\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s recent outbursts have worried investors.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Gene Blevins/ZUMA Wire/REX/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Tesla</h2> <p>Tesla has had a difficult few months, with increasing concerns about the firm\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s financial sustainability and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/jul/18/elon-musk-apologises-for-calling-thai-cave-rescue-diver-a-pedo\">outbursts from its billionaire founder Elon Musk</a> that have seen him labelled the Trump of Tech. On Wednesday the electric-car maker reported a record $717m loss for the last three months, but the shares climbed<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/aug/01/tesla-latest-losses-revenue-elon-musk-report-q2\"> because revenue hit $4bn and Musk promised profitability later this year</a>.

But whether he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a responsible boss or an unpredictable tech genius, Musk still has an uphill struggle on his hands, turning Tesla from a niche maker of expensive cars for the Silicon Valley set into a mass-market manufacturer of electric cars that can compete on equal terms with the likes of BMW and Nissan.</p> <p>Tesla is finally producing its self-imposed quota of 5,000 of its mass-market Model 3s a week, but to do so it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s had to shift production to an external \u00e2\u20ac\u0153tent\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, and take a record $700m loss for the quarter. And simply matching its legacy competitors on one mass-market vehicle isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t enough \u00e2\u20ac\u201c to justify its sky-high valuation (Tesla\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock-market value is roughly the same as BMW\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s), it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll have to deliver on at least one of its moonshots: self-driving cars, a radically redesigned charging infrastructure, or the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s first commercially feasible electric truck.</p> <h2>Twitter</h2> <p>Twitter lost more than a fifth of its value in two days, despite reporting a record profit, because investors were worried about hugely disappointing forecasts for user numbers. It <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/jul/27/twitter-share-price-tumbles-after-it-loses-1m-users-in-three-months\">lost 1 million users in the last three months</a> and predicted a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153mid-single-digit millions\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd decline in the next three-month period. The social media service reported net income of $100m during the second quarter, but tech companies need to show they can deliver uninterrupted growth to impress Wall Street.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive element--supporting\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2018/08/archive-zip/giv-39024qv2eKcTU0Ob/\" data-alt=\"Twitter shares\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2018/08/archive-zip/giv-39024qv2eKcTU0Ob/\">Twitter shares</a> </figure>  <p><strong><br></strong></p> <p><strong>Verdict </strong>In 2016, Twitter moved its app from the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153social networking\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd section of the App Store to the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153news\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd section. At the time, it was seen as a capitulation to Facebook, but now it looks like a piece of genuine insight into what the company could offer to users and how the service differs from its competition. Like all news services, when there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a lot of news, the company booms, and there is certainly a lot of news right now. That has fed into a good performance over the last year.</p> <p>The last quarter is a different story, of course. Twitter still has to tackle the same trust and safety issues as Facebook and Google, with a fraction of the money and engineering talent. And, as with Facebook, Wall Street just doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to play ball: Twitter deletes millions of fake accounts, and investors punish it with a 20% plunge in stock price.

These days, its focus is on original serialised programming, which changes the way to think about its content costs: they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re no longer a recurring expense eating into the margin, but a long-term investment. And, as analyst Ben Thompson notes, the spending in effect works towards customer acquisition: the more content on Netflix, the more reason there is to join the site. Which is why, when subscriber growth slows, the whole thing looks unstable. The smallest of the Faangs hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t achieved the escape velocity of its peers, and a dip could always turn into a death dive.</p> <h2>Spotify</h2> <p>In only its second financial report since flotation, the music streaming service reported an 8 million <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/jul/26/spotify-beats-expectations-by-reaching-83m-subscribers\">rise in the number of paid subscribers, to 83 million</a> during the second quarter. Spotify has yet to record a profit, but the increase suggests it is still staving off competition from deep-pocketed rivals such as Amazon and Apple for music streaming customers. Its operating loss widened from \u00e2\u201a\u00ac79m to \u00e2\u201a\u00ac90m (\u00c2\u00a380m).</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive element--supporting\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2018/08/archive-zip/giv-3902fmh9G6SjEUQt/\" data-alt=\"Spotify shares\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2018/08/archive-zip/giv-3902fmh9G6SjEUQt/\">Spotify shares</a> </figure>  <p><strong>Verdict </strong>The music streaming market still has room to grow, as the stubborn markets for digital downloads and CDs demonstrate. But everyone knows it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s eventually going to be a winner-takes-all battle. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s because, unlike video, there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s little reason to have subscriptions to multiple streaming services, and strong economies of scale. So Spotify\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock price is essentially a representation of one simple question: will it win, or will Apple Music? In Spotify\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s favour is its large and growing free service, which brings in substantial ad revenue and is a crucial pipeline for new users \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and the Android market, where it lacks a strong competitor. Working against it: a competitor with much deeper pockets.</p>",
                "bodyText":"It has been a tumultuous couple of weeks for America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s high-flying technology stocks, even by their own unique standards. Their shares have been soaring since the start of the year, despite being buffeted by trade war fears as President Trump talked of limiting Chinese investments in the US and restricting American technology imports to China. But now there are signs that cracks may be starting to appear in some of the biggest firms in the sector. Facebook suffered the biggest ever one-day drop in a company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s market value \u00e2\u20ac\u201c losing more than \u00c2\u00a390bn \u00e2\u20ac\u201c after its growth slowed in the wake of the Cambridge Analytica scandal. Twitter lost 20%, or $5bn, as it reported a surprise fall in active monthly users, while streaming service Netflix missed its targets for subscriber numbers. On the other hand, electric car specialist Tesla managed to head in the right direction despite making a $717m second-quarter loss, as its controversial chief executive, Elon Musk, regained investor confidence after apologising for previous outbursts. That was in marked contrast to a conference call for the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s previous set of figures, when he accused a Wall Street analyst of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153boring bonehead questions\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and ignored queries from investors. But the pick of the bunch remains Apple, which beat Amazon and Google to reach the landmark $1 trillion valuation on Thursday. Despite the recent rollercoaster ride, the five key tech stocks, known as the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Faangs\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix, and Alphabet-owned Google \u00e2\u20ac\u201c have reached breathtaking heights. The total value of the five companies amounts to a staggering 19% of total US GDP. But their surge in value has prompted fears of a re-run of the dotcom boom of the late 1990s, when technology businesses dominated the stock market before coming crashing to earth. Russ Mould at investment group AJ Bell says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153That [19%] compares to the 15.5% of US GDP reached by the five biggest companies by value at the US stock market\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s peak in the fourth quarter of 1999, just before the technology, media and telecoms bubble burst and that particular mania came to grief.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Here we look at where the big names stand \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and where they could go from here. Facebook The social network\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock market value plunged by more than \u00c2\u00a390bn \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the largest one-day drop in corporate history \u00e2\u20ac\u201c as it felt the effect of the Cambridge Analytica data scandal. The group made more than $5bn (\u00c2\u00a33.8bn) profit in the last three months \u00e2\u20ac\u201c slightly ahead of expectations \u00e2\u20ac\u201c but some 3 million Europeans quit the website amid concerns about what Facebook does with personal data. Finance chief David Wehner warned revenue growth was likely to slow, while costs soared by 50% to $7.4bn as the company spent vast sums on improving data security. Verdict For all the bluster around the largest one-day fall in history, the reasons behind it make the case for a founder-leader with absolute control better than anything else Mark Zuckerberg has done in the past decade. Facebook, shaken by Cambridge Analytica and the election interference scandal, decided to slash its profits in half in order to fund a response: 50,000 new moderators, a substantial investment into its trust and safety engineering, and a commitment to carry on doing the same for at least another year. Wall Street, predictably, hated it, but it was the right thing to do. A weaker leader could have been toppled for doing it, or might never have tried in the first place. Yes, Zuckerberg led the company into this swamp, but maybe he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s right that he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the only one who can get it back out. However, there are storm clouds on the horizon as well. In the future, look out for the shift from \u00e2\u20ac\u0153feeds\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to self-deleting \u00e2\u20ac\u0153stories\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, which could be as momentous as its shift from desktop to mobile. Facebook believes it won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be that long before the majority of content across its four platforms is shared as stories, the format it cloned from Snapchat two years ago, but it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s struggling to achieve advertiser buy-in. Alphabet Google\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s parent company smashed Wall Street\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s profit expectations, sending its shares soaring to a record high. Net profit was actually lower than last year \u00e2\u20ac\u201c down from $4.9bn to $3.5bn \u00e2\u20ac\u201c but that included a $2.7bn fine levied on Google by the European commission for anti-competitive behaviour. The company is set to appeal, so could still get its money back. The business raked in more than $26bn of revenue in the three-month period \u00e2\u20ac\u201c well up on the $21bn recorded in the same period last year. Verdict Even though the general tech sell-off hit Google\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s parent company, and profits fell year-on-year, the future looks fairly bright for Alphabet. Yes, the EU\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fine over Google\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Android monopoly isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t good for the company, and it was large enough to hit profits directly \u00e2\u20ac\u201c if it weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t for the $2.7bn penalty, Alphabet would have actually seen profits grow this quarter \u00e2\u20ac\u201c but the most significant wrongs that Google was accused of are largely in the past, and it is unlikely to feel too constrained going forward. Meanwhile, the search business prints money. Almost every open-ended query on the web starts at Google, and that makes its advertising revenues enormous and secure. YouTube could be a shining gem \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and certainly seems to be if you speak to anyone under 20, for whom it, not Netflix, is the new TV \u00e2\u20ac\u201c but it will have problems down the line over the same dodgy content now causing such pain for Facebook. Amazon The globe-spanning online retailer announced record quarterly profits of $2.5bn \u00e2\u20ac\u201c double the level Wall Street experts had expected \u00e2\u20ac\u201c sending the share price to an all-time high. Advertising and cloud computing were the big growth areas. Verdict Remember when it just sold books? Well, Amazon is the AWS (Amazon Web Services) company now. The record profits of the cloud-computing division led to an astonishing 1,286% year-on-year growth in overall profits, thanks to the extremely high margins that Amazon makes on selling computing time. It now stretches from its own consumer retail business to the Marketplace platform \u00e2\u20ac\u201c where it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s building a shopping mall of internet stores \u00e2\u20ac\u201c to AWS, which provides the backbone to the internet. And don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t forget its bets on the future, particularly with Echo and Alexa. Voice control may yet prove to be a dead-end in the annals of computing, but if not, Amazon could well own the iPhone of the 2020s. Apple Apple made history on Thursday, becoming the first public company to be valued at $1 trillion, reaching the landmark 42 years after the company was founded and two decades after it almost went bust. Financial results for the most recent three months, filed earlier in the week, showed revenues topped $53bn. The company shipped more than 41m phones \u00e2\u20ac\u201c slightly less than anticipated \u00e2\u20ac\u201c but because the expensive iPhone X has proved popular, the average price consumers paid for them went up. Verdict Making nice things and selling them for a lot of money to tens of millions of people is a very good business to be in. The engine of Apple\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s business, the iPhone, generated 60% of the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s profits, and it shows no sign of letting up. The iPhone X has been a resounding success, proving the hypothesis that millions of people will pay whatever Apple asks for the best phone on the planet. The average selling price of an iPhone is now more than $700. More promisingly still, that has held up in the second quarter, usually the time when sales fall off as savvy customers hold on for the inevitable upgrade in September. But while the iPhone provides the reliable profit, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not the growth opportunity. That lies in the two lines at the bottom of the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s report: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153services\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and \u00e2\u20ac\u0153other products\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Services \u00e2\u20ac\u201c which include the App Store, Apple Pay and income from Apple Music \u00e2\u20ac\u201c have been growing rapidly since the company stopped viewing them just as a tool for boosting phone sales and started seeing them as a business. Apple invented the idea of the App Store and is taking a 30% cut on everything in it. Tesla Tesla has had a difficult few months, with increasing concerns about the firm\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s financial sustainability and outbursts from its billionaire founder Elon Musk that have seen him labelled the Trump of Tech. On Wednesday the electric-car maker reported a record $717m loss for the last three months, but the shares climbed because revenue hit $4bn and Musk promised profitability later this year. He said there had been a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153mind-blowing leap forward\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in the number of cars rolling off the lines. Verdict Elon Musk\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s responsible-boss routine on Tesla\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s earnings call appeared to restore investor confidence following his disastrous performance three months ago, when he rejected \u00e2\u20ac\u0153boring bonehead questions\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd from Wall Street analysts concerned about Tesla\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fundamentals. But whether he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a responsible boss or an unpredictable tech genius, Musk still has an uphill struggle on his hands, turning Tesla from a niche maker of expensive cars for the Silicon Valley set into a mass-market manufacturer of electric cars that can compete on equal terms with the likes of BMW and Nissan. Tesla is finally producing its self-imposed quota of 5,000 of its mass-market Model 3s a week, but to do so it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s had to shift production to an external \u00e2\u20ac\u0153tent\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, and take a record $700m loss for the quarter. And simply matching its legacy competitors on one mass-market vehicle isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t enough \u00e2\u20ac\u201c to justify its sky-high valuation (Tesla\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock-market value is roughly the same as BMW\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s), it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll have to deliver on at least one of its moonshots: self-driving cars, a radically redesigned charging infrastructure, or the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s first commercially feasible electric truck. Twitter Twitter lost more than a fifth of its value in two days, despite reporting a record profit, because investors were worried about hugely disappointing forecasts for user numbers. It lost 1 million users in the last three months and predicted a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153mid-single-digit millions\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd decline in the next three-month period. The social media service reported net income of $100m during the second quarter, but tech companies need to show they can deliver uninterrupted growth to impress Wall Street. Verdict In 2016, Twitter moved its app from the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153social networking\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd section of the App Store to the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153news\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd section. At the time, it was seen as a capitulation to Facebook, but now it looks like a piece of genuine insight into what the company could offer to users and how the service differs from its competition. Like all news services, when there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a lot of news, the company booms, and there is certainly a lot of news right now. That has fed into a good performance over the last year. The last quarter is a different story, of course. Twitter still has to tackle the same trust and safety issues as Facebook and Google, with a fraction of the money and engineering talent. And, as with Facebook, Wall Street just doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to play ball: Twitter deletes millions of fake accounts, and investors punish it with a 20% plunge in stock price. Would they really prefer to invest in a site riddled with bots? Netflix The video streaming service was first of the tech firms out of the gate, posting figures in mid-July. Its latest three-month results sent its shares tumbling after it missed subscriber-number expectations for the first time in five years: it signed up more than 5 million new users, which was about a million fewer than the company and the market had expected. Verdict Netflix\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s strategy has changed a lot over the years, from posting DVDs, to streaming licensed movies, to streaming licensed TV shows. These days, its focus is on original serialised programming, which changes the way to think about its content costs: they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re no longer a recurring expense eating into the margin, but a long-term investment. And, as analyst Ben Thompson notes, the spending in effect works towards customer acquisition: the more content on Netflix, the more reason there is to join the site. Which is why, when subscriber growth slows, the whole thing looks unstable. The smallest of the Faangs hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t achieved the escape velocity of its peers, and a dip could always turn into a death dive. Spotify In only its second financial report since flotation, the music streaming service reported an 8 million rise in the number of paid subscribers, to 83 million during the second quarter. Spotify has yet to record a profit, but the increase suggests it is still staving off competition from deep-pocketed rivals such as Amazon and Apple for music streaming customers. Its operating loss widened from \u00e2\u201a\u00ac79m to \u00e2\u201a\u00ac90m (\u00c2\u00a380m). Verdict The music streaming market still has room to grow, as the stubborn markets for digital downloads and CDs demonstrate. But everyone knows it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s eventually going to be a winner-takes-all battle. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s because, unlike video, there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s little reason to have subscriptions to multiple streaming services, and strong economies of scale. So Spotify\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock price is essentially a representation of one simple question: will it win, or will Apple Music? In Spotify\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s favour is its large and growing free service, which brings in substantial ad revenue and is a crucial pipeline for new users \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and the Android market, where it lacks a strong competitor. Working against it: a competitor with much deeper pockets.",

                "bodyText":"Time for a recap. The trade dispute between the US and China has escalated further, as neither side shows any appetite for backing down. The Chinese government unveiled tariffs on $16bn of American goods today. Medical equipment, fuels, fish meal, wood waste, paper and paper waste, metal scraps, cars and bicycles are all on list of products targeted. Beijing was retaliating against Washington\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision to slap tariffs on an extra $16bn of Chinese goods overnight. These latest tit-for-tat moves mean there are levies on $50bn of goods moving each way between the two countries. So far, China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy seems to be holding up under the strain. Trade figures released overnight showed that exports rose by 12.2% year-on-year in July, while exports jumped by over 27%. The decision to allow the yuan to fall against the US dollar may be supporting manufacturers, analysts say. But if the situation escalates, the global economy could be badly hurt. With the two sides deadlocked, a ship full of soybeans has been anchored off China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s coast for a month - as its owners ponder whether to swallow the tariffs. Fears of a hard Brexit have hurt the pound again. Sterling fell to an 11-month low against the US dollar, at $1.2854. Against the euro, it dropped to \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.1091, a nine-month low. Fiona Cincotta, senior market analyst at City Index, explains why traders are worried: he possibility of a no-deal Brexit has been looming over the pound for a while now but it seems to have asserted itself in traders\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 minds even more this week since Bank of England governor Mark Carney said that the likelihood was now \u00e2\u20ac\u0153uncomfortably high\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, a sentiment later echoed by Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade secretary Liam Fox. Elsewhere in the markets, Tesla board members have confirmed they are evaluating whether to take the electric car market private. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s still some cynicism, though, as to whether Elon Musk will actually pull the idea off. And the oil price has slipped, due to trade war worries and a smaller-than-expected drop in US crude inventories. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s probably all for today. GW It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a month since the US and China imposed their first wave of tariffs, in early July. And ever since, a cargo ship full of soybeans has been waiting at anchor off the port of Dalian. Having failed to reach China before the deadline, the vessel is in limbo while its owners decide what to do. If they unload the beans now, they (or the buyer) would incur hefty tariffs. My colleague Rob Davies has been looking into the issue, and explains: A shipment of soybeans worth more than $20m (\u00c2\u00a315.5m) has been bobbing aimlessly in the Pacific Ocean for a month, a casualty of the escalating trade war between China and the US. Lingering uncertainty over the cargo\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fate offered a timely reminder of the fallout from a dispute that intensified on Wednesday, as the US president, Donald Trump, unveiled a second round of tariffs on $16bn of Chinese goods, prompting Beijing to respond in kind. The Peak Pegasus, a 229 metre bulk carrier weighing 43,000 tonnes, has become the reluctant symbol of the potential consequences of this tit-for-tat trade spat. The ship, owned by JP Morgan Asset Management, was scheduled to unload about 70,000 tonnes of American soybeans in the Chinese port of Dalian on 6 July, shortly after Trump imposed a first round of tariffs on $34bn-worth of goods. As it rushed to shore in the hope of clearing customs before Beijing imposed retaliatory tariffs, the ship \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and its protein-rich cargo \u00e2\u20ac\u201c became an unlikely internet sensation on the Chinese social media platform Weibo. However, the vessel arrived just too late and has been sailing around in circles ever since while the cargo\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s owners, understood to be the agricultural commodity trading house Louis Dreyfus, decide what to do.... More here: The US-China trade row is also being blamed for falling oil prices today. Brent crude has tumbled by 3.5% today to $71.99 per barrel, while US crude is down 3.8% at $66.60. Economists are citing the risks to global growth posed by tariffs Abhishek Kumar, senior energy analyst at Interfax Energy in London, says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The US-China trade war is set to worsen, and its impact on oil prices will be gradual as the situation develops. Crude oil and refined products affected by additional duties will reduce their competitiveness in the Chinese market.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The latest oil inventory figures from America have also hit the oil price. Crude inventories fell by 1.4 million barrels in the latest week, less than half the 3.3 million barrel draw analysts had expected. Trade wars can have many casualties. And the dispute between America and China is threatening the future of a paper mill in the state of Arkansas. Associated Press has the details: A Chinese company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s announcement two years ago that it would spend more than $1 billion and hire hundreds of workers for a paper mill on the outskirts of this rural college town was seen as a much-needed shot in the arm for the region\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy. A web video promoting Arkadelphia \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a great place to call home!\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd continues to tout the Sun Paper project and its potential to generate jobs and boost development. But optimism has been giving way to concern in recent months amid President Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s escalating trade dispute with China. The threat of a full-blown trade war has delayed the project further and prompted the state\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s governor to send his top economic development official to China to make sure it stays on track. It also has caused other Chinese companies considering investing in Arkansas to put their plans on hold. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s like a dark cloud hanging over the future of the project,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Stephen Bell, the president and chief executive officer of the Arkadelphia Area Chamber of Commerce. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Right now, the clouds are off on the horizon. But I think no one knows where the trade situation is going right now.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd.... More here. By announcing new tariffs today, China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s is sticking firmly to its tit-for-tat policy on trade, says Art Hogan, chief market strategist at investment bank B. Riley. That means that the trade war is likely to escalate, Hogan warns (via CNN): \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Our $16 billion comes at a scheduled time, which comes up on the 23rd. China said we see your $16 billion and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll match your $16 billion.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u0153They\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll pretty much match what we do until they have no more levers to pull. The bad news is the trade war fears in China are escalating. The major concern right now in trade is China. In case you missed this earlier, we learned overnight that China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s imports and exports both rose in July. Exports jumped by over 12% year on year, indicating that the trade war hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t caused serious damage yet. These photos from Lianyungang Port, in the Jiangsu Province of China, show that plenty of vehicle were lined up for shipment today: China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s latest wave of tariffs haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t spooked the US stock market. The Dow Jones industrial average has dipped by 24 points, or just 0.1%, while the broader S&amp;P 500 index is flat. David Madden of CMC Markets explains why traders aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t panicking: Markets had a muted reaction to China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s announcement that it plans to impose tariffs on $16 billion worth of US goods, starting on 23 August. The token retaliation from Beijing keeps the trade spat alive, and it seems like China were doing it to send a message, rather than to inflict financial pain on the US. So far, China has managed a tit-for-tat response to America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade tariffs -- including today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s retaliation to US plans for tariffs on $16bn of Chinese goods. But Beijing can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t respond in kind if Donald Trump implements his threat for 25% tariffs on an extra $200bn of goods, simply because China doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t buy enough from America. Oliver Jones of Capital Economics thinks Beijing might change course, and target individual US companies. He writes: While China has so far responded to US tariffs primarily with duties of its own, it is reaching the limit of its ability to respond in this way. There are already signs that China is starting to target US multinationals operating there directly instead. We think that its response will increasingly take this form if the US imposes tariffs beyond those already in the pipeline. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Reuters\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 take on the US-China tariffs row: China is slapping additional import tariffs of 25 percent on $16 billion worth of U.S. goods ranging from oil and steel products to autos and medical equipment, the commerce ministry said, as the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s two largest economies escalate their trade dispute. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This is a very unreasonable practice,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd the commerce ministry said on its website http://www.mofcom.gov.cn, responding to the United States\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 decision to slap 25 percent tariffs on another $16 billion of Chinese goods on Aug 23. The slump in sterling today has given the London stock exchange a boost. The FTSE 100 has gained 43 points, or 0.5%, to 7761 points. With the pound lower, multinational\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s overseas earnings are worth more in sterling terms (updated). Basically the Footsie is acting as the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcup\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 side of the see-saw, as the pound drops - currently down 0.5% against the US dollar to around $1.287. Tesla\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shares have dipped in early trading, down $2.5 at around $377. Wall Street may not be convinced that the company is definitely being taken private, following that announcement from the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s board. After all, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153taking the appropriate next steps\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd is rater more guarded than Musk\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bold claim that he has \u00e2\u20ac\u0153funding secured\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to take Tesla off the stock market at $420 per share. Newsflash: Electric car maker Tesla has issued a statement, in response to founder Elon Musk\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s comments yesterday about taking the company off the stock market. Tesla says that Musk \u00e2\u20ac\u0153opened discussions\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd last week with the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s board about taking it private, to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153better serve\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd its long-term interests. The board have met several times since, and are now evaluating the idea. Yesterday, Musk insisted that he had secured the funding to take Tesla private - even though it would be the biggest buyout ever. Leaving the stock market would take some pressure off Tesla, as it battles to hit its production targets... However, some financial analysts are sceptical that the plan would really work: American scrap metal and waste paper will also incur 25% tariffs at the Chinese border in two weeks. So, apparently, will US \u00e2\u20ac\u0153fish meal for feed\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd (which I think is used to nourish farmed fish, poultry and pork). China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new retaliatory tariffs will apply to 333 US products. Coal, diesel, cars and bicycles, medical equipment and steel products are all on the list, the Chinese commerce department says. Newsflash: China has announced it will impose retaliatory 25% tariffs on $16bn of US goods. Beijing\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s commerce ministry says it has been forced to retaliate to America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u0153very unreasonable\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd levies on $16bn of Chinese exports (announced last night). China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s measures will kick-in on August 23, the same day as America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s latest levies, as it sticks to its policy of respond in kind to Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade moves. So in two weeks, the two countries will be imposing tariffs on $50bn of each others goods. American officials are already working on plans for tariffs on another $200bn of Chinese products in September. Reuters reports that City traders are taking steps to protect themselves against sterling falling further: Nine-month and one-year sterling/dollar risk-reversals fell on Wednesday to the lowest since early-March 2017, as investors rushed to protect themselves from further weakness in the British currency. Risk reversals are a gauge of investor expectations for a currency\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s direction and are used to hedge against expected moves. The fall in sterling risk reversals indicates greater demand for put options, derivatives that give investors the right to sell an asset. This is from Miles Eakers of foreign exchange firm Centtrip: Sterling is being hit by fears of a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcno-deal Brexit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, says Lukman Otunuga, research analyst at FXTM. Sterling was pounded by the Dollar and most of its major counterparts on Wednesday as fears heightened over the UK exiting the European Union without a trade deal in place. Concerns of a potential hard Brexit scenario have haunted investor attraction towards the Pound and have left the currency vulnerable to downside shocks. The selloff is gathering pace. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the latest damage: Pound vs US dollar: $1.286, an 11-month low Pound vs euro: \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.109, a nine-month low Economics lecturer Daniel McLaughlin says the slide in the pound is bad news for UK consumers: [It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s true that a weaker currency makes exports more competitive, but it also makes imported raw materials pricier - so it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not an undiluted win] Newsflash: The euro has risen over 90p against the pound for the first time since last autumn. Jordan Rochester of Japanese bank Nomura predicts the pound will keep falling ahead of the next crunch EU summit in October - when Theresa May will try to persuade leaders to back her \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcChequers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 deal. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We remain bearish on the pound in the short term until the Brexit mess is out the way and look for the currency to enter a $1.27-1.28 range before the leaders summit.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Ouch! The pound just fell through $1.29 for the first time since August 2017. UK holidaymakers heading to Europe this summer just suffered a blow. The pound has weakened against the euro to its lowest level since last November, meaning trips across the channel have become a little more expensive. Sterling fell as low as \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.1129, down 0.25% today. But that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not all! Sterling has dropped to a new 11-month low against the US dollar, at $1.2909, and is also weaker against the yen and the Swiss franc. The pound has been under pressure this week, after trade secretary Liam Fox claimed that Britain was likely to leave the EU without a deal. Such a hard-Brexit could lead to chaos at the borders, and leave companies struggling to keep their supply chains running Christophe Barraud, an economist at Market Securities brokerage in Paris, has told Reuters that firms are trying to protect themselves from a sterling crisis. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153A lot of companies can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t wait for the negotiations outcome in October so a lot of course are trying to hedge against a drop in the pound.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd ANZ senior China economist Betty Wang agrees that Chinese factories have benefitted from the weaker yuan - even if Beijing hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t been fighting a currency war. She says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Currency devaluation, which may have helped exports to some extent, has been largely market-driven in our view and is not a preferred policy tool by Chinese policy makers as part of the retaliation measures.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Figures released earlier this week showed that Beijing hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t been burning through its foreign exchange reserves, suggesting it has been allowing the yuan to drop rather than fighting it: China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock market suffered losses today, after America finalised its plans for tariffs on another $16bn of exports. The Shanghai composite index fell by 1.2%, as traders worried that the trade war keeps ratcheting up. Washington might be disappointed to see that China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s imports and exports actually rose in July, says Michael Hewson of CMC Markets: If the US was hoping that its $34bn opening salvo of tariffs would have an effect on Chinese exports this morning\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s China trade numbers would have been a disappointment to them. Chinese exports for July saw a rise of 12.2% up from 11.2% in June, supporting the premise that for the moment we seem to be in a bit of a phoney war. We also saw a big rise in imports of 27.3% showing that domestic demand remains quite strong. China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade surplus with America remained close to a record high in July, despite the trade dispute. Reuters explains: China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s closely watched surplus with the United States dipped only slightly to $28.09 billion last month from a record $28.97 billion in June. Washington has long criticised China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade surplus with the United States and has demanded Beijing cut it. Still, disagreements between the two major economic powers run deeper than just the trade balance and tensions remain over market access, intellectual property, technology transfer and investment. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. America has fired another shot in the deepening trade dispute with China. Overnight, Washington said it would impose a 25% tariff on $16bn of Chinese imports, taking the total amount being targeted to $50bn. The new levy will come into force on August 23rd, and will apply to 279 product types. It mostly affects industrial products, such as machinery, chemicals and semiconductors. Motorcycles and railway cars also feature. Announcing the move, the US trade representative declared that America was penalising China for stealing its intellectual property, saying: China directs and unfairly facilitates the systematic investment in, and acquisition of, U.S. companies and assets to generate large-scale technology transfer\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. China is likely to retaliate soon, escalating the dispute that has been rumbling for weeks. But... China may not be suffering from the trade war yet. Data released this morning shows that the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s exports jumped 12.2% year-on-year in July, beating expectations. Imports surged by a sparkling 27.3% - meaning China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade surplus shrank during the month to $28bn (from over $41bn in June). This is significant, as America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s first wave of tariffs (on $34bn of Chinese goods) began in early July. Those tariffs have been blamed for a drop in German factory orders, but today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s figures suggest China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy is holding firm. Of course, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s still early days. Global trade, like the massive container ships it relies on, changes course slowly. Plus, China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s manufacturers may be benefitting from the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s weaker currency, given the yuan has fallen pretty steadily recently to a 13-month low. Julian Evans-Pritchard, senior China economist for Capital Economics, explains: Adjusting for seasonality and price effects, we estimate that export volumes were essentially flat in July. Shipments to the US did weaken slightly, which suggests the tariffs had some impact. But this was offset by stronger exports to the rest of the world, most likely buoyed by the weaker renminbi. Mike van Dulken of Accendo Markets agrees that China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade data is encouraging, especially in the current climate. China trade data showed stronger growth in both exports and imports, notably the latter, suggesting strong consumption both domestically and internationally. But Also coming up today... Wall Street will be watching for Elon Musk\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s next move, after the inventor/entrepreneur surprisingly announced he plans to take Tesla private. Shares in the electric carmaker surged last night, burning sceptical investors who had bet against the company. Going private would take some pressure off Tesla to meet financial targets (and prevent Musk having another row with the analyst community) However, shares aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t at the $420 level which Musk pitched his somewhat vague offer at (which has sparked grumbling about market manipulation), so Tesla\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s future remains uncertain. Oil is calm this morning, having risen yesterday after the US issued new sanctions on Iran. Later today we get the latest American oil inventory figures, which may show a drop in stocks.

Quite how Erdo\u00c4\u0178an can credibly shift to such a position is anybody\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s guess but it is the logical endgame. The only vaguely good news is that the contagion warnings are not flashing red. A few European banks are overexposed, but the lending problem is not system-wide. In a bigger crisis, investors would also be selling the currencies of other weak emerging economies. The South African rand is sliding but one cannot \u00e2\u20ac\u201c yet \u00e2\u20ac\u201c call it across-the-board panic. That may come, however. Erdo\u00c4\u0178an has chosen a high-risk path and markets have a habit of asking who else cannot live with higher US interest rates. Clarity needed at Esure \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Esure is a great business today and I am excited about the many opportunities we have to ensure we continue to be a great business in the future,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd the founder, chairman and 30% owner, Sir Peter Wood, said in March. Has his enthusiasm waned? Five months later, Woods and Esure are \u00e2\u20ac\u0153minded to recommend\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd a 280p-a-share, or \u00c2\u00a31.2bn, takeover approach from the private equity outfit Bain Capital. The proposed price doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t look terrific since Esure was valued at slightly more only 12 months ago. But it is a 37% premium to the share price last week, which is a level at which boards tend to roll over. To those shareholders who grumble that Esure floated at 290p in 2013, the directors will be able to point to the \u00c2\u00a3300m of dividends paid since and the demerger of the price comparison website Go Compare. But investors will want clarity on a more important point. Bain, you would think, would want to keep Wood in harness in some role. After all, he founded Esure in 2000 and is the guru of general insurance, having also launched Direct Line in the 1980s. Would Wood sell all his shares to Bain? Or would he remain a player with a stake? If it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the latter, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a significant point. Speak up \u00e2\u20ac\u201c starting with Tuesday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s half-year results. Musk\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s claim does not wash Tesla\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Elon Musk has defended his infamous \u00e2\u20ac\u0153funding secured\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd tweet on the grounds that Saudi Arabia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sovereign wealth fund had expressed repeated interest in being the main investor in a deal to take the electric car company private. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It was just a matter of getting the process moving,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he says. Sorry, but this doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t wash. There is a huge difference between the expression of an interest in a buyout and the completion of the legal paperwork and due diligence to make the deal happen. Only the latter justifies a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153funding secured\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd label. From a regulatory point of view, Musk is in very hot water, as he is presumably realising.",

Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a flavour:</p> <h2>What are the implications for the global economy?</h2> <p>The direct impact of what looks like an inevitable recession in Turkey would be relatively small because, despite a population of 80 million and strong growth in recent years, the country accounts for only 1% of global GDP. Eurozone countries run a trade surplus with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/turkey\">Turkey</a> but it is small. In the two previous Turkish financial crises since the turn of the millennium, European exporters have been able to divert their business to other markets. The European Central Bank has expressed concern about potential contagion through the eurozone banking system, with Spain, followed by Italy, the most heavily exposed countries.<br></p> <p>A bigger danger is that Turkey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s crisis will spill over into other emerging market economies and there were signs on Monday that other countries seen as vulnerable were coming under speculative attack. Turkey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s problems are particularly acute because it has more than $300bn of dollar-denominated corporate debt, which is getting more expensive to finance by the day. However, other countries \u00e2\u20ac\u201c such as Mexico and South Africa - also took advantage of low US interest rates in the years after the financial crisis to borrow heavily in dollars and saw their currencies coming under pressure.

                "bodyText":"This liveblog is now closed, but you can catch-up with all the latest developments here: And finally, the Turkish crisis makes the front page of Tuesday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Guardian: The Times is reporting that UK holidaymakers are taking advantage of the fact they can now get eight lira to the pound: President Erdo\u00c4\u0178an\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s defiant speech makes the front page of the Independent, and the Financial Times: That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s all for today. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll back on Tuesday morning, UK time, with the latest market action. Stay tuned to the Guardian website in the meantime, for any breaking developments. Goodnight! GW Over in Asia, the markets are cranking back into action for Tuesday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s session. And so far, the lira looks quite orderly - trading just below 7 lira to the US dollar, as in Europe earlier. The US stock market has close down lower tonight, as the Turkey crisis weighted on sentiment. The Dow shed 125 points, or 0.5%, to finish at 25,187. The wider S&amp;P 500 lost 0.4%. Energy companies led the sell off, dropping by 1.2%. Banks and miners lost 1%, reflecting worries that the lira crisis could create financial turmoil and dent economic demand. After a busy day, here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our economics editor Larry Elliott on the Turkish crisis: A fresh plunge in the Turkish lira sent tremors through global currency markets on Monday, amid fears that the failure of Recep Tayyip Erdogan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s government to tackle its worsening financial crisis would have a domino effect on other vulnerable countries. The Argentine peso and the South African rand were the biggest knock-on casualties of a day of turbulence that saw the lira fall 8% against the dollar and Erdogan lash out at \u00e2\u20ac\u0153economic terrorists on social media\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, as he accused Donald Trump of stabbing Turkey in the back. But the Turkish president\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s insistence that his country would survive an economic siege failed to reassure financial markets alarmed at the possible collapse of the strategically-vital emerging market country. Concerns that the 45% drop in the value of the lira this year would prove ruinous for companies that had borrowed heavily in foreign currencies prompted the renewed sell off of the lira and pushed up the cost of servicing Turkey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s budget deficit. Erdogan insisted that the Turkish economy was fundamentally sound and attacked the US president for imposing sanctions and doubling tariffs on Turkey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s steel and aluminium imports last week over the house arrest of an American pastor, Andrew Brunson, on disputed terrorism charges. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We are together in NATO and then you stab your strategic partner in the back,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Erdogan said as he came under pressure from the markets to respond to the lira\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fall and an inflation rate of more than 15%. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the full story: My colleague Martin Chulov has discovered that the lira crisis has been fuelled by a misunderstanding between the leaders of the US and Turkey. He writes: The currency plunge imperilling Turkey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy has been fuelled by a standoff between Donald Trump and Recep Tayyip Erdo\u00c4\u0178an over the fate of a Turkish woman detained in Israel whose freedom the US president brokered, and an American pastor held in Turkey whose release he demands in return, officials in Ankara claim. Those officials say that Trump may have \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcmisinterpreted\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 a discussion with Erdo\u00c4\u0178an over the pair - Turkish woman Ebru \u00c3\u2013zkan, jailed for alleged links to Hamas (but released last month), and Andrew Brunson, a preacher from North Carolina. It appears that Trump thought he had reached a deal for Brunson\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s release, while Erdo\u00c4\u0178an believed he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d agreed to transfer the pastor to house arrest (as happened in July). Martin explains: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It took place on the margins of the Nato summit,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd the source told the Guardian. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Erdo\u00c4\u0178an asked Trump for help with the lady in prison in Israel. There was only the two of them and a translator. Trump said: \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcI need some traction on the pastor first\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. When Erdo\u00c4\u0178an said OK he meant that we are working on it. Then [US vice-president Mike] Pence, due to midterm election considerations, messed things up. Trump confused a process for an agreement.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd That might explains why the White House has taken such a tough line on Turkey this week, imposing new sanction and starting the process to double tariffs on steel and aluminium. One late newsflash: Argentina\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s central bank has raised its benchmark interest rate to a blistering 45% (!), from 40%. As explained earlier, the peso hit a record low as the Turkish crisis rocked emerging market currencies (and as a political scandal continued to shake confidence). This rate hike is aimed at preventing the peso plunging even further, and suggest Buenos Aires is concerned that the markets could become more volatile in the days ahead. Time for a recap The currency crisis gripping Turkey has deepened today, sending ripples through the financial world and hurting emerging market countries across the globe. Fears over Turkey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s financial position sent its currency spiralling to a fresh record low, hitting 7.2 lira to the US dollar. The lira has now lost a third of its value in the last week, as the crisis has escalated alarmingly. Turkey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock market also had a rough day, with bank shares tumbling by over 10%. Economists fear that Turkish companies will struggle to repay loans priced in dollars, given the lira\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s plunge in value. Contagion caused jitters elsewhere too, with India\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rupee and Argentina\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s peso dropping to record lows. The Russian rouble and the South African rand hit levels not seen since 2016. A cocktail of problems are to blame, from Turkey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s surging inflation rate and current account deficit to the diplomatic row with America that means the Turkish economy faces punishing sanctions. Investors believe that Turkey needs to take decisive action, such as hiking interest rates from their current level of 17.75% to an even more painful rate - perhaps over 27%. President Recep Tayyip Erdo\u00c4\u0178an is refusing to bow to pressure from the markets, though. He told an audience of ambassadors in Ankara that Turkey was under attack from overseas interests: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The developments over recent weeks have shown that Turkey is under siege. It is clear that these attacks will continue for a while.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Erdo\u00c4\u0178an also blasted US sanctions against its NATO ally, calling them a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153stab in the back against Turkey.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Turkey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s central bank has taken some steps to prop up the lira. It has pledged to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153provide all the liquidity the banks need\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, which should help them to keep providing loans to people and businesses. Delphine Arrighi, fund manager at Old Mutual Global Investors, argues that borrowing costs must rise to prevent the lira plunging to fresh depths. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Other options could include capital controls, which seem more likely than an appeal to the IMF, but that would certainly not be the least painful and would most likely precipitate a recession while postponing the return of portfolio inflows. Hence a sizable rate hike followed by drastic measures of fiscal consolidation still appear as the most viable option to re-anchor the lira and pull the Turkish economy from the brink. Turkish authorities have also launched a crackdown against social media accounts, which it blames for spreading \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcfake news\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 and undermining confidence in the economy. Even German chancellor Angela Merkel has weighed in, saying she hoped Turkey could be economically prosperous. She also called for Turkey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s central bank to be properly independent -- a touchy subject, as Erdo\u00c4\u0178an has been pushing it not to raise interest rates. There are fears that currency speculators could drive Turkey deeper into the crisis in the days ahead: And on the streets of Turkey, people have spoken of their concerns as import prices jump and the value of their savings shrinks. One told the Guardian: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t really understand any of it. I think it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s political. Erdo\u00c4\u0178an argues with Trump, and we end up trapped in a corner.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We can just pray to God,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he added. The US stock market is heading lower, as worries over Turkey ripple weigh on Wall Street. Banks are bearing the brunt, with Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan both down around 1%. Traders remain worried that the Turkish crisis will escalate, unless Ankara takes more decisive steps - such as an interest rate hike. A bit more from Ed Conway: After a day of heavy losses, Turkey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock exchange has closed deep in the red with the benchmark BIST 100 index losing 2.4%. Financial stocks felt the full blast of the currency crisis, with some bank stocks falling by over 10%. The slump is even worse if you adjust for the depreciation of the lira, points out Sky News\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ed Conway in this thread about the situation in Turkey: Our economics editor Larry Elliott has written a new Q&amp;A on the Turkish crisis. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a flavour: What are the implications for the global economy? The direct impact of what looks like an inevitable recession in Turkey would be relatively small because, despite a population of 80 million and strong growth in recent years, the country accounts for only 1% of global GDP. Eurozone countries run a trade surplus with Turkey but it is small. In the two previous Turkish financial crises since the turn of the millennium, European exporters have been able to divert their business to other markets. The European Central Bank has expressed concern about potential contagion through the eurozone banking system, with Spain, followed by Italy, the most heavily exposed countries. A bigger danger is that Turkey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s crisis will spill over into other emerging market economies and there were signs on Monday that other countries seen as vulnerable were coming under speculative attack. Turkey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s problems are particularly acute because it has more than $300bn of dollar-denominated corporate debt, which is getting more expensive to finance by the day. However, other countries \u00e2\u20ac\u201c such as Mexico and South Africa - also took advantage of low US interest rates in the years after the financial crisis to borrow heavily in dollars and saw their currencies coming under pressure. The fear is of a full-blown emerging market crisis. The lira is weakening in late trading, and is threatening to plunge back the 7 lira-to-the-US dollar mark to a new all-time low. Andy Birch, principal economist at IHS Markit, fears the lira will keep tumbling until Turkey raises interest rates: The changes to reserve requirements in recent days and the government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s unspecified action plan has done little to stabilize the lira. Significantly more than just official promises of action are needed to exit the current crisis. IHS Markit continues to believe that the most immediate step to be taken to rescue the lira is a sharp central bank rate rise. If this step is taken in conjunction with a shifting of government rhetoric, the plunge of the lira could pause and portfolio investment outflows may slow. Turkish citizens are struggling to cope with the impact of the lira\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s astonishing losses in recent days, report Kareem Shaheen and Gokce Saracoglu in Istanbul. Some fear their businesses could shut down, while others who support the president say they will buy domestic products and shun goods from abroad. Those who cater to tourists, however, hope that the decline in the value of the currency will bring more foreign holidaymakers to the country. All declined to give their full names. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Go your way, nothing will happen to this country, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve seen the lira much lower than this in the 1990s,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said one foreign exchange office worker. Money-changing offices in Istanbul were selling dollars at a much higher rate than the banks on Monday, however, saying the fluctuation in the currency\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s value was so unstable as to render the price they set meaningless. One vegetable and fruit seller said he had been forced to raise the price of imported products. A kilogram of bananas that cost 10 lira last week was now 15 lira. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We need to send Erdo\u00c4\u0178an away,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said. While ordinary Turks struggle to absorb the effects of high inflation and a declining currency, some foreigners who earn salaries in dollars and tourists are buying up luxury items. Pictures on social media over the weekend showed queues of foreigners outside stores such as Luis Vuitton and Chanel. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153A lot of tourists, especially Arabs, buy from our store,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said the manager of a high-end design store in Galata. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153But every 15 days we have to buy new supplies from Europe. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s their full report: European stock markets have closed in the red, as Turkish worries weigh on shares. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE 100 shed 24 points, or 0.3%, to end the day at 7642. Holiday firm TUI was the worst-performing stock on the Footsie, losing 2.5%. Last week, it revealed it was taking a financial hit on euro-denominated loans taken out to fund hotel building in Turkey. The lira\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s losses push up the cost of repaying that debt. European banks with exposure to the Turkish economy also had a bad day. Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s BBVA lost 3.2% while Unicredit shed 2.5%. Argentina has been hit by the anxiety rippling through the financial markets today. The peso has fallen to a record low, at around 30 pesos to the US dollar. Back in April it was trading around the 20 mark, before a slump in market confidence forced Buenos Aires to seek a bailout from the International Monetary Fund. The peso is also being driven down by an unfolding scandal involving alleged bribes made to former officials of the Kirchner government (which was in power until 2015). More than a dozen business people have been arrested, after it emerged that the chauffeur of a former government official had kept diaries which allege to show payments totalling millions of dollars. The ongoing investigation has also hit share and bond prices, as traders wonder whether more executives, or politicians, will be dragged in. Despite today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s drama, currency exchange offices have been operating as normal in Turkey today. Here are some photos from Istanbul: While the slump in the lira is bad news for Turkish citizens, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s something of a boon for tourists. For example, one pound is now worth 8.8 lira -- compared to just 4.5 lira a year ago. That makes Turkey an attractive destination for Brits, driving down the cost of accommodation and food. Economics columnist Matt O\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Brien has written a pithy explanation of the Turkish financial crisis, which new readers might find particularly helpful: In another worrying sign, the cost of insuring Turkish government bonds has jumped today. The cost of a five-year credit default swap (which would pay out if Ankara can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t repay its bonds) jumped to 573 basis points, up from 452bp on Friday. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s according to data firm Markit, and suggests Turkish debt is now seen as riskier. Technically, it means it would cost $573,000 per year to insure $10m of Turkish debt. After several hours of volatile trading, the Turkish lira has settled around 6.87 lira to the US dollar. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a loss of around 7% today (a whopping move by usual standards), but also a small recovery on the record low of 7.2 struck overnight. It also means the lira has still lost a third of its value in the last week. The news that the Turkish central bank is offering more liquidity to commercial banks (see earlier post) seems to have stemmed the panic. However, investors still want to see more comprehensive action to tackle its inflation and current account deficit, such as a massive hike in interest rates. Reto Foellmi, economist from the University of St Gallen, fears that further lira losses could be disastrous: The vibrant growth of Turkey relied heavily on financing in foreign-currency debt. While Turkish exports get cheaper, Turkish companies face higher repayment obligations of the loans which hurts banks as well. As the Lira has a reputation as a weak currency, Erdogan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rhetoric puts oil into the fire. With a further weakening of the Lira, Turkey faces a downward spiral, where default could be the end. The Turkish crisis dragged world stock markets to a one-month low today. The MSCI world equity index, which tracks shares in 47 countries, fell 0.6% this morning, as the Turkish lira hit fresh record lows against the US dollar. That was driven by losses in Asia overnight, in Europe this morning, and at emerging markets across the world. Dean Popplewell of City firm OANDA says anxiety over Turkey has \u00e2\u20ac\u0153severely bullied emerging markets into near submission.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd In Japan, the Nikkei tumbled -2% to a five-week low overnight as a sell-off in emerging market currencies frightened investors, with the safe-haven yen\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s (\u00c2\u00a5110.20) appreciation also hurting sentiment. The broader Topix dropped -2.1%. Down-under, Aussie shares ended lower overnight, weighed down by materials and banks after the crisis in Turkey hit Asian assets, while global trade turmoil pushed commodity prices lower. The S&amp;P/ASX 200 index fell -0.4%. In S. Korea, the Kospi ended down -1.5%, in line with other Asian countries. However, America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock market is holding its nerve. Wall Street is calm in early trading, with the Dow Jones industrial average up 60 points (or 0.23%). The EIU\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Agathe Demarais adds that Turkey has a lot of work to do to regain market confidence -- but it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not clear that such measures will be taken..... With an overheated and indebted economy, Turkey will require credibly orthodox economic policies, fiscal discipline and central bank independence to reverse the current situation. A normalisation of relations with the US could also reduce the amount of legwork that the central bank will have to do to control the economic situation, but this is unlikely to happen at the moment. In view of the domestic political and economic conditions, it is therefore unclear whether the necessary steps will be taken to contain the market fallout. Agathe Demarais, Turkey analyst at The Economist Intelligence Unit, has predicted that Western banks will suffer losses from the Turkish lira\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s slump soon. She told the AFP newswire that the impact of the currency crisis will ripple through the financial world, as Turkish companies find they can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t service loans taken out in dollars. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153So far the impact of the lira crash has been limited in Europe and the rest of the world. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153However, within a few months western banks that have strong ties with Turkey will feel the impact of the crisis as Turkish corporates will struggle to repay debt in foreign currency. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The sharp depreciation of the lira has almost doubled the local currency value of external debt repayments since the start of the year.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd German chancellor Angela Merkel has now waded into the crisis, urging Turkey to ensure the independence of its central bank. Merkel told a news conference in Berlin that: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153No one has an interest in an economic destabilisation inTurkey. But everything must be done to ensure an independent central bank,. Germany would like to see an economically prosperous Turkey. This is in our interest.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The Turkish central bank has been restricted by Erdo\u00c4\u0178an\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s opposition to higher borrowing costs (he believes they cause inflation, while most economists believe they restrict it). Turkish interest rates are currently 17.75% -- very high by current standards. Some City experts, though, argue they should be hiked by over 1000 basis points (to around 27%) to prop up the lira. And here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Associated Press\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s take on the Turkish leader\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s speech earlier today. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan says his country is under an economic \u00e2\u20ac\u0153siege\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd that has nothing to do with its economic indicators. During an address to Turkish ambassadors in the capital, Ankara, Erdogan said Monday that Turkey would overcome the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153attack\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd on its economy. He insisted that Turkey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy remains strong and said the currency would soon settle \u00e2\u20ac\u0153at the most reasonable level.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd In an apparent reference to the United States, Erdogan said \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the bullies of the global system cannot roughly, shamelessly encroach on our gains that were paid for by blood.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The Turkish leader\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s comments came after authorities launched investigations into hundreds of social media accounts for alleged reports they claimed were helping the currency\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s plunge. Erdogan said there is an \u00e2\u20ac\u0153economic terror\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd being waged on social media, adding that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153traitors\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd would be punished. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Reuters first take on the Erdo\u00c4\u0178an speech: President Tayyip Erdo\u00c4\u0178an said on Monday he expected attacks on Turkey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy to continue but predicted the lira would return to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153rational levels\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd soon, after the Turkish currency hit a record low of more than 7 to the U.S. dollar. Erdo\u00c4\u0178an, who has described the lira\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fall as the consequence of a plot rather than economic fundamentals, also said that spreading false news about the economy was treason and recent U.S. actions were a stab in the back against Ankara. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a clip of president Erdo\u00c4\u0178an addressing the Ambassadors\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 conference a moment ago: The lira is weakening, following Erdo\u00c4\u0178an\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s claim that America is trying to stab Turkey in the back. It has dropped back to 6.9 lira to the US dollar, close to this morning\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s record low of 7.2. President Erdo\u00c4\u0178an has also declared that spreading false news about false news about Turkey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153treason\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. That follows this morning\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s crackdown on social media accounts blamed for sharing misleading information about the crisis. Heads-up: Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdo\u00c4\u0178an is giving a speech now, 10th annual Ambassadors\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Conference in Ankara. Bloomberg say Erdo\u00c4\u0178an has told the conference that Turkey must prepare for further attacks on its economy. He has accused America of breaking World Trade Organisation principles (presumably by doubling tariffs on Turkish metal exports last week). Erdo\u00c4\u0178an adds that America is trying to stab Turkey in the back. On the market turmoil, Erdo\u00c4\u0178an has told his audience that the lira would settle at a rational level soon. There is no \u00e2\u20ac\u02dceconomic basis\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 for recent exchange rate moves, he adds. There will also be no retreat from free market economic policies, he insists. More details to follow soon Some UK stocks are taking a direct hit from the Turkey crisis. Travel firm TUI is leading the FTSE 100 fallers, down 3.3% this morning. In theory, the slump in the lira makes Turkey a more attractive holiday destination. In practice, reports of financial instability are likely to deter tourists. Ashmore, a fund manager focused on emerging markets, is down 5%. Stockbroker AJ Bell explains: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Fund management group Ashmore is widely seen as the London-listed bellwether for emerging markets and its shares are unsurprisingly being sold off in the wake of the crisis in Turkey. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The recent collapse in the Turkish lira has served to trouble investors around the world and triggered a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcrisk-off\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 mentality. Put simply, investors are less willing to hold assets in higher risk areas such as emerging markets, and are switching instead to assets deemed to be safer havens. Fiona Cinoctta, senior market analyst at City Index, reckons the Turkish government only has a few days to stem the crisis. She warns that the slump in the lira could prompt some companies to default on their US dollar loans, triggering a domino effect: The lira had already declined 20% against the dollar on Friday on a mixture of domestic financial problems and increasing friction with the US and the decline continued this morning with the Turkish currency plumbing new lows. For the time being Turkey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s financial crisis looks localised but the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s central bank has perhaps only days to stop the decline of the currency before the lira\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s freefall results in loan defaults, starts seriously affecting the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s financial system and potentially starts spilling over onto European banks. Into this domestically induced financial slide comes the deteriorating relationship between Turkey and the US. The US is holding it against Turkey that it is refusing to support US sanctions against Iran and that is not releasing an American pastor who is being held on terrorism charges. The US response was fairly clear cut \u00e2\u20ac\u201c on Friday when the lira was in freefall the US announced it would raise the tariffs on imports of Turkish steel to 50% and the tariffs take effect Monday morning. The selloff at the Istanbul stock market is gathering pace. The BIST 100 index has fallen 4%, with some bank stocks suffering double-digit losses. You can get up to speed on the Turkey crisis with this Q&amp;A: Plus, here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economics editor Larry Elliott on why Turkey needs to raise interest rates sharply, or turn to the IMF for help.... Erdo\u00c4\u0178an\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s answer to the financial crisis \u00e2\u20ac\u201c that his followers should do their patriotic duty and exchange rapidly appreciating US dollars for ever-more worthless Turkish lira \u00e2\u20ac\u201c is laughable. Indeed, it will merely add to the belief in the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s financial markets that Turkey is being led by a man who has lost touch with reality. It is clear what needs to happen. Turkey has to tackle the three causes of its current predicament: an overheating economy; Erdo\u00c4\u0178an\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s attempts since his re-election in June to prevent the central bank from taking the necessary action to deal with rising prices; and the stand-off with the US. For Erdo\u00c4\u0178an, that means eating a huge plateful of humble pie. He is going to have to surrender to Trump over [jailed pastor Andrew] Brunson, because he is damaging the economy by continuing with a fight he cannot win. And he will need to accept that tough and unpopular measures are now inevitable to prevent a total collapse in the currency leading to hyper-inflation. The slump in the Turkish lira in recent weeks is quite extraordinary. It has lost a third of its value against the US dollar in a week (!) as investors have grown more anxious about the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s financial health, its diplomatic row with the US, and its central bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s reluctance (or inability) to raise borrowing costs to stem the crisis. This chart shows how the crisis could spread to Europe, if Turkish banks find themselves struggling to repay dollar-denominated debts: Turkish authorities have launched a crackdown on news and social media posts which are threatening confidence in the economy, according to local reports. Turkish financial regulators are threatening legal action against those who make or publish \u00e2\u20ac\u0153erroneous and fabricated news and statements\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Almost 350 social media accounts are under investigation, for undermining the lira\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s exchange rate against the US dollar. The move comes as president Erdo\u00c4\u0178an\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s office warns that there is a co-ordinated attempt to undermine the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy. H\u00c3\u00bcrriyet Daily News has the details: The Chief Prosecutor\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Office in Istanbul has opened an investigation into actions threatening \u00e2\u20ac\u0153economic security,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd while Turkey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s financial watchdog launched a separate probe into what it described as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153fake news\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd aiming to manipulate economy. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153An investigation has been launched according to Turkish Penal Law, Banking Law, Capital Markets Board regulations and related laws into people who displayed actions that threaten economic security through manipulative stories on media and operational social media accounts as part of the economic attacks that target the Republic of Turkey, its social peace, unity and economic security by the powers behind the [2016] coup attempt,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd the prosecutor\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s office said in a statement on August 13, according to the state-run Anadolu Agency. In a separate statement, Turkey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Interior Ministry said that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a judicial investigation has been launched into 346 social media accounts who shared posts to provoke the rise in the dollar exchange rate.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Meanwhile, Turkey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Financial Crime Investigation Board (MASAK) also launched a probe into what it described as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153fake news\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd aiming to manipulate economy. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153MASAK started an investigation into people and institutions that spread fake news, such as those claiming that \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcthe state will intervene to convert foreign exchange in accounts into Turkish lira\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 and \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcit will fix dollar exchange rate\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 by ditching floating rate policy, which is a main pillar of the free market,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Treasure and Finance Ministry Press Undersecretary Ali Berber said in a tweet on Aug. 13. More here: Turkey launches probe into \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcfake news\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 over lira rumors Overnight, the president\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s communications chief, Fahrettin Altun, has claimed there is a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153disinformation campaign\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd underway to undermine confidence in Turkey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s financial sector. He is unhappy about reports that President Erdo\u00c4\u0178an is threatening to seize foreign currency deposits. Over the weekend, Erdo\u00c4\u0178an warned he would take new measures if businesses rushed to withdraw their bank funds. He told an audience in Trabzon that: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It is industrialists\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 duty too to keep this nation on its feet. Otherwise we will set into motion our plan B and C.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Altun insist on Twitter, though, that this has been misinterpreted (although he doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t reveal what Plans B or C might be): Emerging currencies across the globe are suffering from the Turkish crisis. The South African rand has dropped to a two-year low, while Russia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rouble is at its lowest against the US dollar since early 2016. India\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rupee hit a record low, with traders reporting that the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s central bank had intervened to prevent an even steeper loss. The Turkish lira is still sharply lower today, down 6% at 6.8 lira to the US dollar (having plunged through 7 lira in early trading). With the US dollar strengthening, traders fear that developing economies are going to suffer capital outflows - potentially creating fresh currency crises. Neil Wilson of Markets.com fears further pain for emerging markets [EM in City jargon]. The dollar is the big winner in all this as investors turn away from EM. This may very well make things worse, particularly as long-dollar increasingly becomes something of a one-way trade. This dollar rally has a lot further to go and this will heap more misery on EM. European bank shares are leading the selloff, driven by fears that they could be dragged into the Turkish crisis. Several European financial institution, including Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s BBVA, Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s UniCredit and France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s BNP Paribas, have significant operations in Turkey. They have borrowed in US dollars and may struggle to repay those debts unless the lira recovers. BBVA shares have fallen by 2.2%, Unicredit have lost 2% and BNP Paribas are down 1%. On Friday, the Financial Times reported that the European Central Bank is concerned about their exposure to the Turkish crisis. Anxiety about spillover effects from Turkey is also pinning the euro at a one-year low against the US dollar (down half a cent at $1.137 right now). Yesterday, Turkish finance minister Berat Albayrak pledged that a new economic action plan would be implemented today. He announced: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153From Monday morning onwards our institutions will take the necessary steps and will share the announcements with the market.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd But that promise, and the Turkish central bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new measures, don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t appear to be stemming the crisis. Konstantinos Anthis, head of research at financial services group ADSS, says Turkish policymakers need to do more: Erdogan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s speeches over the weekend did little to calm down investors as he remains defiant and this morning news that the Turkish central bank implemented measures to improve liquidity is not addressing the main issue which is the lira\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decline. Ergodan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s unwillingness to raise interest rates suggests that the situation might not be defused soon extending the risk-off sentiment seen across all markets. Anxiety over Turkey is hitting share prices across Europe too, following those losses in Asia earlier today. The main European indices have all fallen into the red in early trading. Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s DAX has lost 0.8%, and Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE 100 is down 0.45% or 35 points at 7631. Jasper Lawler of London Capital Group says contagion fears are engulfing the markets. The panic that engulfed the markets at the end of last week is showing no signs of going anywhere at the start of the new week. Traders were met with a sea of red as indices dived across the Asian session; investors shunned riskier assets overnight while safer havens such as the Japanese yen and Swiss Franc firmed; jitters surrounding the Turkish currency crisis were showing few signs of moving on. The Turkish Lira dropped a further 6.3% in trading overnight, breaking through TL7 and hitting an all time low of TL7.2 after comments from Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan over the weekend failed to calm investors. The lack of any new significant policy and a defiant stance from Erdogan means that traders are bracing themselves for another day of hectic trading on Monday. Turkey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock market is suffering heavy losses this morning. The BIST 30 index of Turkey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s top countries has slumped by 2.5% in early trading, with virtually every share down. Financial stocks, utilities and consumer-focused companies are all leading the selloff, as investors fear that the financial crisis is escalating. Hussein Sayed, chief market strategist at foreign exchange firm FXTM, argues that Turkish policymakers need take much more decisive action, immediately. With inflation expected to run above 20%, a current account deficit that continues to widen, bond yields trading at record highs and growing political tensions with the U.S., the Turkish administration have limited choices to stop the Lira from bleeding. Investors need to see serious economic measures and not political ones to prevent things getting completely out of control. This includes an emergency interest rate hike by the central bank, imposing capital controls, fiscal reforms, securing a rescue package by the IMF or other lenders and ending the current diplomatic fight with Donald Trump. Until such steps are taken, investors will continue to selloff Turkish assets. Turkey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s central bank has taken action to stem the crisis, after seeing the lira slump to a record low today. The central bank of Turkey has announced several measures to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153support financial stability and sustain the effective functioning of markets\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. This includes providing \u00e2\u20ac\u0153all the liquidity the banks need\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, and taking a more active role in the foreign exchange markets. In a statement (online here), the bank says: The Central Bank will closely monitor the market depth and price formations, and take all necessary measures to maintain financial stability, if deemed necessary. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s an attempt to stabilize the tumbling lira and improve liquidity in the banking system. The move is having some success - the lira has recovered to around 6.7 against the dollar, from this morning\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s record low of 7.2. But, that still means it has suffered a huge depreciation in the last week: Crucially, the bank has NOT raised interest rates, despite some economists arguing they need to increase by perhaps 10 percentage points. Robert Bergqvist, chief economist at Swedish bank SEB, thinks more needs to be done: Asian stock markets and emerging currencies have been hit by the Turkish crisis today, and the euro has been dragged down to its lowest level in a year. My colleague Martin Farrer explains: The Turkish lira fell almost 9% in early trading on Monday and the euro hit a one-year low as investors feared that the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s financial crisis could spread to European markets. Despite defiant words by the Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdo\u00c4\u0178an over the weekend pledging as yet unspecified action to reverse the slide, the currency slipped alarmingly against the US dollar on Monday. Asian stock markets were also down on Monday. The Nikkei in Japan lost 1.7%, Hong Kong was off 1.8%, Shanghai -1.7%, Sydney -0.5% and the Taiwanese bourse fell 3%. The euro dropped 0.3% to a one-year low against the US dollar on Monday as the falling lira fuelled demand for safe havens, including the greenback, Swiss franc and yen. The Vix volatility index measuring turbulence in financial markets \u00e2\u20ac\u201c also known as the fear index \u00e2\u20ac\u201c jumped 16% on Monday. More here: Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Fear is sweeping through the financial markets this morning as Turkey falls deeper into a currency crisis. The Turkish lira has slumped to new record lows overnight, hitting more than 7 lira to the US dollar. That followed Friday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s precipitous declines, as investors fear that the country could be heading towards full-blown financial chaos. The crisis has been building for months as Turkey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s inflation rate has surged higher, its current account deficit has risen, and its economy has been hurt by the strengthening US dollar. Recep Tayyip Erdo\u00c4\u0178an\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s increasing autocratic governing stance - including putting his son-in-law into a key post running the economy - has spooked the markets. So has his dislike of higher interest rates, which would typically be used to prop up a weakening currency like the lira. Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision to double Turkey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s steel and aluminium tariffs on Friday has added to the sense of panic. President Erdo\u00c4\u0178an did nothing to reassure investors over the weekend. Instead, in a series of public addresses, he blasted the United States over the dispute over a jailed US pastor, and appeared to hint that Turkey \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a Nato member \u00e2\u20ac\u201c might look elsewhere for help (Russia, perhaps?) He declared: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We will say bye bye to those, who sacrifice their strategic partnership and alliance with a country of 81 million people on the altar of their relations with terror organisations. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We are working day and night for alternative markets.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Erdo\u00c4\u0178an also urged the Turkish people to do their bit, by converting any spare dollar and euros into lira. He told supporters in the north-eastern Turkish town of \u00c3\u0153nye that: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153If there are dollars under your pillow, take these out. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153If there are euros, take these out \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 immediately give these to the banks and convert to Turkish lira and, by doing this, we fight this war of independence and the future. Because this is the language they understand.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Unless Turkish policymakers can get a grip, the situation could easily cause serious problems in other markets. David Madden of CMC Markets explains: The Turkish lira has taken a battering, and the banks in Turkey who have borrowed in euros might struggle to repay their loans if they haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t hedged their position. Some eurozone banks have substantial shareholdings in Turkish bank, and should the default rate rise in Turkey, it could have a knock on effect around Europe. It looks like the eurozone banking system is set for another period of turmoil as the exposure that some Spanish and French banks have to Turkey could hurt confidence in the region. European banks have enough to worry about with their own non-performing loans, and let alone Turkey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s weakened loan books. When it comes to the health of banks, traders usually steer clear of stocks and seek out safe-haven assets such as government bonds or the Japanese yen. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be tracking all the main events through the day...",

Yet there is far to go. The economy is dependent on 6 million foreign workers and female participation in the labour market is weak, despite the recent lifting of the ban on women driving.

The idea was to make Saudi Arabia a global investment giant, to turn the country into a hub linking the three continents of Europe, Asia and Africa and to be the heart of the Arab and Islamic worlds. The proposed sale of part of the state-owned oil company - Saudi Aramco - was a key part of this attempt to transform and modernise the economy. Proceeds were earmarked for the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sovereign wealth fund so it could continue investing in companies such as the electric car company Tesla and the ride-hailing app Uber. Vision 2030 is strongly supported by the International Monetary Fund, which has praised the plan for its boldness. Yet there is far to go. The economy is dependent on 6 million foreign workers and female participation in the labour market is weak, despite the recent lifting of the ban on women driving. Riyadh is under pressure over its crackdown on dissent and the civilian casualties in Yemen, where it is fighting a proxy war with Iran. The postponement of the Saudi Aramco float \u00e2\u20ac\u201c although the government said it remained committed to an IPO at some point \u00e2\u20ac\u201c may have less to do with the state of financial markets than the unwillingness of the Saudis to come clean about the state of the company and the extent of oil reserves. Saudi Arabia remains a deeply conservative country. Just as with an oil supertanker, changing course will take time.",
