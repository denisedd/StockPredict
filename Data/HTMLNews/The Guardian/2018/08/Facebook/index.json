Markit said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>US manufacturing firms signalled a strong improvement in operating conditions in July, despite the headline PMI falling to a five-month low. Weaker rises in output and employment were seen in July, while export sales fell for the second month in a row. Meanwhile, companies reported the greatest deterioration in vendor performance since the series began and a faster rate of input cost inflation. That said, business confidence remained strongly positive, and was supported by hopes of further increases in overall new orders. </p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"229fcaf4943b426b3e0f5d17bf54c1384b6c92c5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/229fcaf4943b426b3e0f5d17bf54c1384b6c92c5/0_0_873_518/500.jpg\" alt=\"uspmi1aug\" width=\"500\" height=\"297\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit said: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The US manufacturing sector continued to expand in July, but shows increasing signs of struggling against headwinds of supply shortages, rising prices and deteriorating exports. </p> <p>The latest survey showed output rising at a rate roughly equivalent to an annualised 1% pace of expansion, which is the weakest since late last year. While a weakening of new export orders for a second successive month suggested foreign demand has waned compared to earlier in the year, the slowdown can be also in part attributed to increased difficulties in sourcing sufficient quantities of inputs. Suppliers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 delivery delays were more widespread than at any time in the survey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s history. With producers often scrambling to buy enough raw materials, suppliers enjoyed greater pricing power. Not surprisingly, with tariffs also kicking in, cost pressures spiked higher again.</p> <p>Some relief for manufacturers came from strong domestic demand, which meant firms were increasingly able to pass higher costs on to customers. Average prices charged for goods consequently rose at the steepest rate for seven years, which is likely to feed through to higher consumer prices in coming months.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5b61b799e4b0081aec3b9962\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-08-01T13:38:50.581Z\">2.38pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Apple\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rise has helped lift technology stocks on Wall Street, pushing the Nasdaq Composite 0.39% higher.</p> <p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average - which also includes Apple - is marginally higher, up 0.04% while the S&amp;P 500 has opened 0.17% higher.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5b61b0b8e4b0081aec3b991c\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-08-01T13:31:22.438Z\">2.31pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Apple shares open up 4.4%</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Following its forecast-beating results and upbeat outlook, Apple shares have jumped 4.4% to $198.4. at the start of the day\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trading, helping support a US market rattled by renewed concerns about a damaging trade war between the US and China.</p> <p>The move means Apple is close to becoming the first company to be valued at $1tn.

Neil Wilson, chief market analyst at Markets.com, says:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Apple shares leapt 4% in after-hours trade and are set to open at a record high just shy of the $200 level. Although it would be a bit of a stretch, a push up to the $1tn mark today is a possibility - it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s only a matter of time before it achieves a valuation of $1tn. If it does, cue some big profit taking but it would be a moment to savour for Tim Cook.</p> <p> We need the share price to break $203 to hit $1tn in market cap \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a little more than $5 above the after-hours level at $197-$198. Rather like the Dow at 25k, you kind of get the feeling investors will conspire to nudge it over the line. If you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re in FAANGs now I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t see why you wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t rotate some equity out of more exposed companies like Facebook and Netflix and opt for relative safety in Apple, whose multiples remain well short of FAANG peers. What might weigh today is broader market fears about trade wars with China as the White House sets out fresh tariff plans on $200bn of Chinese goods. Tim Cook was pretty circumspect on trade and tariffs on the call.</p> <p> Results were very impressive with a beat on revenues and EPS. iPhone sales were a shade weaker than forecast but on a number of important fronts we saw excellent numbers.</p> </blockquote> <p>The FAANGs - Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix and Google-owner Alphabet - and the wider technology sector have been under pressure in recent days after poor results from Facebook and Twitter.

But the downbeat survey is unlikely to discourage the Bank of England from raising interest rates on Thursday, he says:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>At 54.0, the latest UK manufacturing PMI is the lowest in three months and is a far cry from the levels seen towards the end of 2017. Weaker domestic demand saw new orders fall and the rate of output growth slip to the lowest in 16 months. Interestingly though, demand from abroad hit a six-month high, implying that firms are still reaping the rewards of better global growth, despite the recent moderation in Europe.</p> <p>But over coming months, life for manufacturers is unlikely to get any easier. The recent escalation in trade tensions is clearly a challenge, but increasingly the biggest headache for businesses is likely to be the threat of a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcno deal\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Brexit. This scenario would likely see huge congestion at ports and disruption to supply chains. While we suspect the probability of the UK leaving without an agreement in March next year is relatively low, an agreement may not come until late in the day.</p> <p>Until then, confidence could begin to fall as uncertainty increases \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the latest PMI suggests the degree of positive sentiment is already at a 21-month low.</p> <p>Having said all of that, today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s slip in the PMI is unlikely to faze Bank of England policymakers ahead of tomorrow\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision. Representing around 10% of output, manufacturing is a relatively small part of the UK growth mix. Importantly, the recent data flow \u00e2\u20ac\u201c particularly in the much larger service sector \u00e2\u20ac\u201c has largely backed up the Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s view that the economy has regained poise after the weak first quarter.</p> <p>For that reason, we think the Bank of England will increase interest rates this week. But the key thing to watch is what the Bank has to say on its next steps. In an ideal world, we think policymakers would like to hike rates again much sooner than markets are currently pricing (towards the end of 2019). But with Brexit uncertainty considerably ramping up, realistically we think the Bank will struggle to raise rates again before the UK leaves the EU next March.</p> <p>After Thursday, we currently don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t anticipate another hike before May 2019.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5b61725ee4b0353e1304fc95\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-08-01T08:43:22.623Z\">9.43am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The prospect of a trade war between the US and China is the biggest worry for UK manufacturers, says Dave Atkinson, UK head of manufacturing at Lloyds Bank Commercial Banking:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The dip in the [PMI] reading comes after an eventful month politically. But if manufacturers are not completely ignoring the Brexit uncertainty, they are nevertheless ploughing on regardless.</p> <p>If anything, the biggest current worry for a sector with so many exporters is the prospect of an all-out trade war between the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s two largest economies. The fear is that UK manufacturers become collateral damage in any tit-for-tat tariffs that are imposed at a time when firms are benefiting from their exposure to the still relatively buoyant global economy.</p> <p>The automotive industry is facing a particularly anxious time grappling as it is with weaker consumer sentiment, ambivalence towards diesel engines and uncertainty about those future trade arrangements. This is a real worry given the number of jobs and exports supported by the sector.</p> <p>But by contrast, UK aerospace enjoyed a good July, boosted by the Farnborough Airshow.

Overall production slowed, whilst new order growth took a leisurely pace, and it was the unbalanced reliance on export orders that kept the sector afloat with domestic clients keeping their distance. </p> <p>This general manufacturing malaise was compounded by a scarcity of essential raw materials and vendor delivery times lengthened at a pace not seen for ten months as supply chains stuttered and stumbled to meet contractual obligations. </p> <p>On the price front, firms raised client prices again in a bid to prevent another sudden increase in their own costs from gnawing away at hard-won profits. But, this strategy may not offer long-term solutions as uncertainty remains enemy no.1. Should operating conditions remain unchanged, this damp squib of a performance may persist and the UK has to look to other sectors to inject some vitality into its economic performance.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2018-08-01T09:23:48.300Z\">at 10.23am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5b616f9fe4b0353e1304fc7b\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-08-01T08:32:02.873Z\">9.32am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">UK manufacturing worse than expected</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s factories have performed slightly worse than forecast in July.</p> <p>IHS Markit/CIPS\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s UK manufacturing purchasing managers index came in at 54 last month, less than the 54.2 expected.

                "bodyText":"A host of manufacturing surveys for July showed a disappointing outcome for the UK, while eurozone growth was also sluggish. Over in the US factory growth slipped in July, while a jobs report was better than expected although it came with a warning on the outlook. The latest UK housing market report from Nationwide showed a 2.5% annual rise in July ahead of an expected Bank of England interest rate rise on Thursday. Overall markets were subdued after reports of an escalation in the trade dispute between the US and China, with President Trump said to be considering raising the existing 10% tariff on $200bn of imports from China to 25%. And following its positive results on Tuesday, Apple shares opened up 4.4%, pushing the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s value close to a record $1tn. On that note it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time to close for the day. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be back tomorrow. US factory growth dipped slightly in July, according to the latest manufacturing survey, partly due to falling exports and supply problems. The IHS Markit US manufacturing PMI came in at 55.3 last month, down from 55.4 and lower than the initial estimate of 55.5. Markit said: US manufacturing firms signalled a strong improvement in operating conditions in July, despite the headline PMI falling to a five-month low. Weaker rises in output and employment were seen in July, while export sales fell for the second month in a row. Meanwhile, companies reported the greatest deterioration in vendor performance since the series began and a faster rate of input cost inflation. That said, business confidence remained strongly positive, and was supported by hopes of further increases in overall new orders. Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit said: The US manufacturing sector continued to expand in July, but shows increasing signs of struggling against headwinds of supply shortages, rising prices and deteriorating exports. The latest survey showed output rising at a rate roughly equivalent to an annualised 1% pace of expansion, which is the weakest since late last year. While a weakening of new export orders for a second successive month suggested foreign demand has waned compared to earlier in the year, the slowdown can be also in part attributed to increased difficulties in sourcing sufficient quantities of inputs. Suppliers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 delivery delays were more widespread than at any time in the survey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s history. With producers often scrambling to buy enough raw materials, suppliers enjoyed greater pricing power. Not surprisingly, with tariffs also kicking in, cost pressures spiked higher again. Some relief for manufacturers came from strong domestic demand, which meant firms were increasingly able to pass higher costs on to customers. Average prices charged for goods consequently rose at the steepest rate for seven years, which is likely to feed through to higher consumer prices in coming months. Apple\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rise has helped lift technology stocks on Wall Street, pushing the Nasdaq Composite 0.39% higher. The Dow Jones Industrial Average - which also includes Apple - is marginally higher, up 0.04% while the S&amp;P 500 has opened 0.17% higher. Following its forecast-beating results and upbeat outlook, Apple shares have jumped 4.4% to $198.4. at the start of the day\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trading, helping support a US market rattled by renewed concerns about a damaging trade war between the US and China. The move means Apple is close to becoming the first company to be valued at $1tn. It would need to hit $203.25 to reach that level. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s IG index on the expected opening for Wall Street: In pre-trading Apple shares are currently up around 4%, not quite enough so far to push it above a $1tn valuation. US private sector employers took on more workers than expected in July, according to a new report, partly due to this year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hefty tax cuts. Ahead of the non-farm payroll numbers on Friday, ADP\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s employment report showed a 219,000 increase in private sector jobs last month, compared to expectations of a 185,000 rise. Ahu Yildirmaz, co-head of the ADP Research Institute, said: The labour market is on a roll with no signs of a slowdown in sight. Nearly every industry posted strong gains and small business hiring picked up. But there could be storm clouds ahead given President Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tariff plans and trade disputes. Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Analytics which helped compile the report, said: The job market is booming, impacted by the deficit-financed tax cuts and increases in government spending. Tariffs have yet to materially impact jobs, but the multinational companies shed jobs last month, signalling the threat. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not all good news for Apple despite its upbeat results and its approach towards a $1tn valuation. Samuel Gibbs reports: Huawei overtook Apple to become the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s second-largest smartphone seller behind Samsung in the second quarter, the first time in seven years that any contender has managed to split the top two. Multiple market analysts said that Huawei\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rise came as the slowdown in China, the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest market for smartphones, eased, with growing market share in Europe. Huawei failed in its recent bid to launch in the US after government action against companies deemed a security threat. Despite Apple being historically weak in the second quarter, analysts described the rise of Huawei as significant. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The importance of Huawei overtaking Apple this quarter cannot be overstated,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Canalys analyst Ben Stanton. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It is the first time in seven years that Samsung and Apple have not held the top two positions.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Our full report is here: The FTSE 100 has taken a turn for the worse in the course of the morning. Trade tensions are uppermost in investors\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 minds following reports that the US plans to raise the tariffs it plans of $200bn worth of imports from China from the original 10% to 25%. So commodity stocks are among the leading fallers on concerns that any slowdown in China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy would hit the sector hard. Sharp falls in the likes of Next, Direct Line and Rio Tinto after their latest updates is also hitting the market, leaving the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s leading index 1% or 77 points lower at 7671. So is this the day Apple\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s market value hits $1tn? All eyes will be on Wall Street\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s open to see how the better than expected results are received. Will investors push Apple higher or decide to take profits? Neil Wilson, chief market analyst at Markets.com, says: Apple shares leapt 4% in after-hours trade and are set to open at a record high just shy of the $200 level. Although it would be a bit of a stretch, a push up to the $1tn mark today is a possibility - it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s only a matter of time before it achieves a valuation of $1tn. If it does, cue some big profit taking but it would be a moment to savour for Tim Cook. We need the share price to break $203 to hit $1tn in market cap \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a little more than $5 above the after-hours level at $197-$198. Rather like the Dow at 25k, you kind of get the feeling investors will conspire to nudge it over the line. If you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re in FAANGs now I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t see why you wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t rotate some equity out of more exposed companies like Facebook and Netflix and opt for relative safety in Apple, whose multiples remain well short of FAANG peers. What might weigh today is broader market fears about trade wars with China as the White House sets out fresh tariff plans on $200bn of Chinese goods. Tim Cook was pretty circumspect on trade and tariffs on the call. Results were very impressive with a beat on revenues and EPS. iPhone sales were a shade weaker than forecast but on a number of important fronts we saw excellent numbers. The FAANGs - Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix and Google-owner Alphabet - and the wider technology sector have been under pressure in recent days after poor results from Facebook and Twitter. But Apple\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s figures could give some badly needed support to the sector. The pound is not getting much help from the prospect of an interest rate rise on Thursday. Against the dollar it is down 0.05% at $1.3117, while against the euro is has edged up 0.05% to \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.1229. The survey is positive about exports but less so about domestic demand, says Helena Sans, head of manufacturing at Barclays: A disappointing result for the manufacturing sector in July with PMI at a three-month low, although still firmly in positive territory. Of more concern is the weakest business confidence score for 21 months, indicating that the industry is desperate for a degree of clarity and progress on the Brexit negotiations and a better understanding of what the final outcome will mean for manufacturers. It looks like a tale of two markets at the moment, with export growth accelerating but domestic demand struggling to keep pace. Aside from the encouraging news for exporters, the only other real bright spot was more job growth, with two full years of consecutive monthly employment increases no mean feat. Following the weaker than expected UK manufacturing report, things are unlikely to improve in the immediate future, says ING Bank economist James Smith. But the downbeat survey is unlikely to discourage the Bank of England from raising interest rates on Thursday, he says: At 54.0, the latest UK manufacturing PMI is the lowest in three months and is a far cry from the levels seen towards the end of 2017. Weaker domestic demand saw new orders fall and the rate of output growth slip to the lowest in 16 months. Interestingly though, demand from abroad hit a six-month high, implying that firms are still reaping the rewards of better global growth, despite the recent moderation in Europe. But over coming months, life for manufacturers is unlikely to get any easier. The recent escalation in trade tensions is clearly a challenge, but increasingly the biggest headache for businesses is likely to be the threat of a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcno deal\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Brexit. This scenario would likely see huge congestion at ports and disruption to supply chains. While we suspect the probability of the UK leaving without an agreement in March next year is relatively low, an agreement may not come until late in the day. Until then, confidence could begin to fall as uncertainty increases \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the latest PMI suggests the degree of positive sentiment is already at a 21-month low. Having said all of that, today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s slip in the PMI is unlikely to faze Bank of England policymakers ahead of tomorrow\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision. Representing around 10% of output, manufacturing is a relatively small part of the UK growth mix. Importantly, the recent data flow \u00e2\u20ac\u201c particularly in the much larger service sector \u00e2\u20ac\u201c has largely backed up the Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s view that the economy has regained poise after the weak first quarter. For that reason, we think the Bank of England will increase interest rates this week. But the key thing to watch is what the Bank has to say on its next steps. In an ideal world, we think policymakers would like to hike rates again much sooner than markets are currently pricing (towards the end of 2019). But with Brexit uncertainty considerably ramping up, realistically we think the Bank will struggle to raise rates again before the UK leaves the EU next March. After Thursday, we currently don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t anticipate another hike before May 2019. The prospect of a trade war between the US and China is the biggest worry for UK manufacturers, says Dave Atkinson, UK head of manufacturing at Lloyds Bank Commercial Banking: The dip in the [PMI] reading comes after an eventful month politically. But if manufacturers are not completely ignoring the Brexit uncertainty, they are nevertheless ploughing on regardless. If anything, the biggest current worry for a sector with so many exporters is the prospect of an all-out trade war between the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s two largest economies. The fear is that UK manufacturers become collateral damage in any tit-for-tat tariffs that are imposed at a time when firms are benefiting from their exposure to the still relatively buoyant global economy. The automotive industry is facing a particularly anxious time grappling as it is with weaker consumer sentiment, ambivalence towards diesel engines and uncertainty about those future trade arrangements. This is a real worry given the number of jobs and exports supported by the sector. But by contrast, UK aerospace enjoyed a good July, boosted by the Farnborough Airshow. Bumper orders for the major aircraft manufacturers will help the small- and medium-sized businesses in their supply chains and the launch of the new Tempest fighter jet has the potential to safeguard thousands of highly-skilled jobs. The weaker than expected figures could give the Bank of England second thoughts if it really is planning to raise UK interest rates on Thursday, suggests IHS Markit director Rob Dobson: The financial markets still seem to have an interest rate increase nailed on for August. However, if the combination of weaker growth and a softening of pipeline cost pressures at manufacturers is mirrored in the larger service sector, the Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision will be far from unanimous and they may even yet find some cause for pause. The figure of 54 for July\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s UK manufacturing PMI is a three month low, albeit that any number over 50 shows the sector is expanding. Markit said: The softer growth patch of the UK manufacturing sector continued at the start of the third quarter. July saw slower rates of expansion in both output and new orders, as weaker growth of new work from domestic sources offset a stronger increase in new export orders. Price pressures also remained elevated as a strong increase in average input costs led to the steepest rise in selling prices since February... July saw the degree of positive sentiment dip to a 21-month low, amid reports of uncertainty regarding both Brexit and the exchange rate. Duncan Brock, group director at the Chartered Institute of Procurement &amp; Supply which co-compiles the survey, said: There was a flatline feel to manufacturing this month, as the sector held its ground, but only just. Overall production slowed, whilst new order growth took a leisurely pace, and it was the unbalanced reliance on export orders that kept the sector afloat with domestic clients keeping their distance. This general manufacturing malaise was compounded by a scarcity of essential raw materials and vendor delivery times lengthened at a pace not seen for ten months as supply chains stuttered and stumbled to meet contractual obligations. On the price front, firms raised client prices again in a bid to prevent another sudden increase in their own costs from gnawing away at hard-won profits. But, this strategy may not offer long-term solutions as uncertainty remains enemy no.1. Should operating conditions remain unchanged, this damp squib of a performance may persist and the UK has to look to other sectors to inject some vitality into its economic performance. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s factories have performed slightly worse than forecast in July. IHS Markit/CIPS\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s UK manufacturing purchasing managers index came in at 54 last month, less than the 54.2 expected. This was lower than the June figure of 54.3, itself revised down from the initial estimate of 54.4. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Markit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s country by country manufacturing PMIs for July: The overall eurozone manufacturing sector was subdued in July, according to IHS Markit, and there could be worse to come. The final purchasing managers index edged up from 54.9 in June to 55.1 as trade tensions and rising prices dented optimism. The final figure was unchanged from the initial estimate, and follows disappointing second quarter eurozone GDP figures released on Tuesday. Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit said: A marginal uptick in the PMI provides little cause for cheer given it is the second weakest number for more than one-and-a-half years. The past two months have seen the most subdued spell of factory output growth since late-2016. Worse may be to come. Even this reduced rate of output growth continued to outpace order book growth, resulting in the smallest rise in order book backlogs for two years. The clear implication is that manufacturers may have to adjust production down in coming months unless demand revives. Clues to the current soft patch lie in the export growth trend, which has deteriorated dramatically since the start of the year across all member states to reach a near-two year low, with France and Austria seeing exports fall into decline in July. The survey responses indicate that the slowdown likely reflects worries about trade wars, tariffs and rising prices, as well as general uncertainty about the economic outlook. Optimism about the future remained at one of the lowest levels seen over the past two years. Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s manufacturing sector recovered from June\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 18 month low last month, albeit more slowly than initial estimates. IHS Markit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s purchasing managers index rose from 55.9 in June to 56.9, lower than the initial reading of 57.3. IHS Markit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economist Sian Jones said: The beginning of the second half of the year brought a faster rise in manufacturing growth among German manufacturers. Following a dip in overall performance in June, the upturn in output and new orders strengthened. That said, the increase in production continued to outpace that of new orders as firms expanded their efforts to clear backlogs. Although slightly weaker than June, employment growth continued to grow sharply, with greater production requirements a key factor behind sustained job creation. Panellists also reported stronger optimism towards future output growth, the most robust since April. Concerns were raised however, with some respondents noting uncertainty surrounding tariffs and further marked rises in input costs as risks to future growth. In turn, pressure on supply chains remained significant as firms continued to comment on bottlenecks at suppliers. France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s factories did better in July than analysts had been expecting. IHS/Markit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s manufacturing purchasing managers index climbed from 52.5 in June to 53.3, compared to an initial reading of 53.1. Output and new orders increased but exports fell back amid global trade tensions. IHS Markit economist Alex Gill said: July saw renewed growth momentum in the French manufacturing sector, with output and new orders rising at sharper rates, moving off their recent lows seen in June. Stronger client demand encouraged firms to take on additional staff, raise their purchasing activity and boosted hopes of further near-term growth. The only slight blip was a first fall in new export orders since September 2016, as global trade tensions hamper foreign demand. With trade tensions on the rise again, investors are in a cautious mood despite Apple\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s better than expected results. The FTSE 100 is down 0.44%, while Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax has edged up 0.21% and France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac has climbed 0.35%. Among the companies reporting, Lloyds Banking Group is leading the FTSE 100 risers, up 1.8% but Next is down nearly 6% despite a good second quarter as it expressed caution about the prospects for August sales. Among the mid-caps in the FTSE 250, BBA Aviation has slumped 15% after saying it expected \u00e2\u20ac\u0153modest growth\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd this year. Outsourcing group Capita is down 9.5% as it said its turnaround plan was on track after a collapse in profits but it would be a long road ahead. Commenting on the Nationwide house price index, Jonathan Hopper, managing director of Garrington Property Finders, said: Two steps forward, one step back \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Nationwide\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s annual rate of price growth has barely shifted from where it was a year ago. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tempting to see such a meandering market as the fruit of a cautious consensus. Instead it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a byproduct of the collision of three conflicting forces; pent-up demand, low supply and patchy confidence. With activity levels slowly picking up, the rising tension is creating some big regional anomalies \u00e2\u20ac\u201c making the national average as misleading as it is insipid. The future course of the market is balanced on a knife edge. With the Bank of England set to notch up interest rates tomorrow, the prospect of more expensive mortgages should jolt some previously hesitant buyers into action. Yet any extra impetus is likely to be immediate but ephemeral. By contrast, the forces holding back the market will get steadily stronger if the UK sleepwalks into a no-deal Brexit. If the prospect of Britain crashing out of the EU continues its shift from long shot to likely, the top end of the market could slip into full retreat as investment buyers go into lockdown. For everyone else, softening prices and better affordability will create buying opportunities \u00e2\u20ac\u201c particularly for the bold and strategic \u00e2\u20ac\u201c in what will become an increasingly fractured market. Signs of strength in the UK housing market. The Press Association reports: Annual house price growth accelerated in July as the average property value hit a new record high of \u00c2\u00a3217,010, according to an index. Across the UK, house prices were up by 2.5% annually in July, compared with a 2% annual increase in June, Nationwide Building Society said. House prices increased by 0.6% month on month in July - the second month of increases in a row following a 0.7% upturn in June. With speculation that the Bank of England base rate could edge up on Thursday from 0.5% to 0.75%, Nationwide said a 0.25 percentage point rise is likely to have only a modest immediate impact on borrowers, many of whom are locked into fixed-rate deals. Robert Gardner, Nationwide\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chief economist, said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Providing the economy does not weaken further, the impact of a further small rise in interest rates on UK households is likely to be modest. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This is partly because only a relatively small proportion of borrowers will be directly impacted by the change. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Most lending on personal loans and credit cards is fixed or tends to be unaffected by movements in the bank rate. Similarly, in recent years, the vast majority of new mortgages have been extended on fixed interest rates.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd But, he continued: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153While the impact for most borrowers is likely to be modest, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s important to note that household budgets have been under pressure for some time because wages have not been rising as fast as the cost of living. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Indeed, in real terms (after adjusting for inflation) wage rates are still at levels prevailing in 2005.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Mr Gardner said that, overall, Nationwide continues to expect house prices to increase by 1% over the course of 2018. Here are IG\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s opening calls for European markets: Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Will Apple become the first company in history to be valued at $1tn? The company reported better than expected results after the market closed on Tuesday, helped by strong sales of the higher-cost iPhone X profits jumped 32%, and its shares rose 4% in the after-market, putting it tantalisingly close to the magic $1tn figure. Jasper Lawler, head of research at London Capital Group, said: Traders breathed a sigh of relief as Apple reported strong earnings after the close, putting a spark back into the Nasdaq... What was there not to like about these numbers? This was the news that the markets had been hoping for; there had been concerns going into this release that the iPhone X numbers just weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t going to stack up, but that wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t the case and Apple has managed to pull it out of the bag again, proving why it should be the first trillion-dollar company. The final 7% lift in the share price required to hit that trillion-dollar level shouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be so tough achieve after a set of figures like that. Here is our report on the Apple numbers: Elsewhere it is another big day for company results, with Lloyds Banking Group reporting a 23% rise in pre-tax profit and Next defying the current retail blues with a 2.8% increase in second quarter full-price sales, helped by the warm weather boosting demand for summer outfits. We will also get the first snapshot of how the manufacturing sector has performed in July, with PMI figures from the UK, Europe and US. China has already reported, with its manufacturing sector growing at the slowest pace in eight months, with exports declining amid trade tensions. The Caixin/Markit PMI fell from 51 in June to 50.8 last month. The UK numbers are also expected to see a slight dip, from 54.4 to 54.2. But any figure above 50 shows expansion, and the decline is unlikely to deter the Bank of England if it really wants to raise interest rates on Thursday. As for Europe, Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets, said: It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also set to be another important day for economic data especially in light of yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s disappointing EU Q2 GDP numbers which came in unexpectedly lower than anticipated. For most of this year we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve been told that the slowdown that we saw in Q1 was going to be temporary, and likely weather related. The weak Q2 French GDP numbers and yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s weaker than expected EU numbers would appear to give the lie to that perception, and more worryingly inflation appears to be showing signs of picking up. This is likely to be a concern for the European Central Bank especially if we see no evidence that Q3 is gearing to pick up the slack, with today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s July manufacturing PMI\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s taking on a much greater importance in terms of looking for a rebound in economic activity after the weaker readings we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve seen so far this year. Early indications aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t particularly encouraging if last week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s flash numbers from Germany and France are any guide though Germany did show some improvement, which should be confirmed at 57.3. France slowed to 53.1, while Spain and Italy are also expected to do the same, coming in at 53.1 and 53 respectively, both lower than their June readings. Much later the US Federal Reserve will announce its latest rate decision, although no change is expected this month, with an increase more likely in September. Markets remain edgy, especially with the latest reports suggesting an escalation in the current trade tensions. The US is said to be considering increasing its 10% tariffs on $200bn worth of Chinese imports to 25%.

But it also changed the company on a fundamental level, turning it from a computer manufacturer into a consumer electronics designer.</p> <p>In January 2007, the company completed this transformation, announcing that it was changing its name from Apple Computer to Apple Inc.

                "bodyText":"And finally, here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our news story on Apple\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meteoric rise: Goodnight. GW Apple has beaten several tech rivals for the crown of America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s first trillion dollar company. At one stage it looked like Amazon could get their first, but it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s currently \u00e2\u20ac\u0153only\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd worth around $880bn. Alphabet, Google\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s parent company, is close behind with a market capitalisation of around $850bn. Facebook, though, dropped firmly out of the running after it slashed profitability forecasts last week. One important aspect about Apple\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s revival since its 1990s slump is that it started perfecting, rather than creating, new product types. Apple wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t first with a smartphone or a digital music player, but it created compelling devices that trumped what had gone before. Our tech writer Alex Hern explains: MP3 players already existed, such as Malda\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Nomad Jukebox, and they were technically better, with larger hard drives, replaceable batteries, and compatibility with both Windows and Mac (the iPod would take another year to come to Windows). What did Apple have to offer? With hindsight, the answer is obvious. The iPod looked cool: it had a sleek aluminium shell half the size of its competitors, and a physical scroll wheel that could zoom through the trademark \u00e2\u20ac\u01531,000 songs in your pocket\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. By 2003 Apple\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s advertising agency, Chiat/Day, had come up with silhouette adverts to promote the iPod. The ads were almost too successful, turning the iPod\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s white earphones into such a marker of desirability that the Metropolitan police blamed them for a 26% rise in street robberies in 2005. The iPod revolutionised Apple\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fortunes, kicking off a five-fold increase in its share price over the following five years, and providing a gateway drug for winning round Windows users to its Mac ecosystem. But it also changed the company on a fundamental level, turning it from a computer manufacturer into a consumer electronics designer. In January 2007, the company completed this transformation, announcing that it was changing its name from Apple Computer to Apple Inc. That same day, it also announced something else: the iPhone. More here: Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a reminder of Apple\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s impressive track record over the years: Apple has seen off plenty of critics on its march towards a trillion dollars, particularly in the 1990s when it was losing the Desktop PC battle to cheaper Windows machines. Bloomberg\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Shira Ovide has some examples: Apple\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rise to become America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s most valuable publicly quoted firm began more than 40 years ago, when Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak began a company that would help kickstart and drive the computer revolution. Today, the firm behind the Macintosh, the iMac, the iPhone and the App Store is now worth more than Exxon Mobil, Procter &amp; Gamble (PG.N) and AT&amp;T put together. Reuters points out how the return of the late Steve Jobs two decades ago was crucial: . One of three founders, Jobs was driven out of Apple in the mid-1980s, only to return a decade later and rescue the computer company from near bankruptcy. He launched the iPhone in 2007, dropping \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Computer\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd from Apple\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s name and super-charging the cellphone industry, catching Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O), Intel Corp (INTC.O), Samsung Electronics (005930.KS) and Nokia off guard. That put Apple on a path to overtake Exxon Mobil in 2011 as the largest U.S. company by market value. The Silicon Valley stalwart\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock has surged more than 50,000 percent since its 1980 initial public offering, dwarfing the S&amp;P 500\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s approximately 2,000-percent increase during the same almost four decades. During that time, Apple evolved from selling Mac personal computers to becoming an architect of the mobile revolution with a cult-like following. More here. Newsflash: Apple has become the first US listed company to be worth one trillion dollars. The technology giant hit a $1 trillion market cap as its shares rallied following strong earnings results earlier this week. Apple shares jumped 3% to hit a session high of $207.05 , enough to reach the magic $1trn figure. More to follow.... Richard Flax, Chief Investment Officer at Moneyfarm, thinks today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rate rise is hard to justify: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The fact the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) voted in favour of a hike itself is notable. At the last meeting in June, the MPC voted by 6-3 to keep rates where they are. If anything, since then the case for rate hikes has gotten weaker not stronger. It doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t require too much cynicism to see the unanimous vote as some sort of message. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The Bank and its governor are in an unenviable position - with a combination of low interest rates, low unemployment / low wage growth, sluggish economic growth, declining inflation and massive policy uncertainty around Brexit. They clearly want to normalise interest rate policy if they can - but the data hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t made it easy to justify.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Reuters agrees... Higher interest rates will eat into the profits of Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s buy-to-let lenders. Paul Haywood-Schiefer of accountancy firm Blick Rothenberg says today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rate rise is a blow to the sector: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153For many people who were getting no return on their capital due to long term low interest rates and decided to invest in buy to let properties this will be another blow.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u0153They wanted to get better returns and for many it was also part of their retirement plans.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd One solution is to push up rents, of course. And one controversial buy-to-let landlord has swiftly passed today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rate rise onto new tenants. Fergus Wilson, who owns hundreds of properties across Ashford and Maidstone in Kent, has announced: Following the interest rate rise I have increased rents in all our properties by \u00c2\u00a350 per month (fifty pounds). It is merely passing onto the tenant the additional mortgage charge. This increase starts immediately. I think this will only apply to new tenants, or when existing tenancies come up for renewal. Wilson was heavily criticised by Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s equality watchdog last year, as we reported: The buy-to-let mogul Fergus Wilson\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ban on \u00e2\u20ac\u0153coloured\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd tenants because they allegedly left curry smells in his properties has been overturned in a court victory for the Equality and Human Rights Commission. At Maidstone county court, the judge, Richard Polden, granted an injunction against the landlord. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This policy clearly amounts to discrimination,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Polden said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I find the policy is unlawful. Such a policy has no place in our society.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Ed Hall, director at law firm Gowling WLG, says today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rate rise could hurt the economy, if it spooks consumers and businesses: Given that a quarter point rise is perceived to have a limited long-term impact on most business, the move would seem to make sense in terms of longer term strategy. However, in a period of increasing political and economic uncertainty, it can be argued that this move could damage confidence in what could be perceived as an already fragile economy.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Charles Hepworth, investment director at GAM, says today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rate hike is a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153punchy move\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, given the uncertainty over Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s exit from the EU: Growth in the economy could hardly be described as above trend so members may have realised that this could be the last chance to move ahead before reaching the final Brexit end state. In any case the Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s response in a few months\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 time could look very different should the Brexit cliff edge slip nearer despite them saying more hikes will be needed. The currency markets aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t totally buying the hawkish message otherwise the pound would be rising, which it most certainly isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Indeed. As you can see, the pound has dropped to its lowest level since 20th July today - not the move you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d expect after a rate hike. UK interest rates won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t rise again until at least March 2019, predicts Dean Turner, UK Economist at UBS Wealth Management. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t expect to see further moves from the Bank ahead of Britain leaving the EU. Monetary policy is unlikely to be the key driver for sterling in the markets in the short term, as the spotlight returns to the Brexit saga. The real surprise is that all nine Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s policymakers voted to raise interest rates today. Before noon, many experts were predicting an 8-1 split, or even 7-2, with the most dovish MPC members pushing to keep rates on hold. Our Larry Elliott suggests the data doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t support such unanimity: Threadneedle Street has been overestimating wage inflation for years, and the former MPC member and labour market expert David Blanchflower says it is still doing so [something Carney rejected earlier] Recent official data has shown growth in total pay falling not rising. The economy, despite bouncing back in the second quarter, is far from booming. Retail sales were weak in June, the housing market is dead and inflation is coming back toward its 2% target more quickly than the Bank expected. In such circumstances, it is strange, even a little troubling, that not one MPC member opposed a rate hike. The inflation report makes it sound as if higher interest rates are a no-brainer. They\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re a lot riskier than the Bank appears to think. Jon Ostler, UK CEO at price comparison site Finder.com, says savers need to be proactive to benefit from today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rate rise. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s particularly good news for savers, who have suffered ultra-low interest rates for the past decade. They can expect a rise to their savings, albeit a small one. Now is a good time to consider switching your banking products, as banks will be reviewing their rates. Make sure you keep an eye on which banks are offering the best interest rates as not all of their products will increase by the BoE\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 25 basis points. Mortgage holders, and other borrowers, face a hit, through, he adds: For example, those paying off the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s average mortgage debt with a variable rate mortgage face paying an extra \u00c2\u00a317-\u00c2\u00a318 per month, which adds up to an extra \u00c2\u00a3200 per year or more than \u00c2\u00a36,000 over the life of a 30-year loan term.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Time for a quick recap. The Bank of England has raised UK interest rates for only the second time since the financial crisis, despite concerns that Brexit could hurt the economy. The Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Monetary Policy Committee voted unanimously to raise borrowing costs to 0.75%, from 0.5%, arguing that a modest increase is needed to keep inflation on target. Governor Mark Carney has defended the move. He told reporters that the economy is in a much healthier place than August 2016, when the BoE cut rates from 0.5% to 0.25%. Carney argued that: UK households were well-prepared for the rise, and that the poorest families would suffer most if the Bank allowed inflation to spike. The Bank was ready for all possibly Brexit outcomes, including Britain crashing out of the EU without a deal Monetary policy needed to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153walk, not run\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to keep inflation on target and the economy growing. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a hint that future rate rises will be modest. Banks might not pass the entire increase onto savers The Bank might actually CUT rates, if Brexit negotiations go badly. The move has received a mixed reception, with business leaders criticising it and debt charities fearing that poor families will be dragged into financial difficulties. There is relief in the City that the Bank didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t back away from pushing the button, having given plenty of hints that rates would rise today. But... Carney\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s cautious words have hit sterling; the pound is still in the red against the dollar, at $1.3050. Balraj Sroya, Sales Trader at Foenix Partners, explains why: Today the Bank of England defied Brexit uncertainty and brought music to the ears of Sterling bulls as the MPC voted unanimously to increase interest rates to 0.75%. Unfortunately, Sterling\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rally higher was halted by the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153unreliable boyfriend\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd stating that the monetary policy needs to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153walk, not run, to stand still\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd as the interest rates\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 natural level rises gradually. And finally, an important but technical question from the Financial Times. Q: does the Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s low estimate of the equilibrium level of interest rates (R*) means that quantitative easing is becoming a standard tool of economy policy, rather than just for emergencies? [explainer: if R* is really between zero and 1% today, as the Bank believes, rates might never get high enough to allow the Bank to start selling off the \u00c2\u00a3435bn of bonds it bought through QE during the crisis to stimulate the economy]. Mark Carney says this is a good question, to which he gives a long answer. The upshot is that Bank still expects to start unwinding QE when rates have risen to 1.5%. So if R* rises towards 2-3%, then this plan would still hold. Upshot: the MPC does not expect to keep holding its QE assets on its balance sheet indefinitely. Back on Brexit, and Mark Carney is defending the Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s approach over the last two years. After the referendum, the BoE decided to take the hit in higher inflation (by cutting rates) rather than pushing unemployment up (by raising rates to strengthen the pound), he says. Q: But wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t it be better to have waited a few months until we know how Brexit will pan out? No, governor Carney replies. We need a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcmodest\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 adjustment to policy now because wages are rising faster than inflation. He then explains that rates could rise, stay on hold, or even be cut depending how UK-EU negotiations play out. There are a wide range of Brexit outcomes, but in many of them interest rates will be at least as high as they are today. We don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t need to keep our powder dry for that. There are certain circumstances where it would be appropriate to either keep rates the same or lower them. If that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the case, that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s what the MPC will do. It would be a mistake to wait, wait, wait until you have perfect certainty, because you never know when that point will arise, he concludes. Q: What do you say to business groups who think this rate rise is a mistake? We have a good sense of the challenges faced by British businesses, Carney replies. The Bank knows that this has been the shallowest investment recovery in decades. But...the overwhelming issue for businesses is the outcome of the Brexit negotiations. They should be confident that we will focus on our responsibilities, keeping inflation on target while ensuring the economy is prepared for whatever the outcome is. Christopher Vecchio of DailyFX says Mark Carney\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s cautious guidance on future rate rises is hitting the pound. On trade wars, Carney says the tariffs imposed by the US, China and Europe on each others imports are \u00e2\u20ac\u0153one of the reasons that global growth is little weaker.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The Bank doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t see a material impact on the UK economy, yet, but it would be hurt by a slump in global confidence and investment. Mark Carney is now giving a long explanation about the equilibrium interest rate in the UK (known as R*). This is the level at which interest rates should be set to ensure the economy stays at an even keel. The Bank has estimated today that R* is zero to 1 percent, more than 2 percentage points below its pre-financial crisis level. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s because UK productivity, fiscal headwinds and economic uncertainty are all pulling R* down. If they improve, R* could move closer to the 2-3% range, Carney explains. Danny Blanchflower has hit back at Carney\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s jibe, pointing out that UK wage growth has slowed recently - and is nowhere near 3% per year today. Our economics editor Larry Elliott goes next. Q: The Bank thinks the natural rate of unemployment is 4.25% (slightly above the current rate of 4.2%), which is why you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve raised interest rates. But some experts disagree; former MPC member professor Danny Blanchflower thinks it could be 3%. Why is he wrong, and you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re right? Where do I begin, mutters Mark Carney (somewhat recklessly), before adding that he has \u00e2\u20ac\u0153great respect\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd for Prof B, but his time on the MPC has passed. Carney then explains that policymakers need to reorientate to new reality. He points out that labour cost growth is rising, and productivity growth remains disappointing, thus the UK needs higher borrowing costs to keep inflation on target. [historical note: Danny Blanchflower called, in vain, for UK interest rate cuts before the financial crisis struck, when the rest of the MPC was more worried about inflation] Q: Will this rate rise be passed onto savers, and what will the Bank do to help on this? Mark Carney says that savers have suffered over the course of the last decade from the absolutely necessary low interest rates. But he then suggests that banks might not pass today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rate rise on in full. H explains that when rates hit record lows after the crisis, the spread between bank lending and borrowing rates were compressed. (That ate into bank profitability, so they will want to repair that by raising borrowing costs more than saving rates). As rates move up, one should expect more of them to be passed along, Carney adds. Deputy governor Dave Ramsden weighs in, saying: Historically you never get full pass-though of interest rate changes. Q: Surely poorest households are going to suffer from this rate rise? Mark Carney rebuts this, arguing that the Bank has a responsibility to keep inflation under control. The households that are most affected by high or volatile inflation, and most likely to be out of work, unfortunately, are poorer households. The best thing we can do is keep inflation sustainably on target, and keep the economy on track, he adds. Ouch! Sterling has just dropped against the US dollar, and is now down a whole cent at $1.303. The selloff began as Mark Carney explains that monetary policy needs to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153walk not run to stand still\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, as the natural level of interest rates slowly rises. That looks like a hint that borrowing costs will not rise sharply in the next couple of years. Onto questions: Q: Are households ready for today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s interest rate rise, particularly the poorest? Governor Carney says the Bank of England has been saying for a while that interest rates will go up, at a modest rate. That \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcforward guidance\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 was meant to give households and businesses clarity. And it worked, Carney says, with three-quarters of households expecting interest rate to go up over the next year. The important thing to recognise is that UK households have worked hard over the last decade to get into a better financial position, they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve paid down debt and put themselves in a better position to service their debts. It would take another 100 basis point increase (to 1.75%) to bring the UK debt servicing burden back to the historic average. There is a lot more capacity for UK households to service their debts, Carney concludes. He also cited new \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcmortgage affordability\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 tests that are meant to prevent reckless borrowing. Mark Carney insists that the Bank of England is well prepared for a wide range of Brexit outcomes. The banking system has enough money to keep lending through a cliff-edge Brexit, however unlikely that will be, the governor says. We are working with the Treasury and the European Central Bank to address risks that the banks can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t solve themselves, he adds. Onto Brexit. Mark Carney says that talks between the UK and the EU are at a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153critical period\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Households have been resilient but not indifferent to Brexit uncertainty, he adds, but there are signs that business confidence is softening again. The Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s forecasts are based on a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcrelatively smooth\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd transition period, the governor points out (implying it could take action if we end up with a No-Deal Brexit). Carney signals that further interest rate rises will be needed. If interest rates stay at 0.75%, then inflation will be over the Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 2% target over the next three years, he explains. Mark Carney says UK exporters are in \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a sweet spot\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd with sterling down 17% compared to its pre-Brexit levels. He adds that the UK labour market is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153strong\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, with signs that earnings growth will accelerate later this year. Bank of England governor Mark Carney is giving a press conference now. Carney begins by referencing a famous quote from Harold Wilson, saying: If a week is a long time in politics, then two years is an eternity in monetary policy. He reminds us that the Bank cut borrowing costs to a record low of 0.25%, after the Brexit vote. Back in 2016, there was substantial spare capacity in the economy, business confidence was its lowest since the financial crisis, and inflation was due to overshoot its target \u00e2\u20ac\u0153entirely\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd due to Brexit fears which had driven the pound down. Now, though, the economy is strong enough to justify an interest rate rise to 0.75%. Ian Stewart, chief economist at Deloitte, says Mark Carney and colleagues have taken a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153bold move\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd by raising borrowing costs today. By early 2019, we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll know if they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re right, he adds. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The Bank has so clearly telegraphed this rate rise that markets would have been shocked had rates been left on hold. The unanimity of the decision probably reflects the view that the UK is, quite simply, running out of spare capacity. But sub-trend growth and a cloudy outlook hardly make a compelling case for a higher UK rates. In six months\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 time this decision will look either prescient or premature. Either way it is bold move.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Oof! Suren Thiru, Head of Economics at the British Chambers of Commerce (BCC), says the Bank of England was wrong to raise interest rates today: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The decision to raise interest rates, while expected, looks ill-judged against a backdrop of a sluggish economy. While a quarter point rise may have a limited long-term financial impact on most businesses, it risks undermining confidence at a time of significant political and economic uncertainty. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The increase reinforces a concerning aspect of the Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s recent approach to monetary policy, which appears to be overly focused on reinforcing an idealised direction for rates, rather than on economic reality \u00e2\u20ac\u201c an approach that unnecessarily risks UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s growth prospects. The central bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s assumption that the economy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s speed limit has slowed is unduly pessimistic, as sustained action to fix the fundamentals at home, from closing the skills gap to greater infrastructure investment, would materially help lift the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s growth potential. Thiru hopes the Bank won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t raise borrowing costs again anytime soon: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The MPC must carefully consider what happens next. The most preferential option would be for a sustained period of monetary stability amid the current economic and political uncertainty.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Simon Underwood, business recovery partner at accountancy firm, Menzies LLP, fears that this rate rise will hurt businesses - especially those reliant on consumer spending. He says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The MPC may have been swayed by the summer heatwave and England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s success in the World Cup, which have had a positive impact on consumer behaviour, boosting retail sales temporarily. However, it is unlikely this positive sentiment will be maintained and today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision to increase rates will impact consumer spending ahead of the critical final quarter. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153For businesses serving consumers in the retail and hospitality &amp; leisure sectors, today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision will be very unwelcome news and we should expect more turmoil on the high street in the short to medium term.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd My colleague Richard Partington reports from the Bank of England: The Bank of England has raised interest rates above the emergency level introduced straight after the financial crisis, despite mounting fears over Britain crashing out of the EU without a deal. Signalling the gradual return of higher borrowing costs, Threadneedle Street raised interest rates to 0.75% from 0.5% \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the level they were dropped to in March 2009 as the economy lurched through the last recession. The Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s monetary policy committee judged the economy could withstand higher interest rates, which it believes are required to curb persistently high inflation above its 2% target set by the government. An extra 0.25% interest will add \u00c2\u00a312 a month to a \u00c2\u00a3100,000 repayment mortgage and \u00c2\u00a325 on a \u00c2\u00a3200,000 loan. However, nearly 70% of homebuyers now have fixed rate mortgages so will be unaffected. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our Q&amp;A on how higher UK interest rates will affect you: Although today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s interest rate rise is modest, it will hurt families who are already forced to borrow to pay for the essentials. Phil Andrew, chief executive at StepChange Debt Charity, says politicians need to provide more help to theses households: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Whilst a rise in interest rates might be right for the wider economy, from a consumer debt perspective many households are walking a precarious budget tightrope, as their incomes don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t stretch to cover the basics each month. These are the households that a rate rise will affect most. Policymakers mustn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t lose sight of what a rate rise means for real people on a tight budget. The fact that the wider economy can cope doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t always mean individual households can. Government and policymakers need to take parallel steps to ensure support is there for those who are negatively affected, especially if more rate rises are coming.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd I mentioned earlier this morning that Mark Carney was known as the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcunreliable boyfriend\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 for failing to stick to his promises. Calum Bennie, savings specialist at Scottish Friendly, thinks the governor has turned over a new leaf by raising rates today: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rate rise means that Mark Carney has probably shaken off his tag of being the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcunreliable boyfriend\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 for good. While the decision indicates the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy is picking up steam, it also means higher borrowing costs, so households must be even more prudent to absorb the additional cost. The move is good news for savers but still cash account rates are unlikely to beat inflation, so stocks and shares Isas remain better for those looking to grow their savings long-term.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not much reaction in the financial markets to the rate hike - which figures, as it was widely expected. The pound has clawed back some of its losses, but is still slightly lower against the US dollar today at $1.31. Shares are still being pummelled by those trade war fears, leaving the FTSE 100 down 93 points or 1.2%. The Bank of England has hinted that it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s in no rush to raise interest rates again in the coming months. It say that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153any future increases in Bank Rate are likely to be at a gradual pace and to a limited extent.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The Bank of England also has also warned that Brexit could damage the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economic recovery: The MPC continues to recognise that the economic outlook could be influenced significantly by the response of households, businesses and financial markets to developments related to the process of EU withdrawal. The Bank of England says it is raising interest rates because the economy has recovered from its slowdown during last snowy winter. The minutes of the Monetary Policy Committee\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meeting says: Recent data appear to confirm that the dip in output in the first quarter was temporary, with momentum recovering in the second quarter. The labour market has continued to tighten and unit labour cost growth has firmed. The MPC continues to judge that the UK economy currently has a very limited degree of slack. Unemployment is low and is projected to fall a little further. The BoE also points out that prices are rising faster than its target (2%), so it is raising borrowing costs to squeeze inflation. CPI inflation was 2.4% in June, pushed above the 2% target by external cost pressures resulting from the effects of sterling\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s past depreciation and higher energy prices. The contribution of external pressures is projected to ease over the forecast period while the contribution of domestic cost pressures is expected to rise. Every member of the Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s nine-strong monetary policy committee voted to raise interest rates. NEWSFLASH: The Bank of England has voted to raise UK interest rates to their highest level in almost a decade. The BoE is raising Bank rate to 0.75%, from 0.5%. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the highest level since March 2009, and only the second rise since the financial crisis struck a decade ago. More to follow! An interest rate rise would obviously be a blow to borrowers, as it would push up the cost of repaying debts. This chart from Resolution Foundation shows how a rise to 0.75% would force a small number of mortgage owners to \u00e2\u20ac\u02dctake action\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 in some way: Back in June, the Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s MPC was split six-three -- with a trio of policymakers voting to raise interest rates. Danielle Haralambous, UK Analyst at the Economist Intelligence Unit, predicts that the majority will vote to hike today, but it won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be a 9:0 win for the hawks. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We expect the MPC to raise the policy rate to 0.75% today, although it is unlikely to be a unanimous vote. Some of the economic data has softened in recent months, notably core inflation and wage growth, which may prevent some MPC members from changing their vote in favour of higher interest rates. Our economics correspondent, Richard Partington, explains why the Bank of England will (probably) raise borrowing costs today: Inflation has remained stubbornly above the 2% target set for the Bank by the government, after having risen sharply straight after the EU referendum result. Some rate setters on the MPC, including the Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chief economist, Andy Haldane, also believe wage growth is just around the corner for workers, amid the lowest levels of unemployment since the mid 1970s, a factor that could help boost workers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 bargaining power for higher pay. The summer heatwave, royal wedding and England progressing to the semi-final of the World Cup helped boost the economy, triggering stronger retail sales in April and May before they unexpectedly fell back in June. The Office for National Statistics found that the warmer weather helped the economy rebound from a slowdown earlier this year after heavy snowfall from the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153beast from the east\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. More here: Tension is rising in the City, with around 30 minutes to wait until the Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s interest rate decision. Traders broadly expect borrowing costs to rise at noon today, to a nine-year high of 0.75%. But this isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t giving the pound any love. Sterling is still bobbing at a two-week low against the dollar, with some investors speculating that the Bank could dampen expectations of further interest rate rises any time soon. John Goldie, FX Strategist at Argentex, explains: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The Bank of England are firmly expected to raise rates this lunch time, only the second hike since 2007. However, most commentators are expecting a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153dovish\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd hike with perhaps some dissenters within the committee (one or two may vote to keep rates on hold still) and/or the statements to play down further hiking expectations in the near term. Plus, you can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t discount the possibility that the Bank sits on its hands again. But that would badly hurt its credibility, given its recent guidance that a rate rise is close. Sue Kershaw, managing director of major project advisory at KPMG, says Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s builders benefitted from the hot summer, but warns that Brexit could derail the recovery seen last month. She writes: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Seeing housebuilding come back to good health is hugely positive. As the longstanding driver of activity, the weakening demand we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d seen in recent months did cause some concern and raised questions as to whether residential construction had peaked and was heading for a steady decline. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153But supply chain and cost pressures still remain a cause for concern. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re seeing input costs continue to creep up and the outcome of Brexit negotiations is still far from clear. Those with infrastructure arms will also be concerned about the sluggish-looking civil engineering market, traditionally quite a reliable source of activity.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Phil Harris, Director at BLP Insurance, fears that the collapse of the merger between shopping centre groups Hammerson and Intu could hurt construction. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153July was another strong month for commercial activity but the sector remains vulnerable to volatility. British retailers continue to close shops at a pace and the full impact of shopping centre developer, Hammerson\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s failed takeover of rival Intu may have yet to be fully felt. With many predicting the closure of more Hammerson sites, growth in July may prove a false dawn.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Brendan Sharkey, head of construction and real estate at accountancy firm MHA MacIntyre Hudson, points out that Carillion\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shock collapse in January has caused less damage than feared. However, a hard Brexit might not be shaken off as easily: Construction has been relatively slow to wake up to the dangers posed by Brexit. Given the industry doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t depend on exports, the potential pitfalls of a no-deal Brexit have perhaps been easier to overlook. Yet construction does depend on the import of raw materials, and crucially on the free movement of labour. Over the next few months we will see more focus on contingency planning and demand for additional information and support from the government. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The consequences of Carillion\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s collapse were over-hyped but only a very foolhardy captain of industry can assume the same will be true about the consequences of a no-deal Brexit.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Newsflash: China has hit back at America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s threats to impose steep tariffs on its goods (see earlier post). Beijing\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s commerce ministry has told reporters it is fully prepared to fight back, if America delivers on Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s threat to impose 25% tariffs. This is driving financial markets deeper into the red. The FTSE 100 is now down 80 points, with mining stocks leading the selloff. Trivia corner: UK interest rate have never been pegged at 0.75%, since the Bank of England was established in 1694. Back in July 2007, the BoE raised interest rates to 5.75% just as the credit crunch began. It was began cutting as the financial crisis kicked in, including a monster Bank Rate cut from 4.5% to 3% in November 2008. In March 2009 it halved borrowing costs to 0.5%, where they remained until the Brexit vote prompted a cut to 0.25%, which was reversed in November 2017. The pick-up in building activity in July will reassure the Bank of England, as it suggest the construction sector could handle higher borrowing costs. However, yesterday we heard that manufacturing growth slowed a little last month, so it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a mixed picture. The opposition Labour party is concerned that consumers will be hurt by higher borrowing costs. John McDonnell MP, Labour\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Shadow Chancellor, has warned that higher interest rates will push more people into debt: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153With wages still below 2010 levels and the gap between people\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s income and outgoings at record levels, the concern must be that a pattern of interest rate rises will push more families into higher levels of debt. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The Government needs to end its counterproductive austerity programme and raise people\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s incomes.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the key points from today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s survey of purchasing managers at UK construction firms: Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s builders achieved an \u00e2\u20ac\u0153impressive turnaround\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in July, says Tim Moore, Associate Director at IHS Markit. He sees several signs that the construction sector has strengthened this summer: New business volumes expanded at the strongest rate since May 2017, while workforce numbers increased to the greatest extent for just over two- and-a-half years. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153House building was the bright spot for construction growth in July, alongside a stronger upturn in commercial development projects. Residential activity and commercial work both increased at the sharpest pace since December 2015, which contrasted with another subdued month for civil engineering. Newsflash: Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s construction sector has recorded its fastest growth in 14 months. Data firm Markit reports that builders picked up pace in July, led by a surge in housebuilding. This pushed Markit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s construction PMI, which measures growth in the sector, up to 55.8 from 53.1. Anything over 50 shows growth, and this is the highest reading since May 2017. Housebuilders reported the strongest pick-up in growth since the end of 2015. More to follow.... Stock markets around the globe are sliding today, thanks to the threat of a US-China trade war. Investors have been spooked by the news that the Trump administration is considering a 25% tariff on $200bn of Chinese imports - previously it had been planning a 10% levy. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the latest shot in an increasingly bitter and protracted trade spat between Washington and Beijing. CNN explains: The United States has already slapped 25% tariffs on Chinese goods worth $34 billion to punish Beijing for what it says are its unfair trade practices, such as forcing American companies to hand over valuable technology. China immediately responded with equal measures. In the latest step, President Donald Trump has directed US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer to consider increasing the proposed tariff level on fruit and vegetables, handbags, refrigerators, and more. The trade office has extended its previous deadline of Aug. 30 to allow the public more time to comment on the new plan. Those comments are now due on September 5. In London the FTSE 100 has shed 32 points, or 0.4%, to 7620, its lowest level in over two weeks. There are heavier falls across Europe, with Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s DAX shedding 1.3%. Over in Asia, the Chinese markets have tumbled by around 2%. Other markets also in the red as traders fear an escalating trade dispute will hurt growth and exports across the region. Kit Juckes of French bank Soci\u00c3\u00a9t\u00c3\u00a9 G\u00c3\u00a9n\u00c3\u00a9rale says the Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s interest rate decision is the main event of the day: Bloomberg polled 58 forecasts...10 expect no change, and 48 expect a 25 basis point hike (including us). Sterling meanwhile, continues to bump along the bottom of its historic trade-weighted range. There isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t nearly enough good news in a much-anticipated rate hike to propel it higher, but the downside is limited. An interest rate rise today would be risky, argues our economics editor Larry Elliott. He points out that many UK households are struggling, meaning incomes are lagging spending for the first time in three decades. Households are not borrowing because they are brimful of confidence. In many cases they are borrowing to make ends meet. The MPC knows this and will go out if its way to reassure consumers and businesses that any further policy tightening will be both modest and gradual. Thursday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rate rise is supposed to prevent wage inflation from taking off, underpin sterling and boost the Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s credibility without harming growth. The next eight months will see Brexit negotiations come to a climax and the inevitable period of uncertainty means this is the MPC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s last opportunity to raise rates for some time. Yet the fact remains that this is an ill-timed and risky venture, not least for the millions overburdened with debt. The pound will tumble if the Bank of England leaves interest rates on hold today, says Miles Eakers of global payments, FX and Treasury management firm Centtrip: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153A hawkish hike will boost the Pound but only for the short term. That said, Mark Carney may catch market participants off-guard again and not increase rates, which will weaken the Pound substantially and could fall as low as its yearly nadir of $1.2956 or even below. Even if the BoE does hike, the Brexit negotiations are still under way, keeping the Pound under pressure for the foreseeable future.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The pound is dropping this morning, as the City braces for the Bank of England interest rate decision at noon. Sterling has lost half a cent against the US dollar to $1.3068, its lowest in nearly two weeks. Normally you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d expect a currency to rally when interest rates go up. But there may be some anxiety over whether the Bank will actually do the deed today. Traders may also be anticipating a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcdovish hike\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 - the BoE could raise borrowing costs to 0.75%, but hint that the next rise is a long way away. This chart shows how sterling has struggled, even as an August rate hike looked more likely. Laith Khalaf, senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, suspects uncertainty over Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s exit from the EU is hurting the pound: \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcThursday could be a hugely symbolic day if the Bank of England decides to raise interest rates above 0.5% for the first time since the financial crisis. However it doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t actually change too much on the ground. Markets are already expecting a rise, and from here on in, further hikes are going to be few and far between because UK economic growth is so fragile. We could see some reaction from sterling though, which has remained resolutely weak against the dollar, despite rising expectations of a rate rise. That probably reflects the fact that economic data hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t been resoundingly positive in the lead up to this interest rate decision, plus of course the prospect of a no-deal Brexit has raised its head in recent weeks. He also points out that rates could yet be cut, if the economy falters. Even though rates are very low and will remain so for the foreseeable future, they can still move down if there is an economic shock to the system. Few people thought rates would ever be cut from 0.5%, but that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s exactly what happened following the EU referendum result. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. With Love Island finally off our screens, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time for the nation\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s favourite unreliable boyfriend to show if he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s mended his ways, or is as fickle as ever. The Bank of England will announce today whether UK interest rates are going up, for only the second time in a decade. The City widely expects a hike, after governor Mark Carney declared last month that the economy seems to have recovered from its slowdown at the start of 2018. The City is pricing a 91% chance of an interest rate rise today. That would take borrowing costs up to 0.75% today -- their highest level since March 2009 (but still low in historic terms). But traders are edgy. Carney has a long track record of capriciousness \u00e2\u20ac\u201c promising that a rate hike is imminent only to back away when the big day arrives. So there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a possibility that the Bank will shy away from pressing that rate hike button today. The decision is unlikely to be unanimous, as some monetary policy committee members are concerned that the economy may not be strong enough to handle higher borrowing costs. Kathleen Brooks of Capital Index explains: The market is currently expecting an 8-1 split in favour of a hike, with Sir Jon Cunliffe the only member expected to dissent and vote against a hike. However, if we get more MPC members voting against a hike then sterling could come under pressure, as it would suggest a future dovish stance by the BOE. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s four years since Labour MP Pat McFadden gave Carney his \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcunreliable boyfriend\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 tag, but it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not a title the governor appreciates. He would argue that businesses and households have understood his message -- that interest rates will rise at a modest pace as the recovery allows. Also coming up Data firm Markit will report how Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s construction sector performed last month. Economists predict that growth slowed, as the bounceback after the winter freeze fades. Trade war fears are weighing on the markets again. There are reports that Donald Trump is considering slapping a 25% tariff on Chinese imports into the US, which would have a hefty impact on world trade.

Facebook, shaken by Cambridge Analytica and the election interference scandal, decided to slash its profits in half in order to fund a response: 50,000 new moderators, a substantial investment into its trust and safety engineering, and a commitment to carry on doing the same for at least another year. Wall Street, predictably, hated it, but it was the right thing to do. A weaker leader could have been toppled for doing it, or might never have tried in the first place. Yes, Zuckerberg led the company into this swamp, but maybe he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s right that he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the only one who can get it back out.</p> <p>However, there are storm clouds on the horizon as well.

Facebook believes it won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be that long before the majority of content across its four platforms is shared as stories, the format it cloned from Snapchat two years ago, but it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s struggling to achieve advertiser buy-in.</p> <h2>Alphabet</h2> <p>Google\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s parent company smashed Wall Street\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s profit expectations, sending its <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/jul/23/google-alphabet-profits-5bn-fine-shares-surge\">shares soaring to a record high</a>.

Yes, the EU\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fine over Google\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Android monopoly isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t good for the company, and it was large enough to hit profits directly \u00e2\u20ac\u201c if it weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t for the $2.7bn penalty, Alphabet would have actually seen profits grow this quarter \u00e2\u20ac\u201c but the most significant wrongs that Google was accused of are largely in the past, and it is unlikely to feel too constrained going forward.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the search business prints money.

The engine of Apple\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s business, the iPhone, generated 60% of the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s profits, and it shows no sign of letting up.</p> <p>The iPhone X has been a resounding success, proving the hypothesis that millions of people will pay whatever Apple asks for the best phone on the planet. The average selling price of an iPhone is now more than $700. More promisingly still, that has held up in the second quarter, usually the time when sales fall off as savvy customers hold on for the inevitable upgrade in September.</p> <p>But while the iPhone provides the reliable profit, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not the growth opportunity.

But whether he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a responsible boss or an unpredictable tech genius, Musk still has an uphill struggle on his hands, turning Tesla from a niche maker of expensive cars for the Silicon Valley set into a mass-market manufacturer of electric cars that can compete on equal terms with the likes of BMW and Nissan.</p> <p>Tesla is finally producing its self-imposed quota of 5,000 of its mass-market Model 3s a week, but to do so it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s had to shift production to an external \u00e2\u20ac\u0153tent\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, and take a record $700m loss for the quarter. And simply matching its legacy competitors on one mass-market vehicle isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t enough \u00e2\u20ac\u201c to justify its sky-high valuation (Tesla\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock-market value is roughly the same as BMW\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s), it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll have to deliver on at least one of its moonshots: self-driving cars, a radically redesigned charging infrastructure, or the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s first commercially feasible electric truck.</p> <h2>Twitter</h2> <p>Twitter lost more than a fifth of its value in two days, despite reporting a record profit, because investors were worried about hugely disappointing forecasts for user numbers.

These days, its focus is on original serialised programming, which changes the way to think about its content costs: they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re no longer a recurring expense eating into the margin, but a long-term investment. And, as analyst Ben Thompson notes, the spending in effect works towards customer acquisition: the more content on Netflix, the more reason there is to join the site. Which is why, when subscriber growth slows, the whole thing looks unstable. The smallest of the Faangs hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t achieved the escape velocity of its peers, and a dip could always turn into a death dive.</p> <h2>Spotify</h2> <p>In only its second financial report since flotation, the music streaming service reported an 8 million <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/jul/26/spotify-beats-expectations-by-reaching-83m-subscribers\">rise in the number of paid subscribers, to 83 million</a> during the second quarter. Spotify has yet to record a profit, but the increase suggests it is still staving off competition from deep-pocketed rivals such as Amazon and Apple for music streaming customers.

But everyone knows it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s eventually going to be a winner-takes-all battle. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s because, unlike video, there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s little reason to have subscriptions to multiple streaming services, and strong economies of scale. So Spotify\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock price is essentially a representation of one simple question: will it win, or will Apple Music? In Spotify\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s favour is its large and growing free service, which brings in substantial ad revenue and is a crucial pipeline for new users \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and the Android market, where it lacks a strong competitor. Working against it: a competitor with much deeper pockets.</p>",
                "bodyText":"It has been a tumultuous couple of weeks for America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s high-flying technology stocks, even by their own unique standards. Their shares have been soaring since the start of the year, despite being buffeted by trade war fears as President Trump talked of limiting Chinese investments in the US and restricting American technology imports to China. But now there are signs that cracks may be starting to appear in some of the biggest firms in the sector. Facebook suffered the biggest ever one-day drop in a company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s market value \u00e2\u20ac\u201c losing more than \u00c2\u00a390bn \u00e2\u20ac\u201c after its growth slowed in the wake of the Cambridge Analytica scandal. Twitter lost 20%, or $5bn, as it reported a surprise fall in active monthly users, while streaming service Netflix missed its targets for subscriber numbers. On the other hand, electric car specialist Tesla managed to head in the right direction despite making a $717m second-quarter loss, as its controversial chief executive, Elon Musk, regained investor confidence after apologising for previous outbursts. That was in marked contrast to a conference call for the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s previous set of figures, when he accused a Wall Street analyst of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153boring bonehead questions\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and ignored queries from investors. But the pick of the bunch remains Apple, which beat Amazon and Google to reach the landmark $1 trillion valuation on Thursday. Despite the recent rollercoaster ride, the five key tech stocks, known as the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Faangs\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix, and Alphabet-owned Google \u00e2\u20ac\u201c have reached breathtaking heights. The total value of the five companies amounts to a staggering 19% of total US GDP. But their surge in value has prompted fears of a re-run of the dotcom boom of the late 1990s, when technology businesses dominated the stock market before coming crashing to earth. Russ Mould at investment group AJ Bell says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153That [19%] compares to the 15.5% of US GDP reached by the five biggest companies by value at the US stock market\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s peak in the fourth quarter of 1999, just before the technology, media and telecoms bubble burst and that particular mania came to grief.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Here we look at where the big names stand \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and where they could go from here. Facebook The social network\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock market value plunged by more than \u00c2\u00a390bn \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the largest one-day drop in corporate history \u00e2\u20ac\u201c as it felt the effect of the Cambridge Analytica data scandal. The group made more than $5bn (\u00c2\u00a33.8bn) profit in the last three months \u00e2\u20ac\u201c slightly ahead of expectations \u00e2\u20ac\u201c but some 3 million Europeans quit the website amid concerns about what Facebook does with personal data. Finance chief David Wehner warned revenue growth was likely to slow, while costs soared by 50% to $7.4bn as the company spent vast sums on improving data security. Verdict For all the bluster around the largest one-day fall in history, the reasons behind it make the case for a founder-leader with absolute control better than anything else Mark Zuckerberg has done in the past decade. Facebook, shaken by Cambridge Analytica and the election interference scandal, decided to slash its profits in half in order to fund a response: 50,000 new moderators, a substantial investment into its trust and safety engineering, and a commitment to carry on doing the same for at least another year. Wall Street, predictably, hated it, but it was the right thing to do. A weaker leader could have been toppled for doing it, or might never have tried in the first place. Yes, Zuckerberg led the company into this swamp, but maybe he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s right that he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the only one who can get it back out. However, there are storm clouds on the horizon as well. In the future, look out for the shift from \u00e2\u20ac\u0153feeds\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to self-deleting \u00e2\u20ac\u0153stories\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, which could be as momentous as its shift from desktop to mobile. Facebook believes it won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be that long before the majority of content across its four platforms is shared as stories, the format it cloned from Snapchat two years ago, but it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s struggling to achieve advertiser buy-in. Alphabet Google\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s parent company smashed Wall Street\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s profit expectations, sending its shares soaring to a record high. Net profit was actually lower than last year \u00e2\u20ac\u201c down from $4.9bn to $3.5bn \u00e2\u20ac\u201c but that included a $2.7bn fine levied on Google by the European commission for anti-competitive behaviour. The company is set to appeal, so could still get its money back. The business raked in more than $26bn of revenue in the three-month period \u00e2\u20ac\u201c well up on the $21bn recorded in the same period last year. Verdict Even though the general tech sell-off hit Google\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s parent company, and profits fell year-on-year, the future looks fairly bright for Alphabet. Yes, the EU\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fine over Google\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Android monopoly isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t good for the company, and it was large enough to hit profits directly \u00e2\u20ac\u201c if it weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t for the $2.7bn penalty, Alphabet would have actually seen profits grow this quarter \u00e2\u20ac\u201c but the most significant wrongs that Google was accused of are largely in the past, and it is unlikely to feel too constrained going forward. Meanwhile, the search business prints money. Almost every open-ended query on the web starts at Google, and that makes its advertising revenues enormous and secure. YouTube could be a shining gem \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and certainly seems to be if you speak to anyone under 20, for whom it, not Netflix, is the new TV \u00e2\u20ac\u201c but it will have problems down the line over the same dodgy content now causing such pain for Facebook. Amazon The globe-spanning online retailer announced record quarterly profits of $2.5bn \u00e2\u20ac\u201c double the level Wall Street experts had expected \u00e2\u20ac\u201c sending the share price to an all-time high. Advertising and cloud computing were the big growth areas. Verdict Remember when it just sold books? Well, Amazon is the AWS (Amazon Web Services) company now. The record profits of the cloud-computing division led to an astonishing 1,286% year-on-year growth in overall profits, thanks to the extremely high margins that Amazon makes on selling computing time. It now stretches from its own consumer retail business to the Marketplace platform \u00e2\u20ac\u201c where it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s building a shopping mall of internet stores \u00e2\u20ac\u201c to AWS, which provides the backbone to the internet. And don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t forget its bets on the future, particularly with Echo and Alexa. Voice control may yet prove to be a dead-end in the annals of computing, but if not, Amazon could well own the iPhone of the 2020s. Apple Apple made history on Thursday, becoming the first public company to be valued at $1 trillion, reaching the landmark 42 years after the company was founded and two decades after it almost went bust. Financial results for the most recent three months, filed earlier in the week, showed revenues topped $53bn. The company shipped more than 41m phones \u00e2\u20ac\u201c slightly less than anticipated \u00e2\u20ac\u201c but because the expensive iPhone X has proved popular, the average price consumers paid for them went up. Verdict Making nice things and selling them for a lot of money to tens of millions of people is a very good business to be in. The engine of Apple\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s business, the iPhone, generated 60% of the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s profits, and it shows no sign of letting up. The iPhone X has been a resounding success, proving the hypothesis that millions of people will pay whatever Apple asks for the best phone on the planet. The average selling price of an iPhone is now more than $700. More promisingly still, that has held up in the second quarter, usually the time when sales fall off as savvy customers hold on for the inevitable upgrade in September. But while the iPhone provides the reliable profit, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not the growth opportunity. That lies in the two lines at the bottom of the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s report: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153services\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and \u00e2\u20ac\u0153other products\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Services \u00e2\u20ac\u201c which include the App Store, Apple Pay and income from Apple Music \u00e2\u20ac\u201c have been growing rapidly since the company stopped viewing them just as a tool for boosting phone sales and started seeing them as a business. Apple invented the idea of the App Store and is taking a 30% cut on everything in it. Tesla Tesla has had a difficult few months, with increasing concerns about the firm\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s financial sustainability and outbursts from its billionaire founder Elon Musk that have seen him labelled the Trump of Tech. On Wednesday the electric-car maker reported a record $717m loss for the last three months, but the shares climbed because revenue hit $4bn and Musk promised profitability later this year. He said there had been a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153mind-blowing leap forward\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in the number of cars rolling off the lines. Verdict Elon Musk\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s responsible-boss routine on Tesla\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s earnings call appeared to restore investor confidence following his disastrous performance three months ago, when he rejected \u00e2\u20ac\u0153boring bonehead questions\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd from Wall Street analysts concerned about Tesla\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fundamentals. But whether he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a responsible boss or an unpredictable tech genius, Musk still has an uphill struggle on his hands, turning Tesla from a niche maker of expensive cars for the Silicon Valley set into a mass-market manufacturer of electric cars that can compete on equal terms with the likes of BMW and Nissan. Tesla is finally producing its self-imposed quota of 5,000 of its mass-market Model 3s a week, but to do so it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s had to shift production to an external \u00e2\u20ac\u0153tent\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, and take a record $700m loss for the quarter. And simply matching its legacy competitors on one mass-market vehicle isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t enough \u00e2\u20ac\u201c to justify its sky-high valuation (Tesla\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock-market value is roughly the same as BMW\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s), it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll have to deliver on at least one of its moonshots: self-driving cars, a radically redesigned charging infrastructure, or the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s first commercially feasible electric truck. Twitter Twitter lost more than a fifth of its value in two days, despite reporting a record profit, because investors were worried about hugely disappointing forecasts for user numbers. It lost 1 million users in the last three months and predicted a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153mid-single-digit millions\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd decline in the next three-month period. The social media service reported net income of $100m during the second quarter, but tech companies need to show they can deliver uninterrupted growth to impress Wall Street. Verdict In 2016, Twitter moved its app from the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153social networking\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd section of the App Store to the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153news\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd section. At the time, it was seen as a capitulation to Facebook, but now it looks like a piece of genuine insight into what the company could offer to users and how the service differs from its competition. Like all news services, when there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a lot of news, the company booms, and there is certainly a lot of news right now. That has fed into a good performance over the last year. The last quarter is a different story, of course. Twitter still has to tackle the same trust and safety issues as Facebook and Google, with a fraction of the money and engineering talent. And, as with Facebook, Wall Street just doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to play ball: Twitter deletes millions of fake accounts, and investors punish it with a 20% plunge in stock price. Would they really prefer to invest in a site riddled with bots? Netflix The video streaming service was first of the tech firms out of the gate, posting figures in mid-July. Its latest three-month results sent its shares tumbling after it missed subscriber-number expectations for the first time in five years: it signed up more than 5 million new users, which was about a million fewer than the company and the market had expected. Verdict Netflix\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s strategy has changed a lot over the years, from posting DVDs, to streaming licensed movies, to streaming licensed TV shows. These days, its focus is on original serialised programming, which changes the way to think about its content costs: they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re no longer a recurring expense eating into the margin, but a long-term investment. And, as analyst Ben Thompson notes, the spending in effect works towards customer acquisition: the more content on Netflix, the more reason there is to join the site. Which is why, when subscriber growth slows, the whole thing looks unstable. The smallest of the Faangs hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t achieved the escape velocity of its peers, and a dip could always turn into a death dive. Spotify In only its second financial report since flotation, the music streaming service reported an 8 million rise in the number of paid subscribers, to 83 million during the second quarter. Spotify has yet to record a profit, but the increase suggests it is still staving off competition from deep-pocketed rivals such as Amazon and Apple for music streaming customers. Its operating loss widened from \u00e2\u201a\u00ac79m to \u00e2\u201a\u00ac90m (\u00c2\u00a380m). Verdict The music streaming market still has room to grow, as the stubborn markets for digital downloads and CDs demonstrate. But everyone knows it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s eventually going to be a winner-takes-all battle. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s because, unlike video, there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s little reason to have subscriptions to multiple streaming services, and strong economies of scale. So Spotify\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock price is essentially a representation of one simple question: will it win, or will Apple Music? In Spotify\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s favour is its large and growing free service, which brings in substantial ad revenue and is a crucial pipeline for new users \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and the Android market, where it lacks a strong competitor. Working against it: a competitor with much deeper pockets.",

The S&amp;P 500 dipped 1 point to 2,861 for the day while the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 88 points, or 0.3%, to 25,733, and the Nasdaq composite rose 29 points, or 0.4%, to 7,889. But records were set nonetheless.</p> <p>Having started in March 2009, following the financial crisis, the longest market rally comes as the global economy continues its recovery from the depths of the last recession. </p> <p>Although there have been numerous wobbles in the past 10 years, including a sharp correction earlier this year, when S&amp;P fell 10% over two weeks after its January high, the milestone comes with help from corporate tax cuts and the rise of internet companies such as Apple, Amazon and Google\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s owner, Alphabet.</p> <p>A loose definition is that a stock market switches from a bear to a bull phase when share prices have risen 20% from the previous low.

                "bodyText":"US stock markets passed another landmark on Wednesday as the S&amp;P 500 recorded its longest rally ever, capping a near decade-long Wall Street boom that has gathered pace over the course of this year. The S&amp;P 500 share index, tracking the 500 biggest public companies in America, closed trading on Wednesday having gone 3,453 days \u00e2\u20ac\u201c nearly nine and a half years \u00e2\u20ac\u201c without a fall of 20% or more, which is the measure used by some analysts for handing it the status as the longest bull market in US history. The record was set with more of a whimper than a roar. The S&amp;P 500 dipped 1 point to 2,861 for the day while the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 88 points, or 0.3%, to 25,733, and the Nasdaq composite rose 29 points, or 0.4%, to 7,889. But records were set nonetheless. Having started in March 2009, following the financial crisis, the longest market rally comes as the global economy continues its recovery from the depths of the last recession. Although there have been numerous wobbles in the past 10 years, including a sharp correction earlier this year, when S&amp;P fell 10% over two weeks after its January high, the milestone comes with help from corporate tax cuts and the rise of internet companies such as Apple, Amazon and Google\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s owner, Alphabet. A loose definition is that a stock market switches from a bear to a bull phase when share prices have risen 20% from the previous low. The bull market continues until there is a 20% decline from the peak, when stocks go back into bear mode. One theory explaining the stock market terminology comes from the way both animals attack their opponents. A bull thrusts its horns up into the air, while a bear swipes downward. The previous record bull run started in October 1990, lasting almost a decade until the dotcom bubble burst around the turn of the millennium. There are, however, disputes over the starting point, which could render celebrations over the latest milestone premature. The US Financial Industry Regulatory Authority reckons the tech rally began in 1987, rather than 1990, meaning the current bull market would need to continue until at least the summer of 2021 to break the record. Some analysts argue that bull and bear market status is unclear, not set in stone, and that identifying the positions reflects an unhealthy obsession with arbitrary turning points in financial markets. The S&amp;P 500\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s close at 2,861 points was within touching distance of the record high reached in January. Among the best performers so far this year are Netflix, Twitter, and the watchmaker Fossil. The latest milestone comes as the US economy goes through its second longest-ever unbroken expansion, helped by low interest rates set by the Federal Reserve and sluggish inflation. Stock markets have also benefited since the crisis from the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest central banks pumping billions into their economies through quantitative easing. The rise of the tech firms has boosted the overall value of the US stock market. The five so-called Faangs \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix and Google \u00e2\u20ac\u201c are together worth more than $3tn (\u00c2\u00a32.3tn), a sum that makes them more valuable than the entire FTSE 100. Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s corporate tax cuts have boosted US corporate profits, helping to drive the stock market higher. The president celebrated stocks reaching record levels earlier this year, tweeting: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Dow just crashes through 25,000. Congrats!

                "bodyText":"Holidaymakers complained to Thomas Cook about conditions at an all-inclusive hotel in Egypt before two Britons suddenly died there last week, but say they were assured nothing was wrong. Alison Cope from Birmingham said she raised multiple complaints including about being served raw meat and drinks from unwashed glasses prior to the deaths last Tuesday of John Cooper, 69, and his wife Susan, 63, at the Steigenberger Aqua Magic hotel in Hurghada, which is on the Red Sea. Five people in Cope\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s party were among 13 guests who reported illnesses in the last week. Some suffered such uncontrollable diarrhoea that people defecated in the swimming pool on three separate occasions in the last fortnight, Cope told the Guardian. She said the hotel was unable to prevent other guests from jumping in unaware that the pools had yet to be disinfected. One member of her party suffered headaches, breathing difficulties and fluid on the lungs, which a British doctor has since said appear consistent with Legionnaire\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s disease, a lung condition that can be carried by contaminated water in air conditioning units. Thomas Cook and the German hotel company Steigenberger said they were carrying out urgent investigations into food and water supplies as well as air conditioning systems after several guests reported stomach and breathing problems. The Coopers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 daughter, Kelly Ormerod, said on Sunday she believed \u00e2\u20ac\u0153there was something in that room that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s actually killed them\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and they may have inhaled something that poisoned them.

When we asked what they were doing, they said that if they were really dirty they would put them in the dishwasher for 30 seconds. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153There was a barbecue on the beach and another guest bit into the chicken and it was raw in the middle.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Cope said that after members of her family fell ill a few days into their holiday she complained to the Thomas Cook hotel representative but says she was told: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no problem and no one else has a problem:\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd She escalated her complaint and was met by a hotel manager and a more senior Thomas Cook representative and \u00e2\u20ac\u0153they dismissed what I was saying\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Thomas Cook confirmed Cope had complained but neither it nor Steigenberger would comment on her claims. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We are aware that a number of customers have come forward to say they have experienced illness,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd a Thomas Cook spokeswoman said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We are very sorry for any customers whose holidays have been spoiled. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We take all illness very seriously and have taken the decision to expand our ongoing investigation into the sudden deaths of two of our customers at the Steigenberger earlier this week to include any other customer reports of illness at the hotel this summer.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Steigenberger said the hotel was operated by a franchisee and that it had launched its own investigation into standards. The German company said it was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153deeply saddened\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd by the deaths. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We are really looking carefully to check the facts,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Sven Hirschler, director of corporate communications.",
