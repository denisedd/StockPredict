                "bodyText":"The world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest advertising and marketing services group, WPP, has said last year was its worst since the 2009 recession, as it published gender pay gap figures. The UK company reported a 0.9% fall in revenues to \u00c2\u00a315.2bn in its results for 2017, making it WPP\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s worst year in growth terms since 2009 when the company reported a fall of 8.1% during the depths of the recession following the credit crunch. WPP\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s share price fell more than 14% in early trading on Thursday, the biggest faller on the FTSE 100, after the company said there had been no improvement in trading so far this year and cut its long-term profit outlook. Sir Martin Sorrell, WPP\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chief executive, admitted 2017 \u00e2\u20ac\u0153was not a pretty year\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd for the company but denied it was because his agencies were being cut out of deals between advertisers and Google and Facebook. The tech companies account for almost 60% of the \u00c2\u00a319.7bn UK internet market and hoover up as much as 90% of all new money coming in. However, Sorrell said advertisers were still using his agencies to spend money with the technology companies, and were not cutting them out by doing direct deals. Sorrell, one of the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s highest-paid chief executives, who took home \u00c2\u00a348m in 2016, said WPP spent more than $6bn (\u00c2\u00a34.4bn) of its clients\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 advertising and marketing money with Google, its biggest single investment, last year, a 10% rise. Facebook received about $2.1bn of its ad spend last year, a 30% rise. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The major factors influencing [WPP\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s] performance were probably the long-term impact of technological disruption and more the short-term focus of zero-based budgeters, activist investors and private equity,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said. Zero-based budgeting is a marketing strategy where a company starts with a clean slate each year, rather than taking the previous year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s advertising spend as a benchmark. WPP also published a gender pay gap report for the 14,000 staff in the UK. For basic pay excluding bonuses there was a median hourly gap of 14.6% between men and women, compared with the UK average of 18.4%. The difference between men and women was far higher on bonuses, with a median gap of 46.3%. The report found that while overall 51% of WPP\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s UK workforce are men, only 38% of women employees were in the most senior roles in the top 25% pay bracket. WPP\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pre-tax profits rose 7.7% to \u00c2\u00a32.1bn last year, but the company indicated that this year there would probably be job cuts among its 130,000 global staff. WPP needed to put a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153continued emphasis on balancing revenue growth with headcount increases and improvement in staff costs\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, it said. Staff costs climbed from \u00c2\u00a37.78bn to \u00c2\u00a38.3bn last year, with more than \u00c2\u00a3320m paid out in cash and share-based performance bonuses.",

Thanks for reading and commenting. GW Powell is also making some interesting points about student debt; suggesting it could be wiped away if an individual is made bankrupt. Background: The US Education Department said this week it will review when borrowers can discharge student loans, an indication it could become easier to expunge those loans in bankruptcy. Fed chair Jerome Powell is exhibiting a more dovish plumage to Congress today, having come over as quite the hawk on Tuesday. Jerome Powell\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s cautious comments about wage inflation have taken some of the sizzle out of the US dollar. Shares have also pushed higher on Wall Street, as traders shed some of their worries about rate increases. Over in Washington, Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell is testifying to the Senate banking committee. His prepared testimony was the same as Tuesday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s offering to the House, so it didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t move the markets. But Powell now taking questions....and he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s delivered a dovish-sound comment on wages increases. Perhaps importantly, the new Fed chief says there aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t any signs of a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcdecisive\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 move in wages. That could dampen expectations of hefty interest rate rises this year. CNBC has the details: Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said Thursday that there are no \u00e2\u20ac\u0153decisive\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd signs of wage inflation yet. Speaking in testimony before the Senate Banking Committee, the central bank head also said more gains can come in the labor market without causing harmful levels of inflation. The remarks are significant in that during Powell\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s remarks two days ago before the House Financial Services Committee were interpreted as being more concerned about inflation, leading the Fed to a more aggressive path in interest rate hikes. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t see any strong evidence yet of a decisive move up in wages. We see wages by a couple of measures trending up a little bit, but most of them continuing to grow at two and a half percent,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Nothing is suggesting to me that wage inflation is at a point of accelerating. I would expect that some continued strengthening in the labor market can take place without causing inflation.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Andrew Hunter of Capital Economics is impressed by today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s US manufacturing figures: The rise in the ISM manufacturing index in February to 60.8, from 59.1, left it at a 13-year high and suggests that growth is set to pick up following a soft start to the year. On past form, the index is consistent with real GDP growth of more than 5% annualised. Rupert Harrison of BlackRock suggests Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tax reforms are helping: James Knightley of ING says the data supports the case for four US interest rate rises this year: Given orders and production are also well above the 60 level \u00e2\u20ac\u201c remember that a reading of 50 notionally means stable output - the report suggests that the manufacturing sector will continue to contribute significantly to economic activity in coming months. However, inflation pressures are also clearly building with prices paid the highest since 2011. As such, this report supports our predictions that the US economy will expand 3% this year and that headline inflation could hit 3% in the summer. With new Fed Chair Jay Powell seemingly backing the case for further policy tightening, we look for a March 21st rate hike with three more to follow later this year. Charlie Bilello of Pension Partners puts today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s data in context: More strong US economic data! Growth among American factories jumped last month, to the highest level in 13 years. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s according to the Institute of Supply Management. Its monthly manufacturing PMI survey has risen to 60.3 in February, up from January\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 59.1. Economists had expected a small fall. Instead, ISM reports that new orders and employment growth were both strong, keeping activity in the sector bubbling away. In contrast, the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s factory PMI fell to 55.2 this morning, while the eurozone posted 58.6. Any reading over 50 shows growth. Back in the UK, households have been told to \u00e2\u20ac\u02dccarry on cooking\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, despite the shortfall in gas supplies. Energy minister Claire Perry has pledged that domestic supplies won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be disrupted, so Britons should \u00e2\u20ac\ufffdcarrying on using your gas heating and cooking meals as normal\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ranko Berich, Head of Market Analysis at Monex Europe, on the surprise drop in US jobless claims: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153In the final week of February 1969, 201,000 US workers made jobless claims (seasonally adjusted). Led Zeppelin had just released their debut album, the Vietnam war was raging, and some 69 million workers were on Non-Farm Payrolls. Unemployment was below 4%. The fact that a comparable number of initial jobless claims are being made today illustrates just how tight the US labour market is getting. We also have fresh data showing that inflationary pressure are building in America, although not dramatically. The prices paid by US consumers rose by 0.4% in January, although the annual rate remains below the significant 2% level. Reuters has the details: U.S. consumer prices increased in January, with a gauge of underlying inflation posting its largest gain in 12 months, bolstering views that price pressures will accelerate this year. The Commerce Department said on Thursday consumer prices as measured by the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index, rose 0.4%. That was the biggest increase since September and followed a 0.1 percent gain in December. In the 12 months through January, the PCE price index rose 1.7% after a similar gain in December because of base effects. Excluding the volatile food and energy components, the PCE price index advanced 0.3% in January - the largest gain since January 2017. Economist Danny Blanchflower reckons this isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t an excuse to raise US interest rates.... Significantly, the four-week moving average of US jobless claims has also hit a 48-year low. This measure, which strips out week-to-week volatility, fell 5,000 to 220,500 last week. Bloomberg\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Mike McKee says today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s US unemployment data is seriously impressive: Analyst Marco Mazzocco says the figures highlight the strength of America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s recovery Financial blogger Bill McBride has tweeted a graph showing the initial claims figures over the decades: Breaking: The number of Americans signing on for unemployment benefit has hit its lowest level in almost 50 years. The weekly initial claims survey shows that just 210,000 US citizens filed new claims last week, down from 220,000 the previous week. This extends a long run of impressive jobs data, underlining the strength of the US labor market (which is why interest rates are likely to rise three or four times this year). The shortage of gas in the UK has pushed prices to new record levels. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s same-day gas prices have surged by more than 130 per cent to 275p per therm. That extends todays record highs, and beats the previous record high of 150p set in 2013. Last week, wholesale gas for immediate use was trading around 60p per therm, but the snowy weather - and National Grid\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s warning that supplies can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t meet demand today - has triggered a scramble to get hold of gas. Dr Jonathan Marshall, energy analyst at the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit, says a range of factors have left Britain short of supplies. He explains (via PA) \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Behind today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s gas deficit warning is a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcperfect storm\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 of unrelated short-term issues - freezing conditions, diminished Dutch gas production due to earthquake concerns, weather-related issues curbing imports from Europe, and a global LNG market in which supplies are being pulled to Asia by higher prices. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153But underlying it is another set of issues that speak to a failure by successive governments to map out a secure gas future in the way that they have done so successfully for electricity. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Allowing Centrica to close the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s only big long-term gas store without consideration for supply during cold snaps, failing to develop a coherent plan for low-carbon heating, and above all a head-in-the-sand approach to improving energy efficiency in homes have all put households and businesses at risk of shortages and price spikes.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The pound and the euro are both losing ground against the US dollar today. America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s currency is benefiting from the prospect of several interest rate rises this year (which would make it more profitable to hold cash in dollars, rather than sterling or euros). The euro has slipped to a seven-week low against the dollar, at $1.216, while the pound has dipped to $1.374, a six-week low. The London stock market has fallen deeper into the red, after a morning of generally bad news. The FTSE 100 is now down 63 points, or 0.9%, at 7170. Ad firm WPP remains the biggest faller, down 13%, after reporting its weakest growth since 2009 this morning. The smaller FTSE 250 index, of medium-sized companies is also down, shedding 135 points or 0.7% . The latest gloom at Carpetright, the drop in UK house prices, and the slowdown in factory growth have all dampened the mood in the City. But there are chunky losses across Europe too -- with Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s DAX down 1.6%. Wall Street is also expected to drop, when trading begins in over two hours time. Investors remain nervous about the prospect for US interest rates -- with new Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell speaking at the US Senate in a few hours time. Will Powell repeat his upbeat words from Tuesday, when he testified before the lower House of Congress? Craig Erlam of City firm OANDA explains why traders will be watching closely: It would appear markets are bracing for more hawkish commentary from Powell today when he appears before the Senate Banking Committee, once again discussing the semi-annual monetary policy report. Given everything that he said on Tuesday, it seems pretty clear that economic forecasts will be revised higher this month and the pace of tightening will likely therefore pick up, which may make today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s less eventful as he reiterates many of the views already expressed. That said, should he wish to back pedal on anything or clarify points that have been misinterpreted, it may attract some attention. Even the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s financial markets aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t immune to the snowy weather. The Irish stock exchange is closing at noon today, and will be shut all Friday, due to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153extreme weather conditions\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. The ISE says: Due to the announcement by the Irish Government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s National Emergency Coordination Committee and the severe weather-related nationwide Status Red Warning, and to protect against any potential risk to market integrity in these exceptional circumstances, the Irish Stock Exchange (ISE) is altering its trading calendar to facilitate an earlier closing of the market today, Thursday, 1 March 2018 and will close all day on Friday, 2 March 2018. Earlier today, a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcRed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 weather alert was extended to cover the entire Republic of Ireland, which means people should stay at home to avoid the severe winter storm that is hitting the country. The Guardian\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s weather blog has full coverage of Storm Emma, and the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcBeast from the East\u00e2\u20ac\u2122: Heads-up, UK readers. This is the last day to spend your old \u00c2\u00a310 notes (the ones with Charles Darwin on them). From Friday morning, only the new Jane Austen ones will do (although you can always change out-of-date notes at the Bank of England). Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s my colleague Mark Sweney on ad giant WPP\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s results, which have sent its shares sliding: The world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest advertising and marketing services group, WPP, has said last year was its worst year since the 2009 recession. The UK company reported a 0.3% fall in revenues to \u00c2\u00a315.2bn in its results for 2017, making it WPP\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s worst year in growth terms since 2009 when the company reported a fall of 8.1% during the depths of the recession following the credit crunch. WPP\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s share price fell more than 10% in early trading on Thursday, the biggest faller on the FTSE 100. Sir Martin Sorrell, WPP\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chief executive, admitted 2017 \u00e2\u20ac\u0153was not a pretty year\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd for the company but denied it was because his agencies were being cut out of deals between advertisers and Google and Facebook. More here: Mike Rigby, Head of Manufacturing at Barclays, fears that Brexit uncertainty is hitting UK factory growth. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s his take on this morning\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s manufacturing report: Although the sector remains positive, the continuing uncertainty over Brexit negotiations can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be helping the investment intentions of manufacturers who are looking for some degree of clarity over the future relationship with the EU sooner rather than later. Manufacturers will also need to remain flexible in their planning as they negotiate the uncertain market conditions in 2018. With current Barclays data highlighting the premia that international consumers are prepared to pay for British goods, and given the continuing improvement in key overseas markets, manufacturing businesses should be increasingly focusing on differentiating their products on quality and service.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Dave Atkinson, UK head of manufacturing at Lloyds Bank Commercial Banking, reckons Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s factory sector is still in \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a positive mood\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, despite the drop in the manufacturing PMI last month. Brexit uncertainty is a key factor, he adds: Recent ONS figures show sector productivity is increasing, although there is still some way to go before the UK catches up to its G7 counterparts. But manufacturers are taking steps to make this happen by investing in automation and exploring the opportunities presented by Industry 4.0. Many are using specialist asset finance facilities to invest in equipment, protecting their working capital which can be used to support growth opportunities. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Clearly, challenges and uncertainties lay ahead. All firms are keen for clarity on the future trading relationship with the EU, but manufacturers, which account for nearly half of UK exports, are disproportionately exposed to uncertainty associated with international trade agreements. The PMI will therefore be closely watched in the coming months for any clues as to how exporting firms are managing this uncertainty.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Newsflash: UK factory activity growth has hit its lowest level in eight months, according to data firm Markit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s monthly healthcheck. Manufacturers have reported that production increased at the slowest pace for 11 months in February, with \u00e2\u20ac\u0153decelerations seen across the consumer, intermediate and investment goods sectors\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Firms also suffered a sharp rise in input costs, as raw materials and other commodities became pricier. Some companies passed this onto their own customers -- which could push inflation up. But there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s good news too - new orders picked up, and firms kept hiring staff: Duncan Brock, Director of Customer Relationships at the Chartered Institute of Procurement &amp; Supply, says there wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t much \u00e2\u20ac\u0153bonhomie\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in the UK manufacturing sector last month. All sectors lost their drive as manufacturing activity crawled at a snail\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pace not seen for almost a year. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Amidst these signs of a moderate slowdown, it was supply chain disruptions that were largely at fault. Suppliers underperformed not only on the timely delivery of goods but in their inability to meet the demand from makers for some raw materials. This intensified capacity issues and acted as a drag on overall purchasing activity. Time for some data... The euro zone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s manufacturing boom slowed a little last month, new figures from Markit show. But Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s factories are still in a rosy period, and enjoying their strongest growth spell in almost 20 years. Markit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s manufacturing Purchasing Managers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Index (which tracks activity in the sector) dipped to 58.6 in February from 59.6. Any reading over 50 shows growth. France and Germany both reported a small drop in growth. National Grid has issued a warning that the UK will not have enough gas to meet demand on Thursday, as temperatures plummeted and imports were hit by outages. It is thought unlikely that the situation will affect supply to households, but if enough extra gas supplies by pipeline or ship are not forthcoming, it could affect industrial users. Within-day wholesale gas prices soared 74% to 200p per therm this morning after the formal deficit warning, which acts as a call to suppliers to bring forward more gas on Thursday. Prices have since fallen back to 170p. More here: European stock markets are all in the red this morning, following last night\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s late slide on Wall Street. In London, the FTSE 100 is being dragged down by advertising giant WPP - which has shed 13% after reporting a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153slow start\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to the new year, and a 0.3% drop in like-for-like revenues in 2017. Otherwise, traders are continuing to fret about the prospect of sharp hikes in US interest rates this year (as the Federal Reserve tries to prevent inflation getting out of hand). Connor Campbell of SpreadEx says European markets got off to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153another duff start\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, after traders saw America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dow Jones shed 380 points last night. Interactive Investor\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Lee Wild explains what\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s going on: A strong US economy is great for confidence and jobs, but corporate America will have to absorb more expensive debt, which is why equity traders are selling into the rally from mid-February lows. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s all eyes on Jerome Powell again on Thursday when the Fed chair testifies before the Senate Banking Committee. Any further talk about an overheating economy will give equity market bears another reason to dump stock. Retail analyst Nick Bubb is amazed that Carpetright has produced another profit warning today: It is only 6 weeks or so since the last Carpetright profit warning on Jan 19th, but, almost unbelievably it has issued yet another profit warning today and flagged, ominously, that it is in discussions with its banks about to prop up the balance sheet. Whether Carpetright needs to raise more equity remains unclear, as does the issue of how far its problems are to do with intense competition from its rival Tapi, but shareholders will fear the worst today\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 Neil Wilson of ETX Capital says Carpetright has deteriorated sharply in recent months. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153A bad week for retail as Carpetright\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s woes get worse: now the company expects to report a loss for the year to the end of April as its store investment programme is not paying off. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been quite a climb-down from just a few months ago. In December it issued a profits warning, guiding underlying profit before tax for the year to be at the lower end of the previous range of \u00c2\u00a313.8m to \u00c2\u00a316.7m. As we noted at the time, profits warnings have a nasty habit of not coming alone and that guidance appeared to be wishful thinking. In January management slashed this to a range of \u00c2\u00a32m-\u00c2\u00a36m. Horrendous post-Christmas sales were to blame then but the trend is not improving. Now a small loss is expected as trading remains very difficult. That loss may not remain small if Easter doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t go well. Like-for-like sales are negative and below management expectations. Lee Wild, Head of Equity Strategy at interactive investor, says the next few months will be crucial for Carpetright. Carpetright\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s long and painful decline clearly has further to run. Things haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t improved since the last profits warning in January, and the company will lose money this year. It has the backing of its lenders for now, but a strong Easter is crucial for the business and any goodwill that remains. Newsflash: Shares in Carpetright, the UK flooring and furnishing business, have plunged by 25% in early trading. In another sign of retail gloom, Carpetright has issued a profits warning (its fourth in three months, according to Reuters). It now expects to make a small underlying pre-tax loss for the current financial year. Carpetright admits that sales in the UK have been weaker than hoped, saying: Trading conditions in the weeks since the Group last updated the market on 19 January 2018 have remained difficult, characterised by continued weak consumer confidence. While the trend in the Group\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s UK like-for-like sales has improved through the intervening period, it remains negative. Carpetright says it is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153proactively engaged in constructive discussions\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd with its banks, to ensure it sticks with its bank facilities. They add: The bank lenders have indicated that they currently remain fully supportive. This comes a day after Toys R Us and Maplin, two other UK retailers, both fell into administration putting over 5,500 jobs at risk. The drop in UK house prices in February is a surprise, says Jeremy Leaf, north London estate agent . He explains: \u00e2\u20ac\u2122As one of the most closely-watched indicators of property market strength due to its longevity and accuracy, Nationwide\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s figures may cause concern. At this time of the year we would have expected an increase, not a fall, in house price growth although of course these figures are in contrast to the previous month\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s findings. \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcHowever, it goes to show the limitations of a national snapshot of the market. While Nationwide reports a lack of supply, on the ground, we are finding more balance between supply and demand in our part of London as buyers, spoilt for more choice, hesitate before making commitments and identifying whether they are dealing with serious sellers.\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Simon French, chief economist of Panmure Gordon, predicts that the slowdown in UK house prices will continue this year: Jonathan Samuels, CEO of the property lender, Octane Capital, believes the property market is being battered by weak consumer confidence. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153With the ongoing financial squeeze on households, you sense the house price slowdown has now begun in earnest. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153High living costs, low wage growth, potential rate rises and a lethargic economy in the shadow of Brexit: for consumers, the bad news is in stereo mode. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153While weak supply and very low borrowing costs will prevent a collapse in prices, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hard to see 2018 delivering anything other than very low single digit growth. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153February could go down as the month the big freeze on prices took hold. Newsflash: UK house prices fell in February, fuelling suspicions that the housing market is cooling fast. The Nationwide Building Society has reported that prices fell by 0.3% last month, crushing expectations of a rise, following January\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 0.8% increase. That drags the annual rate of house price growth down to 2.2%, from 3.2% a month ago. Robert Gardner, Nationwide\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Chief Economist, blames falling consumer confidence and the squeeze on household budgets: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Month-to-month changes can be volatile, but the slowdown is consistent with signs of softening in the household sector in recent months. Retail sales were relatively soft over the Christmas period and at the start of the new year, as were key measures of consumer confidence, as the squeeze on household incomes continued to take its toll. Gardner points out that mortgage approvals fell to their weakest level for three years in December - a sign that activity in the sector has fallen. Nationwide expects house prices to only rise by 1% this year, due to \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcsubdued economic activity\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 and Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s exit from the European Union. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153How the housing market performs in the year ahead will be determined in large part by developments in the wider economy and the path of interest rates. Brexit developments will remain a key factor, though these remain hard to foresee. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll pull some reaction together now... Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. European stock markets are facing fresh losses today, after a late wobble on Wall Street sent the Dow Jones industrial average down almost 400 points, or 1.5%. The selloff ended Wall Street\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s run of 11 monthly gains, and was triggered by renewed jitters about the pace of US interest rate rises . The big fear is that America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s central bank, the Fed, will hike interest rates four times in 2017. This has sparked declines in Asia, where Japan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Nikkei shed 1.5%. As AFP put it: After a couple of weeks of calm, the volatility that kicked off February has returned on worries that the strong US economy and Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tax cuts will lead the Federal Reserve to tighten borrowing costs more than previously thought. European markets are set to follow, with the main indices being called down 0.5%. The new chair of the Federal Reserve, Jerome Powell, worried investors on Tuesday by indicating that borrowing costs must rise to prevent the US economy overheating. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll hear from Powell again today, when he testifies to the Senate banking committee. If he repeats his hawkish tone, then the markets could take fright. Michael Hewson of CMC Markets says: Mr Powell returns for a second round today with US lawmakers and markets will be looking to see whether he rows back a little from Tuesday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hawkish interpretation of his remarks or whether he reaffirms them. If he does the latter then we could well see further gains for the US dollar and increased pressure on stock markets. On the corporate side, advertising giant WPP and theme park operator Merlin are reporting results. We also find out how the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s manufacturing companies fared last month, as data firms Markit and ISM release their monthly healthchecks: The agenda: 9am GMT: Eurozone manufacturing PMI report for February 9.30am GMT: UK manufacturing PMI report for February 10am GMT: Eurozone unemployment figures for January 1.30pm GMT: US personal income and spending figures 3pm GMT: US manufacturing PMI for February 3pm GMT: Fed chair Jerome Powell testifies to Congress (again)",

GKN closed on Thursday at 435p versus an offer, which is mostly in the form of Melrose shares, worth 413p. And that was before the FT\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s report on Thursday night that GKN is talking to US group Dana about a deal to sell or combine its automotive division.

                "bodyText":"It would be an exaggeration to say GKN\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shareholders, after being blasted by management presentations for the past week, have suddenly fallen in love with their misfiring engineering giant. But something may be stirring. For almost the first time since Melrose launched its \u00c2\u00a37bn reverse takeover bid, GKN\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shares are trading consistently above the value of the offer. GKN closed on Thursday at 435p versus an offer, which is mostly in the form of Melrose shares, worth 413p. And that was before the FT\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s report on Thursday night that GKN is talking to US group Dana about a deal to sell or combine its automotive division. The gap isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t huge, but the position is more encouraging for GKN than a fortnight ago. Back then, it was too easy for Melrose to portray GKN\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chief executive, Anne Stevens, as a semi-retired recruit hauled from the non-executive benches and who could make only vague promises about corporate self-improvement. GKN\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s big plan, called Project Boost, does still require investors to take a lot on trust. But there were clear long-term cashflow forecasts in the mix, a promise to return \u00c2\u00a32.5bn to shareholders plus a firm commitment to demerge the two halves of the company \u00e2\u20ac\u201c aerospace and automotive \u00e2\u20ac\u201c by the middle of next year. A demerger in itself should add no value. In practice, the move would address the old complaint that the stock market awards the lower rating - in this case, an automotive one - to any engineering group that serves two markets. Life shouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t work that way, but sometimes does. Project Boost won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t convince everybody, but it prompted Jefferies\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 analyst, for example, to place a valuation range of 448p to 523p on GKN\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock. At the very least, it is probably safe to assume, even if Melrose were to walk away tomorrow, that GKN\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shares wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t tumble all the way back to their pre-action level of 326p. A price around 370p or 380p might be more like it. Viewed that way, Melrose\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s current offer worth 413p looks outright mean. The real takeover premium is miserable.

                "bodyText":"And finally.... Wall Street has closed, with a small but surprising rally that ends a four-day losing streak. The Dow Jones finished the day up around 344 points, or 1.4%. The S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq also finished in the green, up around 1%. So, what happened to those concerns about a trade war? Some traders are suggesting that the fears were overstated, especially with Paul Ryan and the WTO both weighing in. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s strong US service sector data is another factor - reminding investors that America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy remains robust. Fiona Cincotta, Market Analyst at City Index, explains: Wall Street started the week on the back foot, sinking lower as trade war fears spilled over from last week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s announcement by Trump. However, stronger than forecast ISM non-manufacturing data quickly grabbed trader\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s attention boosting sentiment and returning risk appetite to the market. ISM non-manufacturing data printed at 59.5, ahead of tht 59 forecast, albeit a slight dip from last month\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 59.9. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s all for today. Thanks for reading and commenting. GW Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our news story on the unfolding battle over trade and tariffs in America: Republican leader Paul Ryan publicly split with Donald Trump on Monday over the president\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s threat to impose tariffs on the US\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trading partners on steel and aluminium. The House speaker became the most senior Republican to publicly distance himself from Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tariffs, which have rattled stock markets worldwide and sparked threats of retaliation. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We are extremely worried about the consequences of a trade war and are urging the White House to not advance the plan,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd AshLee Strong, Ryan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s spokeswoman said in a statement. She said the tariffs plan threatened to jeopardize the impact of Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s recently introduced $1.5tn tax reforms. Ryan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s split came shortly after Trump had doubled down on the tariff plan in a pair of tweets. The president reiterated his displeasure with trade deficits with Mexico and Canada, two of the US\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest trading partners. Metals duties will only be removed on America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s neighbours to the north and south, he said, after a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153new and fair\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd free trade agreement is signed. Trump followed up with another tweet proclaiming: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153To protect our Country we must protect American Steel! #AMERICA FIRST.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd More here.... BREAKING: Donald Trump isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t backing down, in the face of criticism from the World Trade Organisation and House Speaker Paul Ryan. The US president has just declared that he doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think tariffs on steel and aluminum will lead to a trade war, and he won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t change his position. Speaking at the Oval Office, during a visit from Israel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Benjamin Netanyahu, Trump says China is the biggest problem on trade. The president also claims that America gets a very bad deal from Mexico today. He also hints that Mexico and Canada might get an exemption from the tariffs, if a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153good deal\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd can be reached on NAFTA (something he tweeted about earlier). Newsflash: The World Trade Organisation has warned that there is a real risk of plunging into a new trade war. Roberto Azev\u00c3\u00aado, the head of the WTO, told members that Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s plan for a 25% tariff on steel imports, and 10% on aluminium, could be very damaging. Azev\u00c3\u00aado says it would be \u00e2\u20ac\u0153very hard\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to prevent retaliatory action, so it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s vital to prevent the first dominos falling now. In a statement, Azev\u00c3\u00aado warns that a trade war, with tit-for-tat sanctions, could result in a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcdeep\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 global recession. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s his warning: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153In light of recent announcements on trade policy measures,it is clear that we now see a much higher and real risk of triggering an escalation of trade barriers across the globe.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We cannot ignore this risk and I urge all parties to consider and reflect on this situation very carefully. Once we start down this path it will be very difficult to reverse direction. An eye for an eye will leave us all blind and the world in a deep recession.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd U.S. House Speaker Paul Ryan has weighed in, urging the Trump administration not to implement the new tariffs on steel and aluminum announced by the president last week. Ryan fears that the move would hurt the US economy, and wipe out the benefits of the recent tax cuts. AshLee Strong, a spokeswoman for Ryan, says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We are extremely worried about the consequences of a trade war and are urging the White House to not advance with this plan. The new tax reform law has boosted the economy and we certainly don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to jeopardize those gains.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd After a late rally, European markets have closed higher mostly higher. Not in Italy, though, where the FTSE MIB ended the day 0.4% lower at 21,819. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a recovery from its early morning selloff. In London, the FTSE 100 finished 46 points higher, or +0.65%, at 7,115 points - up from Friday night\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 14-month low. The City was cheered to learn that service sector growth hit a four-month high last month (but not so impressed by the latest fall in car sales) In Germany, the DAX ended 1.5% higher at investors welcomed the news that Angela Merkel has secured a coalition deal with the Social Democrats. In other news, a former Deutsche Bank trader has been fined \u00c2\u00a3180,000 for his role in the Libor-rigging scandal. Guillaume Adolph was also banned from working in the City, having tried to influence the information which Deutsche had submitted to the Libor panel. Mark Steward, Director of Enforcement and Market Oversight at the FCA said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Mr Adolph improperly influenced several of Deutsche\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s LIBOR submissions in disregard of standards governing LIBOR submissions. Mr Adolph\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s misconduct threatened the integrity of important benchmarks. He should have no further role in the financial services industry.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Adolph had been nicknamed \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Gollum\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd by Tom Hayes, the UBS trader who was jailed in 2015 for manipulating benchmark interest rates. Ouch! The Canadian dollar just hit an eight-month low against the US dollar. The \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcLoonie\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, as it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s known in the markets, has weakened to $1.2975 - a level last seen in July 2017. That reflects concerns that Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s latest burst of protectionism could cut Canadian exports into the US, hurting Canada\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy. As this charts shows, the dollar has enjoyed a mixed performance against other currencies - and fell against several major rivals. Capital Economic\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s John Higgins explains: All else equal, the proposed tariffs might have been expected to boost the dollar against the currencies of other major economies too, as the duties would reduce US demand for exports from those countries. But the greenback has actually weakened on average against its \u00e2\u20ac\u0153major\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd peers. The Japanese yen and Swiss franc, traditionally seen as safe havens, have performed particularly well. This is presumably also a product of the retreat from risk which has hit EM currencies. More generally, investors appear to have concluded that a marked shift towards protectionism in the US would ultimately see its economy fare worse than those of other developed markets. Goldman Sachs have predicted that the NAFTA negotiations in Mexico will fail to make a breakthrough (having been somewhat derailed by Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new tariffs): Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s confirmation that Italy is looking at a hung parliament, with Five Star Movement scooping the most votes but the centre-right parties collectively forming the largest bloc. Boom! America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s service sector grew strongly in February, thanks to a surge in new orders. The Institute for Supply Management\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s monthly US service sector PMI came in at 59.5, ahead of forecasts, and close to January\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 59.9. Any reading over 50 shows growth, and these levels suggest the US economy rattled along last month. Firms told the ISM that new business surged, pushing up the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcnew orders\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 index to its highest rate since 2005. Some also cited Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s recent tax reforms, although there was also anxiety about last month\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock market volatility. A separate PMI survey from Markit has hit its highest level since last August, confirming that American services firms did pretty well last month. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s some snap reaction: As predicted, shares are dipping at the start of trading in New York. The Dow Jones industrial average has dropped by almost 150 points, or 0.6%, following Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s latest burst of tweeting. Lawrence Mills of Finsa Markets says that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Trump trade war fears are leading to market nervousness\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Just in: Credit Suisse has cut its rating on Italian shares, following Sunday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s election. Back on Italy....and Richard Carter of investment management firm Quilter Cheviot predicts that the centre-right parties will assemble a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcshaky\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 coalition: He writes: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Arguably the performance of the Five Star Movement is another leg of the anti-establishment trend that has brought us Brexit and Trump, but the market reaction has been very sanguine so far. Uncertainty and unstable coalitions is not exactly a new phenomenon when it comes to Italian politics and the likelihood is that some sort of shaky centre-right government will be cobbled together in the coming weeks. The most important thing for investors is that Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s place in the Euro or the EU does not look to be under threat at the current time while ongoing QE from the Eurozone Central Bank will keep a lid on Italian government borrowing costs.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd If Carter\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s right, then Matteo Salvini of the right-wing Northern League will play a key role. So you should check out our preview of the man who scooped up more votes than Silvio Berlusconi with an anti-immigrant, pro-Russian and anti-EU platform. German carmakers are coming under more pressure, as investors worry about a trade war breaking out across the Atlantic (as explained earlier). Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Justin Benson, Head of Automotive at KPMG in the UK, on the latest fall in UK car sales: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Diesel car sales continue to fall, albeit at a slower rate than recent months. However, diesel should still be a relevant choice for consumers, as the latest technology does help address air quality issues. Whilst sales for petrol and alternatively fuelled vehicles are increasing, they are not filling the gap. Consumer confidence is low and the evidence suggests people are keeping their cars for longer before making a buying decision. Whether or not this is due to Brexit is hard to say, but the automotive industry needs certainty in order to maximise new car sales growth. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s service sector is still growing slower than major European rivals, despite the pick-up last month. Reuters Andy Bruce has the details: Donald Trump certainly isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t backing down on his tariffs, despite concerns that protectionism will hurt economic growth and could trigger a trade war. A few years ago, Matteo Renzi was being hailed as the bright young hope for Italian politics. Back then, the young mayor of Florence was challenging the old guard and promising to reform Italy. But then he seized power, in early 2014, by shunting PM Enrico Letta aside - only to be brought down in 2016 after the public rejected a referendum on electoral reforms. Last night\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s election results were a chastening reminder of how Renzi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s career has nose-dived (a fate shared more widely by social democratic parties). There are now reports that he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll resign as head of the Democratic Party. From Rome, my colleague Stephanie Kirchgaessner explains: The centre-left coalition headed by Matteo Renzi did worse than expected, winning 19% of the vote according to early results. While Renzi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s leading lieutenant, Maria Elena Boschi, won a safe parliamentary seat in South Tyrol in northern Italy, two other prominent politicians, the interior minister, Marco Minniti, and the culture minister, Dario Franceschini, were defeated. The dismal showing prompted reports that Renzi, who was prime minister from February 2014 until December 2016, has stepped down as head of the Democratic party (PD). Francesco Galietti, an analyst in Rome, said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Renzi has been obliterated in what is perhaps the shortest boom-to-bust cycle of Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s political history. Early data suggest the PD won less than 20% of the vote, less than half its share in the EU elections of 2014, and it won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be long before the non-Renzian forces of the left all go for the jugular.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd More here: Back over in Italy, the head of the right-wing Northern League has declared his party are ready to form the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s next government. Matteo Salvini also told reporters in Milan that investors shouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t cower from a new centre-right coalition, insisting: The markets have nothing to fear. The Northern League won around 18% of the votes, beating Silvio Berlusconi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Forza Italia party to become the leading right-wing party. Although the anti-establishment Five Star Movement won the greatest share of the vote (around 32%), the Northern League and its fellow right-wing parties have some 37% between them. Forming a coalition will be very tricky, but Richard Turnill, BlackRock\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Global Chief Investment Strategist, suspects a deal will be found. It could include the Democratic Party, which had a bad election with just 19% of votes. Turnill says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We believe it unlikely that M5S will partner with Lega to form a government. Lega\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ambition is to lead the center-right coalition rather than be a junior partner in an unstable alliance with M5S. At some point, an increasingly mainstream M5S and the center-left Democratic Party may warm up to each other. A new Italian parliament needs to be convened by March 23, yet negotiations are likely to drag on beyond then. Political noise is poised to remain high until a sustainable coalition emerges. Newsflash: President Trump has just tweeted that the new planned tariffs on steel and aluminum could be changed...if America can get a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153new and fair\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd trade agreement with NAFTA. He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also pushing Canada over agriculture trade, and Mexico over border controls. Officials from the US, Canada and Mexico have been renegotiations the NAFTA pact for several days. Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s plan to slap 25% tariffs on steel imports, and 10% on aluminum, have threatened to derail those talks, with Mexican and Canadian ministers keen to be get a blanket exemption. The threat of a trade war between the United Stats and the European Union is weighing on European carmakers today. Shares in BMW are down 1%, Daimler are down 0.3% and Renault has lost 0.35%. This comes after Donald Trump tweeted on Saturday that he would impose a tax on European cars if the EU followed through on its threat of tariffs on US bourbon, jeans and motorbikes. Overnight, the president also defended his new tariffs on steel and aluminium, despite UK PM Theresa May expressing concern yesterday. Back in the markets, the Italian FTSE MIB is still down 1% as traders in Milan face the prospect of a hung parliament after Sunday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s election. David Madden of CMC Markets says investor confidence in Italy has been shaken by the surge in support for Five Star Movement and the Northern League, at the expense of more mainstream parties. The votes are still being counted, but the early indication is there will be no majority. Added uncertainty comes from the rise of the anti-establishment Five-Star Movement. Traders fear the nation could be plunged into a period of political unpredictability, and this could delay much-needed reforms. Claudio Ferrarese, portfolio manager at Fidelity International, says there could be weeks of uncertainty: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153A grand coalition is still possible, but smaller, traditional parties however, are in a position of weakness, and will have to strike a deal with the M5S or the Lega. More importantly, even though the Lega and the M5S will have a greater say in the political agenda, the more extreme views from either party are likely to be tamed somewhat once they get into power. Their anti-European rhetoric is already much softer than it was in the past, although they will place greater focus on fiscal easing, and a more confrontational attitude towards European partners. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The political horse trading will now start and the first smoke will come for the election of the presidents of the chambers within the next three or four of weeks. That would be something to watch, depending on the names that are chosen, it will give a lead on where the coalition talks are going. But the big swing towards populist parties isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t causing too much angst in other markets. The markets may be concluding that political deadlock in Italy remains a domestic problem. In London, the FTSE 100 has gained 25 points, having hit a 14-month low on Friday night. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our latest news story on the elections: Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s baby boomers should be hit with new wealth taxes, to spare younger generations from massive tax rises. That might sound like a line from Labour\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s John McDonnell. But actually, former Conservative minister David Willetts is the one calling for action to tackle intergenerational unfairness. Willetts, who now chairs the Resolution Foundation, is speaking in London this morning, saying: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153As we baby boomers sit on so much wealth \u00e2\u20ac\u201c which has continued to grow even as incomes have stagnated \u00e2\u20ac\u201c one obvious source is for us to make a contribution through capital or property taxes... \u00e2\u20ac\u0153By the end of the next decade, the fiscal gap is set to grow to the equivalent today of \u00c2\u00a320bn a year and then to \u00c2\u00a360bn after another decade. That translates to an income tax hike of 15p in the basic rate by 2040, the burden of which will overwhelmingly fall on the generations following baby boomers. My colleague Richard Partington is there, tweeting the key points: Newsflash: Greece has recorded its fourth quarter of growth in a row.... just. Greek GDP rose by 0.1% in the final three months of 2017, according to statistics body Elstat. Elstat also revised up its estimate for growth between July and September 2017, from 0.3% to 0.4%. Growth for 2017 as a whole came in at 1.4%. Nathan Coe, chief finance officer of Auto Trader, reckons anxiety over Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s exit from the EU is deterring people from buying new cars: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The dip in new car registrations continues to reflect the serious decline in diesel sales and the broader UK economic environment. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This is further compounded by the uncertainty car buyers have over Brexit, with over sixty per cent saying it is causing them to delay or change their car buying plans. You could call it Brexiety I suppose! Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s service sector was surprisingly strong last month, says Jeremy Cook, Chief Economist at WorldFirst. He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s encouraged that firms reported that their cost pressures have eased recently: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Higher orders and higher employment buoyed the service sector in February with the global economic recovery allowing for an uptick in new business. Interestingly, price pressures weakened to their lowest in 18 months and may limit the immediate need for a rate rise from the Bank of England at the May meeting. It is good news that the pressures on margins and costs from exchange rates have been seen to lessen in the past few months or so with UK SMEs maintaining a very \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcwait-and-see\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 approach to hedging. Newsflash: Growth in Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s service sector has risen to a four-month high. Data firm Markit reports that activity in the dominant sector of the UK economy rebounded modestly in February. Firms reported that new business jumped last month, encouraging them to take on more staff. Markit says: Growth of incoming new business picked up for the second month running and reached its strongest since May 2017. Service providers commented on particularly marked business-to-business sales growth in February, helped by the improving global economic backdrop. However, there were also reports that stretched household budgets remained a factor holding back domestic consumer demand. This pushed its UK service sector PMI, which tracks activity, up to 54.5 in February, from 53.0 in January. Any reading over 50 shows growth. Duncan Brock, director of customer relationships at the Chartered Institute of Procurement &amp; Supply, says UK consumers remained cautious last month. In fact it was business customers that had the confidence to forge ahead with orders, as consumers hesitated over concerns about possible rate rises impacting on their household budgets and what the future could hold. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153But it was encouraging to see job seekers were the winners as hiring levels continued to rise and at the fastest rate since September 2017. Firms were eager to reduce accumulated backlogs in part created by difficulties in finding talented, skilled staff and in a period of exceptionally low unemployment. Growth in the eurozone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s service sector dipped last month, from 58 to 56.2, including a small slowdown in Italy... Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s figures also show that petrol cars now make up 60% of the UK market, up from just 51% a year ago. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bad news for Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s greenhouse gas emissions, as the FT\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Peter Campbell tweets: Howard Archer of the EY Item Club says Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s car industry is stuck in the slow lane. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s his take on the latest fall in car sales. Sales of diesel cars (down 23.5% year-on-year in February) have been decimated by pollution concerns and expectations of related government action to counter this. While this contributes substantially to the weakness in car sales, the overall softness has run deeper than this as the pick-up in demand for petrol (up 14.4% year-on-year in February) and alternatively fuelled vehicles (up 7.2%) has been insufficient to compensate for the slump in diesel sales February\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 2.0% drop in private sector car sales points to squeezed, uncertain consumers still being reluctant to make major purchases. While uncertainty over government policy on diesel cars has clearly affected fleet sales, another drop in February (down 2.5% year-on-year) also suggests that businesses are currently cautious in their car purchases amid significant economic and political uncertainties. Many businesses have likely become increasingly inclined to delay replacing vehicles. Newsflash: UK car sales have fallen again, as drivers continue to shun new diesel models. The SMMT reports that new car registrations dropped by 2.8% in February, compared to a year earlier, with 80,805 models sold. This is the 11th month of falling sales in a row, and means sales in 2018 are down 5.1% compared to a year ago. Diesel sales slumped by 23.5%, while petrol sales rose 14.4% and electric car sales rose by 7.2%. The SMMT says the slump in diesel registrations is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153disappointing....given the latest low emission vehicles can help address air quality issues.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd It suspects that diesel car owners are keeping their older cars for longer, following the emissions scandal (which has hurt demand for second-hand diesels). February is usually a quiet month for car sales, as buyers hang on for the new number places next month. However, the SMMT is already warning that sales could be down in March. Mike Hawes, SMMT chief executive, says: Looking ahead to the crucial number plate change month of March, we expect a further softening, given March 2017 was a record as registrations were pulled forward to avoid VED [road tax] changes.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Elliot Hentov, head of policy and research for official institutions for EMEA at State Street Global Advisors says the Italian election result should be a wake-up call to investors. He argues that the eurozone crisis, dormant for so long, isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t actually over: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The Italian status quo \u00e2\u20ac\u201c political inertia in the face of economic decline \u00e2\u20ac\u201c is simply not sustainable in the long-term and Italian voters are restless. It remains to be seen whether the Five Star Movement can actually lead a government as any other constellation looks unfeasible. The fact that a majority of votes went to parties outside of the mainstream is likely to be a warning for markets that Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s and Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s core challenges remain unresolved. All roads lead to Rome, at least when it comes to boosting the Eurozone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s viability, and markets will take note that euro assets need to reflect more than just the relatively buoyant economy. On the contrary, it is increasingly clear that the Eurozone drama is far from over, even if we may be enjoying the current intermission.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Italian bank stocks have hit a two-month low this morning, Reuters reports. Mujtaba Rahman of Eurasia Group says investors are worried that Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s populist parties would clash with Brussels over tax and spending rules, should they end up in power: Euro exit, let alone EU exit remain very unlikely, as is a meaningful revision of the EU\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s treaties to Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s favour, something both the League and Five Star have campaigned on. A bigger risk is the possibility of meaningful fiscal slippage, as either party moves to implement some of their flagship campaign pledges. This will create more friction between Rome and the European commission. Italy is already at risk of failing to comply with EU-mandated fiscal targets, and any additional slippage may result in a new Excessive Deficit Procedure. Any attempts to roll back past reforms, most notably the 2011 pension reform, will also be seen with concern by investors My colleagues have been live-blogging the Italian election through the night - and are covering all the reaction this morning: Over in Milan, the Italian stock market has fallen in early trading. The benchmark FTSE MIB index tumbled by 2% at the open. It then stabilised around 1% lower, so there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no sign of actual panic. Unicredit, Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest bank, has shed 2.5% while UBI Banca are down 3.8%. Rebecca O\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Keeffe, Head of Investment at interactive investor, says the markets are nervous. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Italy looks to have taken a step to the right and moved towards populism and change. The complexity of the Italian voting system makes it very difficult to establish what happens next and when, but neither of the anti-establishment Five star movement or League parties are an attractive option for markets or the euro.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Shares in Silvio Berlusconi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Mediaset company have fallen by over 4% after his Forza Italia party did worse than expected in Sunday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s election, lagging behind the Northern League. Mediaset has been fighting a long legal battle with France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Vivendi, and a strong showing by Forza Italia would have strengthened its hand. Italian government bonds are falling in early trading, as investors worry that the country faces a period of instability. This has pushed the interest rate (or yield) on 10-year Italian bonds up to 2.11%, from 2.03% on Friday. That suggests they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re seen as as little riskier today - especially when compared to German debt. T The euro has dipped in early trading. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s down around 0.3% at $1.228 against the US dollar following the Italian election results. Hussein Sayed, chief market strategist at FXTM, explains: The Euro found no support after Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Social Democratic party voted for a coalition deal with Angela Merkel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s CDU party. The muted Euro reaction is mainly due to worries that the Italian elections delivered a hung parliament. The European Union would have a new headache to deal with if Italy formed a Eurosceptic coalition which would undoubtedly challenge EU budget rules. Several of the Italian parties had pledged to abolish the EU\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fiscal compact, which would allow member states to borrow more. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Investors are jittery this morning as they digest Sunday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Italian election results, and brace for further ratcheting up of the tensions over Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s steel and aluminium tariffs. Over in Italy, populist parties are celebrating - even though the election has delivered a hung parliament. Around half of voters abandoned the traditional mainstream parties, delivering a stinging rebuke to the centre-left Democratic Paty. The anti-establishment Five Star Movement - no fan of the euro - came first with around 31% of the votes, according to preliminary voting. The right-wing anti-immigration Northern League also had a good night, securing 17% of the vote. That means that Silvio Berlusconi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s centre-right bloc could end up back in power. As my colleague Stephanie Kirchgaessner reports from Rome, a populist wave has swept Italy: Andrea Marcucci, one of the Democratic party\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s senators in the outgoing parliament, wrote on his Facebook page: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Voters have spoken very clearly and irrefutably. The populists have won and the Democratic party has lost.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The exit polls showed Berlusconi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s coalition \u00e2\u20ac\u201c which includes the Northern League \u00e2\u20ac\u201c winning up to 36% of the vote, a result that could potentially help the billionaire media magnate clinch a fourth election victory under a complicated Italian election law. Analysts were also poring over early data that suggested another potential political upset: Matteo Salvini, the firebrand head of La Lega \u00e2\u20ac\u201c as the Northern League is now known \u00e2\u20ac\u201c beating out Berlusconi within the centre-right coalition. Under a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153gentleman\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s agreement\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, whoever emerges as the winner between the two will choose the next prime minister, if the coalition were to win a majority. Italy now faces a period of negotiations and horse-trading as the various parties try to cobble a deal together. That uncertainty is going to hit European markets today. with Germany, France and Italy all expected to fall. There have already been losses in Asia overnight: The Italian election result distracts from the news that Angela Merkel has secured a coalition deal with Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Social Democratic Party. The markets ended last week on a low point, after president Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s plans to impose tariffs on imported steel and aluminium sparked threats of retaliation from Europe. The UK prime minister, Theresa May, has now waded in, telling Trump that Britain has \u00e2\u20ac\u0153deep concern\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd about the plan. A government spokeswoman explains: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The prime minister raised our deep concern at the president\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s forthcoming announcement on steel and aluminium tariffs, noting that multilateral action was the only way to resolve the problem of global overcapacity in all parties\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 interests. Adam Cole of Royal Bank of Canada says investors are bracing for more developments this week: Markets have a mildly risk-off tone overnight as the threat of a trade war continues to overhang. Over the weekend, administration officials in the US said there would be no exemptions to the new tariffs and reports suggest the EU could respond with reciprocal measures as early as this Wednesday.

Reacting to the threat from the US president of 25% tariffs on steel imports and 10% on aluminium, European commissioner for trade Cecilia Malmstr\u00c3\u00b6m said on Wednesday the EU was finalising its own list of American exports that could face sanctions, including steel, industrial and agricultural products. However, Malmstr\u00c3\u00b6m also said the EU still hoped to avoid a full blown trade war, despite the escalating rhetoric between the US and its main global trading partners in recent days. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153A trade war has no winners and if it does not happen for the better, then we can work with our American friends and other allies on the core issue of this problem, overcapacity,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd she told reporters at a press conference in Brussels. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153But if it does happen we will have to take measures to protect European jobs.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd More here: No sign of a recovery on Wall Street yet. The Dow is still down 1%. Billionaire investor Carl Icahn has denied acting improperly after selling $31m shares in a company dependent on steel imports. Icahn, a former special advisor to president Trump, insists that he had no knowledge of the plan to impose tariffs. In a statement, Icahn Enterprises says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t generally comment on rumors, but the recent media speculation regarding our sale of Manitowoc stock calls for a response. We state for the record: Any suggestion that we had prior knowledge of the Trump administration\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s announcement of new tariffs on steel imports is categorically untrue. We reduced our position in Manitowoc for legitimate investment reasons having nothing to do with that announcement.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Despite all these trade war worries, the UK stock market has ended the day a little higher. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s partly thanks to Rolls-Royce, which jumped after beating profit forecasts and promising more cost savings. Time for a quick recap, for any readers just tuning in. Europe has ratcheted up the pressure on Donald Trump over steel tariffs, by drawing up a list of US goods which could be hit with retaliatory action. Peanut butter, orange juice, bourbon and cranberries are all included, along with an unspecified range of industrial and steel products. Commissioner Cecilia Malmstr\u00c3\u00b6m said Brussels hopes that Trump will not impose blanket tariffs on steel imports into America. But if he does, the EC will take proportionate action. Malmstrom told reporters in Brussels that: We cannot see how the European Union, friends and allies in Nato, can be a threat to international security in the US.... It is alarming that the US would invoke this article from 1962, to introduce trade restrictions that will mainly impact traditional allies of the United States. President Trump, though, is not backing down. He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tweeted that America has suffered from bad policies and bad leadership for too long. US Steel has given Trump some good news. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s re-opening a steel furnace in Illinois and getting hundreds of staff back to work. A group of countries, including China, have raised concerns about Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s planned tariffs to the World Trade Organisation. They fear that tit-for-tat retaliations could break out. Wilbur Ross, the US commerce secretary, has pledged that America will work constructively with its allies. We won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcblow up the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, he says (something administrations don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t usually have to spell out). The US stock market has fallen in early trading. Investors are concerned that the resignation of Gary Cohn as Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s top economic advisor raises the risk of a trade war. White House advisor Peter Navarro has just told Bloomberg TV that he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not on the list to replace Gary Cohn. Navarro, a confirmed sceptic on free trade, says there is a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153deep bench\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd at the White House. He also claims that metal tariffs are good for the US economy, and will strengthen national security. Andre Bakhos, managing director at New Vines Capital of New Jersey, reckons Wall Street is anxious about the prospect of a trade war. He says (via Reuters): \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s more of the same jitters we had seen recently, with investors in this case fearing that a lack of confidence in the tariffs by Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s own people. Investors are taking risk off the table to see how much more damage in the administration this will cause.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd After that early slide the Dow has stabilised, now down 170 points (or 0.7%). Equipment and machinery giant Caterpillar is the biggest faller, down 1.5%. Demand for its trucks and diggers would fall if the global economy was hit by a trade war. Aircraft maker Boeing are down 1% -- steel tariffs could push up the cost of making new planes. Financial stocks are also in the red, with Goldman Sachs down 1.3%. DING DING! Wall Street has opened for trading, and the US stock market is taking a leg downwards. The Dow Jones industrial average shed more than 300 points at the open, a drop of 1.2%. The S&amp;P and the Nasdaq are also in the red, as investors get their first chance to respond to Gary Cohn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s resignation last night. Cohn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s resignation is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153dominating proceedings early doors\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, says Lawrence Mills of Finsa Markets. The news that Europe is drawing up a list of US goods to target, if Washington doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t back down over steel tariffs, is also casting a shadow over the New York stock exchange. Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s commerce secretary Wilbur Ross has pledged that the US won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t blow the world up in its attempt to tackle trade imbalances. I guess that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s reassuring..... CNBC has the details: Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross told CNBC on Wednesday that President Donald Trump has indicated a degree of flexibility on tariffs for Canada and Mexico. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re not trying to blow up the world. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no intention of that,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Ross said in an interview with CNBC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Squawk Box.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The president indicated the other day he has a willingness to provide an exemption to Canada and Mexico.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re not looking for a trade war. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re going to have very sensible relations with our allies,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Ross added. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We hope and we believe that at the end of the day, there will be a process of working with the other countries that are our friends.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The jump in America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade deficit will add fuel President Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s protectionist rhetoric, says Capital Economics. They add: Exports fell by 1.3% month-on-month in January, driven by a drop in goods exports, while imports were basically unchanged. In real terms, goods exports fell by 3.3%, compared to a 1.6% decline in real goods imports. Barring a big rebound in February and March, it therefore looks very likely that net trade will subtract from first quarter GDP growth, albeit by much less than the huge 1.1 percentage point drag seen in the fourth quarter. Just in: America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade deficit has swelled to its widest level in almost a decade. The Commerce Department reports that the trade gap jumped by 5% in January to $56.6bn. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s more than expected. The deficit with China has widened particularly sharply -- up 16% year-on-year to $36bn. Newsflash: US Steel has announced that it is reopening some operations at its site in Granite City, in Illinois - and giving Donald Trump the credit. The company will dust off one of two blast furnaces (\u00e2\u20ac\u0153B\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd blast furnace) and the steelmaking facilities at the site, and call back around 500 workers. CEO David Burritt says he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s responding to the president\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s plan to impose 25% tariffs on steel imports: In a statement that will be welcomed by the White House, Burritt says the US has suffered from steel dumping: Our Granite City Works facility and employees, as well as the surrounding community, have suffered too long from the unending waves of unfairly traded steel products that have flooded U.S. markets The Section 232 action announced by President Trump last week recognizes the significant threat steel imports pose to our national and economic security. The President\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s strong leadership is needed to begin to level the playing field so companies like ours can compete, win and create jobs that support our employees and the communities in which we operate as well as strengthen our national and economic security. We will continue to support our customers with the high-quality products they have come to expect from U. S. Steel.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Burritt has also been speaking on CNBC, saying he sees a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153renaissance\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s steel industry. The US stock market is still on track to fall when trading begins at 9.30am New York time (2.30pm in the UK). The Dow is being called down 250 points, or around 1%. Breaking: Some blisteringly hot US jobs figures just landed. Private sector companies across America created 235,000 new jobs in February, smashing forecasts for 195,000. That indicates the US labor market remains strong (which is what you want if you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re starting a trade war). It may also be a sign that Friday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s US jobs report (Non-Farm Payroll) will be better than expected. Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s, says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The job market is red hot and threatens to overheat. With government spending increases and tax cuts, growth is set to accelerate.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The threat of new tariffs on US goods being sold into Europe hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t forced President Trump to back down. He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tweeted a defence of his \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcMake America Great Again\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 policy: Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Associated Press\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s take on Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s threat to impose tariffs on a range of US goods if Donald Trump presses on with steel and aluminium tariffs: The European Union warned Wednesday that it is ready to retaliate against the U.S. over President Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s proposed tariffs on steel and aluminum, with counter-measures against iconic U.S. products like Harley Davidson motorcycles, Levi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s jeans and bourbon. Trade Commissioner Cecilia Malmstr\u00c3\u00b6m said that the EU, the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest trading bloc, rejects Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s reasoning that the tariffs are backed by international legal right to protect national security. Should tariffs be introduced, the EU and other partners would take the case to the World Trade Organization, she said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We cannot see how the European Union, friends and allies in NATO, can be a threat to international security in the U.S.,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Malmstr\u00c3\u00b6m told reporters in Brussels. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153From what we understand, the motivation of the U.S. is an economic safeguard measure in disguise, not a national security measure.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Trump has long railed against what he deems unfair trade practices by China and others, and last week declared that his government would levy penalties of 25% on imported steel and 10% on aluminum imports. The tariffs, he said, would remain for \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a long period of time,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd but it was not clear if certain trading partners would be exempt. Malmstr\u00c3\u00b6m said Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s motives do not appear compatible with WTO rules and that this means the EU can activate safeguards to protect its own markets. She confirmed that the EU\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s counter-measures would include tariffs on U.S. steel and agricultural products, as well as other products like bourbon, peanut butter, cranberries and orange juice. EU Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker has said that Harley Davidson motorcycles and Levi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s jeans could also be hit. The list is being circulated among EU member states for approval. The Commission also has plans in case steel from other producers is dumped on European markets. European Council president Donald Tusk has just weighed in on the issue, saying Donald Trump is wrong over trade wars: Tusk was speaking as the EU outlined its draft offer to Britain for trade after Brexit. He has ruled out giving the UK a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcpick and mix\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 approach to access to Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s markets. More details in our Politics Live blog: Newsflash: The World Trade Organisation has just revealed that 18 member states, led by China, have raised concerns over America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s steel and aluminium tariffs: Reuters has snapped the details: CHINA SPARKS WORLD TRADE ORGANIZATION DEBATE OVER U.S. TARIFFS, 17 OTHER WTO MEMBERS ALSO EXPRESS STRONG CONCERNS - WTO SPOKESMAN WTO MEMBERS SPEAKING OUT OVER U.S. TARIFF PLAN INCLUDED EU, CANADA, TURKEY, RUSSIA, AUSTRALIA, SOUTH KOREA, JAPAN, MEXICO, INDIA AND BRAZIL MANY WTO MEMBERS EXPRESSED BOTH COMMERCIAL AND SYSTEMIC CONCERNS ABOUT U.S. TARIFFS PLAN AND SAID THEY FEARED TIT-FOR-TAT TRADE ACTIONS - WTO SPOKESMAN Q: How quickly could the EC implement these countermeasure against the US? Cecilia Malmstr\u00c3\u00b6m says that Europe can bring a complaint to the WTO quite quickly. Implementing rebalancing measures (tariffs on American goods) would take more time, she says, perhaps two months. But the EC could hold back from counter-measures to see how things develop, as it still hopes that the US government won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t impose blanket tariffs that hurt European companies. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the end of the briefing. Q: Isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t there a risk that Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s measures could be found illegal, and could annoy allies around the world? Cecilia Malmstrom says the Commission is taking very serious legal advice, to make sure that any countermeasures it takes against America over steel tariffs are fully legal. The EC is also talking to major steel producers, as we don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want them to be hurt, she adds. Cecilia Malmstrom repeats that the list of US products which could face tariffs in Europe is still provisional. Changes could be made, and the final list will be made public very soon. Q: By singling out American peanut butter, orange juice and bourbon, aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t you escalating the situation rather than trying to turn the volume down? We are eager not to escalate this, Malmstrom insists, adding: We do not want this to go out of proportion. But the EU wants to have \u00e2\u20ac\u0153rebalancing\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd measure ready, in case necessary. We cannot just stay silent when such a major measure could be taken to the EU economy. Q: Might these proposed tariffs on US products break WTO rules, and are member states on side? Cecilia Malmstr\u00c3\u00b6m says the EC is very confident that its proposed actions are compatible with World Trade Organisation rules, and that there is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153very close co-operation with member states\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd on this issue. Q: Are you confident that the talk of trade wars coming out of the White House will end after the special election in Pennsylvania, where there are many steel workers? Your guess is as good as mine, Cecilia Malmstr\u00c3\u00b6m replies. But she notes that Trump did promise to take action on tariffs during his race to the White House. I hope it will not happen, as a trade war has no winners, she adds. But if it does happen, action must be taken to protect European companies and workers. Q: What US products might be hit by the tariffs being drawn up by the EU? Commissioner Cecilia Malmstr\u00c3\u00b6m says that a provisional list has been drawn up. It is being shared with EU member states now, and will be published soon. The list includes steel products, industrial products, and agricultural products, she tells reporters in Brussels, adding: Certain types of bourbon are on the list, as are other items such peanut butter, cranberries, orange juice, etc. Very soon that list will be public, so you will be able to plan your whisky drinking. Onto questions... Q: What do you think about Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s claim that the EU is unfair over trade, and his threat to impose tariffs on EU cars? Cecilia Malmstr\u00c3\u00b6m insists that there are \u00e2\u20ac\u0153only losers\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in a trade war, so Europe will respond in a proportionate and balanced way. Two million cars are produced in the US by EU manufacturers, Malmstr\u00c3\u00b6m says, creating jobs and US exports. She concedes that the EU has higher tariffs on cars than America, but on the other hand the US has higher tariffs on trucks. The European Commission has been holding intensive talks with officials in Washington for a very long time, Cecilia Malmstr\u00c3\u00b6m continues, in the hope of getting the US to rethink its tariffs. Europe still hopes that it will be excluded from the tariffs, she continues. We have made clear that if a move is taken, it will hurt the European Union and put thousands of jobs at risk - and will be met with a firm response. EU Commissioners have decided a three-pronged response, she says: The EU will prosecute its rights under the WTO It is preparing safeguards in case steel is dumped in Europe in response to America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tariffs New measures on US exports into Europe to match the losses suffered by EU exporters But Europe is still hoping that the US will not impose tariffs, so this retaliatory action can be avoided. Over in Brussels, European Commissioner Cecilia Malmstr\u00c3\u00b6m has warned that trans-Atlantic relations could be damaged by the looming tariffs on steel and aluminium. Malmstr\u00c3\u00b6m is speaking in Brussels now, outlining the European Union\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s response to Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s plans following a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dccollege meeting\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 of EU commissioners this morning. Malmstr\u00c3\u00b6m (who is sporting a natty leather jacket) says \u00e2\u20ac\u0153events in the US are moving quickly\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Malmstr\u00c3\u00b6m explains that Donald Trump may, in the coming days, sign off a decision to impose 25% tariffs on steel and 10% on aluminium imports under the section 232 review of national security. We have \u00e2\u20ac\u0153serious doubt\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd that this can be justified on national security grounds, she says. We cannot see how the European Union, friends and allies in Nato, can be a threat to international security in the US. We find that assumption \u00e2\u20ac\u0153deeply unjust\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Malmstr\u00c3\u00b6m continues: It is alarming that the US would invoke this article from 1962, to introduce trade restrictions that will mainly impact traditional allies of the United States. We also have serious doubts about whether it is compatible with the WTO rules, Malmstr\u00c3\u00b6m continues. And in a clear warning to the White House, she warns that these tariffs \u00e2\u20ac\u0153would be damaging to trans-Atlantic relations...and potentially to a global rules-based trading system.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s almost 6am in New York, so early bird financial workers will be heading to their desks soon (perhaps via the coffee shop and the gym). And when they get to work, traders are likely to be hitting the sell button as they react to the latest turmoil at the White House. The Dow Jones industrial average is currently called down 330 points (-1.4%), with losses likely on the S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq too. Uh oh... Veteran City expert George Magnus isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t impressed by the frontrunners to become Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new chief economic advisor: Patrick Chovanec, managing director of Silvercrest Asset Management, suggests a certain sort of candidate will be needed.... City traders are also fretting about Brexit, as well as trade. The pound has fallen 0.3% to a three-month low against the euro this morning, slipping to \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.116 for the first time since late November. That means one euro is worth 89.6p. The EU is due to release its draft guidelines for the upcoming trade talks between Brussels and London later today. That will show whether the two sides are converging, following Theresa May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s speech on Brexit last week. MPs have piled on the pressure, warning that UK trade could \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcfall off a cliff\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 unless EU trade agreements with some 70 countries are rolled over soon. Our Politics Live blog has all the details: European politicians have been alarmed, and disappointed, to learn of Gary Cohn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s resignation. German economy minister Brigitte Zypries has warned that the situation over tariffs is serious, adding: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I hope Trump reconsiders. Trade promotes prosperity if it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s based on exchange, on working together.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The European Commission is set to review possible countermeasures which it could launch against the US later today, if tariffs on steel and aluminium are imposed. US-made jeans, bourbon and motorbikes are all in the firing line. European Commission vice president Valdis Dombrovskis has already warned that the EU won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t stand idly by, saying: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We hope that eventually this initiative from the U.S. side will not be followed through... But it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also clear that the EU is going to react if these one-sided tariffs are going to be imposed by the U.S.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Back in the UK, house price growth has slowed to a five-year low. The Halifax bank has reported that average house prices increased by 1.8% in the three months to February compared with the same period of 2017. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the weakest annual growth since March 2013, down from 2.2% in January. It will fuel concerns that consumer confidence is weak, with the threat of rising interest rates also deterring borrowers. Emily Thornberry, the shadow foreign secretary, says she\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s very worried by the threat of a global trade war. Speaking on Bloomberg TV, she warns that it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s very easy to start these wars, and quite difficult to finish them. When a president drives his top economic advisor to resign, it creates a vacancy. So there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s plenty of speculation over who might slide into Gary Cohn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s seat and chair the Council of Economic Advisors. One option is Peter Navarro, a fiercely protectionist voice in the White House who is famously sceptical of free trade. CNBC reports that Navarro had been kept on a tight leash by chief of staff John Kelly - even ordered to cc: Cohn on all his emails. But now, Navarro seems to have won the battle and could potentially get a promotion. That could alarm the markets... Conservative economist Larry Kudlow, who served in the Reagan administration, has also been suggested. However, he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a free trade advocate, so it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tricky to see how he could back new tariffs. Kudlow has already tweeted that he asked Cohn to stay on.... President Trump has tweeted that he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll choose a successor soon: Pierre Moscovici, the European Commissioner for Economic and Financial Affairs, has tweeted his support for Gary Cohn: The markets have been choppy this week, as investors have see-sawed over how alarmed they should be about a trade war. Share fell sharply on Friday when Trump announced his plans for tariffs on steel and aluminium, but did then claw back on Monday and Tuesday. That optimism has now been punctured. Kay Van-Petersen, global macro strategist at Saxo Bank, says investors can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t risk being blas\u00c3\u00a9: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve gone from being a little bit relaxed about the trade-war thing to being quite a lot more nervous. People are not giving it as much weight as they should be\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think people are really thinking this through.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s plenty of red electronic ink on the European markets this morning, following on from the drops in Asia: Investors are worried that Gary Cohn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s departure removes a key opponent to Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s protectionist leanings. Matt Simpson, senior market analyst at Faraday Research, explains: The revolving door in the Whitehouse gets another spin, but the ramifications from Cohn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s exit has the potential to be huge. As his departure was announced after the US markets closed we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re yet to see a real reaction from the US. But as Cohn was Wall Street\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s main man in Washington, we doubt they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be so happy about it. An advocate of free trade and the biggest critic of tariffs, markets fear his absence from the White House could make the tariffs inevitable. Such tariffs didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t work out well for the Bush administration, so its difficult for markets to fathom a better outcome this time around. Mining stocks are falling this morning, helping to drag the London stock market into negative territory. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s due to fears that a trade war will hurt global growth, and dent demand for copper, zinc, iron ore and coal. Anglo American have lost 1.8%, with Glencore shedding 1.7% and BHP Billiton down 1.3%. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re not looking at a crash, thankfully, but the markets are certainly edgy this morning: Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock market has followed Asia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s lead, downwards. The FTSE 100 has shed 35 points, or 0.5%, at the open to 7113 -- towards the 14-month low struck on Friday when president Trump announced his tariffs. Other European markets are also dipping, as news of Gary Cohn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s departure rattles the markets. Neil Wilson of ETX Capital says the changes of a full-on trade war have increased: The implication is that without the restraining influence of Cohn on Trump, the president will now have a free hand to press ahead with further tariffs and generally up the ante on trade. Clearly he fought back on trade and lost. Goldman Sach\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s CEO Lloyd Blankfein has tweeted his support for his former colleague, saying he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s disappointed that Gary Cohn is leaving the White House. Rob Carnell of ING fears that investors have been too complacent about the risks of a trade war blowing up: The breaking news this morning is that Gary Cohn, Director of the National Economic Council, is resigning over the issue. Trump, for now, seems unbowed. A 25% tariff on EU cars is his response to potential retaliation to the aluminium and steel tariffs by the EU. It won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t end there. It is hard not to characterise current market behaviour as complacent. Analysts at City firm FXPro warn that Cohn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s departure removes an important voice from the White House: Markets are in risk-off mode this morning, as news broke just after the US market close yesterday that Presidents Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Chief Economic Advisor, Gary Cohn, resigned after a clash with the president due to the implementation of trade tariffs. Cohn was an advocate of free trade and his resignation will dent market confidence in the administration. This leaves an imbalance in the administration, with an unopposed cadre of officials supporting trade tariffs, which could lead to a trade war developing as protectionist policies take hold. Jasper Lawler of CMC Markets says Trump seems to have won the argument over tariffs: With Cohn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s steadying influence no longer steering economic policy in the Trump administration, in addition to Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s recommitment to his nationalist trade agenda, market participants are growing increasingly nervous of where the Trump administration is going. As a result Dow futures plummet 300 points after the bell. The US dollar has hit a two-week low against a basket of currencies this morning, as traders ditch the greenback in favour of the yen. A wave of selling swept through Asia-Pacific markets after Gary Cohn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s resignation hit the wires. Nearly every market is in the red - including Australia (-1%), Hong Kong (0.9%), Tokyo (0.7%) and Shanghai (-0.75%). Money also poured into the Japanese yen - a traditional safe-haven asset. Jingyi Pan, a market strategist at IG in Singapore, says investors are nervously awaiting for more details of Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tariff plans. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153For the markets, Gary Cohn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s departure certainly points strongly to the likelihood that little can halt the President from going ahead with his tariff plans and may mark more volatility to come for markets,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Perhaps the biggest thing to look forward to on this topic will be the details of the plans at the moment, to gain a better gauge of the extent of the impact, whereupon more volatility may be unleashed.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Trade war fears are sweeping through the financial markets today after Gary Cohn became the latest official to quit the White House - over Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s plans for new tariffs on steel and aluminium. Cohn, a former top Goldman Sach\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s executive, quit as Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s top economic advisor after failing to persuade the president not to impose blanket tariffs on imports into America. His resignation could dash hopes that Trump might be steered away from protectionist policies -- and raises the chances of a full-blown trade war with retaliatory action from Europe, Canada and China. As we reported overnight: Cohn said in a statement issued by the White House that it had been \u00e2\u20ac\u0153an honor to serve my country and enact pro-growth economic policies to benefit the American people, in particular the passage of historic tax reform\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Cohn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s departure represents another blow to the administration, which has suffered several high-profile resignations since the election. Hope Hicks, Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s close aide and communications director, quit last week, and other senior figures to have left include Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s former chief of staff, Reince Priebus, and former chief strategist, Steve Bannon. Royal Bank of Canada analysts say Trump could be gearing up for a big fight on trade: Cohn staunchly opposed the invocation of Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act to impose steel and aluminum tariffs and his resignation has been taken as a strong indication Trump would go ahead with a set of less measured tariffs, risking a larger trade war. Adding to those fears, Trump is said to be considering a clampdown on Chinese investment in the US and broader tariffs in retaliation for alleged intellectual property theft. Asian markets swiftly fell - with Japan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Nikkei losing 1.6% at one stage (more on that shortly). The futures market is predicting chunky losses on Wall Street later today, with the Dow called down around 350 points (1.4%). European markets are also tipped to open lower, with the FTSE 100 called down 40-ish points The agenda: 8.30am GMT: Halifax house price figures for February 10am GMT: Updated eurozone GDP data for Q4 2017 3pm GMT: Bank of Canada\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s interest rate decision 3.30pm GMT: US crude oil inventory figures",

Snapchat wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t, because of the might of Facebook and its Instagram service. Snapchat is a second-tier player: Spotify and Dropbox are top-tier players. It is a completely different ballgame.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd</p> <p>Some big names are counting on Ek and his counterpart at Dropbox, Drew Houston. Lining up behind Dropbox and Spotify are ride-hailing service Uber \u00e2\u20ac\u201c given a notional value of $50bn in 2015 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and the short-term letting agency Airbnb. The former isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t profitable; the latter is. With markets jittery, both Spotify and Dropbox are working hard to push a story of future profits and growth.</p> <p>On Wednesday, Spotify used a web presentation to reassure would-be investors that it has a clear path to profit, pointing out that revenues grew 39% to \u00e2\u201a\u00ac4.1bn (\u00c2\u00a33.6bn) in 2017, though financing costs from a \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1bn loan helped push operating losses up 8% to \u00e2\u201a\u00ac378m. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The trend towards profitability is clear when you look at operating losses as a percentage of revenue,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd it said soothingly.</p> <p>Spotify is also taking an unusual approach to its listing \u00e2\u20ac\u201c going direct, so that its shares aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t handled by an investment bank or underwriters, but simply offered from the company on the exchange to would-be buyers.</p> <p>Analysing that approach last year, the <a href=\"http://fortune.com/2017/04/07/spotify-ipo-direct-listing/\" title=\"\">business magazine <em>Fortune</em> said</a>: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153If an IPO is like a wedding, a direct listing is running off to elope. A faster, easier, cheaper route to the same result.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Of course, like an elopement, you might not get the big benefits: an IPO guarantees money from institutional buyers snapping up millions of shares. A direct listing could flop.</p> <p>Others aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t so sure about Spotify\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s potential, based on its finances and its business model. Spotify users have the option of a free service, in exchange for listening to adverts intermittently, or paying a monthly subscription fee of \u00c2\u00a39.99, $9.99 or \u00e2\u201a\u00ac9.99 for no-advert streaming. It is a compelling service with 71 &#xa0;million paying users, but the cost in payments to artists and record companies is huge: it has forked out $9bn in royalties since it launched.</p> <p>According to one investor, Spotify\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s gross margin \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a measure of profitability once certain costs are stripped out \u00e2\u20ac\u201c is not high enough and indicates that royalty rates have to come down. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153A 20% gross margin business is not a good business,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd says venture capitalist David B Pakman. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153One of two things has to happen: they have to enter new business lines with higher gross margins, or somehow magically transform the rate structure with labels.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The latter rate is how much Spotify has to pay per track streamed.</p> <p>Dropbox, meanwhile, was valued at $10bn when it last raised capital in 2014, but that has been slashed to between $7bn and $8bn for its forthcoming IPO, which is intended to raise about $610m. Steve Jobs was famously dismissive of the company: in a 2009 meeting, the late Apple chief <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2012/01/23/dld-2012-drew-houston-yes-steve-jobs-called-dropbox-a-feature/\" title=\"\">told</a> Houston that he had \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a feature, not a product\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. In other words: Apple or Microsoft or Google could add Dropbox\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s functionality \u00e2\u20ac\u201c you drop a file in the folder on your PC, and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s available on your phone or tablet \u00e2\u20ac\u201c to their existing software for free.</p> <p>Houston shrugged off Jobs\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s disdain to build a company that in 2017 had 500 million users and $1.11bn in revenues. Not bad for a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153feature\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"9b00a5b0e8306bb74190791c9d69a2308ed3c8ef\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9b00a5b0e8306bb74190791c9d69a2308ed3c8ef/0_0_1992_2490/800.jpg\" alt=\"Spotify\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Daniel Ek\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Spotify\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Daniel Ek has some big startups watching his IPO closely.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ilya S Savenok/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>So why has its notional value gone down? Partly it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s revenues: in the absence of profits (it made a net loss of $112m in 2017, almost halved from $210m in 2016), a typical measure of capitalisation is a five- or six-fold revenue multiple. With <a href=\"https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1467623/000119312518055809/d451946ds1.htm\" title=\"\">the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s filings</a> showing revenues up 31% in 2017, the $7bn figure looks reasonable compared to rivals such as Box, which does the same file synchronisation but with a focus on commercial clients.</p> <p>\u00e2\u20ac\u0153The pricing [for Dropbox] had to come down to lure in the investors,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd says Phil Davis of the investment advice service Phil\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Stock World. Eric Schiffer, of private equity company the Patriarch Organization, calls the pricing \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a slap in the face to investors of the 2014 round\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd.</p> <p>It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s therefore starting to look as though the sky-high valuations of a few years ago were mistakes born of over-optimistic expectations. In 2012, the venture capitalist Bill Gurley <a href=\"http://abovethecrowd.com/2012/02/23/why-dropbox-is-a-major-disruption/\" title=\"\">called Dropbox \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a major disruption\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd</a>, saying that Houston and his team had \u00e2\u20ac\u0153taken a hard problem \u00e2\u20ac\u201c file synchronisation \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and made it brain-dead simple\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. But now such synchronisation is a feature offered by almost everyone. Microsoft has OneDrive, Apple has iCloud, Google has Drive.</p> <p>Dropbox\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s broader problem is also its biggest opportunity. Of its 500 million users (of which 100 million signed up in 2017), only about 11 million pay for its extra features, such as more storage, administrative tracking, and integration with Microsoft Office.</p> <p>With only 2% of users paying, there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s plenty of headroom for revenue growth: Spotify\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s figure of 71&#xa0;million paying users from a total of 159 million is an impressive 44%. Dropbox\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s challenge is persuading people to flip over to paying for something they can largely get for free: Apple and Google both offer unlimited photo storage and as much free file storage as Dropbox.</p> <p>So, for both companies, plenty of ancillary questions remain over these valuations. Is Dropbox really a product? Or has the march of technology turned it into just another feature? And will Spotify ever make a profit when its margins seem to be determined by its suppliers \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the record labels? Investors\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 feelings about the answers to those questions could have a knock-on effect on many other &#xa0;businesses.</p>",

The former isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t profitable; the latter is. With markets jittery, both Spotify and Dropbox are working hard to push a story of future profits and growth. On Wednesday, Spotify used a web presentation to reassure would-be investors that it has a clear path to profit, pointing out that revenues grew 39% to \u00e2\u201a\u00ac4.1bn (\u00c2\u00a33.6bn) in 2017, though financing costs from a \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1bn loan helped push operating losses up 8% to \u00e2\u201a\u00ac378m. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The trend towards profitability is clear when you look at operating losses as a percentage of revenue,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd it said soothingly. Spotify is also taking an unusual approach to its listing \u00e2\u20ac\u201c going direct, so that its shares aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t handled by an investment bank or underwriters, but simply offered from the company on the exchange to would-be buyers. Analysing that approach last year, the business magazine Fortune said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153If an IPO is like a wedding, a direct listing is running off to elope. A faster, easier, cheaper route to the same result.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Of course, like an elopement, you might not get the big benefits: an IPO guarantees money from institutional buyers snapping up millions of shares. A direct listing could flop. Others aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t so sure about Spotify\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s potential, based on its finances and its business model. Spotify users have the option of a free service, in exchange for listening to adverts intermittently, or paying a monthly subscription fee of \u00c2\u00a39.99, $9.99 or \u00e2\u201a\u00ac9.99 for no-advert streaming. It is a compelling service with 71 million paying users, but the cost in payments to artists and record companies is huge: it has forked out $9bn in royalties since it launched. According to one investor, Spotify\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s gross margin \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a measure of profitability once certain costs are stripped out \u00e2\u20ac\u201c is not high enough and indicates that royalty rates have to come down. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153A 20% gross margin business is not a good business,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd says venture capitalist David B Pakman. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153One of two things has to happen: they have to enter new business lines with higher gross margins, or somehow magically transform the rate structure with labels.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The latter rate is how much Spotify has to pay per track streamed. Dropbox, meanwhile, was valued at $10bn when it last raised capital in 2014, but that has been slashed to between $7bn and $8bn for its forthcoming IPO, which is intended to raise about $610m. Steve Jobs was famously dismissive of the company: in a 2009 meeting, the late Apple chief told Houston that he had \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a feature, not a product\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. In other words: Apple or Microsoft or Google could add Dropbox\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s functionality \u00e2\u20ac\u201c you drop a file in the folder on your PC, and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s available on your phone or tablet \u00e2\u20ac\u201c to their existing software for free. Houston shrugged off Jobs\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s disdain to build a company that in 2017 had 500 million users and $1.11bn in revenues. Not bad for a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153feature\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. So why has its notional value gone down? Partly it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s revenues: in the absence of profits (it made a net loss of $112m in 2017, almost halved from $210m in 2016), a typical measure of capitalisation is a five- or six-fold revenue multiple. With the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s filings showing revenues up 31% in 2017, the $7bn figure looks reasonable compared to rivals such as Box, which does the same file synchronisation but with a focus on commercial clients. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The pricing [for Dropbox] had to come down to lure in the investors,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd says Phil Davis of the investment advice service Phil\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Stock World. Eric Schiffer, of private equity company the Patriarch Organization, calls the pricing \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a slap in the face to investors of the 2014 round\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s therefore starting to look as though the sky-high valuations of a few years ago were mistakes born of over-optimistic expectations. In 2012, the venture capitalist Bill Gurley called Dropbox \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a major disruption\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, saying that Houston and his team had \u00e2\u20ac\u0153taken a hard problem \u00e2\u20ac\u201c file synchronisation \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and made it brain-dead simple\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. But now such synchronisation is a feature offered by almost everyone. Microsoft has OneDrive, Apple has iCloud, Google has Drive. Dropbox\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s broader problem is also its biggest opportunity. Of its 500 million users (of which 100 million signed up in 2017), only about 11 million pay for its extra features, such as more storage, administrative tracking, and integration with Microsoft Office. With only 2% of users paying, there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s plenty of headroom for revenue growth: Spotify\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s figure of 71 million paying users from a total of 159 million is an impressive 44%. Dropbox\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s challenge is persuading people to flip over to paying for something they can largely get for free: Apple and Google both offer unlimited photo storage and as much free file storage as Dropbox. So, for both companies, plenty of ancillary questions remain over these valuations. Is Dropbox really a product? Or has the march of technology turned it into just another feature? And will Spotify ever make a profit when its margins seem to be determined by its suppliers \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the record labels? Investors\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 feelings about the answers to those questions could have a knock-on effect on many other businesses.",

                "bodyText":"Time for a recap: Around $36bn has been wiped off Facebook\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s market capitalisation, after its worst day\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trading in several years. Shares slumped by 6.7% after a whistleblower revealed a vast data breach that affected tens of millions of people. Politicians on both sides of the Atlantic are demanding answers. In America, senators are pushing for senior executives to be questioned on Capitol Hill. The Connecticut Attorney General is also opening a probe. In the UK, the information commissioner is launching an investigation. The ICO may search the offices of Cambridge Analytica on Tuesday, after Theresa May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s spokesperson expressed concern over the revelations. Tonight, Channel 4 have revealed how the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bosses talked of using honey traps, spies and fake news to help clients World stock markets were also dragged down by worries that Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s steel and aluminium tariffs would spark a trade war. In London, the FTSE 100 sagged to a 15-month low That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s all for today. Thanks for reading and commenting. Just in: the Connecticut Attorney General is launching an investigation into Facebook. It will centre on the Observer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s revelations that the Facebook profiles of 50 million people were harvested by Cambridge Analytica. Attorney General George Jepsen says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153News reports that personal user information from Facebook profiles was provided to third parties without user consent are concerning and raise serious questions about how this happened in the specific situation involving Cambridge Analytica and about Facebook\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s policies and practices more generally. Today, my office has in writing initiated an inquiry asking Facebook to answer a series of questions about this matter. While we cannot comment further at this time, Connecticut residents should know that my office takes privacy matters very seriously, and we will move as quickly as we responsibly can to get to the bottom of this situation.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Bloomberg have more details of the growing pressure to make top tech executives face a Capitol Hill grilling: U.S. Senators Amy Klobuchar, a Democrat from Minnesota, and John Kennedy, a Republican from Louisiana, have called on the chairman of the Judiciary Committee to bring in technology company CEOs, including from Twitter Inc. and Alphabet Inc.\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Google, for public questioning In a letter Monday to Senator Chuck Grassley, a Republican from Iowa, Klobuchar and Kennedy said they have \u00e2\u20ac\u0153serious concern regarding recent reports that data from millions of American was misused in order to influence voters.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The lack of oversight on how data is stored and how political advertisements are sold raises concerns about the integrity of American elections as well as privacy rights,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd the senators wrote. A hearing with the CEOs would allow the committee to learn \u00e2\u20ac\u0153what is being done to protect Americans\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 data and limit abuse of the platforms, as well as to assess what measures should be taken before the next elections.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Global stock markets are now on their worst run since last November, according to Reuters data. Facebook was obviously one factor behind today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s selloff. But, traders are also worried about a protectionist trade war breaking out. This overshadowed the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcBrexit breakthrough\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 between the UK and Brussels over a transition deal this morning. Breaking! Around $36bn has been wiped off Facebook\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s value today, as trading ends in New York after a rough session. Shares in the embattled social media giant ended down 6.7% at $172.5. That looks to be its biggest one-day loss in four years (and its biggest drop in value ever). That takes Facebook\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s market capitalisation down to just over $500bn, from $537bn on Friday night. Other tech stocks also suffered, dragging the Nasdaq down by 1.8%. The broad S&amp;P 500 index fell by 1.4%, with Facebook the biggest faller. Facebook\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision to hire a data forensic firm to examine the claims against Cambridge Analytica has caused some concern. Particularly as the UK Information Commissioner is planning to obtain a warrant on Tuesday to search its offices. New details of Cambridge Analytica\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s activities are emerging tonight. Undercover Channel 4 News reporters have recorded CEO Alexander Nix discussing the tactics it used. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a flavour: In a series of meetings with a reporter posing as a representative of a wealthy Sri Lankan family seeking political influence, Cambridge Analytica executives initially denied the company was in the business of using entrapment techniques. But Nix later detailed the dirty tricks the company would be prepared to pull behind the scenes to help its clients. When the reporter asked if Cambridge Analytica could offer investigations into the damaging secrets of rivals, Nix said it worked with former spies from Britain and Israel to look for political dirt. He also volunteered that his team were ready to go further than an investigation. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Oh, we do a lot more than that,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said over dinner at an exclusive hotel in London. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Deep digging is interesting, but you know equally effective can be just to go and speak to the incumbents and to offer them a deal that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s too good to be true and make sure that that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s video recorded. Newsflash: Facebook has just released a statement, saying it has hired a forensics firm to investigate the claims against Cambridge Analytica. The social media giant says that Cambridge academic Aleksandr Kogan, who orchestrated the harvesting of Facebook data, has verbally agreed to take part in the audit. Whistleblower Christopher Wylie has \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcthus far declined\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, Facebook says. The Wall Street selloff is gathering pace. Facebook\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s problems seem to be sparking wider alarm in the markets, with investors also worried about the risk of a trade war (and the prospect of a US interest rate rise on Wednesday) With just over an hour\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trading to go, the Nasdaq is down almost 3% while the Dow is staring at a 450-point loss (-1.8%). More than $100bn has been wiped off the value of America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest tech companies today. Facebook is the worst performer (-7%), shedding around $35bn at pixel time. According to the Financial Times, that is one of the ten biggest one-day losses (in dollar terms) ever suffered by a technology company. Every member of the Nasdaq is currently in the red; Alphabet/Google is down 3.5%, Amazon are down 2.3%, NVIDIA has lost 4.8%, Apple is off 2% and Microsoft has shed 2.2%. The revelations about how Cambridge Analytica harvested tens of millions of Facebook profiles is fuelling calls for tighter regulation of the tech sector. And if that happens, the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest technology firms could find their growth squeezed, making it hard to justify their immense valuations (Facebook is still worth half a trillion dollars, despite today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s share price slide) Jake Dollarhide of Longbow Asset Management believes the implications could be huge. He says (via Reuters): \u00e2\u20ac\u0153There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the thought that the government might try to regulate tech. You open a slippery slope. If you regulate Facebook what\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s to say that wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have a domino effect. Google, maybe Uber?\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd What\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s to stop the government for getting its fingers in all these areas. People have thought right now the tech growth rate has no boundaries, no ceiling. Today people are beginning to question that. If it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the case now, will it still be the case in the future.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd US senator Amy Klobuchar, who represents Minnesota, is calling for top tech executives including Mark Zuckerberg to be called to account: Facebook\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s share price is stubbornly in the red, and on track for its worst day in five years: The UK government has weighed in on the unfolding Facebook data story. Theresa May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s spokesman has said the PM backs an investigation by the information commissioner into the use of Facebook data by Cambridge Analytica, adding: The allegations are clearly very concerning, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s essential people can have confidence that their personal data can be protected and used in an appropriate way. More here: It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a grim start to the week for stock markets, as a combination of factors leave investors nursing losses. The technology sector has been hit by the Facebook controversy, and in the UK, the slump in Micro Focus shares following a profit warning. There is also nervousness ahead of this week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Federal Reserve meeting, which is expected to sanction another interest rate rise. The interest will be in seeing whether new Fed chair Jerome Powell hints at three or four increases in total this year. Signs of some agreement in the Brexit transition talks has lifted the pound to a one month high against the dollar. But the strength of sterling has helped push the FTSE 100 to its lowest level since December 2016. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 fell 121.21 points or 1.69% to 7042.93 Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax dropped 1.39% to 12,217.02 France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac closed down 1.13% at 5222.84 Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB finished 0.98% lower at 22,633.10 Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ibex ended down 0.99% at 9664.1 In Greece, the Athens market lost 0.79% to 807.44 On Wall Street the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 429 points or 1.72%. The Facebook controversy means investors are shying away from risk in general, sayd Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at IG: Markets are in full retreat this afternoon, and the drop has been exemplified by a triple-digit decline on the FTSE 100. The index has returned to December 2016 levels, a remarkable change from last when it was riding high above 7200. Devoid of big macro data, investors have focused on the growing scandal at Facebook and this has resulted in a full-blown flight from risk. Investors have begun to fear that the social media giant has encountered its first real obstacle, and that further investigation will uncover other data breaches. The market has been in love with Facebook for a long time now, but with questions surrounding other tech giants and their use of data, it could be only a matter of time until others of the hitherto untouchable \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcFANG\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 stocks find themselves dragged into an official investigation. Another retailer in trouble, as US jewellery and accessories group Claire\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s files for bankruptcy. The company said its international operations were not included but it does plan to cut back on the number of its stores in Europe. The full story is here: Meanwhile in the UK, Carpetright shares are down 17.5% and Mothercare has lost 12.5% as investors fret about store closures and future prospects for both chains. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not getting any better for Facebook. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shares are now down 7% in the wake of the Cambridge Analytica controversy. The technology gloom on both sides of the Atlantic, including worries about an EU tax and in the UK the slump in Micro Focus shares, is one of the reasons for the day\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s market weakness. On Wall Street the Nasdaq Composite is down 2%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average has lost 280 points or 1.1%. Investors are also nervous ahead of this week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Federal Reserve meeting. A rate rise announcement on Wednesday is almost a done deal, but there is much nervousness about whether there will be three or four increases in total this year. In Europe, Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax is down 1.2% and France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac is 0.89% lower while the FTSE 100 has fallen 1.59%, not helped by a stronger pound after positive noises from the Brexit negotiations. Jasper Lawler, head of research at London Capital Group, said: A sharp decline in tech stocks, US politcal tension between and a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcdeath cross\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 on Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s benchmark DAX index were all weighing on sentiment. Investors are extra touchy in the lead up to Wednesday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FOMC meeting and the first press conference from new Fed Chair Jerome Powell. The death cross, when the 50 day moving average crosses below the two-hundred day moving average, is a technical indication that the price trend for German stocks has turned downwards. Tech stocks saw some of the biggest declines on the day. Facebook\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s monopoly on personal data has put the company under the microscope again. There has been public outcry over the use of personal data harvested from Facebook data by Cambridge Analytica for use in election campaigns. The latest data scandal might well be the straw that breaks the camel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s back for tighter industry regulation. Tighter regulation of how data is collected and used will inevitably curb growth for tech and social media companies that use the data to attract advertisers. Back with Facebook, and the company could now face regulation, sayis Peter Garnry, head of equity strategy at Saxo Bank: Facebook shares are down almost 4% as the Cambridge Analytica Files were revealed over the weekend by the Guardian. The files expose a major data scandal that Facebook did little to contain or correct. This scandal will fuel into the Mueller investigation and potentially pave the way for the regulation of Facebook as the social media platform is a national security asset because people\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s behaviour can be impacted through the network. Garney also warns about the impact of the EU Commission considering a technology tax of 3% on revenues: This is move to make technology companies, that are extensively using transfer pricing to avoid taxes in high tax rate countries, to pay more to society. These are just the first signs that major technology companies will be more regulated in the future. It is key for long-term investors in technology to have this on the radar. On a day when markets in Europe and the US are heavily in negative territory, Barclays is one exception to the rule. The bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shares are up nearly 4% after it emerged that activist investor Edward Bramson had taken control of a 5% stake through his Sherborne Investors. It owns 1.94% of the bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shares directly and the rest of the 5% through derivatives. Russ Mould, AJ Bell investment director, said: Sherborne has built a formidable reputation for squeezing improved financial and operational performance from the companies in which it invests and Edward Bramson clearly feels that Barclays shares are going cheap, given the prevailing discount to the book, or net asset value. The question now is what the activist investor thinks Barclays should be doing differently and how he intends to get those views across to the bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s boss, Jes Staley. The fall in Facebook\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s value has also hit founder Mark Zuckerberg\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s personal wealth. His stake in the business has fallen by around $4bn in the wake of the Cambridge Analytica controversy. But don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t worry too much. He is still worth around $71bn, making him the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fourth richest person according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sell off has wiped some $27bn off Facebook\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s value, as investors react to the revelations about its relationship with Cambridge Analytica. Breaking: Shares in Facebook have fallen at the start of trading in New York, after the social media giant was hit by a major data scandal. Yesterday, the Observer reported that data analytics firm Cambridge Analytica had harvested the Facebook profiles of millions of US voters, and used them to built a sophisticated tools to predict, and influence, how they would vote. The disclosure creates some huge questions for Facebook, as Cambridge Analytica worked for Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s successful election campaign. As my colleague Carole Cadwalladr reported: Christopher Wylie, who worked with a Cambridge University academic to obtain the data, told the Observer: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We exploited Facebook to harvest millions of people\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s profiles. And built models to exploit what we knew about them and target their inner demons. That was the basis the entire company was built on.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Documents seen by the Observer, and confirmed by a Facebook statement, show that by late 2015 the company had found out that information had been harvested on an unprecedented scale. However, at the time it failed to alert users and took only limited steps to recover and secure the private information of more than 50 million individuals. Facebook is now facing criticism from politicians on both sides of the Atlantic. There are with suggestions that founder Mark Zuckerberg could be summoned to the UK parliament to answer questions. Conservative MP Damian Collins, who chairs the House of Commons digital, culture, media and sport select committee, has said he plans to recall Cambridge Analytica\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s CEO to explain why he told MPs last month that his company had not received data from Facebook. Collins says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We will be contacting Alexander Nix next week asking him to explain his comments\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Tech shares are also being hit by reports that Brussels is preparing to impose a digital tax on the EU revenues of companies such as Google, Facebook and Apple. Facebook is leading the selloff, falling from $185 per share to below $176 in early trading. Ding ding. The New York stock market has opened, and stocks are dropping in a broad-based selloff. The Dow Jones industrial average has shed around 100 points, or 0.4%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq is down almost 1%. Adam Leyland of The Grocer reckons the Conviviality crisis began after it floated on the stock market in 2013, and started executing ambitious takeover deal to consolidate the drinks trade. He point out that the company changed CFOs last autumn, and has also been hit by recent bad weather and the post-festive slump. Leyland writes: It seems incredible that a business could unravel as quickly as Conviviality has. But with tighter margins and sales commonplace after Christmas, plus tough trading and the snow to contend with, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not inconceivable that an operation can quickly lose control of cashflow. And you lose it at your peril. The Grocer: Why has Conviviality spent out on company-owned stores? Newsflash: The CEO of Conviviality, which owns the Bargain Booze and Wine Rack chains, has resigned. Diana Hunter has stepped down with immediate effect, the company says, less than a week after the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shares were suspended after two profits warnings. Conviviality is in a pickle. Firstly, it revealed that a spreadsheet error meant profits this year would be \u00c2\u00a35.2m lower than expected. That was compounded last week when it discovered an unpaid \u00c2\u00a330m tax bill. Conviviality, which is also a drinks wholesaler, is urgently seeking fresh funds from investors. Last week, Sky News reported that some were demanding Hunter\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s exit in return for their support. Brexit means colour-coding! The new draft Brexit deal text has been neatly shaded to show areas where there is full agreement (green), political agreement (yellow) and areas which are still under discussion (white0). It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s official! Britain and the EU have taken a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153decisive step\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd towards withdrawal agreement, says Michel Barnier in Brussels. After intensive work, the two sides have jointly published a new version of the draft withdrawal deal for Brexit, says Barnier at his joint press-conference with David Davis. This includes \u00e2\u20ac\u0153complete accord\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd on citizens right and Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s financial settlement. But.. Barnier also cautions that a step is just a step - a lot of work remains to be done, especially on the Ireland border issue. So, they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re closer, but they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re not there yet. The pound is pushing a little higher, now up 0.7% against both the US dollar (to $1.405), and the euro (to \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.147). Politics Live has full details. Disappointingly, another 46 Carillion workers have been made redundant today by the Official Receiver. The receiver was unable to find fresh employment for these staff, following Carillion\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fall into liquidation two months ago. This takes the total laid off to 1,582. In better news, 71 workers have been successfully transferred to a new supplier, which means 8,592 jobs have been saved - or almost half Carillion\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s workers. That leaves around 7,000 workers who are still working on outsourced public or private sector contracts which haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t yet been transferred to a new operator, or cancelled. The surge in the pound is helping to drag Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE 100 down to a two-week low. Micro Focus is also doing its bit - shares are down a staggering 55% after this morning\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s gloomy update. This has helped wipe 90 points off the Footsie, or 1.2%. Other European markets are also starting the new week rather, er, weakly, with losses in Frankfurt (-0.9%), Paris (-0.7%), Milan (-0.4%) and Madrid (-0.5%) Investors are edgy ahead of several big news events this week, including the G20 finance ministers meeting in Buenos Aires (ending tomorrow), and Wednesday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Federal Reserve meeting which is likely to lead to a hike in US interest rates. Fed chair Jerome Powell\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s first press conference since replacing Janet Yellen will give the markets an insight into his thinking, and the likely pace of future rate hikes. A frisson of excitement is rippling through the foreign exchange floors, amid rumours of a Brexit breakthough. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Brexit secretary David David is meeting with chief EU negotiator Michel Barnier now, ahead of the crunch EU summit later this week. And there are rumours that the two men will announce that the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcbroad\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 terms of a transition deal have been agreed. If so, that would calm fears that Britain would crash over the cliff-edge into a hard Brexit in March 2019. The pound has gained almost a cent against the US dollar to $1.40, and is up 0.5% against the euro to \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.14 (both the highest levels since February) Barnier and Davis are due to hold a press conference at around 12.45pm Brussels time (11.45am GMT). Our Politics Live blog will have all the action (plus the latest on the Skripal poisoning). Back to GKN.... and Melrose has swiftly rubbished today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s news that America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dana will list shares in London if it succeeds in merging with GKN\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s auto business. A Melrose spokeswoman argues that City investors will still lose out, due to London\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s listing rules. \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcA secondary UK listing will make little difference to the problems it creates for UK holders with Ohio-headquartered Dana maintaining its primary listing on the New York Stock Exchange. Without a primary UK listing the shares will remain outside the investment mandate of many UK funds who benchmark their performance against the UK indices. Such a listing does not allow indexation, so UK tracker funds can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t hold the shares. Perhaps more significantly many of the UK listing rules which govern corporate behaviour, such as shareholder approval for significant acquisitions, do not apply to a standard listing. There will still be a major flowback issue which has implications for the underlying price the shares are offered at. Basically, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a fudge which is unattractive to UK shareholders\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 In a busy morning for takeover news, UK property group Hammerson is fending off an approach from French mall operator Kl\u00c3\u00a9pierre. Kl\u00c3\u00a9pierre has announced this morning that it approached Hammerson about a possible \u00c2\u00a35bn offer. If it went through, it would thwart Hammerson\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s attempt to merge with rival Intu and create Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest property firm. Hammerson has swiftly rejected Kl\u00c3\u00a9pierre\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s approach as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153entirely opportunistic\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and without merit, even though the 615p per share offer is around 40% over Hammerson\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s value last week. Hammerson shares have jumped 25% this morning, as traders anticipate a bidding battle for the company - which owns 37 shopping centres and retail parks including Birmingham\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Bullring shopping centre. More here: Reuters reckons the takeover battle for GKN is heating up today, with both sides sweetening their pitch to shareholders. They write: Melrose, making a hostile bid, said it would inject about 1 billion pounds ($1.39 billion) into GKN\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pension scheme, its latest attempt to convince shareholders to back its offer and win over political opponents of the deal. Shareholders have until March 29 to decide on that offer. GKN is trying to fight off the Melrose bid with an alternative $6.1 billion deal to merge its automotive business with U.S. company Dana Incorporated leaving GKN focused on its aerospace division. Dana said on Monday it would seek a secondary listing in London, enabling more UK shareholders to back the rival plan as some funds are subject to rules which prevent them from holding US stock. The US company also promised GKN investors a slice of its dividend as it said it would pay its current quarterly dividend of $0.10 per share to the enlarged shareholder base. Bloomberg\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Sam Unsted says it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s turning into a full-blown saga: Over in the City, investors have been distracted from the GKN-Melrose battle by a truly grim announcement from tech firm Micro Focus. Micro Focus, a FTSE 100-listed software provider, warned that revenues will fall by between 6% and 9% this year, which will eat into profits. It blames integration problems following its \u00c2\u00a36.8bn takeover of Hewlett Packard Enterprise\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s software business last autumn, a deal that made Micro Focus Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest tech company. Micro Focus admits that it has struggled to implement its new IT system, which hit sales - leading to sales people quitting the business. Splitting HP\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s software operations from the rest of the business has caused further disruption to customer accounts, it admits, making it harder to win sales. Quite a mess. CEO Chris Hsu has resigned and is leaving with immediate effect to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153spend more time with his family and pursue another opportunity\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Micro Focus insists it can fix these problems, and that the HP deal makes sense. But shareholders have reacted by wiping 50% off Micro Focus\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s share price. The unions who represent GKN employees across the UK will demand answers from Melrose over its plans for the company, when they meet today. Many GKN workers fear for their future, as Melrose\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s business model is to buy companies, make them more profitable, and then sell them again. One person\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcasset-stripper\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 is another one\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcturnaround specialist\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, of course. But unions are concerned that Melrose could load GKN up with debt, and take a dangerously short-term approach. Unite\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s assistant general secretary Steve Turner has warned: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Melrose\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bosses have been far from clear about the detail of their true intentions for GKN beyond vague platitudes and soundbites. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Question marks remain around the levels of debt Melrose will pile on the company and what it means for jobs, long-term investment and product development. Turner also points out that aerospace giant Airbus - GKN\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest customer - has warned it couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t work with the firm unless it knew its long-term plans. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153GKN\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s highly skilled UK workforce fear they will end up being sold off piecemeal, with their jobs either axed or shipped overseas to fund a debt-fuelled pay day if Melrose gets its way. That concern over Melrose\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s short-termism extends to major GKN customers such as Airbus too, which relies on a long-term relationship with GKN to develop the wings of the future. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153If Airbus or other major customers take their business elsewhere it would blow a hole in revenues and destroy jobs and innovation. In another development, Melrose has lowered the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcAcceptance Condition\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 of its GKN offer, from 90% to 50% plus one share. That means it has lowered the bar to a successful takeover. GKN has hit back against Melrose\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s takeover bid. The UK engineering group has announced that, once it sells its Driveline business to American firm Dana, the resulting company will have a secondary listing on the London stock exchange as well as a primary listing in New York. That is designed to help GKN investors, who might have been forced to sell the shares they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll own in Dana-GKN Driveline if the deal goes through Driveline is GKN\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s automobile division. The \u00c2\u00a34.4bn sale to Dana (who make axels and driveshafts) was hammered out 10 days ago as GKN battled to repel Melrose\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s advances. CEO Anne Stevens says that the deal makes sense for GKN shareholders, especially if they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be able to hold onto equity in the new business through a London listing. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Since announcing the deal to bring GKN Driveline and Dana together, I have had the opportunity to speak to many of our shareholders and explain why I am so excited about this prospect. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The complementary nature of the two businesses and our shared commitment to R&amp;D and long term investment creates a fantastic opportunity to build a world leading company and create meaningful shareholder value by delivering $235 million in synergies. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The listing on the London Stock Exchange will make it possible for more of our shareholders to participate in the expected value creation opportunity from the combined Dana and GKN Driveline business.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. The battle to take control of one of Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s oldest engineering firms is hotting up today. Melrose, the turnaround group, has intensified the pressure as it tries to seize control of GKN, in an increasingly bitter fight. Over the weekend, Melrose CEO Simon Peckham blasted GKN\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s management, telling the Sunday Telegraph that: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153GKN has been run by people who don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have an owner mentality, they have a manager mentality. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a business that has slowly but surely lost the support of the UK institutional investment community.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Relations between the two companies were already chilly (Melrose\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s plan for GKN includes dismissing its management and giving its staff more involvement). Peckham\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s intervention, at a time when major shareholders are having to choose who to back, ensures they are now sub-zero. And this morning, Melrose has announced that it has offered to put more money into GKN\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pension scheme -- roughly \u00c2\u00a31bn over the time it expected to own GKN. It told the City that this proposal is almost twice the amount of the \u00c2\u00a3528 million deficit reduction package that the trustees recently agreed with GKN. Melrose chairman Christopher Miller says: The proposal we have made to the trustees of up to \u00c2\u00a31 billion of contributions under our ownership is a clear example of what Melrose does which is good for pensioners and shareholders alike and shows we are a good custodian for all stakeholders. Melrose\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s measured approach represents certainty of strategy, value and management. We strongly urge GKN shareholders to accept our offer without delay.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd That might assuage some concerns about whether Melrose is a suitable owner for GKN. GKN, though, insists that Melrose\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s latest offer (worth around \u00c2\u00a38bn) is too low. MPs also have concerns, given Melrose\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s track record of buying companies and breaking them up to release value. Unions also fear job losses - and are expect to meet with Melrose today. Shareholders have until 29th March to make a decision.... Also coming up today.... Finance ministers from the G20 group of advanced economies are meeting in Argentina today. They\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be discussing trade, financial stability and cryptocurrencies (among other issues). The economic calendar heats up later this week, with UK inflation and unemployment data, plus interest rate decisions from the Bank of England and the US Federal Reserve. However, today is quieter, apart from some eurozone trade and construction data. The agenda: 10am GMT: Eurozone trade balance for January 10am GMT: Eurozone construction output figures for January All day: G20 finance ministers meet in Buenos Aires",

                "bodyText":"Time for a quick recap Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s cost-of-living crisis has eased a little, after inflation fell back from its recent highs. The consumer prices index fell to 2.7% in February, down from 3% in January, and closer to wage growth. The Office for National Statistics reported that food and fuel inflation slowed, pulling down the benchmark cost of living. But, prices are still rising ahead of earnings - although tomorrow\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s labour market statistics may show the gap narrowing. The impact of the pound\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fall after the EU referendum is starting to fade, after driving import prices sharply higher in 2017. Economists are split over whether the Bank of England will raise interest rates in May, as it tries to get inflation back down to 2% without driving up unemployment. Andrew Sentance, senior economic adviser at PwC, has warned that inflation could get an Easter bump, which would hurt households. In the markets, European stock markets are clawing back some ground after Monday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s selloff. But Facebook is being shunned again; its shares down another 3% as politicians and regulators probe how users\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 personal data has been used. Despite Facebook\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s deepening problems, the US stock market is recovering from Monday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s losses. The Dow Jones industrial average, which shed 335 points yesterday, is up 180 today. The tech-focused Nasdaq is flattish, with software firm Adobe up 2.8% and chipmaker NVIDIA up 1.1%. Facebook, though, is still down 3%. Back on inflation, our economics editor Larry Elliott has warned that the Bank of England could raise interest rates in May - if wages rise over the next couple of months. He writes: Earnings growth has been creeping up and before too long earnings will be increasing more quickly than prices. The sharper than expected fall in inflation means the return to rising real incomes will occur sooner and that will mean stronger growth and \u00e2\u20ac\u201c from the MPC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s perspective \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the threat of higher wage inflation. While there has been little in recent economic data to justify a May increase in rates, earnings data will be crucial. If the annual increase edges closer to 3%, a spring rise will be a real possibility. No sign of a bounceback for Facebook yet: Over in New York, shares in Facebook have fallen by another 3% at the start of trading. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s on top of yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 6.7% rout, and knocks another $15bn off its market capitalisation. The selloff comes as the data scandal that hit the company last weekend deepens, with several new developments today: A former Facebook executive has told the Guardian that numerous companies harvested the personal data of its users America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Federal Trade Commission is reportedly probing whether Facebook violated the terms of a 2011 consent decree over its use of personal data A parliamentary committee has asked Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg to answer questions European stock markets have recovered a little ground this morning, after yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s selloff. In London the FTSE 100 has gained 22 points, having slumped to a 15-month low on Monday. However, worries over global trade spats, the Facebook data crisis and uncertainty over the pace of US interest rate rises are all keeping traders edgy. Elsewhere in the markets, legendary motor racing star-turned-airline manager Niki Lauda has landed a deal with Ryanair. The Irish budget airline has agreed to buy a 25% stake in Laudamotion - the Vienna-based operator which was created out of Laudi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s previous airline, Niki (formerly part of Air Berlin, which went bust last year). Ryanair intends to boost its state to 75% as soon as EU regulators have given their approval. It will lend Laudamotion six planes, which will boost its fleet to 21 -- helping it to challenge rival Lufthansa. Jane Foley, head of foreign exchange strategy at Rabobank, believes the Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s monetary policy committee will raise interest rates at least once this year. And despite today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s inflation figures, she believes they will hike Bank Rate from 0.5% to 0.75% in May. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Our expectation is of no change to rates at this week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s BoE meeting] but of a rise at the May meeting. In our view, though, the market is still focusing too much on the committee\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s voting patterns. It is possible for every member to hold steady this time while also planning to vote for a hike in May. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The markets are better served by reading the Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s minutes closely and observing Mark Carney\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s comments. It was clear at Davos, for example, that he was readying the markets for a potential rate increase during the first half of the year. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153In terms of a November hike, there remain two core issues at play. The first is Brexit. If the process runs smoothly, the environment will be much more conducive to a rate rise. Secondly, the Bank will monitor UK wage growth closely. If this increases, pushing up inflation, it will be a lot easier to justify a rate hike. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153These are significant factors, though, and so it is possible to envisage a rate rise in May but none later in the year if Brexit negotiations hit a snag and wages are flat.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The pound has dipped slightly, following the news that Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s consumer prices index has dropped to a seven-month low. Traders are calculating that the inflation slowdown makes a UK interest rate rise a little less likely in the next few months. But sterling is only down 0.1% against the US dollar today, to just over $1.40 (this tweet from Bloomberg makes it look more dramatic though!) The muted reaction suggests the City believes a May rate hike is still possible. Obviously the Bank of England will be pleased to see inflation falling towards its target of 2%. But if wages do pick up, policymakers might conclude that labour market slack has been eroded, so the economy can handle higher borrowing costs. Thursday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meeting is an opportunity for the BoE to drop some hints... Households won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be popping champagne bottles open when wages finally start rising faster than inflation. Economist Rupert Seggins has shown how workers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 earnings power has been badly eroded since the financial crisis, meaning people are poorer in real terms: In other news, the threat of a global trade war has hit investor confidence in Germany: House price inflation also fell last month, but is still rising faster than wages. The average house price rose by 4.9% in the 12 months to January, down from 5% a month earlier. Prices rose slowest in the North East (0.7%) and London (2.1%), but jumped fastest in the East Midlands (7.3). It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s possible that wages will catch up with inflation this month, predicts Stephen Clarke, senior economic analyst at the Resolution Foundation. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Import-driven inflation is clearly slowing. Food and beverage prices are rising at a slower rate than last month and further falls are likely. We can also see a slowdown in transport inflation, contributing just 0.35 ppts to annual inflation down from 0.8ppts a year ago, and the price of utilities is rising at a slower rate than before. Both are underpinned by a fall in the price of energy from its New Year highs. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The sharp fall in inflation means we could be seeing an earlier end to the pay squeeze than previously expected, perhaps as early as this month\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd We get the latest UK earnings figures tomorrow, in the unemployment data for November-January. Economists predict that wages rose by 2.6% per year in that quarter, which would almost eliminate the gap. Mel Stride, financial secretary to the Treasury, insists that the government is helping families cope with inflation. He says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We know families feel the cost of living at the end of every working week. From next month a typical taxpayer will pay 1,000 less income tax than in 2010. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153And we are increasing the National Living Wage, which is already helping the lowest earners see their pay rise by almost 7% above inflation. This is part of our plan to build an economy that works for everyone.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Stride also suggests that real wages should start rising again soon, as inflation is expected to keep dropping: Unions aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t impressed, though. TUC general secretary Frances O\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Grady warns that workers desperately need a proper pay rise after years of struggles: She says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s living standards crisis is far from over. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fall in prices may ease the pressure a bit. But working people will still be worse off at the end of this parliament than before the crash. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The government must up its game. Millions of workers haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t had a proper pay rise in years. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Unless ministers invest in the infrastructure and public services needed for better-paid jobs, the UK will remain at the bottom of the league for real wage growth.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s now 14 months since the pound hit a 31-year low against the US dollar at $1.20, driving import prices higher. Sterling has since recovered to around $1,40. Phil Gooding, head of CPI at the Office for National Statistics, believes the impact of the pound\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s slide is now fading: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153A small fall in petrol prices alongside food prices rising more slowly than last year helped pull down inflation, as many of the early 2017 price increases due to the previous depreciation of the pound have started to work through the system. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Hotel prices also fell and the cost of ferry tickets rose more slowly than last year, when prices were collected on Valentine\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Day when many people could have been taking mini-breaks.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The battle against inflation isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t over, warns Andrew Sentance, senior economic adviser at PwC. He predicts that consumer prices could push higher this month, as retailers and transport firms prepare for Easter: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It is not a surprise to see UK inflations tarting to fall back - from 3% in January to 2.7% in February. Forecasters were expecting price increases to ease back this year. But the rate of reduction is likely to remain slow and volatile. The fact that Easter is early this year could push inflation back up again in March. Sentance (a former Bank of England policymaker) also argues that UK interest rates could soon rise - even though inflationary pressures are easing. The UK recovery is now nearly nine years old, and yet our official interest rate is exactly where it was nine years ago. A further interest rate rise would be justified this Spring - which would show that the UK is following the lead of the US Federal Reserve in embarking on a policy of gradual and careful interest rate rises.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd This slowdown in inflation should bring some relief to poorer families, says Richard Lim of Retail Economics: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Key areas driving the decline included transport and food which comprise a large chunk of expenditure, especially for the least affluent households. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153While real earnings remain in negative territory, the financial pinch will continue to ease and we expect growth to resurface by mid-2018.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Jeremy Cook, chief economist at WorldFirst, predicts that UK pay rises could overtake inflation soon: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Following the decision by the ONS to exclude pork pies and nightclub bottled lagers from the inflation basket, we will soon get to a point wherein the declines the pound suffered following the EU referendum go a similar way. CPI at 2.7% is the lowest since July of last year and while wages are hardly setting the world alight, we could be within a few months of real wages turning positive for the first time since the beginning of last year.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd British inflation seems to be falling back from its recent peak, says Suren Thiru of the British Chambers of Commerce: Economist Simon French of Panmure Gordon agrees that import price inflation is cooling. The BBC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Kamal Ahmed is optimistic that real wages will start rising soon. More detail: Petrol prices fell by 0.2 pence per litre between January and February, to 120.8 pence per litre in February. Food and non-alcoholic beverages prices rose by 0.1% between January and February this year compared with a rise of 0.8% a year ago. This drop in inflation suggests that the impact of the Brexit vote is finally fading. Transport and food has the biggest downward impact on inflation, according to the Office for National Statistics. It says: The largest downward contributions to the change in the rate came from transport and food prices, which rose by less than a year ago. Falling prices for accommodation services also had a downward effect. Rising prices for footwear produced the largest, partially offsetting, upward contribution. In recent months, import costs had been pushed by drop in sterling after the EU referendum in June 2016. That impact may now be easing. Breaking! UK inflation has fallen to its lowest since last July. The consumer prices index has fallen to 2.7% in February, from 3% in January, taking some pressure off hard-pressed households. It suggests that the squeeze in earnings is coming to an end, as wages rose by 2.8% per year in December (although by 2.5% in the October-December quarter). More to follow! Real wages in the UK have been falling since last spring, so the end of the cost of living squeeze can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t come soon enough. New data from Barclaycard shows that 39% of people feel poorer than a year ago, due to rising inflation. Food and fuel prices are a key factor. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s some details: two-thirds (67 per cent) say it is because their weekly shop seems more expensive than it used to be 41 per cent say filling up the car seems more expensive than it used to A fifth (21 per cent) say the cost of a night out or meal in a restaurant seems more expensive than it used to One in five (20 per cent) say that the cost of travelling on public transport has gone up Economist Sam Tombs predicts that today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s inflation data will cut the chances that the Bank of England raises interest rates this spring. Just in: Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade commissioner, Cecilia Malmstr\u00c3\u00b6m, is jetting to America to insist that the EU is excluded from the new tariffs on steel and aluminium imports. Malmstr\u00c3\u00b6m, who has already threatened retaliatory action on American products, will meet with commerce secretary Wilbur Ross. However, US officials have already warned that president Trump will make the final decision, with a rather broad-brush approach: Economist Rupert Seggins is tweeting some handy charts about inflation: Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s inflation is in the spotlight today, and for the first time in months we might get some good news. Economists predict that the consumer prices index fell in February, from January\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 3% to around 2.8% last month. If so, that would ease some of the pressure suffered by households since the pound slumped after the Brexit vote. The data is released at 9.30am - here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the situation last month: A fall in inflation would offer hopes that the cost of living squeeze might be ending. Wages rose by 2.5% per year in the last quarter, and by 2.8% in December alone. If that trend continues, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s possible that real wages might actually turn positive soon. Weaker inflation also takes some pressure off the Bank of England to raise interest rates, so today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s report could move sterling. Konstantinos Anthis, head of research at ADS Securities, says: The British pound will be front and centre this morning in light of the release of the UK inflation report. The Consumer Price Index is the number one concern for the Bank of England as the rallying inflation has forced the British central bank to grow more hawkish and signal three rate hikes over the next three years. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s report will be important in assessing when the first hike for this year will come. The Bank of England will set interest rates on Thursday (we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re not expecting a hike, though). The ONS will also release its latest UK house price data (for January). Also coming up today.... The technology sector is reeling after Facebook was engulfed in the Cambridge Analytica data scandal. Last night, around $36bn was wiped off Facebook\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s value, knocking $5.5bn off Mark Zuckerberg\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s personal wealth, as politicians demanded to know how the personal details of 50m Facebook users were harvested. As public anger mounts, Zuckerberg has been keeping a remarkably low profile. Parliament, though, wants answers. Conservative MP Damian Collins, chair of the digital, culture, media and sport select committee declared: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time for Mark Zuckerberg to stop hiding behind his Facebook page.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Jasper Lawler of CMC Markets says investors have serious concerns: This is not the first time that Facebook have been caught being lax over their controls; both users and regulators are going to want this to be the last or at least see the firm go to extraordinary lengths to prevent incidences like this happening again. The next few weeks will be crucial as to how Facebook responds to the allegation. With Uber suspending its driverless-car testing after one of its vehicles hit and killed a woman in Arizona, big tech is under more scrutiny than ever. City traders will also be watching for the latest economic confidence figures from Germany, and consumer confidence across the eurozone. And in parliament, MPs will be quizzing top officials from Office of Budget Responsibility over last week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s spring statement. including chairman Robert Chote. The agenda: 9.30am GMT: UK consumer price inflation data for February released 9.30am GMT: UK house price data for January 10am GMT: ZEW index of German investor confidence 10am GMT: OBR officials questioned by the Treasury committee 3pm GMT: Eurozone consumer confidence figures",

This will in large part depend on how policymakers assess inflationary pressures \u00e2\u20ac\u201c if they think inflation is coming they might accelerate the path of rate hikes.

However, it is perhaps more likely that the dots show greater confidence in three hikes (i.e., the doves come round to consensus), than the centrists join the hawks and go for four. Nevertheless, with the key doves not voting this year (Neel Kashkari and Charles Evans), it would imply that the actual FOMC dots of voting members is higher...</p> <p>Trade and tariffs will also be a big focus having weighed not insignificantly in the last week. It may be the wrong moment for the Fed to signal more hawkish policy when we look at the potential negative impact of tariffs on GDP.

                "bodyText":"And finally.... Wall Street has closed sightly in the red after Jay Powell\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s debut press conference. The Dow Jones industrial average ended 45 points lower at 24,682, a dip of nearly 0.2%. The tech-focused Nasdaq lost 0.5%, although Facebook stemmed its recent sharp losses by gaining 0.75%. Traders in New York got a clear message from Powell - the process of raising US interest rate further away from their crisis-era record lows will continue, Jeremy Gatto, Investment Manager on Unigestion\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s multi asset Navigator fund, explains: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FOMC meeting confirms the scenario we have been advocating for some time, that \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcmonetary policy normalisation\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 is well and truly underway. As expected Powell committed to raise rates, indicating strong global economic growth, while highlighting that the Federal Reserve is seeking a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcmiddle ground\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 agenda. And that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s all for tonight. Thanks for reading and commenting. GW and NF Ranko Berich, head of market analysis at Monex Europe, says Jerome Powell avoided any shocks today. Indeed, the new Fed chair maintained the same cautious approach as his predecessor, Janet Yellen: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Jay Powell\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s first Fed presser went more or less as expected, with the FOMC raising rates and making some vague hawkish noises about the future while maintaining its cautious approach to policy tightening. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153As with his testimony to lawmakers, the Fed Chair stuck to the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Powell Doctrine\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd of studiously avoiding commenting on political issues. If the Fed will react to trade or fiscal policy, it will do so only once it is looking directly at the economic effects of those policies. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Powell noted that there is a range of opinion on the committee on the outlook, meaning as always that the Fed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s projections should not be taken as gospel. But today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FOMC median projections did include a mild inflation overshoot in 2019 and 2020, yet this did not prompt a policy response, further underlining the fact that Yellen\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s cautious approach to policy is alive and well.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Bloomberg\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Luke Kawa has summed up Jerome Powell\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s approach rather well: That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s it! Jerome Powell has wrapped up his first press conference as Fed chair after 45 minutes, around 15 minutes quicker than expected. He rattled through the questions swiftly, giving sharp and clear answers - without any diversions into deep economic theory. I was stuck by Powell\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s warning that the new tariffs on steel and aluminium are worrying businesses leaders in America. The Fed must be a little anxious that a trade war will break out, even though Powell declined to talk about relations between Washington and Beijing. Powell sounded confident about the US economy, and also tried to persuade reporters not to get too excited by the Fed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s famous dot charts. They\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re only predictions of future rate hikes, not an oracle, after all. He hinted that he might change policy and hold a press conference after every Fed meeting -- so we might be seeing a lot more of Mr Powell in future. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s some more reaction: Powell sways elegantly to avoid a potential curveball on political issues. He says he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not kept awake at night, worrying whether he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s free to raise rates ahead of the midterm elections this autumn. On wages, Powell says he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s surprised that wages haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t risen faster, given the pace of the economic recovery. Q: What impact would a US-China trade war have on the global economy? Powell replies that trade wars are a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153low profile risk\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd that has become \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a more prominent risk to the outlook\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. However he won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t comment on trade policy between countries. Powell says the Fed expects Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tax cuts will have a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153meaningful\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd impact on the economy, although its full effect isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t clear. Ooooh. Asked about financial risks, Jerome Powell warns that the prices of some assets are \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcelevated\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, including shares. Q: What impact might the US government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tariffs have on American monetary policy? Fed chair Jerome Powell says that a number of FOMC committee members brought up the issue of tariffs at this week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meeting. We don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think that changes in trade policy should have any effect on the current outlook, he explains. However, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a number of participants\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd reported that they had met with business leaders; trade policy has become a concern going forward with that group, Powell warns. Pressed on this point, Powell says there is a risk that the economic outlook could suffer if there was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153more widespread retaliation\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and actions back-and-forth between countries. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meeting comes less than two weeks after Donald Trump signed the order to impose tariffs on imports of steel and aluminum. Q: Would you like to hold more Fed press conferences? Powell says he is considering whether to hold a press conference after every FOMC meeting (the committee meets eight times a year, but only hold a press conference four times). But he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s concerned that people might think he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s signalling a change to monetary policy (because investors don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t expect any big news at meetings without a press conference). Asked about the neutral rate of interest, Powell says he and his colleagues believe is is still \u00e2\u20ac\u0153quite low\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Jerome Powell suggests we shouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get too fixated on the dot-plot forecasts of where each Fed policymaker believe interest rates will be in future. We only had one decision today, and that was to raise the Funds rate, he says. No-one voted on what the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcmean\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 projection should be. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a clip of Powell\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s opening statement: Q: How concerned would you be if US inflation rose over your 2% target? Powell says the Fed would be concerned about \u00e2\u20ac\u0153sustained deviation\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd above or below its target. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re swiftly onto questions. Q: The Fed has raised its growth forecasts, and sees unemployment lower than before, but hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t changed its forecast for inflation much. Why? Jerome Powell says the US unemployment rate has fallen from 10% during the crisis to just 4.1% today, but with only very gradual pressure on inflation. That suggests the relationship between changes in labor market slack and inflation isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t very tight. So the Fed is trying to take the middle ground, by making gradual changes to the Federal Funds rate. The new Federal Reserve chair, Jerome Powell, has arrived for his first press conference since succeeding Janet Yellen. He confirms that the Federal Open Market Committee voted to raise US interest rates today. He calls it another another step in the process of gradually scaling back accommodative monetary policy. Powell says the economic outlook has strengthened in recent months, and that the FOMC expects the jobs market to remain strong. On the outlook, he says the Fed will be watching how the economy performs in the months and years ahead. Nancy Curtin, chief investment officer at Close Brothers Asset Management, says today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rate hike was a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153fairly straightforward decision\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd: The US economy seems to be in somewhat of a sweet spot, with a synchronised global economy, a weaker dollar, fiscal expansion and the prospect of increased business investment all supportive of growth. Wholesale tax reform should filter through more strongly into the economic data ahead, providing increased growth momentum. At the same time, inflation is showing signs of getting close to the Fed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s goal, and spare capacity in the labour market is declining. Michael Pearce of Capital Economics says the Federal Reserve is signalling that rates will rise faster than expected in the next 21 months. The Fed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision to raise interest rates by 25bp today was widely expected but some investors may have been caught off-guard by the degree to which Fed officials increased their projections for future interest rate hikes. The median projection for the fed funds rate at the end of 2019 is now 2.75-3.00% - exactly in line with our own forecast, which until recently was at the hawkish end of the spectrum. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision to raise the federal funds rate to 1.50% \u00e2\u20ac\u201c 1.75% was unanimous; the two dissenters at the December meeting, Charles Evans and Neel Kashkari, are not voting FOMC members this year and their replacements are more hawkish. Aaron Anderson, Senior Vice President of Research, Fisher Investments, comments: The Fed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s more hawkish tone could simply be a result of new Chairman Powell\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s communication style compared to Janet Yellen, or it could mean the Fed believes recent economic data signal a strengthening economy, tighter labor market, and higher inflation. But if a few data points since the last meeting were enough to change the Fed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s plans, they could change just as easily in the future.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Nell Henderson of the Wall Street Journal on those dots... Shares are pushing higher on Wall Street, as traders react to the Fed announcement. The Dow is now up 180 points, or 0.75%, having been around 135 points higher earlier. That shows there is relief that the rate-setting committee isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t predicting four rate hikes in 2018. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the latest \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcdot plot\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 from the Federal Reserve\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s policymakers, showing where they expect interest rates to be at the end of 2018. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s guesstimates are in the right-hand column, next to the ones from December\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meeting. As you can see, the majority expect rates to have risen to 2.25% - ie, two more hikes on top of today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s one. But, there has been an upward movement among the dots, compared to three months ago, suggesting the Fed is a little more hawkish. Looking further ahead, policymakers now expect another 3 hikes in 2019 (up from two in December) plus two in 2020: The Fed has also signalled its confidence in the strength of the US economy. In a statement announcing the rate hike, it says: Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in January indicates that the labor market has continued to strengthen and that economic activity has been rising at a moderate rate. Job gains have been strong in recent months, and the unemployment rate has stayed low. It has then added a new line, declaring: The economic outlook has strengthened in recent months. Looking further ahead, the Fed is more hawkish about how fast US interest rates will rise: The Fed is sticking with its forecast that it will raise interest rates three times in 2018 (including today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hike, of course!). NEWSFLASH: The Federal Reserve has raised US interest rates. The Fed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Open Market committee has voted to hike the target for the Federal Funds rate, to 1.5% to 1.75% - up from 1.25% to 1.5%. More to follow.... A quick check at the markets - the Dow is up 0.5%, or 134 points, at 24,861 as Wall Street braces for the Federal Reserve announcement.... The US dollar is down around 0.5% against the pound, at $1.407. The Fed decision is imminent... Tension is mounting, with less than 20 minutes to go until the Federal Reserve decision hits the wires. Most traders expect the Fed to hike borrowing costs today - so the real interest is in how many further hikes are expected. Miles Eakers, Chief Market Analyst at Centtrip, explains: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The Federal Open Market Committee are widely expected to raise the target range for the federal funds rate later today. Last December, the median forecast for the funds rate by year end was 2.1% which implied three hikes. But since then, hawkish rhetoric from the Fed has swayed market expectation towards four rate hikes in 2018. Any confirmation of this will create volatility. As investors await the Federal Reserve decision, European markets have ended on a mixed note. With Wall Street now in positive territory, most have come back from their worst levels, but uncertainty over the Fed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s future interest rate policy meant caution was the watchword. Meanwhile the problems with UK retailers put the FTSE 100 under added pressure. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished down 22.3 points or 0.32% at 7038.97 Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax edged up 0.01% to 12,309.15 France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac closed down 0.24% at 5239.74 Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB added 0.1% to 22,820.12 Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ibex ended 0.52% lower at 9630.9 In Greece, the Athens market lost 0.68% to 800.10 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has recovered from its early falls and is now up 88 points or 0.36%. The dollar has dipped ahead of the Federal Reserve meeting, despite the prospect of a rate rise announcement. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said: In a move that surprised no-one the Dow Jones was incredibly reticent to do much after the bell rang on Wall Street, as investors eye the month\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Fed meeting. The Dow dipped 0.1% this Wednesday; enough of a drop to suggest some pre-Fed fretting, but nothing to really tip its hand as to what it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s are expecting from the March statement. The dollar was more interesting in that regard. The greenback fell half a percent against the pound, 0.4% against the euro and 0.2% the yen, hinting that investors are perhaps a tad worried that Jerome Powell, in his first outing as the central bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chief, won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be as hawkish as they want. Interestingly the questions surrounding the meeting are less about what the Fed will do, but more about how they do it. At this point a rate rise seems almost guaranteed, a move that would take the benchmark interest rate to 1.75%. What is less certain are how many interest rate increases will follow throughout 2018, namely whether Powell will pull the trigger a further 2 or 3 times after his debut hike. More signs of strength in the US economy ahead of the Federal Reserve rate decision. Home sales jumped 3% in February to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.54 units, according to the National Association of Realtors. Analysts has expected a rise of just 0.5%. But there is a shortage of available homes which is pushing up prices and helping to price first time buyers out of the market. NAR chief economist Lawrence Yun said sales were uneven across the country but did increase nicely overall: A big jump in existing sales in the South and West last month helped the housing market recover from a two-month sales slump,. The very healthy US economy and labor market are creating a sizeable interest in buying a home in early 2018. However, even as seasonal inventory gains helped boost sales last month, home prices \u00e2\u20ac\u201c especially in the West \u00e2\u20ac\u201c shot up considerably. Affordability continues to be a pressing issue because new and existing housing supply is still severely subpar. Meanwhile Facebook shares are down another 2.5% at the open, in the wake of the Cambridge Analytica controversy. Here is our latest story: Ahead of the Federal Reserve decision - with rates expected to rise and investors seeking hints about further increases this year - Wall Street has slipped back at the open. With technology stocks still under pressure, both from EU tax plans and the fallout from the Facebook controversy, the Nasdaq Composite has opened down 0.21%. The S&amp;P 500 has dipped 0.09% while the Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 27 points or 0.12%. Neil Wilson, senior market analyst at ETX Capital, said: Markets are pricing in a roughly 90% chance of a hike this week, the first of three or four anticipated this year. So the focus is on the dot plot and the accompanying language from chair Jay Powell. For risk, markets will want the Fed to hold off indicating 4 hikes in 2018 but keep up its confident assessment of the economy. This will in large part depend on how policymakers assess inflationary pressures \u00e2\u20ac\u201c if they think inflation is coming they might accelerate the path of rate hikes. But there is a much bigger risk that the Fed sticks to three in 2018 but raises forecasts for 2019 and that could knock equities and give a boost to USD more than indicating four hikes in 2018 might... Since the last meeting in December inflation has picked up but the pace has not really accelerated beyond the most bullish scenarios seen already... Currently the median dot plot suggests three hikes this year, and there is a chance that this could rise to four. However, it is perhaps more likely that the dots show greater confidence in three hikes (i.e., the doves come round to consensus), than the centrists join the hawks and go for four. Nevertheless, with the key doves not voting this year (Neel Kashkari and Charles Evans), it would imply that the actual FOMC dots of voting members is higher... Trade and tariffs will also be a big focus having weighed not insignificantly in the last week. It may be the wrong moment for the Fed to signal more hawkish policy when we look at the potential negative impact of tariffs on GDP. We wait to see whether policymakers comment on the impact of tariffs and a trade war on the economy. The jump in UK wage growth means interest rates may rise soon, argues our economics editor Larry Elliott. He writes: Higher interest rates from the Bank of England have moved a decisive step closer after the latest official figures showed earnings growing at their fastest rate in more than two years. The latest snapshot of the labour market from the Office for National Statisticsshowed that a record high level of employment and a drift from part-time to full-time work pushed up wages in the three months ending in January. With inflation falling, the ONS said the squeeze on living standards that had dampened consumer spending over the past year had come to an end if bonuses were included in the yardstick used to calculate earnings. Threadneedle Street\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s monetary policy committee is meeting to discuss interest rates this week and the prospect of an increase in borrowing costs pushed up the pound on foreign exchanges. An increase in May is thought more likely than one this week.... More here: Over in parliament, the prime minister has hailed today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s jobs figures. Theresa May points out that employment is at a joint record high, the unemployment rate hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t been lower since 1975, and economic inactivity is at a record low. No mention of the fact that the jobless total did rise in the last quarter, though... Dr Carole Easton, chief executive of Young Women\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Trust, is concerned that younger female workers aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t getting enough help to join the jobs market. She points out that unemployment among women aged 16-24 rose by 21,000 in the three months to January. That means 151,000 young women are now unemployed and a further 340,000 young women are economically inactive and not in full-time education. Dr Easton says young people need help to get the right skills, and should also benefit from the National Living Wage (which only applies to those over-25s today). \u00e2\u20ac\u015321,000 more young women are unemployed, meaning nearly half a million are out of work. The Government must help young women into jobs to benefit individuals, businesses and the economy. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Young women are telling us they want to work but they are getting shut out of the jobs market by employer discrimination, low pay and unaffordable childcare. Interestingly, the number of people in work and the number counted as unemployment in Britain both rose in the last quarter. You might expect them to move inversely - but instead, there was a fall in the number of \u00e2\u20ac\u02dceconomically inactive\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 citizens, suggesting people are being lured back into the jobs market. Dr Heather Rolfe of the NIESR thinktank explains: These figures indicate that, in the face of recruitment difficulties, including as a result of a large fall in net migration of EU citizens, employers are hiring people who have not been actively seeking work. This might be seen as a positive sign, but this pool is likely to be limited\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd As usual, Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s unemployment report has split Westminster - with the government pointing to what\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s going well, and the opposition focusing on the problems. The Department for Work and Pensions highlights that the employment rate is now back at a record high (75.3%), with the unemployment rate back at its lowest level since Harold Wilson was prime minister in 1975 (at 4.3%). Esther McVey, secretary of state for Work and Pensions, says the government is trying to get more people into work, adding: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153And from next month, we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be taking thousands more people out of paying tax and also increasing the National Living Wage, benefiting those on the lowest pay and making sure they keep more of what they earn. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153In fact by raising the National Living Wage we have ensured that the lowest earners have seen their wages grow by almost 7% above inflation since 2015.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd But her opposite number, Labour\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Margaret Greenwood, is concerned that the number of people out of work rose by 24,000 during the last quarter. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153With eight million people in working households living in poverty and the cost of basic essentials remaining high, the Spring Statement was a missed opportunity for the Government to take the urgent action needed. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The Government has also failed to close the employment gap faced by women, disabled people and BAME groups, who have too often borne the brunt of austerity cuts.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Ian Stewart, chief economist at Deloitte, has spotted another interesting angle in today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s jobs report: More people are quitting their jobs to move to another company. That could drive wages growth higher, he reckons, as employers are forced to fight for labour. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The post-Brexit squeeze on consumer spending power is easing. Low unemployment, a slowing flow of overseas workers into the UK and high levels of job vacancies are raising wage pressures and boosting job moves. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The number of people resigning from one job to move to another fell in the wake of the financial crisis, but is now running at its highest level since 2001. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The scene is set for a pickup in earnings growth this year.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The Resolution Foundation has crunched today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s labour force statistics, and calculated that Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pay squeeze is finally ending. The think tank says that the official confirmation will come in a month\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time, when the ONS publishes the unemployment figures for November-February. But today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s data shows that earnings are finally overtaking inflation, after almost a year of pain for hard-pressed households. Resolution says: Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s figures show that real average weekly earnings fell by 0.2% in the three months to January, fell by 0.6% in the public sector, but were flat at 0 per cent in the private sector. However, the Resolution Foundation pay projection shows that earnings growth is set to have returned to 0.1% overall, and 0.2% in the private sector, in the three months to February. However, while private sector workers can celebrate, those in the public sector will continue to suffer falling real wages for a bit longer - until new pay deals are approved, Stephen Clarke, Resolution\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s senior economic analyst, warns that the squeeze on living standards isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t over. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 12-month pay squeeze has finally ended, though public sector workers will have to wait until new pay settlements are agreed across the NHS, schools, the police and other parts of the public sector. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153While it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a relief that pay packets are no longer shrinking, the outlook for anemic pay growth remains a huge living standards concern. Average pay is still lower than it was a decade ago, and an entire generation of young workers are still yet to experience the 3-4 per cent pay rises that were once the norm.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Factory workers and builders are enjoying decent pay rises, says Geraint Johnes, research director at the Work Foundation and Professor of Economics at Lancaster University Management School. He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hopeful that the fall in real wages will soon end, especially as the UK economy is still creating jobs.. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Encouraging news on pay includes the 2.8% rise in total pay on the preferred measure, this being driven by gains in manufacturing and, particularly, construction. Alongside the drop in consumer price inflation announced yesterday, this heralds an early end to the squeeze on real earnings. Meanwhile, the 182k rise in full-time employees in employment figure signals a labour market that continues to grow.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Despite the pick-up in wages in recent months, UK workers are still poorer than before the financial crisis once you adjust for inflation. The Office for National Statistics explains that in real terms: average regular pay (excluding bonuses) for employees in Great Britain was \u00c2\u00a3459 per week before tax and other deductions from pay, \u00c2\u00a314 lower than the pre-downturn peak of \u00c2\u00a3473 per week recorded for March 2008 average total pay (including bonuses) for employees in Great Britain was \u00c2\u00a3488 per week before tax and other deductions from pay, \u00c2\u00a334 lower than the pre-downturn peak of \u00c2\u00a3522 per week recorded for February 2008 The ONS also provided this chart, which shows the impact of austerity on the wages of teachers, doctors, police officers and other public sector workers Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s unemployment rate has fallen back to 4.3%, its lowest level since 1975. However, the number of people out of work has risen, by 24,000 to 1.45 million in the three months to January 2018 when compared with August to October 2017. In another boost, Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s employment rate has risen to 75.3% in the three months to January. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s up from 74.6% a year ago, and the joint highest on record. There were 32.25 million people in work, 168,000 more than for August to October 2017 and 402,000 more than for a year earlier. Breaking: Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s cost of living crisis is easing, as wages accelerate and close the gap with inflation. Basic pay rose by 2.6% per year in the three months to January, up from 2.5% in the three months to December 2017. If you include bonuses, then earnings jumped by 2.8% (again, up from 2.5% a month earlier). That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the biggest jump since September 2015, according to the latest labour force statistics which were just released. That means pay is catching up with inflation, which was 3% in January and only 2.7% in February. The Office for National Statistics estimates that real wages have actually stopped falling (if you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re lucky enough to get a bonus, anyway). Latest estimates show that average weekly earnings for employees in Great Britain in real terms (that is, adjusted for price inflation) fell by 0.2% excluding bonuses, but were unchanged including bonuses, compared with a year earlier. More to follow.... Hannah Uttley of the Daily Mail sums up the scene: Hundreds of jobs are also at risk at UK retailer New Look. New Look\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s creditors are meeting today to vote on a rescue deal to help its avoid administration. Under the plan, New Look would shut up to 60 of its worst-performing stores, putting around 980 staff at risk of redundancy. Mothercare, the mother and baby chain, has also come under fierce pressure in recent days. Shares in the company hit a record low yesterday, on fears that it is struggling to raise funds for a new turnaround programme. Three weeks ago, it warned it was in rescue talks with its banks, as it was on the brink of breaching its lending covenants Mothercare has now issued a statement to the City, saying that these talks are \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcprogressing constructively\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. It has also won a short-term reprieve from its lenders, who have agreed not to test these covenants next week. However, Mothercare now faces a two-month deadline to get new funding. The company says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Mothercare expects those discussions to conclude before 17 May 2018, the scheduled date for the announcement of its preliminary results, and Mothercare\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s lenders have agreed to defer the testing of our financial covenants due on 24 March 2018 accordingly. We will make further announcements as and when appropriate. As previously indicated, we are also exploring additional sources of financing to support and maintain the momentum of our transformation programme and we are engaged in preliminary discussions on securing such additional financing. Shares have risen by 9% this morning, to 17p. Back in July 2017 they were worth almost \u00c2\u00a33. We also have news from another struggling retailer, Carpetright. The floorings company has announced that it is exploring a company voluntary arrangement, which would allow it to shut some of its loss-making store and cut its rent bill. Carpetright has also secured a \u00c2\u00a312.5 loan from one of its shareholders, Meditor. This will provide much-needed working capital while the company works through its problems. It is in talks with its banks to relax its covenants, and is also considering raising up to \u00c2\u00a360m through a rights issue to shore up its balance sheet. Wilf Walsh, chief executive officer of Carpetright, took a sideswipe at previous management for creating a sprawling portfolio of stores. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The aggressive store opening strategy pursued by the Company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s previous leadership has left Carpetright burdened with an oversized property estate consisting of too many poorly located stores on rents which are simply unsustainable. The Company has worked hard over recent years to address this legacy issue and reduce the size of its property estate, however many of these poor performing stores still have long leases to run, which has limited our ability to exit a meaningful number in the short-to-medium term. Moss Bros\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s CEO, Brian Brick, warns that 2018 will be a tough year for retailers: In common with many UK retailers, the year ahead looks like being a very challenging one and we have taken action early to be sure we protect the underlying strength of the business. We do believe continued investment is essential to ensure we retain a sustainable point of differentiation and that we leverage our distinct position on the high street.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Moss Bros has hit shareholders with its second profits warning of the year. The formal clothing and suit hire business has warned that profits for the current financial year, to January 2019, will be \u00e2\u20ac\u0153materially lower than current market expectations\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s quite a shocker, given Moss Bros is only two months into this financial year. Moss Bros warned that it has suffered a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153material\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd shortage of stock -- partly blamed on Brexit -- and a fall in visitors to its stores. It says: Following the consolidation of the Group\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s supplier base in response to Sterling weakness, there have been material short-term issues with the resulting availability of stock. This stock shortfall across all categories has had a negative effect on sales in all retail channels and will continue to do so until late Spring. Hire sales continue to be challenging, although the peak trading period for Hire is still to come. As such the Group has remained prudent in its outlook. The reduction in store footfall that was experienced towards the latter part of December, has continued, reflecting a more cautious consumer environment. Shares in Moss Bros have slumped by 30% in early trading. DIY chain Kingfisher has sent a chill through Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s retail sector by reporting a fall in earnings, and warning that the UK market is tough. Pre-tax profits at the company, which owns B&amp;Q and Screwfix in the UK, have slumped by 10% in the last year to \u00c2\u00a3682m. Kingfisher warned that UK sales in the last quarter has been \u00e2\u20ac\u0153softer\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, with less demand for big ticket items. Sales in France, where Kingfisher owns Brico D\u00c3\u00a9p\u00c3\u00b4t and Castorama in France, were \u00e2\u20ac\u0153weaker and volatile\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, it warns. The City is unimpressed; shares in Kingfisher have slumped by over 7% in early trading to the bottom of the FTSE 100 leaderboard. V\u00c3\u00a9ronique Laury, Chief Executive Officer, says Kingfisher benefitted from stronger sales in Poland. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Our performance this year has been mixed, however, with solid growth at Screwfix and Poland, offset by continued weaker sales in France and some business disruption, principally reflecting product availability and clearance. We are acting on the causes of this disruption, however next year will be another big year in our transformation plan. The pace of change is quick and impactful but necessary as we build the new ONE Kingfisher engine to support our ambition to be the leading home improvement company, based on putting customer needs first. The outlook for our main markets is also mixed. The UK is more uncertain, France is encouraging yet volatile, whilst the market in Poland remains supportive. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Two big events will keep traders on their toes today. First, we get the latest UK labour market figures for the three months to January. They may show that Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s cost of living crisis is easing. Earnings are tipped to have risen by 2.6% per year, closing the gap with inflation (which fell to 2.7% in February). Economists also expect that the jobless rate will remain at 4.4%, having risen from 4.3% last month. A strong jobs report could strengthen the pound. Investors across the world will also be watching America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s central bank, the Federal Reserve. The Fed is widely expected to raise US interest rates at today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meeting, and will also release fresh economic forecasts and projections for future interest rate moves (its \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcdot plot\u00e2\u20ac\u2122). The Fed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new chairman - Jerome Powell - will hold his first press conference, and there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s huge interest in his views. Hussein Sayed, chief market strategist at FXTM, says: Markets are almost certain that the Fed will be raising interest rates by 25 basis points later today, suggesting that a rate hike has been already priced in. Instead, the focus will be on the accompanying statement, economic forecast, the dot plot and the Q&amp;A session with Fed Chair, Jerome Powell. Economic forecasts are likely to be revised after President Trump signed the $1.5 trillion tax bill into law last December. This should be reflected in the GDP growth forecasts for 2018 and 2019, but the magnitude of change is a hard guess. Similarly, inflation and unemployment estimates are likely to see upgrades from December\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s projections. However, the key question remains - how does such a change impact monetary policy tightening in the next two years? The answer to this question will be mirrored in the dot plot chart, and it is here where most market participants are divided which makes trading the Fed a tricky one. The latest dot plot, released in December\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meeting, shows three rate rises in 2018, followed by another two in 2019, and reaching a range of 3-3.35% by 2020. An upward shift in the dots, whether in the short or long term, will have implications for the markets, and especially for the dollar, which has been in a downtrend since late 2016.

                "bodyText":"European markets have closed sharply lower, although off their worst levels, as a combination of factors unnerved investors once more. In an echo of the early February slump, share prices around the globe came under pressure. The chief reason was the growing fear of a trade war as President Trump slapped tariffs on China - although more details about the exact targets will come later - in retaliation for supposedly stealing US technology. With the Federal Reserve raising interest rates on Wednesday and the Bank of England signalling a UK increase in May, investors were also rattled by the prospect of the cheap money which has supported markets for years now being more quickly withdrawn. On top of all that, the controversy over Facebook and Cambridge Analytica prompted talk of increased regulation of technology companies. So the final scores showed: The FTSE 100 fell 1.23% or 86.38 points to 6952.59, a new 15 month low Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax dropped 1.7% to 12,100.08 France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac closed down 1.38% at 5167.21 Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB finished down 1.85% at 22,397.84 Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ibex ended 1.49% lower at 9487.4 In Greece, the Athens market lost 1.57% to 787.50 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 272 points or 1.11%, having lost more than 500 points earlier. On that note, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time to close for the day. Thanks for your comments, and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be back tomorrow. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s more on the exemptions to the US steel and aluminium tariff move: The US move to impose sanctions on China is a high risk strategy, says Mike Jakeman, global analyst at the Economist Intelligence Unit: This has been clearly signposted by the Trump administration and is actually likely to prove broadly popular with US businesses and in Congress. The Democratic minority leader in the Senate, Chuck Schumer, welcomed it as a sign of the US standing up to China. But there is a lot riding on China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s response. The US is gambling that any response will be proportionate. China could hit the US hard in return, by making access to the local market harder for US farmers, for example. Were farmers faced with falling prices for the exports and higher prices at home because of the import tariffs, the popularity of the tariffs would diminish quickly. This is a high-risk strategy for the US administration and one that is likely to weaken, rather than strengthen, the global economy. And here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s signed tariff sanctions against China: President Trump is signing the order to impose tariffs on China, which he says could be up to $60bn. He says he has been talking to senior Chinese representatives and asked them to cut the deficit by $100bn immediately. He says he wants reciprical deals. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153If they charge us, we charge them the same thing.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd He says China charges 25% for a US car go in,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffdbut we charge 2% for their cars to come into the US - that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not good.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd He says he has been talking to China, Japan, Europe, and every single one of them wants to negotiate. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153In meantime we are sending a section 301 action which I will sign here.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The proposed tariffs on China are expected shortly. AP sums up the situation: The Trump administration is readying restrictions on Chinese investment and tariffs on nearly $50 billion worth of Chinese imports to punish Beijing for stealing American technology and pressuring U.S. companies to hand it over. China is already warning that it will take \u00e2\u20ac\u0153all necessary measures\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to defend itself, raising the prospect of a trade war between the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s two biggest economies. The White House says President Donald Trump will direct the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative to publish a list of proposed tariffs for public comment within 15 days. USTR has already identified potential targets: 1,300 product lines worth about $48 billion. The president is also asking Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin to come up with a list of restrictions on Chinese investment. A number of countries look like they will be exempt from the proposed US tariffs on steel and aluminium, including the European Union, Mexico, Canada, Australia, Argentina, Brazil and South Korea. China of course is clearly in the frame. Here is the European side, from Daniel Boffey in Brussels: The EU believes it has won a temporary reprieve from president Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tariffs on steel and aluminium after appealing to Washington to take a step back from a potential trade war. Following intensive talks in the US, the EU\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s commissioner for trade, Cecilia Malmstrom, said she believed the omens were good, although she indicated concern that the situation could unravel. The US is set to impose 25% tariffs on steel and 10% tariffs on aluminium on Friday. The EU has argued that it should be exempt and has threatened to impose a series of retaliatory measures including import duties on US products. On returning to Brussels after a two-day trip, Malmstrom said she was confident the US commerce secretary, Wilbur Ross, would suggest a temporary exemption for the EU but conceded that the decision remained in Trumps\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 hands. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We expect that we are on that list, we don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know for sure,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd she told the European parliament. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It is ultimately the president who decides this. But we expect that secretary Ross will recommend that the EU is excluded as a whole.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The proposed tariffs\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 main target is China, which has been flooding the world with cheap steel and aluminium. However, Trump has had few kind words to say about the EU, claiming that it had made life difficult for US exporters. The full story is here: With markets tumbling it is no surprise the measure of volatility is on the way up again: Back with the Bank of England, and is a May rate rise a done deal? Our economics editor Larry Elliott says it would be a suprise if there is no increase but the Bank has been careful to give itself some wriggle room: A rate rise will depend on the economic data that is published over the next month and a half, but judging by the minutes of the MPC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s March meeting that data would have to be quite poor for Threadneedle Street to sit tight. His full analysis is here: And here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our news story on the Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s announcement: The weakness in the FTSE 100 could mean UK-listed companies being targets for potential predators, says Richard Hunter, head of markets at Interactive Investor,: At current levels, the FTSE100 is just a few points from being down 10% in the year to date, knocking on the door of what is often described as correction territory. UK equities on the whole have fallen out of favour with international investors with the spectre of Brexit looming, whilst the recent relative strength of sterling has meant additional pressure on the premier index, where the majority of earnings come from overseas. Meanwhile, the possibility of trade disputes particularly between China and the US is denting sentiment, and the move towards tighter monetary policy is another brick in the wall of worry which investors are currently climbing. This is despite the global, synchronised economic recovery where corporate earnings have so far continued to justify some slightly rich valuations, especially in the US. The UK economy has remained resilient despite any impending Brexit fallout, with the result that some of the top quality FTSE100 companies are moving towards bargain territory \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and could even, as a consequence of this index weakness, find foreign groups running the slide rule over some of them as potential bid targets. Markets continue under pressure, ahead of the announcement by President Trump of trade tariffs. Apart from fears of a trade war, investors are also concerned about the fallout from the current Facebook controversy, and the prospect of increased regulation for technology companies. Facebook itself has lost another 3% so far today. So on Wall Street the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 370 points or 1.5%. In Europe, Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax is down 2% and France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac 2.16%. With the prospect of a UK interest rate rise in May, the FTSE 100 has fallen 1.6% to a new 15 month low. The pound\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s surge in the immediate wake of the Bank of England announcement has proved short lived, as investors decided that an interest rate rise in May had really already been priced into the market. Sterling has slipped 0.02% to \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.1455 against the euro and is down 0.16% against the dollar at $1.4116. Ken Odeluga, market analyst at City Index, said: Sterling traded against the dollar was able to spike to a fresh seven-week high though it soon settled around 100 pips lower. It remained elevated relative to earlier in the month. Against the euro the pound made a similarly short-lived move to the highest levels since January but then retreated by 60 pips. In short, a May rate rise remains all but certain, but the market had largely priced it before Thursday. More signs of a fairly robust US economy, with the latest snapshots of the manufacturing and service sectors. The preliminary IHS Markit manufacturing PMI for March has come in at 55.7, up from 55.3 last month and the highest level since March 2015. The manufacturing figure was better than analysts had been expecting, but the services PMI - although strong - came in below forecasts. It fell from 55.9 in February to 54.1, a two month low. Overall the composite PMI dipped from 55.8 to 54.3 in March, but the index has been above the 50 mark (which signals expansion) for two years now. Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit said: The flash PMI surveys indicate that the economy likely continued to expand at a robust pace in March, rounding off a solid opening quarter of the year. The surveys are running at a level consistent with annualised first quarter GDP growth approaching 2.5% (though we note that official GDP estimates may once again understate growth in the opening quarter of the year). The survey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s employment index is meanwhile at its highest for nearly three years and indicative of another strong payroll rise in the order of 240,000 in March. The improved hiring trend reflects buoyant optimism regarding future growth. Companies\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 expectations for output in the year ahead remained elevated, dipping slightly in services but surging to a three-year high in manufacturing. Inflationary pressures meanwhile remain a key theme of the surveys, especially in manufacturing, reflecting increased raw material prices, notably for metals. The survey found average prices charged for goods and services are rising at one of the strongest rates seen since 2014. Furthermore, with factory costs showing the largest jump for seven years amid growing shortages of key inputs, inflationary pressures appear to be on the rise. Back with UK interest rates, and there could be four over the next two years, reckons Kallum Pickering, senior UK economist at Berenberg: The Bank of England seems to be re-opening the playbook it used ahead of the November 2017 rate hike. Step one, signal to markets that a hike could come soon. Step two, let a couple of known hawks dissent in a policy vote shortly thereafter. Step three, hike rates. After signalling at the February 2018 Inflation Report that a rate hike could come soon, the minutes of the March Monetary Policy Committee meeting published today showed two members of the nine member Monetary Policy Committee \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Saunders and McCafferty, both known hawks \u00e2\u20ac\u201c voted in favour of raising the Bank Rate by 25bp to 0.75%. These are the same members that dissented ahead of the November hike. The March minutes strengthen the bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s February guidance that a hike could come soon. The real question is, when will it happen? ...We expect the BoE to hike its Bank Rate by 25bp four times over the next two years, with two hikes in 2018 and two in 2019. This would take the Bank Rate to 1.5% by the end of 2019. We look for the next 25bp hike in May 2018. Ouch! Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE 100 has fallen to a fresh 15-month low. London\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s index of leading shares has lost 101 points, or nearly 1.5%, to 6937. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s its lowest point since December 2016. And over on Wall Street, shares are sliding too. The Dow Jones industrial average has lost 310 points, or 1.2%, to 24,371 points. Traders are citing fears of trade wars, with Donald Trump expected to announce new tariffs on Chinese imports on Thursday. Those are likely to target China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s high-technology sector and could also include restrictions on Chinese investments in the United States. Peter Dixon, Economist at Commerzbank, thinks there are two good reasons for the Bank of England to raise interest rates away from their near-record lows. nominal GDP growth in excess of 3% is not consistent with Bank Rate of 0.5% and the global monetary cycle, led by the Fed, would suggest that there is scope for a modest tightening in UK rates.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd A rate rise would be good news for savers. And Craig Inches, head of rates &amp; cash at Royal London Asset Management, suggests the Bank of England should have taken the plunge today. He argues: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision not to raise rates was a missed opportunity in our opinion. With real wage growth moving into positive territory for the first time in over two years, strong retail sales (despite the adverse weather conditions) and some welcome progress on the Brexit negotiations, the uncertainty that has concerned the Bank in recent months is beginning to be demystified. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The markets were warned in February that rates would rise \u00e2\u20ac\u0153faster and sooner\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, the question we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d ask is why the Bank thought it necessary to wait until May. The probability of a rate rise now stands at over 75% following the vote today, sterling has risen in recent weeks from \u00c2\u00a31.37 to \u00c2\u00a31.42 and gilt short gilt yields have risen to the highs of the year. Given these moves and in light of the recent slew of positive data, the economy is clearly ready for a rate hike in May, but it would have been just as ready today! Inches is also concerned that the Bank hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t begun unwinding its quantitative easing stimulus programme, which holds \u00c2\u00a3435bn of government bonds. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153In the meantime the Bank continues to buy gilts via the APF facility and is massively distorting the shape of the yield curve, which is detrimental for pension funds and an accident waiting to happen further down the line.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Economist James Smith of Dutch bank ING says the Bank of England could potentially raise interest rates twice this year - perhaps once in May, and once in the autumn. But that could be undone if Brexit negotiations hit problems, Smith adds: By alluding to the need for \u00e2\u20ac\u0153ongoing tightening\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, policymakers have kept the door open to a second rate hike later this year. We certainly wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t rule it out, and markets are increasingly coming around to this view \u00e2\u20ac\u201c there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s now not far off two hikes priced in for this year. But if Brexit talks \u00e2\u20ac\u201c which are due to be wrapped up in October to allow time for ratification \u00e2\u20ac\u201c get particularly noisy, then this could get in the way of a second rate rise in the autumn. The City was surprised that two MPC policymakers wanted to raise interest rates today, says Ben Brettell, senior economist at Hargreaves Lansdown. He suspects that Brexit angst is helping to split the monetary policy committee: Ian McCafferty and Michael Saunders are worried that inaction now will mean rates will need to rise faster and further in future. Sterling jumped on the news, hitting a seven-week high against the dollar. The Bank faces a delicate balancing act. Inflation seems to be falling back towards the target of 2%, as the effect of the weaker pound starts to filter out of the calculation. But a pick-up in wage growth points to an erosion of slack in the labour market. This raises the prospect that a wage-price spiral could push inflation back up in future. Throw in a hefty dose of Brexit-related uncertainty and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s easy to see why the committee is divided at present. The Institute of Director\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s senior economist, Tej Parikh, reckons the Bank made the right decision this month. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Business leaders will welcome the Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision not to spring any surprises this month, but firms and households will be on tenterhooks for what comes in May. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The Bank has been paving the way for a rate rise, but must tread lightly until there is richer evidence of growing inflationary pressures, to avoid unnecessarily placing a speed bump in the way of economic activity. UK savers and borrowers should prepare for interest rates to rise in May, warns Ed Monk, associate director for Personal Investing at Fidelity International: Monk says the recent pick-up in UK wage growth (to 2.8%, if you include bonuses) means the Bank is worried that the economy could overheat. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The message from the Bank of England to borrowers couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t really be clearer: get ready for higher rates now. Two members voted for a rate rise this month and the Bank said nothing to dispel expectations that rates will rise in May. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The rate rise made in November felt like a straightforward reversal of the emergency post-Brexit cut, but this now feels more like we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re entering a genuine tightening phase at the Bank. The minutes of this week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meeting show that the Bank of England expects to raise interest rates over the coming months, having left them at 0.5% today. It says: Given the prospect of excess demand over the forecast period, an ongoing tightening of monetary policy over the forecast period would be appropriate to return inflation sustainably to its target at a more conventional horizon. All members agreed that any future increases in Bank Rate were likely to be at a gradual pace and to a limited extent. However, there was a split among the Monetary Policy Committee over when to take the plunge and hike borrowing costs. Ian McCafferty and Michael Saunders pushed for a rise today, arguing hawkishly that it would be reckless to wait: The minutes say: These members noted the widespread evidence that slack was largely used up and that pay growth was picking up, presenting upside risks to inflation in the medium term. A modest tightening of monetary policy at this meeting could mitigate the risks from a more sustained period of above-target inflation that might ultimately necessitate a more abrupt change in policy and hence a greater adjustment in growth and employment. But governor Mark Carney, deputies Ben Broadbent, Dave Ramsden and Jon Cunliffe, chief economist Andy Haldane, and external members Silvana Tenreyro and Gertjan Vlieghe weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t convinced. They argued that it would be better to wait until they have new economic forecasts in May. There had been few surprises in recent economic data and the February Inflation Report projections, conditioned on a gently rising path of Bank Rate, had appeared broadly on track. The May forecast round would enable the Committee to undertake a fuller assessment of the underlying momentum in the economy, the degree of slack remaining and the extent of domestic inflationary pressures. The pound has jumped, following the news that two policymakers - Ian McCafferty and Michael Saunders - voted to raise UK interest rates today. Sterling has hit \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.151 against the euro, the highest level since June 2017. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also up against the US dollar at $1.420, a new seven-week high. That means traders are anticipating that the next rate hike will come soon - quite possibly at May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meeting. NEWSFLASH: The Bank of England has left UK interest rates unchanged at 0.5%. Two members of the MPC voted to hike rates, but were outvoted by the other seven policymakers. More to follow.... Five minutes to go, until we learn whether the Bank of England has voted to leave rates on hold.... Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE 100 shares index has fallen below the 7,000 point mark for the first time in 15 months. Worries over trade wars, plus the strength of the pound, have combined to pull the index of blue-chip companies down to 6,983, a drop of 55 points. The team at Deutsche Bank believe the Bank of England will raise rates in two months time... Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s an explanation of how the Bank of England sets interest rates: The pound is pushing higher as traders get ready for the Bank of England decision, in under 50 minutes. Sterling has risen to \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.1489 against the euro, its highest levels since January 25th. The City may be preparing for a hawkish announcement from the BoE, paving the way for a rate rise in May (a hike today would be a real shock...) Craig Erlam of trading firm OANDA says: While a rate hike is not expected today, it is heavily priced in for May when the central bank will also release its inflation report containing new macro-economic projections. The Monetary Policy Committee has become notably more hawkish recently and the reference to rate hikes needing to come \u00e2\u20ac\u0153somewhat earlier and by a somewhat greater extent\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd than it expected in November, last month was a clear reference to an upcoming meeting. If the MPC is still planning to raise in May, I would expect another clear hint from the central bank today. Over in the City, shares in printing group De La Rue have slumped by 5% after it missed out on the contract for Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new blue-coloured passport. De La Rue is fuming over the snub, especially as the contract has been awarded to Gemalto, a Franco-Dutch security firm. Somewhat ironic, as these new passports have been hailed by Brexiteers as a benefit of leaving the EU. De La Rue\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s CEO, Martin Sutherland, has warned that jobs could be lost. He wants Theresa May to: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153come to my factory and explain my dedicated workforce why they think this is a sensible decision to offshore the manufacture of a British icon\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Unions are urging the government to reverse the decision. Unite national officer Louisa Bull says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Theresa May and Amber Rudd need to explain to De La Rue workers why \u00e2\u20ac\u02dctaking back control\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 means their jobs could be put at risk while the production of Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new iconic passport is shipped overseas to France. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t happen in France because of national security and it shouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t happen in the UK. De La Rue is the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s leading security printer making bank notes as well as passports sustaining thousands of decent jobs in the UK. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Ministers need to reverse this decision and start supporting British business and UK workers through public procurement and an industrial strategy which is more than just sound bites.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The contract was awarded under EU procurement rules, though, so a u-turn wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be easy. One could even argue that this is what free trade is all about..... The BBC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Rob Watson reckons the government will be worried: Optimism is building that Europe could win an exemption from America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new US tariffs on steel and aluminium. EU trade commissioner Cecilia Malmstrom has just held high-level talks with US officials, in an effort to prevent European metal-producers from being hit by Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s import duties, which kick in tomorrow. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s nothing official yet, but EU officials are hopeful that Malmstrom\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s efforts will pay off - and mean Europe needn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t enforce its threat of retaliatory tariffs on US imports. European Commission vice-president Jyrki Katainen told Bloomberg TV that the visit went well. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Cecilia Malmstrom had a good, very fruitful visit to Washington,. We have good opportunities now to solve the issue and stabilize, or calm down, the problem.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Last night, Malmstrom tweeted that the meetings had been productive: Newsflash: UK retail sales rose last month, but the broader picture is still downbeat. Retail sales volumes (the amount of stuff people bought) rose by 0.8% in February, compared to forecasts of just 0.4%. But after sharp falls earlier this winter, retail sales volumes are down 0.4% over the last quarter. On an annual basis, retail sales were up 1.5% - again, much weaker than last year, as households are stretched by the cost of living squeeze. This might make the Bank of England reluctant to raise borrowing costs.... The report also shows that consumers continued to spend more online. Internet shopping made up 17.2% of all retail spending, up from 15.6% a year ago. That helps explain why various high street chains have been struggling, or gone bust, in recent months. Rhian Murphy, ONS senior statistician, says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Retail sales did grow in February, with increases seen in food, non-store and fuel, but this followed two months of decline in these sectors. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153However, the underlying three-month picture is one of falling sales, mainly due to strong declines across all main sectors in December. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Store prices continue to rise across all store types, but at a lower rate than the previous month due to a slowdown in price growth, though clothing and household goods stores continued to see stronger price rises. Just in: The eurozone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s recent economic surge seems to be levelling off. Data firm Markit has reported that growth across eurozone service sector firms and manufacturers has slowed to its slowest since January 2017. Companies reported that growth had slowed after a very strong performance last year, with new order and exports both rising at a slower rate. Markit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u02dccomposite output PMI\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, which tracks activity across the eurozone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s private sector, dropped to 55.3 in March from 57.1 last month. At a country level, output growth slowed to a seven-month low in France and an eight-month low in Germany. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not a reason to panic -- the PMIs had been remarkably strong last year, so this is a return to more normal growth levels. Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit, says recent bad weather is one factor, plus \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcgrowing pains\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 as European supply chains struggle to keep pace with recent growth. But political issues - such as Brexit, and trade tariffs - are another factor. Williamson says: The fact that export order book growth has more than halved since the end of last year suggests the stronger euro is taking an increasing toll on export performance. Survey responses also highlighted how political uncertainty also appears to have intensified, dampening demand. The data therefore suggest that eurozone growth peaked around the turn of the year and the region is settling into a slower, but still robust pace of expansion. European stock markets have dropped this morning, as investors fret about the risks of a trade war. The FTSE 100 is down 13 points, or 0.2%, at 7021 after falling through 7,000 points at the start of trading. Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s DAX has lost 0.4%. Exporters are suffering from the strength of the pound and the euro against the US dollar today. The markets are also being pulled down by signs that Wall Street will fall, especially if Donald Trump does to hit China with new sanctions. Connor Campbell of SpreadEx says: The state of the Dow futures, alongside the re-emergence of trade war chatter ahead of Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s China tariff announcement later this Thursday, left the European indices in a sorry state after the bell. Alan Clarke of Scotia Bank is confident the Bank of England will leave rates on hold today: We expect policy to be left unchanged at this meeting. The focus of attention will be on whether there are any clues that support the case for a rate hike at the May MPC meeting. Given fairly mixed data since February, we would not be too surprised if the vote was 9-0 for unchanged rates and that should not be seen as an obstruction to a hike in May. But analysts at Mitsubishi UFG warn that a shock hike can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be ruled out.... The US dollar has fallen against other major currencies overnight, as traders digested Jerome Powell\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s debut press conference since becoming Fed chief. I thought Powell handled the occasion pretty well (rattling through the questions within 45 minutes, not the full hour available). He was upbeat about the US economy, avoided any bear traps, and reassured listeners that the Fed would take the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcmiddle ground\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 as it seeks to normalise monetary policy without slowing growth. So why has the dollar fallen? Firstly, the Fed stuck to its forecast of three rate hikes in 2018, rather than slipping in a fourth. Investors can take that as a dovish signal (although the Fed is now forecasting an extra hike in 2019). Secondly, Powell revealed that business leaders have told Fed officials they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re worried about a trade war breaking out. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a timely warning, as president Trump is expected to announce new tariffs and investment restrictions on China later today. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s enough to drive the pound up to a six-week high against the dollar, at $1.417. China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s central bank has responded to last night\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s move in US interest rates, by hiking its own borrowing costs. The People\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Bank of China increased the cost of short-term loans to commercial lenders, hours after the Fed announced it was tightening policy in America. Bloomberg has the details: The People\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Bank of China raised the interest rates it charges on 7-day reverse-repurchase agreements by five basis points, the central bank said in a statement. The move is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153in line with market expectations and a normal reaction to the Fed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rate hike\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, the PBOC said in a statement on the website. The Bank of England could send the pound shooting higher at lunchtime, if it hints at a rate hike in the next few months (or even raises rates today, of course). Konstantinos Anthis, head of research at ADS Securities, explains: The focus today will be on the Bank of England rate decision which will have a significant effect on the medium-term outlook of the British pound. The UK currency has seen good demand over the past few days being supported by expectations for a positive labour market report - which indeed printed in a bullish fashion yesterday - but also hopes for a hawkish tone from the BoE today. The key drivers for this upbeat bias? Inflation rebounded higher last month, we noted good wage growth in yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s employment report and there has even been progress in the Brexit negotiations. All these factors paint a positive outlook for the pound and shape expectations for a bullish BoE message which will underpin investors\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 hopes for a rate hike soon. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s some speculation that the BoE might even go ahead and raise rates today but we believe that this is too optimistic - our base scenario suggests an interest rate increase in the summer, either in May or June. Today though a positive message and a consistent bullish bias from the British central bank will keep the pound in demand: we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re looking to the pound/ dollar to extend gains towards 1.42 and euro/ pound to break below the 0.87 mark. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s turn under the spotlight today, as policymakers on the Monetary Policy Committee will set UK interest rates at noon today , We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re not expecting a rate hike today, just four months after the first one in a decade. But the MPC could decide to steer the markets towards a move in May, as it tries to balance inflation pressures against Brexit uncertainty. The MPC have some interesting economic data to digest, which may encourage policymakers to reach for the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcrate hike\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 button soon. Tuesday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s drop in inflation to 2.7% took some pressure off the Bank, although prices are still rising faster than its 2% target. That was followed by yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s strong labour market report, showing that wages are rising at their fastest pace since 2015, and catching up with inflation. Policymakers may conclude that this strengthens the case for a rate hike soon, rather than risk waiting too long. This chart, from Berenberg bank, suggests the labour market is recovering from the Brexit shock of 2016, which drove real wages down. Kallum Pickering of Berenberg explains: Thanks to the drop in headline inflation to 2.7% in February (3.0% in January), and the uptick in nominal weekly earnings to 2.8% in January (up from 1.9% in May 2017), the real wage squeeze is probably over. Tight labour markets should push nominal wage growth higher over the medium term as inflation gradually trends towards a rate of about 2-2.5%. Real weekly earnings growth can rise towards 1.0% by the end of the 2018. Helped by continued jobs growth, this should allow real consumption to grow at close to 1.5% over the medium term. The minutes of the meeting, released at noon, will give an insight into the MPC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s thinking. Last night, the US Federal Reserve raised its benchmark rate to 1.75%, and lifted its growth forecast. It also predicted two more rate hikes this year, and three in 2019, as the process of normalising monetary policy continues under new Fed chair Jerome Powell. Powell sounded upbeat about the US economy, but also warned that fears of a trade war are building. We also get a new healthcheck on eurozone service sector firms and factories, fresh UK retail sales figures, and the weekly US jobless claims numbers.

                "bodyText":"Before we close up for the day, here is a summary of the main developments: Stock markets in Asia fell heavily after China signalled it would retaliate against US tariffs. The Nikkei in Japan closed down 4.5%, while the Hang Seng in Hong Kong closed down 2.5% European markets followed Asia lower, as investors worried about an impending US-China trade war Falls on the FTSE 100 were limited by gains in Next, the index\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s top performer despite its declaration that it had faced its toughest period in 25 years. Investors were relieved by a lack of nasty surprises from the retailer MPs published a report demanding tougher rules on night flights before parliament gives Heathrow expansion the go-ahead European leaders gathered in Brussels welcomed the EU\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s temporary exemption from tariffs on US imports... ... but Belgium\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s prime minister said America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s negotiating stance amounted to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a gun to our heads.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Donald Tusk, President of the European Council, called on the US to make the exemption permanent Back in the UK, Bank of England policymaker Gertjan Vlieghe put households on notice for borrowing costs to rise faster than previously thought over the next few years Wall Street opened slightly higher as investors more calmly digested China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s retaliation against US trade tariffs. The Dow was up 0.4% That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s all from us for today. Thank you for following the blog and for all the comments. Have a good weekend and please join us again on Monday. AM Time for another look at the markets. In the US, the Dow Jones is bucking the trend across global markets and continues to rise. Here are the latest scores on Wall Street: Dow Jones: +0.4% at 24,042 S&amp;P 500: +0.2% at 2,648 And in Europe: FTSE 100: +0.3% at 6,930 Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s DAX: -1.3% at 11,946 France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s CAC: -1% at 5,115 Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB: -0.5% at 22,277 Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s IBEX: -1% at 9,398 Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s STOXX 600: -0.6% at 367 Brent crude oil prices have hit $70.03 a barrel, the highest since late January. The rise follows comments from the Saudi energy minister, who said OPEC countries would need to keep co-ordinating supply cuts with non-member countries, including Russia, into 2019. Back to the subject of trade wars... Ana Boata, senior economist at Euler Hermes, the trade credit insurer, has done some number crunching on what the dispute between the US and China might mean: The trade feud between the US and China could lead to potential export losses of $15.7bn. The US\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 25% tariff on imports for $60bn Chinese goods might cost China $15bn in export losses, while retaliatory Chinese tariffs on $3bn of US agrifood and steel products could see US exporters lose up to $700m. We expect vehicles and electronics to be next on the target list, while their attentions might also turn to financial services and intellectual property. US markets are slightly up after the opening bell on Wall Street: Dow Jones: +0.3% at 24,029 S&amp;P 500: +0.2% at 2,649 Nasdaq: +0.1% at 7,172 Bank of England rate-setter Gertjan Vlieghe has put households on notice for borrowing costs to rise faster than previously thought over the next few years. Using a speech in Birmingham, the member of the Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s monetary policy committee said he saw a need for one or two rate hikes per year over the next few years, in comments likely to be seen as putting the Bank on track for raising the cost of borrowing in May. One of the seven MPC members who voted to leave rates unchanged on Thursday, he said he was increasingly confident that wage growth in Britain was just around the corner. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The data have shifted further in the direction that warrants a continuation of the removal of monetary stimulus,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said. Although he warned there was uncertainty about the strength of the economy, particularly as the UK leaves the European Union, Vlieghe said recent surveys and figures from the jobs market had convinced him of the need for higher interest rates. But despite the good news for workers from rising pay, he warned there was also a lower \u00e2\u20ac\u0153new normal\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd for wage growth, as pay rises are likely to be constrained by poor levels of productivity growth in the UK. The sluggish increase in the efficiency of British workers seen since the financial crisis - which has been poorer than other advanced economies - could mean average annual wage rises worth about 3% per year compared to about 4% previously, he said. Andrew Hunter, US economist at Capital Economics, says the durable goods data suggests business investment is in \u00e2\u20ac\u0153healthy shape\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. The 3.1% rebound in durable goods orders in February was encouraging, even if that headline figure was boosted by the more volatile transport category. Equipment investment still appears to have slowed in the first quarter overall, but the data suggest that won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t last for long. The 26% in commercial aircraft orders was in line with the stronger orders reported by Boeing last month, while orders for defence aircraft also posted a big rebound. The 1.6% gain in motor vehicle orders was, however, stronger than expected given the recent declines in sales. Overall, business equipment investment still appears to have slowed in the first quarter, probably to between 6% and 8% annualised. But some slowdown appeared inevitable after the double-digit gains in the second half of last year and, in any case, the latest business surveys suggest that the outlook over the coming months remains bright. On a data-light Friday, we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve just had some stronger-than-expected numbers out of the US. Orders for durable goods - items ranging from kitchen appliances to aircraft that are expected to last three years or more - jumped 3.1% in February, as demand for transport equipment rose by 7.1%. The headline number was expected to come in at 1.5%, and growth of 3.1% followed a 3.5% fall in January, the commerce department said. Orders of non-defence related capital capital goods excluding aircraft - considered a bellwether for business spending plans - rose 1.8% last month. It was the biggest gain in five months and beat expectations of a 0.8% increase. Joseph Stiglitz, the Nobel prize-winning economist, says China can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be seen to show weakness against a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153bully\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd like President Trump. He told Bloomberg Television in Beijing: Particularly when you have a bully like Trump, it would not be good to respond in a weak way. We know about appeasement from Munich. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a different kind of a war but in a trade war, appeasement could lead to more and more demands. Stiglitz, a Columbia University economics professor, said China was in a better position than the US to withstand a trade war: [China is] sitting on $3 trillion of reserves that it can use to help those adversely affected. In the United States we don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have an economic framework that is able to respond to the particular places that will be affected by a trade war. The fiscal resources of the United States are strained. US futures have reversed earlier losses suggesting Wall Street could open slightly higher. Dow Jones futures are up about 0.1% while S&amp;P futures are up 0.2%. Trevor Greetham at investment company Royal London Asset Management says now could be the time to buy shares. In a note titled \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the Donald dip becomes a Trump slump\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, he says: Stock markets have fallen back sharply towards their February lows. While the initial bout of market weakness this year was blamed on rising wage inflation and fears of higher interest rates, this time round it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s in reaction to President Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s announcement of a range of tariffs on imports from China. Although equities have taken a battering since the market melt-up at the turn of the year when US corporate tax cuts were the focus, these moves aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t so unexpected. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s quite normal for markets to remain edgy for a month or two after such a sharp reversal and a move back towards the initial lows is not surprising. Given this weakness, we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re once again adding to equities and remain overweight stocks in the multi asset funds we manage. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s noteworthy that commodity markets haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t reacted particularly badly to the tariffs spat and emerging market equities are outperforming in the sell-off, both signs that global growth remains on track. With profits growing and interest rates still below inflation in major developed economies, the fundamentals and outlook remain positive. Cecilia Malmstrom, the EU\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade commissioner, has outlined her view on the bloc\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s temporary exemption from US tariffs in a series of tweets. The exemption was agreed after Malmstrom travelled to Washington for talks with US trade representative Robert Lighthizer and commerce secretary Wilbur Ross. Over in Brussels, where EU leaders are gathered for talks, positivity over the bloc\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 40-day exemption on tariffs, granted by Washington, appears to be wearing thin. Belgium\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Prime Minister, Charles Michel, said he was not impressed at the suspension of tariffs until 1 May: I have the impression that the US leader wants to negotiate with the European Union by putting a gun to our head. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a strange way to negotiate with an ally. Here is our latest market roundup as China reacts to US steel tariffs: Peter Rosenstreich, a trader at Swissquote, the online bank, says markets are overreacting to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153trade war hype\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd: Markets are overreacting to President Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s threats of a trade war. Trump is using the issue for political gain, rather than actual trade repositioning. This will give him a nice bullet point for stump speeches in the 2020 campaign, but he gains little from sparking a full-blown trade conflict. Besides, the World Trade Organization is still in action. Craig Erlam at online trading site Oanda, says investors are concerned that an impending trade war will derail the global economy: For a person who\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been obsessed with stock market gains since his election victory 16 months ago, US President Donald Trump doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t appear too concerned about the impact his tariffs are having at the moment. Trump may be prepared to add the European Union to the list of those that are temporarily exempt from the tariffs \u00e2\u20ac\u201c with Canada, Mexico and Australia having been allowed similar exemptions \u00e2\u20ac\u201c but that has barely cushioned the blow for investors. Understandably, the prospect of a trade war between the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s two largest economies is not particularly desirable for investors. The global economy is finally starting the tick along nicely after a decade of efforts to repair the damage of the global financial crisis and the issues that followed and now we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re potentially having to deal with an entirely self-inflicted and avoidable problem. Losses have widened across European market as investors digest the prospect of a US-China trade war. Here are the latest scores: FTSE 100: -1% at 6,884 Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s DAX: -1.9% at 11,877 France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s CAC: -1.9% at 5,068 Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB: -1.7% at 22,008 Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s IBEX: -1.5% at 9,345 Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s STOXX 600: -1.5% at 364 Wall Street is also expected to open down: Dow Jones futures: -0.7% S&amp;P futures: -0.5% Nasdaq futures: -0.9% Donald Tusk, President of the European Council, has called on the US to make permanent the EU\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s temporary exemption from steel and aluminium tariffs. He says a good trading relationship between the US and EU is essential for \u00e2\u20ac\u0153security and prosperity\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in both regions: China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s planned retaliation against US tariffs on steel imports includes a potential 25% levy on pork imported from the US. As Bloomberg explains, this would hit the US agricultural sector, particularly in Iowa, a key battleground in the 2016 presidential election: In its initial counterstrike, China announced a 25 percent levy on US pork imports - a heavy blow to Iowa, the top pork-producing state and a political battleground that swung to Trump in 2016 after going for Democrat Barack Obama in the previous two elections. Any hit to agricultural producers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 earnings would be especially painful as falling commodity prices already are hurting rural America. US farm income is forecast to drop 6.7% this year to its lowest level since 2006, according to US department of agriculture estimates that assumed normal trade relations with China. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Were farmers faced with falling prices for the exports and higher prices at home because of the import tariffs, the popularity of the tariffs would diminish quickly,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Mike Jakeman, a global analyst at the Economist Intelligence Unit. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This is a high-risk strategy for the U.S. administration and one that is likely to weaken, rather than strengthen, the global economy.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd EU leaders meeting in Brussels have welcomed President Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision to row back on plans to impose tariffs on European steel. Washington said on Thursday tariffs would be suspended for the EU - America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest trading partner - Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, Mexico and South Korea. The tariffs are suspended until 1 May as discussions continue. A spokesman for the French government said this morning: Europe has clearly stated its intention to riposte and enter a trade war ... it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a good thing that President Trump changed his mind on tariff increases. Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy minister, Peter Altmaier, said: I am very pleased that we have avoided a situation for the German steel and aluminium industry and its workers, that could have led to great uncertainty. We don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want further unilateral measures, rather we want sensible agreements. European commissioner Pierre Moscovici kept it simple: This is progress, let\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s keep talking. Theresa May has also welcomed the decision. Next is one of Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest retailers and the latest results for the year ending January 2018 reflect a tough trading backdrop on the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s high streets. Pre-tax profits fell 8% to \u00c2\u00a3726m, reflecting a 7.9% fall in sales in its shops. The drop was not enough to offset a 9% rise in online sales. Lord Wolfson, chief executive, said it had been an \u00e2\u20ac\u0153uncomfortable year\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, adding: In many ways 2017 was the most challenging year we have faced for 25 years. A difficult clothing market coincided with self-inflicted product ranging errors and omissions. At the same time, the business has had to manage the costs, systems requirements and opportunities of an accelerating structural shift in spending from retail stores to online. In the end our profits were in line with the forecast we issued in January 2017 and the company goes into the coming year in good financial health. However, investors are not perturbed by the fall in profits, given they were in line with expectations. In the absence of any nasty shocks, Next is now the biggest riser on the FTSE 100, up 3.3% at \u00c2\u00a347.83. The FTSE 100 has fallen less than expected in early trading, currently down 33 points or 0.5% at 6,919. The losses have been limited by GlaxoSmithKline and Next, which are the top two risers this morning: Shares in the pharma giant GSK are being boosted by the decision to withdraw its interest in buying Pfizer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s consumer healthcare business. GSK had been the favourite to buy the business in a multibillion-pound deal after Reckitt Benckiser pulled out. The rise in Next\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shares follow the publication of its annual results, which show an 8% fall in pre-tax profits. More on that soon. And we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re off... Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s main markets have opened down, as predicted: FTSE 100: -0.5% Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s DAX: -0.9% France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s CAC: -0.9% Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB: -1.2% Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s IBEX: -0.9% Tougher rules should be imposed on night flights and keeping costs down for passengers before parliament approves a third runway at Heathrow. That is the verdict of the transport select committee in a report published overnight. Concerns are centred on the environmental impact of Heathrow expansion, as Lilian Greenwood, the committee\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chair, explains: At present, the draft national policy statement does not guarantee that passengers will be protected from the cost risks associated with the scheme. The secretary of state must set out how airport charges will be held down. She added: Thousands of people across London could be exposed to worse levels of noise, air quality and traffic congestion \u00e2\u20ac\u201c there must be sufficient measures to protect or compensate them. Read our full story on the report: European markets are expected to follow Asia lower when they open in about 20 minutes. Here are the opening calls from traders at the spread-betting firm IG: Jasper Lawler at London Capital Group says the stand-off between the US and China is sending a chill through the markets: Despite Trump claiming that the tariffs would make the US \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a much stronger nation\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd the markets are keenly aware that there will be no winners in a trade war. Worse still, the tit for tat responses that we are now seeing - and can expect to see more of - between the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s two largest economies, is damaging for their economies and the broader global economy. Good morning if you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re just joining us \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and hello again if you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve already been reading. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been a very busy day so far on the stock and currency markets so here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a roundup of what\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s happened: Fears of a global trade war have intensified after China signalled it would retaliate against US tariffs. Beijing said it didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want a trade war and urged the US to pull back from the brink. But it said it wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t afraid of one and has drawn up a list of more than 100 US products that it will hit with duties if Donald Trump goes ahead with his tariffs on Chinese steel and aluminium. Stock markets in Asia have fallen sharply. The Nikkei in Japan closed down 4.51% and in Hong Kong and Shanghai, where trading is still going on, the markets are down 3.18% and 3.4%. European markets are set to open down as well with FTSE 100 on course to drop 0.74% Key industrial commodities have been hit as well, with the iron ore futures price down 5% and copper at a three-month low The yen is up as the US dollar continued to slump. The pound rose against the greenback to $1.415. For a roundup here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our news story: Spreadbetters are forecasting that the FTSE100 will lose about 0.8% when trading starts in London in an hour or so. Bourses are about to open in Europe though, and they too are expected to take a hefty hit. These are the predicted openings: Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s DAX -1.6% France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s CAC -1.5% S&amp;P 0.6% The Kospi index in Seoul, South Korea has closed down 3.29%, or 82 points at 2,414. The country has a large export industry and stands to lose out if there is a trade war between the US and China. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest trading partner is China and the US is its second biggest. SE Kim, an employee at a construction company in Seoul, told AP: I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m worried that it would affect the national economy. If the US imposes tariffs on China like that, I think there would be some damage on us in the long term as well. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been a pretty rough few days on the financial markets. Facebook\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s woes are punishing the tech sector, the US Fed hiked interests rates on Wednesday and the Bank of England rate setters were split 7-2 in favour of keeping rates on hold. Only a matter of time before that changes, many believe. And now the prospect of a trade war. Michael Hewson at CMC Markets says the potential for a big selloff in the tech sector is especially worrying: Investors should be rightly fearful of [the Facebook selloff] given that the tech sector has driven most of the gains in US markets over the past 18 months. A meltdown in this sector has the potential to get very messy indeed, with related ripple out effects. This week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Fed decision to raise rates and tweak its guidance appears to have cut the rug out further from under the US dollar as policymakers adopted a safety first approach to future rate rise expectations, leaving them unchanged for this year. This appears to have caught markets off balance sending bond yields sharply lower and the US 10 and 2-year spread back towards its previous lows, though some of these declines could also be attributed to concerns about tariffs. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s worth looking again at the statement from the Chinese commerce ministry earlier today. It said that China did not want a trade war, but it was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153not afraid\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd of having one. China doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t hope to be in a trade war, but is not afraid of engaging in one. China hopes the United States will pull back from the brink, make prudent decisions, and avoid dragging bilateral trade relations to a dangerous place. The interesting thing here is that it does leave a bit of wriggle room so might not necessarily result in an all-out trade war as noted by some of our experts. The memorandum signed by Trump on Thursday allows for a 30-day consultation period that only starts once a list of Chinese goods to be taxed is published. Trump said he views the Chinese as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a friend\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, and both sides are in talks so it could be resolved. The commerce industry said China was considering measures in two stages: a 15% hit on 120 US products, including steel pipes, dried fruit and wine worth $977m. China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s list also included close to 80 fruit and nut products. Then it would levy 25% on $1.99bn of pork and recycled aluminium. The market in Tokyo is closed. It finished down 4.51%, or 974 points at 20,617. Masses of reaction from traders so let\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s try to roundup some of their comments. Masafumi Yamamoto, chief forex strategist at Mizuho Securities in Tokyo, sounded a slightly optimistic tone to Reuters by saying that US tariffs might not be quite as bad they appear. But then he essentially says it might get worse before it gets better: In the longer run, protectionist policies touted by the United States could be watered down, in turn limiting the negative effect on trade and the global economy. But until the United States makes such concessions, global stocks will be under pressure and the yen will appreciate, especially if China decides to confront the U.S. measures. Similarly, Vishnu Varathan of Mizuho Bank is quoted by Associated Press saying: Beijing is extending an olive branch and urging the U.S. to resolve trade disputes through dialogue rather than tariffs. Nevertheless, the first volley of shots and retaliatory response has been set off. Paul Eitelman, senior investment strategist at Russell Investments, tells Bloomberg: It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a significant step in escalation in trade tensions between the US and China. The biggest watchpoint from here is how China responds to this and any potential escalation that creates going forward. The Australian benchmark index, the ASX200, has closed down almost 2%. The big miners, such as BHP and Rio Tinto, were among the biggest losers amid concern that demand for the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest export \u00e2\u20ac\u201c iron ore \u00e2\u20ac\u201c will be hurt by the tariffs. Elsewhere it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s an even grimmer picture. In Tokyo the Nikkei is off a whopping 4.58%. The yen has risen as invesors seek a safe haven, but that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bad news for Japan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s exporters, hence the big drop in equities. Australia fears it could be hit by steel tariffs after it emerged that an exemption promised by Donald Trump would run on 1 May. The White House said Friday that Australia, Europe, South Korea, Canada, Mexico, Argentina and Brazil would initially escape America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 25% steel and 10% aluminium tariffs. But that would run out in a matter of weeks \u00e2\u20ac\u0153pending discussions of satisfactory long-term alternative means to address the threatened impairment to US national security\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. The country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade minister, Steve Ciobo, said Australia could not have a fairer deal with the US but it may find itself in the same boat as China. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the full story: And find out more about the EU\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s reprieve \u00e2\u20ac\u201c temporary or otherwise \u00e2\u20ac\u201c with this story from our man in Brussels, Daniel Boffey: Good afternoon/good morning and welcome to our business live blog on a tumultuous day for the world economy. China has wasted no time in signalling that it will retaliate against Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision to impose tariffs on Chinese steel and aluminium imports. Beijing\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s swift response was expected and, although Asian stock markets have been battered in the wake of Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s move, it left some room for negotiation with a plea for the US to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153pull back from the brink\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Here are the main developments so far: China will impose duties on US pork, apples and steel pipe among other things unless a settlement could be reached Beijing\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s commerce ministry said it didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want a trade war but was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153not afraid of having one\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd if the US didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t back down Asian shares fell sharply along with key commodities such as iron ore The Nikkei is down 4.4%; Hang Seng -2.8%; ASX200 in Sydney -2%; Kospi in Seoul 2.2%; CSI in Shanghai 3.2%. The FTSE100 looks set to drop nearly 1% this morning, according to futures trade, while Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax is set to drop 1.6%. The Dalian iron ore price is down 5% on fears of a drop in demand for steel Copper fell to a three-month low of $6,628.00 per tonne, but oil rose 1% on the back of more Saudi production cuts The yen and bond prices rose as the US dollar fell back The pound was up slightly at $1.416 and \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.444.",

In the bible of modern capitalism, the Wealth of Nations, Smith said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153To widen the market may frequently be agreeable enough to the interest of the public; but to narrow the competition must always be against it.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Excessive market power, in other words, is bad because it thwarts progress. Old established businesses can see off potential rivals even though the new entrants might have new and better ways of doing things.</p> \n<p>This concept, that Facebook <em>et al </em>are anti-capitalist, explains why the pressure for anti-trust action against them is coming from both right and left \u00e2\u20ac\u201c from Steve Bannon, Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s former chief strategist, as well as from the leading Democrat Elizabeth Warren. <br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> \n<p>After all, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s said, much of the innovation that blossomed in Silicon Valley was the result of the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breakup_of_the_Bell_System\">breakup of the telephone company AT&amp;T in 1982</a>. AT&amp;T saw off challengers by deciding what equipment could be used on its national network: Google does the same by using algorithms to decide what comes up on an internet search. Without government action, there was no real prospect of AT&amp;T\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stranglehold being broken and the same applies today given the market dominance of the big tech giants.</p> \n<p>The reality is that breaking up Facebook, Google and Amazon would not be as simple as their critics think. America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s anti-trust legislation is tightly defined and there is no provision for action simply because a company is deemed to be too big. What counts is whether size is being exploited to damage consumer interests.</p> \n<p>That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s going to be tricky to prove. Consumers get Google and Facebook for free, while Amazon offers books \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and an array of other goods \u00e2\u20ac\u201c at a discount. Nor can it be said the companies are failing to invest in new products: all three companies devote an impressive share of their turnover to R&amp;D.</p> \n<p>Actually, of course, consumers are not getting Google and Facebook for free. They don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have to part with hard cash but they have to accept that their online activities will be constantly monitored so that advertisers \u00e2\u20ac\u201c commercial or political \u00e2\u20ac\u201c can tailor ads personally for them. People are now waking up to the terms of this Faustian bargain, which is why there will be calls for a change in US competition policy to make anti-trust action easier to prosecute.</p> \n<p>This would require an ideological shift. Americans think the reason they have a Facebook, a Google and an Amazon and the Europeans don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t is that they have a more relaxed attitude towards companies growing big and powerful. The US sees winner-takes-all markets as the law of the capitalist jungle; the EU sees them as an intrinsic threat to consumers.</p> \n<p>A twin-track approach \u00e2\u20ac\u201c tougher regulation of Big Tech with the threat of anti-trust action if it doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t comply \u00e2\u20ac\u201c looks likelier than an immediate recourse to breakup. There are echoes here of the financial crash of a decade ago. Back then, there were calls for a new <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2010/jan/28/glass-steagall-act-glossary\">Glass Steagall</a> act to break up the banks into retail and investment arms, as was the case from the 1930s to the 1990s. It didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t happen. The banks expressed regret and then used their considerable lobbying power to head off or water down the threat of radical reform. Politicians talked a lot tougher than they eventually acted. They should be careful not to make the same mistake again.<br></p>",

It is this charge \u00e2\u20ac\u201c that the disruptive startup companies of yesteryear are today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s anti-capitalists \u00e2\u20ac\u201c that creates the biggest risk of anti-trust action. Those who have Facebook, Google and Amazon in their sights can draw on Adam Smith for support. In the bible of modern capitalism, the Wealth of Nations, Smith said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153To widen the market may frequently be agreeable enough to the interest of the public; but to narrow the competition must always be against it.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Excessive market power, in other words, is bad because it thwarts progress. Old established businesses can see off potential rivals even though the new entrants might have new and better ways of doing things. This concept, that Facebook et al are anti-capitalist, explains why the pressure for anti-trust action against them is coming from both right and left \u00e2\u20ac\u201c from Steve Bannon, Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s former chief strategist, as well as from the leading Democrat Elizabeth Warren. After all, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s said, much of the innovation that blossomed in Silicon Valley was the result of the breakup of the telephone company AT&amp;T in 1982. AT&amp;T saw off challengers by deciding what equipment could be used on its national network: Google does the same by using algorithms to decide what comes up on an internet search. Without government action, there was no real prospect of AT&amp;T\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stranglehold being broken and the same applies today given the market dominance of the big tech giants. The reality is that breaking up Facebook, Google and Amazon would not be as simple as their critics think. America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s anti-trust legislation is tightly defined and there is no provision for action simply because a company is deemed to be too big. What counts is whether size is being exploited to damage consumer interests. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s going to be tricky to prove. Consumers get Google and Facebook for free, while Amazon offers books \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and an array of other goods \u00e2\u20ac\u201c at a discount. Nor can it be said the companies are failing to invest in new products: all three companies devote an impressive share of their turnover to R&amp;D. Actually, of course, consumers are not getting Google and Facebook for free. They don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have to part with hard cash but they have to accept that their online activities will be constantly monitored so that advertisers \u00e2\u20ac\u201c commercial or political \u00e2\u20ac\u201c can tailor ads personally for them. People are now waking up to the terms of this Faustian bargain, which is why there will be calls for a change in US competition policy to make anti-trust action easier to prosecute. This would require an ideological shift. Americans think the reason they have a Facebook, a Google and an Amazon and the Europeans don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t is that they have a more relaxed attitude towards companies growing big and powerful. The US sees winner-takes-all markets as the law of the capitalist jungle; the EU sees them as an intrinsic threat to consumers. A twin-track approach \u00e2\u20ac\u201c tougher regulation of Big Tech with the threat of anti-trust action if it doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t comply \u00e2\u20ac\u201c looks likelier than an immediate recourse to breakup. There are echoes here of the financial crash of a decade ago. Back then, there were calls for a new Glass Steagall act to break up the banks into retail and investment arms, as was the case from the 1930s to the 1990s. It didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t happen. The banks expressed regret and then used their considerable lobbying power to head off or water down the threat of radical reform. Politicians talked a lot tougher than they eventually acted. They should be careful not to make the same mistake again.",

Trade war concerns take centre stage and are adding uncertainty to the outlook for businesses and impacting the view on the general economic situation for consumers. Both manufacturers and the service sector experienced declining sentiment. Consumer confidence was unchanged after a large drop in February as lower expectations for inflation offset a weaker view on the economy and household finances.</p> <p>Last month, the drop was mainly due to a decline in expectations from manufacturers and consumers. The developments in recent production, new orders and exports were only slightly negative. This month, we see indicators for recent production and new orders have come down somewhat more. Even though still at elevated levels of activity, this does signal that some moderation of growth seems to be under way.</p> <p>On the bright side, employment expectations in services continue to improve despite uncertainty about global growth, meaning that the job market is likely to stand firm in the months ahead which should limit the downside to consumption growth as well. Export orders books only dropped from 2.5 to 2, indicating that the main channel through which trade concerns impact the economy for the moment is confidence and not yet trade itself.</p> <p>The inflation outlook came down in March as both consumers and businesses in manufacturing and services saw selling price expectations decrease. As pipeline price pressures seem to level off a bit and the economic outlook is coming down from cloud nine, there is not much in this survey that will please the ECB. Expect continued dovish talk as the summer and decision on QE approaches.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5aba0910e4b0a30fbbaa0e44\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-03-27T09:12:10.898Z\">10.12am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Eurozone business confidence falls</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>European businesses have become more downbeat, according to <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/business-economy-euro/indicators-statistics/economic-databases/business-and-consumer-surveys/download-business-and-consumer-survey-data/press-releases_en\">the latest snapshot of economic sentiment.</a></p> <p>The European Commission\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s index for the eurozone fell to 112.6 in March from 114.2 in the previous month, below estimates of a level of 113.4.

The Commission said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The marginally stronger decrease of the headline indicator for the EU (-1.9) was mainly due to the marked deterioration of sentiment in the largest non-euro area EU economies, the UK (-4.2), and Poland (-2.0).

Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The rebound in the US [came] as China moved to assuage US concerns about its trade policies by pledging to open up its markets to external companies.

                "bodyText":"Signs that the US and China could be talking behind the scenes about avoiding a trade war have given global markets a lift after last week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s slump. European markets, which had missed out on Monday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s gains, have moved sharply higher today, with the FTSE 100 currently up around 2%, Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax 1.7% better and France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac climbing 1.3%. At the US open, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has also risen after Monday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 700 point gain. There were signs of weakness in the European economy, as business sentiment fell by more than expected in March. Elsewhere our monthly Brexit watch showed the UK economy showing signs of steadying a year ahead of the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s departure from the European Union. On the corporate front, the insolvency service wants to disqualify former BHS owner Dominic Chappell from being a director for up to 15 years. In the bid battle for GKN, which comes to a head on Thursday, predator Melrose has promised to keep the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s aerospace division for at least five years. And more bad news for retailers, with profit falls at H&amp;M, Moss Bros and Game Digital. On that note it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time to close for the day. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be back tomorrow. The rally on US markets on Monday which saw the Dow Jones Industrial Average add nearly 700 points has continued at the opening of trading. The easing of fears over a possible trade war between the US and China has lifted the Dow another 50 points or 0.2%, while the S&amp;P 500 opened up 0.3% and the Nasdaq Composite up 0.48%. Sterling is falling back after its recent strong run after last week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s agreement between the UK and EU on a Brexit transition deal. A spate of profit taking has seen the pound fall 0.8% against the dollar to $1.4114 and 0.3% against the euro to \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.1399. The UK economy is steadying after the initial fallout from the vote to leave the European Union, according to our monthly Brexit watch series. Richard Partington reports: As the one-year countdown to Brexit looms, the British economy is showing signs of steadying from the fallout triggered by the EU referendum, according to a Guardian analysis of economic news over the past month. After progress with Brussels towards a two-year transitional deal to smooth Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s formal exit from the EU on 29 March 2019, the pound has risen back towards the highest levels seen since the leave vote. Inflation triggered by the drop in sterling after the referendum is finally beginning to fade, just as pay rises begin to come through for workers. But while the Guardian\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s latest Brexit dashboard hands support to Philip Hammond\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s reasons for feeling \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Tiggerish\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd at the spring statement earlier this month, sharp challenges remain. The full story is here: And here are the monthly statistics: And the experts\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 verdict: Following the collapse of BHS, the insolvency service has said it will bring proceedings to disqualify Dominic Chappell, who bought the department store group from Sir Philip Green from running a company for up to 15 years. Its full verdict: We can confirm the Insolvency Service has written to Dominic Chappell and three other former directors of BHS and connected companies informing them that we intend to bring proceedings to have them disqualified from running or controlling companies for periods up to 15 years. We can also confirm that we have written to Sir Philip Green, also a former director of BHS, informing him that we do not currently intend bring disqualification proceedings against him. As this matter may now be tested in the Court it is not appropriate to comment further. Royal Bank of Scotland has made its first acquisition since its ill-fated purchase of ABN Amro which went sour during the financial crisis. PA has the details: RBS has snapped up accounting software firm FreeAgent, marking the lender\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s first acquisition since its controversial crisis-era deal to buy ABN Amro. The taxpayer-owned bank said it had agreed to buy the company for around 120p per share, valuing it at 53 million. The decision comes weeks after the company reported its first profit in a decade and as the Government prepares to start selling off its 72% holding. Chief executive Ross McEwan said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We have been impressed by FreeAgent and its technology and are excited by the enhanced offering we will be able to provide to our customers. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We believe that a technology-enabled solution for our business banking customers will make it easier for our customers to build their businesses safely and securely.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd It marks RBS\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s first foray into deal-making since its 49 billion acquisition of Dutch bank ABN Amro in 2007, which quickly turned toxic. In 2008, RBS was forced to announce an emergency rights issue, asking existing shareholders to inject 12 billion into the firm to strengthen its reserves. Months later, the value of RBS shares plunged 90%, prompting a 45.5 billion Government bailout. FreeAgent specialises in cloud-based accounting software and mobile applications aimed at businesses with 10 or fewer employees. Given Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s keenness on a strong stock market he may not want to really follow through on his trade war threats, suggest Craig Erlam, senior market analyst at Oanda There are a lot of risks that financial markets have shrugged off over the last couple of years, to the amazement at times of investors, but the prospect of a trade war is clearly not one of these. [This] has weighed heavily on risk appetite over the last couple of weeks with US equity markets posting significant losses on Thursday and Friday as things heated up. The message over the weekend though was far less confrontational and suggested the US would be open to scrapping the tariffs in exchange for certain other concessions such as reduced tariffs on important cars. Ultimately, Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s target was and remains to reduce the county\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sizeable trade deficit with a number of countries and while he may give the impression that a trade war is a worthwhile sacrifice, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m not sure he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s as keen on it as he makes out. The question now is how big a concession other countries are willing to make to appease him, if any, and whether it will be sufficient enough for him to sell it to US voters as a worthwhile victory. Given the reaction we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve seen in markets over the last couple of week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be keen to follow through on his threats and risk sending markets into a tailspin. European markets continue to gain ground. With the Dow Jones Industrial Average expected to open around 170 points higher, the FTSE 100 is now up 140 points or 2%, Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax is 2.01% higher and France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac has climbed 1.5%. As far as the FTSE 100 goes, the rise comes after four straight declines and marks the biggest one day rise for nearly a year (since 24 April 2017). The outlook for the eurozone economy could well become less benign over the summer as uncertainty impacts sentiment, says Bert Colijn, senior eurozone economist at ING Bank. And there is little in the latest confidence survey which will please the European Central Bank, he says: This drop in the eurozone sentiment indicator from 114.2 to 112.6 rounds out the second month of disappointing survey data for the Eurozone. While the economy continues to perform strongly, some clouds have reemerged on the horizon. Trade war concerns take centre stage and are adding uncertainty to the outlook for businesses and impacting the view on the general economic situation for consumers. Both manufacturers and the service sector experienced declining sentiment. Consumer confidence was unchanged after a large drop in February as lower expectations for inflation offset a weaker view on the economy and household finances. Last month, the drop was mainly due to a decline in expectations from manufacturers and consumers. The developments in recent production, new orders and exports were only slightly negative. This month, we see indicators for recent production and new orders have come down somewhat more. Even though still at elevated levels of activity, this does signal that some moderation of growth seems to be under way. On the bright side, employment expectations in services continue to improve despite uncertainty about global growth, meaning that the job market is likely to stand firm in the months ahead which should limit the downside to consumption growth as well. Export orders books only dropped from 2.5 to 2, indicating that the main channel through which trade concerns impact the economy for the moment is confidence and not yet trade itself. The inflation outlook came down in March as both consumers and businesses in manufacturing and services saw selling price expectations decrease. As pipeline price pressures seem to level off a bit and the economic outlook is coming down from cloud nine, there is not much in this survey that will please the ECB. Expect continued dovish talk as the summer and decision on QE approaches. European businesses have become more downbeat, according to the latest snapshot of economic sentiment. The European Commission\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s index for the eurozone fell to 112.6 in March from 114.2 in the previous month, below estimates of a level of 113.4. There was decline optimism among the manufacturing, service and retail sectors, but the construction sector showed a small improvement. But consumer sentiment was unchanged from February to March. In the EU as a whole, the index fell by 1.9 points to 112.5, partly due to a sharp drop in the UK. The Commission said: The marginally stronger decrease of the headline indicator for the EU (-1.9) was mainly due to the marked deterioration of sentiment in the largest non-euro area EU economies, the UK (-4.2), and Poland (-2.0). In line with the euro area, confidence deteriorated strongly in industry, services, and retail trade, while it increased slightly in the construction sector and remained unchanged among consumers. Back with GKN and the hostile bid from Melrose, union Unite has repeated its opposition to the proposed takeover. In a letter to GKN shareholders it lists a number of reasons why: A Melrose takeover has the potential to severely damage GKN\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s customer base The timescales required in the aerospace and automotive industries is not compatible with Melrose\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s approach Melrose does not have the skills or experience needed to make this bid a success Melrose\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s plans for splitting the company will weaken its future prospects Increase in debt will increase risk Role of short-term investors in the takeover process - their support for the bid is motivated by a desire to make a short-term profit through arbitrage GKN stakeholders united in opposition to Melrose\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bid - Concern has been expressed by the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s customers, its trade unions, its pension fund trustees, politicians and a growing number of long-term shareholders. The union concludes: We do not believe this bid is in the long-term interest of GKN and are concerned that it would jeopardise the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s future. The choice facing investors is between a long-term future for GKN or a short-term, high-risk approach from Melrose. We therefore ask you not to accept Melrose\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s offer. So far it seems there may not be any profit taking when Wall Street opens later, despite Monday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s near 700 point surge on the Dow Jones Industrial Average. The futures are pointing to a 100 point plus rise on the Dow in early trading, which should continue to give some support to European markets. Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK, said: US markets look set to build on yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s gains despite their biggest one day gain in over 2 years, as trade concerns move further into the background. Shares in focus are likely to include Facebook which, despite dropping below $150 for the first time since July last year, still managed to close higher on the day. Ahead of Thursday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s deadline for GKN investors to decide whether to accept the hostile \u00c2\u00a37.9bn bid from turnaround specialist Melrose or back the board, comes the daily update on the battle. This time Melrose has made some commitments to try and keep interested parties - not least the UK government - happy. Reuters has the details: Melrose on Tuesday pledged to own the Aerospace division of its bid target GKN for at least five years and to increase funding in apprenticeships and R&amp;D in a last-ditch bid to win government backing for its hostile takeover. In one of Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s most hotly contested corporate battles for years, shareholders have until 1pm BST on Thursday to accept the hostile bid from turnaround specialist Melrose or GKN\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s plan to split off its auto unit and combine it with US group Dana, leaving GKN focused on Aerospace. Some politicians have objected to Melrose buying GKN because they fear it could break up the mainstay of Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s engineering sector and sell it on to foreign buyers. On Tuesday Melrose said it would keep the Aerospace unit until April 2023. Melrose said it reserved the right to list the Aerospace division on the stock market however and added that were it to be approached by a strategic buyer in that time, it would seek the approval of the government to sell. The group said it would also pump a further \u00c2\u00a310m into the company over five years to support the creation of between 100 and 150 new apprenticeships in engineering, technology and science, a key area of focus for the government which is promoting an industrial strategy as it leaves the EU. It has also committed to spend at least 2.2 percent of sales on research and development, saying this figure should be seen as a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153floor, not a ceiling on our ambitions\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. More downbeat news from the high street. Fashion retailer H&amp;M has reported a 61% fall in first quarter profits and said higher inventories would lead to increased markdowns in the second three months of the year. The Swedish company had already warned in February that weak demand would hit its earnings. Elsewhere Game Digital said half year revenues rose from \u00c2\u00a3498m to \u00c2\u00a3517m but profits fell 25.5% from \u00c2\u00a316.5m to \u00c2\u00a312.3m. It said it would continue to negotiate property savings, close stores and rationalise retail working hours, but looked forward to a large number of new software releases, especially in the final quarter of this year. And Moss Bros confirmed last week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s warning by unveiling a 6.1% fall in annual profits to \u00c2\u00a36.7m, hit by stock shortages and a tough retail environment. Richard Hunter, head of markets at interactive investor, said: Last week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s profit warning may have taken some of the sting out of the situation, but Moss Bros is already facing an uphill struggle for the remainder of its trading year. After the rise on Wall Street and Asia as trade tensions between the US and China ease, European markets have followed suit. The FTSE 100 is up 90 points or 1.3%, Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax has opened up 1.8%, France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac has climbed 1.35% and Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB is 1.48% better. The only faller in the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s leading index is drinks giant Diageo, down marginally after it announced that the appointment of Ursula Burns to its board - due on 2 April - would be delayed following news she would be made interim executive chair of Nasdaq listed Veon. Another factor for the renewed buoyancy in stock markets comes from North Korea, says Naeem Aslam, chief market analyst at ThinkMarkets : Investors have reacted positively to the surprise visit of North Korea\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s leader Kim Jong Un to China. This is his first trip outside his country since he became the leader of his country. Traders are considering this event as a further evidence of de-escalation of tensions in the Asia region. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. A surge on Wall Street has lifted Asian markets and is expected to do the same for European shares, as investors become increasingly convinced the US and China can resolve their trade issues. After last week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rout in the wake of President Trump announcing $60bn of tariffs on Chinese imports to the US, on top of his steel and aluminium sanctions, signs that the two sides were talking has led to a market revival. Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK, said: The rebound in the US [came] as China moved to assuage US concerns about its trade policies by pledging to open up its markets to external companies. Chinese officials also pledged to overhaul protection for intellectual property rights. There was also an offer to buy more US semiconductors, as well as offering to finalise rules that would allow foreign financial firms to take stakes in Chinese securities companies, along with talk of lowering the tariff that is levied on US car imports of 25% These concessions while fairly modest would allow the US administration to claim progress on changing the status quo where trade is concerned and could pave the way for further discussions further down the line. So the Dow Jones Industrial Average jumped 2.81% or 669 points - the third highest points gain ever and its best percentage gain for nearly two and a half years. Although to put that in context, the percentage rise was less than the 2.93% slump recorded on Thursday after Trump unveiled the Chinese move. Nevertheless, the revival on Wall Street has pushed Asian shares higher, with the Nikkei 225 up 2.3% and the Hang Seng around 0.9% better. European shares missed out on the gains yesterday, partly on concerns about a slowdown in the region\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy, said Hewson, with the US tax reforms which helped support Wall Street before the tariff shenanigans unlikely to give much of a lift to European companies. But they are expected to benefit in early trading, with the FTSE 100 expected to open around 80 points higher, Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax up 170 points and France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac around 60 points. Elsewhere it is another fairly quiet day on the economic front, apart from eurozone and consumer confidence figures and a US manufacturing survey. On the corporate front, GlaxoSmithKline is planning a review of its Horlicks business as part of a deal to buy out Novartis\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 36.5% stake in their Consumer Healthcare Joint Venture for $13bn. And one of the founders of Superdry, Julian Dunkerton is leaving the retailer on Saturday to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153devote more time to his other business and charitable interests.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd",

Peter Welford at Jefferies says the structure of any deal is uncertain:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p> We see the potential strategic rationale for the deal and have long highlighted Shire is currently trading at a substantial discount to our fundamental 4300p or so value given overhangs, notably haemophilia competitive concerns. Nevertheless Takeda\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s near.$42bn market cap versus Shire\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s $47bn or $66bn enterprise value raises questions on a potential deal structure....</p> <p>We presume Takeda would need a significant equity raise to acquire Shire, suggesting a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153merger\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd is perhaps better terminology, which may raise hurdles to the successful completion of any future deal.</p> </blockquote> <p>Jack Scannell at UBS says other bidders could emerge:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Since Takeda\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s market cap is close to Shire\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s we assume a potential offer would have to include a substantial percentage in equity and how Shire\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s board and shareholders would react is hard to predict. However as Shire\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s share price is significantly below the net present value of our cash flow estimates, Takeda could trigger discussion of other bidders.</p> <p> Shire does not strike us as an obvious take-over candidate. There is presumably a price at which the financial engineering would work. However, Shire\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s specialty focus and mix of therapeutic foci means that most buyers would struggle to extract substantial operational synergies while escaping from competition problems, in our view. Also Shire\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s low corporate tax rate could rise in most scenarios were the company acquired. It would also be a bold acquisition in our view given the uncertain trajectory of Shire\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s haemophilia business. A merger of equals in this context might be more feasible.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2018-03-28T12:15:53.943Z\">at 1.15pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5abb7826e4b0ea82609d1836\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-03-28T11:13:46.699Z\">12.13pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The potential offer for Shire has helped the FTSE 100 come off its worst levels after the morning\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s earlier declines.</p> <p>The UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s leading index is now down just 0.12% or around 8 points, with Shire up 18% and fellow drugs group GlaxoSmithKline 1.5% better.</p> <p>Elsewhere though the fallout from the US tech slump continues.

In a new report, the agency says:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Global momentum has lifted the eurozone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economic prospects, and it now appears to have reached cruising altitude. The economic and monetary union closed 2017 on a high note, with GDP growth at 2.5%, its fastest pace in a decade.</p> <p>...S&amp;P Global Ratings\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 economists say the chief reason for this is the revival of world trade, which has put the eurozone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s industries back in motion. Capacity utilization was just short of its 2007 high, triggering stronger investment and boosting industry prospects for this year.</p> <p>However, the general fall in sentiment surveys at the start of 2018 indicates that eurozone growth is leveling off. Firms are increasingly reporting that supply constraints, rather than demand, are a drag on output. Nonetheless, for now, we expect the growth momentum will stay solid, thanks to the broad-based economic expansion and strong domestic fundamentals.</p> </blockquote> <p>It added:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p> Strong fundamentals in the eurozone suggest that economic expansion will continue at a brisk pace, and we have raised our GDP growth forecasts for the region to 2.3% this year and 1.9% in 2019.</p> <p>We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve also raised our euro-dollar exchange rate forecast to $1.27 in 2018 and $1.3 in 2019, since we expect the dollar\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s weakness will persist.</p> <p>The current growth cycle appears to have peaked, but the remaining slack in the labor market and productivity rebound will keep inflationary pressures in check until the end of 2019.</p> <p>Because inflation will likely remain subdued this year, we expect the ECB will only gradually wind down its asset purchase program from September until the end of this year. As the gap between structural and real unemployment diminishes, earnings growth will accelerate.

Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>For all the gains seen in US markets over the past 18 months the bulk of these have been driven by tech stocks, and yesterday these tech stocks swooned quite sharply, reversing a good proportion of Monday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s gains, in the process dragging the S&amp;P500 back down towards its 200 day moving average. </p> <p>This rolling over in tech stocks looks set to weigh on European markets this morning, with a lower open as markets mull over the potential for uncertainty over a tech sector that could catch a cold as a result of Facebook\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s woes around user data. </p> <p>With the increasing focus on what is going with respect to how Facebook has managed its users personal data, it must surely be only a matter of time before attention turns to the rest of the tech sector, and how companies like Alphabet, Twitter, Microsoft and Apple to name a few, manage their own users personal data.

The US economy is expected to have grown by 2.7% in the fourth quarter on an annualised basis, up from 2.5%. Jasper Lawler at London Capital Group said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The economic backdrop was supportive in the last quarter of 2017. Robust jobs growth and healthy consumer spending comfortably propped up the economy, which is expected to be reflected in an upwards revision for economic growth to 2.7% on an annualised basis from 2.5% in the previous estimate. The reading will not yet include the benefits from the tax cuts, nor the more recent uncertainties over global trade. However, given how quiet the economic calendar is, the reading is expected to attract attention anyway.</p> <p>A surprise to the upside, could boost the possibility of a June rate hike up from the CME FedWatch odds of 78%, lifting the dollar back towards 90.00. On the contrary, should growth remain around 2.5%, we could see buying demand for the dollar decline and the greenback look to test 89.00 once more.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>The agenda:</strong></p> <p>11.00 BST: CBI distributive trades survey</p> <p>13.30 BST: US fourth quarter GDP</p> </div>   </div>",
                "bodyText":"It was another volatile session for stock markets. After Tuesday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s slump on Wall Street, driven predominantly by sharp declines in technology stocks, European markets opened mostly lower. However they came off their worst levels as the US market managed to stage a mild recovery, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average currently marginally in positive territory, up 35 points, although the tech-heavy Nasdaq is down around 1%. Amazon in particular is being hit by reports that the US president plans to go after the company and altering its tax treatment. The FTSE 100, now up around 9 points, was supported by news of a potential bid for UK listed pharmaceutical group Shire from Japan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Takeda. Shire\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shares jumped, valuing the company at more than \u00c2\u00a335bn at one point. Elsewhere there was more bad news for the UK high street, with retail sales falling in March for the first time since October, according to the CBI. But the US economy grew more strongly than expected in the final quarter. And there was a positive report on the eurozone economy from S&amp;P Global ratings. On that note, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time to close for the day. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be back tomorrow. Back with Shire, and Ketan Patel at EdenTree Investment Management says it could be a key moment if a deal goes ahead: If a bid does materialise from Takeda for drug maker Shire, it would be a watershed moment for Japanese pharma. There hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t been a cross border transaction in the sector, excluding joint ventures and small generic M&amp;A. Takeda\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s cash laden balance sheet appears a good fit for Shire\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s struggling balance sheet, following recent large scale M&amp;A. The attraction for Takeda is the highly lucrative rare disease market in the US, which comes with exceedingly high margins and is largely exempt from the usual pricing pressure that affects the wider pharmaceutical sector. After Tuesday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tech-inspired slump, there is little respite for the sector despite US markets generally starting the day on a slightly more positive note. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is up 121 points or 0.53% in early trading, while the S&amp;P 500 has edged up 0.05%. But the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite has opened down 0.35%. The stronger than expected US GDP figure will revive talk about how many interest rate rises the Federal Reserve will sanction this year. Dennis de Jong, managing director at UFX.com, said: Robust jobs growth and healthy consumer spending have been attributed to today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stronger than expected US GDP data, as the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economic outlook appears in rude health and the 3% growth target appears within touching distance. ...As a result of the strong economic outlook, questions may be raised around the possibility of Fed Chair Jerome Powell introducing a June rate hike. It may be a case of US growth being monitored before any rate decision is made, but markets could be volatile between now and then. The 2.9% growth in the US economy, although better than the initial estimates, shows a slowdown from the 3.2% rise recorded in the third quarter. The figures were helped by the biggest rise in consumer spending for three years, offset by a surge in imports. The Bureau of Economic Analysis said: The increase in real GDP in the fourth quarter primarily reflected positive contributions from personal consumption expenditures, nonresidential fixed investment, exports, residential fixed investment, state and local government spending, and federal government spending that were partly offset by a negative contribution from private inventory investment. Imports, which are a subtraction in the calculation of GDP, increased. Breaking news: Something for Donald Trump to tweet about. The US economy grew more strongly than expected in the final quarter, up 2.9% on an annualised basis compared to expectations of a 2.7% increase and an initial estimate of 2.5% growth. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s some analyst reaction to the possible Shire deal. Peter Welford at Jefferies says the structure of any deal is uncertain: We see the potential strategic rationale for the deal and have long highlighted Shire is currently trading at a substantial discount to our fundamental 4300p or so value given overhangs, notably haemophilia competitive concerns. Nevertheless Takeda\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s near.$42bn market cap versus Shire\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s $47bn or $66bn enterprise value raises questions on a potential deal structure.... We presume Takeda would need a significant equity raise to acquire Shire, suggesting a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153merger\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd is perhaps better terminology, which may raise hurdles to the successful completion of any future deal. Jack Scannell at UBS says other bidders could emerge: Since Takeda\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s market cap is close to Shire\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s we assume a potential offer would have to include a substantial percentage in equity and how Shire\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s board and shareholders would react is hard to predict. However as Shire\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s share price is significantly below the net present value of our cash flow estimates, Takeda could trigger discussion of other bidders. Shire does not strike us as an obvious take-over candidate. There is presumably a price at which the financial engineering would work. However, Shire\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s specialty focus and mix of therapeutic foci means that most buyers would struggle to extract substantial operational synergies while escaping from competition problems, in our view. Also Shire\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s low corporate tax rate could rise in most scenarios were the company acquired. It would also be a bold acquisition in our view given the uncertain trajectory of Shire\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s haemophilia business. A merger of equals in this context might be more feasible. The potential offer for Shire has helped the FTSE 100 come off its worst levels after the morning\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s earlier declines. The UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s leading index is now down just 0.12% or around 8 points, with Shire up 18% and fellow drugs group GlaxoSmithKline 1.5% better. Elsewhere though the fallout from the US tech slump continues. Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax remains down 0.7%, while France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac is 0.9% lower. Meanwhile US futures are suggesting a rebound of sorts on Wall Street, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average forecast to open around 67 points higher. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our story on the possible takeover of Shire by Japan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Takeda: Shares in the UK-listed drugmaker Shire surged after Japan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest pharmaceutical company, Takeda Pharmaceutical, said it was considering making a takeover approach. Shire\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shares jumped as much as 33% to \u00c2\u00a338.79 on the news, and later traded 17% higher at \u00c2\u00a336, valuing the company at \u00c2\u00a332.8bn. Takeda\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s market value is about \u00c2\u00a329bn, around the same as Shire\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s at last night\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s closing price. Shire is best known for its ADHD drug Adderall but its focus in recent years has been on rare diseases. The company is based in Dublin for tax purposes but run from Boston. Most of its operations are in the US. The news comes three-and-a-half years after US firm AbbVie abandoned its agreed $54bn (\u00c2\u00a334bn) takeover of Shire, after a US clampdown on so-called tax inversions by US companies buying an overseas business to secure a lower tax rate. Shire then turned acquiror and completed its $32bn purchase of US firm Baxalta last June. In November it reported a drop in sales of haemophilia drugs, which became its biggest source of revenue following the deal. The full report is here: Here is the full statement from Takeda, which includes more detail of the Japanese company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s thinking: Takeda believes that a potential transaction with Shire presents an opportunity to advance Takeda\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stated Vision 2025, build on its current strong momentum, and create a truly global, value-based Japanese biopharmaceutical leader. In particular, a transaction with Shire would: \u00c2\u00b7 strengthen Takeda\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s core therapeutic areas of oncology, GI and neuroscience \u00c2\u00b7 accelerate Takeda\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s vision to be a leader in specialized medicines that are transformative to patients through the addition of Shire\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s leading global rare disease franchise \u00c2\u00b7 further enhance Takeda\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s robust R&amp;D strategy, concentrating on key therapeutic areas \u00c2\u00b7 reinforce a strong and large-molecule focused late-stage pipeline within Takeda\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s core therapeutic areas to complement Takeda\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s own pipeline and discovery capabilities \u00c2\u00b7 balance Takeda\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s geographic focus to align with the market opportunity in the U.S. \u00c2\u00b7 drive financial value from a strong combined financial profile Clearly defined strategic and financial objectives are core to Takeda\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s disciplined approach to acquisitions, including in relation to its dividend policy and credit rating, which are well-established. Any potential offer for Shire, if made, would have to align with this strict investment criteria. Back to Shire: More from the CBI\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s high street survey: More bad news for the high street, with a new survey showing a slump in sales this month. Reuters reports: British retail sales fell for the first time in five months in March as heavy snowfall combined with the financial strains on many households, a survey by the Confederation of British Industry showed on Wednesday. The CBI distributive trades survey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s retail sales balance fell to -8 from +8 in February, confounding a median forecast of +15 in a Reuters poll of economists. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Against a backdrop of stagnating household incomes and weak consumer confidence, the lengthy cold snap earlier this month has heaped added pressure on retailers,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Ben Jones, a CBI economist, said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Freezing conditions and transport disruption caused people to avoid the high street. With many forced to work from home, telecoms firms saw record internet traffic, yet on-line shopping slowed sharply given the potential for disrupted deliveries.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd A measure of sales for the time of year was the weakest since April 2013, the survey showed. Retailers expected sales volumes and orders to grow in April but only at a subdued pace. Elsewhere, the latest report from the Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s network of regional agents has just come out with some good news to cheer British workers. Used to detect early warning signs for the economy, the quarterly report compiles the views of businesses recorded by the Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 12 regional outposts. In their latest assessment, the agents say companies are handing out pay rises worth between 2.5% and 3.5% - which would be inflation-busting for staff at the top end of that range. Firms are also telling the agents inflation is beginning to fade. Elsewhere in the report for the first three months of the year, there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s an interesting look at how company chief executives are preparing for Brexit. Apparently, two fifths from more than 3,000 firms surveyed are not spending any time at all each week on Brexit. They had better hope the government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s transitional arrangements, agreed in principal earlier this month, will help smooth the process as advertised. Meanwhile, there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a contrarian view over the collapse of Carillion. Far from being the disaster for the wider construction industry forecast by experts, firms tell the agents it hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t had much of an impact at all. There has been \u00e2\u20ac\u0153little evidence of a significant impact on the supply chain or on the availability of credit to the sector\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd so far, the agents report. Shire shares - which climbed as high as \u00c2\u00a338.79 on news of the possible approach by Takeda - have come off their best levels. The rather conditional nature of the Japanese statement means Shire is now at \u00c2\u00a335.45, still 15% better on the day. Takeda says it is at a preliminary and exploratory stage in considering a bid, and no approach has been made to the Shire board. Meanwhile Takeda - Japan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest pharmaceutical company - is worth some \u00c2\u00a329bn. This is less than Shire\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s value after today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s jump, but around the same as the UK-listed company was worth at last night\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s closing price. Shire is worth \u00c2\u00a335bn after its shares jumped to \u00c2\u00a338 on the news of Takeda\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s possible approach. Breaking news: Pharmaceutical group Shire has soared 25% after Japan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Takeda says it is considering making a takeover approach to the company. Takeda has until 5pm on 25 April to decide whether to make a firm bid or walk away. The Easter break couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have come at a worse time for stock markets, says David Morrison, senior market strategist at GKFX: Investors were already on edge having been shocked by February\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s equity sell-off triggered by the dual spike in volatility and bond yields. Despite a strong rebound, the major stock indices remain fragile with many in danger of breaking back below some major technical levels \u00e2\u20ac\u201c in particular, the lower level of the S&amp;P\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bullish trendline advance since February 2016. This has been brought sharply into focus with the sell-off in tech stocks, which have lead the market rally for so long, catalysed by the scandal surrounding Facebook\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s cavalier attitude to its users\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 data. Now we have a long holiday weekend which coincides with the close of the first quarter. Once again, bonds are in focus \u00e2\u20ac\u201c particularly the US 10-year Treasury. But this time yields have slumped with the 10-year crashing back below the key 2.80% level which has held as support for the past six weeks. Investors are piling back into the perceived \u00e2\u20ac\u0153safe haven\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd of fixed income as stock markets slide... And this comes against a backdrop of tighter monetary policy from the Federal Reserve, concerns over the outbreak of trade wars and worries about changes in key White House personnel leading to a more hawkish foreign policy. All-in-all, investors will see plenty of reasons to reduce equity exposure as we head into the weekend. Markets could be in for a run of volatility similar to the summer of 2015, says Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at IG: Markets remain under pressure as the sell-off in tech spreads once more to the wider equities space. The bounce on Tuesday looks like a flash in the pan, with more and more investors heading to the exit. It is looking increasingly likely that we have a re-run of August 2015 on our hands; equities then had months of volatility to contend with before the rally resumed. With trade wars and the tech scandal weighing on sentiment we may well have more downside to content with... The rout in global growth stocks has been seen in the falls in mining and bank names in London. Particularly hard hit among the banks are the Asia-focussed giants HSBC and Standard Chartered, while miners have seen further outflows as investors downgrade their optimistic views on global economic expansion. Oil prices are on the slide after a surprise rise in US stockpiles. Brent crude is currently down 0.6% at $69.68 a barrel while West Texas Intermediate - the US benchmark - is 1% lower at $64.6. The American Petroleum Institute said late on Tuesday that US weekly crude stocks had risen unexpectedly by 5.3m barrels to 430.6m barrels. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s an interesting chart on market bubbles: The eurozone is seeing steady economic growth, thanks to a revival in world trade, according to S&amp;P Global Ratings. In a new report, the agency says: Global momentum has lifted the eurozone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economic prospects, and it now appears to have reached cruising altitude. The economic and monetary union closed 2017 on a high note, with GDP growth at 2.5%, its fastest pace in a decade. ...S&amp;P Global Ratings\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 economists say the chief reason for this is the revival of world trade, which has put the eurozone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s industries back in motion. Capacity utilization was just short of its 2007 high, triggering stronger investment and boosting industry prospects for this year. However, the general fall in sentiment surveys at the start of 2018 indicates that eurozone growth is leveling off. Firms are increasingly reporting that supply constraints, rather than demand, are a drag on output. Nonetheless, for now, we expect the growth momentum will stay solid, thanks to the broad-based economic expansion and strong domestic fundamentals. It added: Strong fundamentals in the eurozone suggest that economic expansion will continue at a brisk pace, and we have raised our GDP growth forecasts for the region to 2.3% this year and 1.9% in 2019. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve also raised our euro-dollar exchange rate forecast to $1.27 in 2018 and $1.3 in 2019, since we expect the dollar\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s weakness will persist. The current growth cycle appears to have peaked, but the remaining slack in the labor market and productivity rebound will keep inflationary pressures in check until the end of 2019. Because inflation will likely remain subdued this year, we expect the ECB will only gradually wind down its asset purchase program from September until the end of this year. As the gap between structural and real unemployment diminishes, earnings growth will accelerate. Thus, we think underlying inflation is set to move closer to the ECB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s target at the end of 2019, giving the ECB enough leeway to raise rates in Q3 2019. Meanwhile the pound is edging higher, up 0.16% against the dollar at $1.4177 and 0.21% better against the euro at \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.1430. Lee Hardman, currency analyst at Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi, said: The ongoing reduction in Brexit risks and more hawkish outlook for Bank of England policy are the key drivers behind the pound\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s upward momentum. The pound has derived some additional support from a report that Irish officials have been told to expect new plans \u00e2\u20ac\u0153imminently\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd on how Britain plans to avoid a hard border with Northern Ireland. While short on details, the report has further boosted confidence that the UK and EU can find a workable and timely solution to the Irish border issue to support plans for a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153smooth &amp; orderly Brexit\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Nevertheless, it still remains a potential banana skin for the pound in the coming months if intensified Brexit talks do not progress as well as hoped. Among the day\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s company news, furniture group DFS has bucked the gloom in the high street with an upbeat outlook. It reported a 7.4% fall in underlying half year profits to \u00c2\u00a330m, in line with expectations, and chief executive Ian Filby said: We have seen a strengthening trading performance across the first half of the financial year and through February into March. We therefore remain confident that, despite the current challenging market conditions, the group will deliver modest growth in [earnings] and generate strong cashflow across this financial year, in line with our expectations. Analysts at Stifel issued a buy note, saying: Management is striking a confident tone today (despite a challenging market), as the group heads into an easier comparison phase....The shares were pricing in bad news, so we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d expect to see a decent relief rally today. Indeed the shares are up nearly 6% in early trading. Stifel added We still believe in the long-term attractions of DFS Furniture. It is a highly cash generative market leader, which is consolidating the physical market at the same time as some online pure players re-evaluate their business models. More on the tech fallout, which saw the US FANG stocks have their worst day for more than two years. Naeem Aslam, chief market analyst at Think Markets, said: The tech sector is predominantly getting battered, mainly due to the woes of Facebook\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s data breach. We clearly have three kind of investors when it comes to the Facebook; firstly there are some who are jumping out of the ship, pushing the stock price lower. Secondly, we have investors who are watching the show from the sideline and thinking there is more pain to come as we do not know how big the potential fine could be. This is not helping the stock price either. Finally, we have those who are not interested in Facebook anymore as they think that the regulatory burdensome on Facebook is too risky for their appetite and they do not want to get involved in this stock. We personally think, that Facebook has strong fundamentals and it has become the part of everyone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s daily life, so once we have a clear idea about the potential sum which the firm would have to pay as a result of this situation, the stock price could present a potential opportunity. As for the FANG stock including Microsoft, Twitter, it is likely that the Facebook incident would open the door for more scrutiny for other firms, and lawmakers would see how other firms are using user data. This could really open the can of worms and open a potential opportunity for short sellers. Following the falls on Wall Street and in Asia, European markets have indeed dropped back in early trading. The FTSE 100 is down 0.7%, with software group Sage slipping 1.8% and mining shares also among the leading fallers. France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac and Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ibex have fallen 0.9% while Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB is 0.88% lower. In Germany, the Dax has dropped 0.77%. In the wake of the decline of the US technology stocks, Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tech index is down 1.1%. Here are IG\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s opening calls for European markets: Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. An early rally on Wall Street went south by the close of play yesterday, and the turnaround is likely to weigh on European markets at today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s open. Relief that the US and China appeared to be talking about averting a damaging trade war between the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s two biggest economies had given some support to markets. But a tech turnaround saw the Dow Jones Industrial Average drop 1.4% while the Nasdaq Composite dropped 2.93% and the S&amp;P 500 fell 1.73%. The so-called FANG technology stocks - Facebook, Amazon, Netflix, and Google (now Alphabet) were under pressure on fears of growing regulation in the wake of the Cambridge Analytica revelations. Tesla was also a big faller, down more than 8% on news of a Federal investigation into a fatal crash in California. The drop in the US filtered through to Asia, with the NIkkei 225 down 1.4% and the Hang Seng 1.57% lower. In Europe the FTSE 100 is forecast to open down around 50 points, back below 7000, while Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax could drop 120 points after European markets ended higher on Tuesday. Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets, said: For all the gains seen in US markets over the past 18 months the bulk of these have been driven by tech stocks, and yesterday these tech stocks swooned quite sharply, reversing a good proportion of Monday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s gains, in the process dragging the S&amp;P500 back down towards its 200 day moving average. This rolling over in tech stocks looks set to weigh on European markets this morning, with a lower open as markets mull over the potential for uncertainty over a tech sector that could catch a cold as a result of Facebook\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s woes around user data. With the increasing focus on what is going with respect to how Facebook has managed its users personal data, it must surely be only a matter of time before attention turns to the rest of the tech sector, and how companies like Alphabet, Twitter, Microsoft and Apple to name a few, manage their own users personal data. If lawmakers do turn their attention to the rest of the sector, which seems likely, then it is hard not to see how other tech companies will escape scrutiny on how they use this user data, raising the prospect that we could uncover other practices that invite scrutiny. In the run-up to the Easter break there is a smattering of economic news in the form of the CBI\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s monthly snapshot of the retail sector and the latest US GDP figures. The US economy is expected to have grown by 2.7% in the fourth quarter on an annualised basis, up from 2.5%. Jasper Lawler at London Capital Group said: The economic backdrop was supportive in the last quarter of 2017. Robust jobs growth and healthy consumer spending comfortably propped up the economy, which is expected to be reflected in an upwards revision for economic growth to 2.7% on an annualised basis from 2.5% in the previous estimate. The reading will not yet include the benefits from the tax cuts, nor the more recent uncertainties over global trade. However, given how quiet the economic calendar is, the reading is expected to attract attention anyway. A surprise to the upside, could boost the possibility of a June rate hike up from the CME FedWatch odds of 78%, lifting the dollar back towards 90.00. On the contrary, should growth remain around 2.5%, we could see buying demand for the dollar decline and the greenback look to test 89.00 once more.

The FTSE 100 is up 0.3% or 19 points at 7,064. There was some bad news from the UK retail sector, as the owner of Bargain Booze and Wine Rack - Conviviality - said it would appoint administrators within a fortnight after failing to secure emergency funds. UK house prices fell for a second month in March according to Nationwide, by 0.2%, as cash-strapped consumers proved unwilling to make major spending commitments. London continues to lag the rest of the country. The ONS confirmed the UK economy grew by 0.4% in the fourth quarter of 2017, and revised up annual growth in 2017 to 1.8% from an earlier estimate of 1.7%. A breakdown of the GDP report showed that household spending growth of 1.7% in 2017 was the weakest in six years, as falling real pay took its toll on family finances. In the US, initial jobless claims dropped to a 45-year low of 215,000 last week, in a further show of strength for America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s labor market. The US Department of Justice announced that Barclays has agreed to pay $2bn to settle claims that it fraudulently sold residential mortgage-backed securities in the run-up to the financial crisis. On that note, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time to close for the day. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be back on Tuesday. US markets after the opening bell: Dow Jones: +0.5% at 23,974 S&amp;P 500: +0.5% at 2,617 Nasdaq: +0.5% at 23,974 Barclays has agreed to pay $2bn to settle claims that it fraudulently sold residential mortgage-backed securities in the run-up to the financial crisis. Announcing the levy, the US Department of Justice said Barclays had caused billions of dollars in losses to investors by engaging in a fraudulent scheme to sell 36 residential mortgage-backed securities (RMBS) deals between 2005 and 2007, misleading investors about the quality of the mortgage loans backing those deals. Richard Donoghue, United States Attorney for the Eastern District of New York, said: This settlement reflects the ongoing commitment of the Department of Justice, and this Office, to hold banks and other entities and individuals accountable for their fraudulent conduct. The substantial penalty Barclays and its executives have agreed to pay is an important step in recognizing the harm that was caused to the national economy and to investors in RMBS. As well as the fine imposed on the bank, two former Barclays executives have agreed to pay a combined sum of $2m in exchange for a dismissal of claims brought against them individually. The number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits fell to the lowest level in 45 years last week. Initial claims fell 12,000 to 215,000 in the week ending 24 March, the lowest since January 1973, the US Labor Department said. It followed 227,000 claims a week earlier, and was well below the 230,000 claims forecast by economists. Claims have now been below the 300,000 threshold - considered a measure of a strong labour market - for 158 consecutive weeks. That is the longest run of growth since 1970. John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, says he is concerned by this morning\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ONS figures, which showed the savings ratio hit a record low of 4.9% in 2017. He says: These are deeply worrying figures. The fact that for the first time in 30 years households are now net borrowers, taking on more debt and seeing their incomes squeezed by inflation, while the savings ratio is at its lowest level since records began, should be setting off alarm bells in the Treasury. The chancellor stubbornly refused to use the spring statement to help working families, but he must now reconsider his policy of inaction as households are clearly reeling from the effects of eight years of Tory economic failure \u00e2\u20ac\u201c with real wages still lower than when the Conservatives first came to power in 2010. The next Labour government will end austerity, introduce a \u00c2\u00a310 per hour real living wage and cap interest on credit cards, to build a high wage, high skill economy of the future. President Trump has made very clear his feelings about Amazon in his first tweet of the day: Time for a European market update: FTSE 100: +0.2% at 7,061 Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s DAX: +0.8% at 12,037 France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s CAC: +0.6% at 5,161 Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB: +0.2% at 22,386 Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s IBEX: +0.7% at 9,620 Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s STOXX 600: +0.4% at 371 US stock index futures are up with tech shares posting slim gains after being hammered earlier in the week. Shares in the so-called FANG group - Facebook, Amazon, Netflix, and Google (now Alphabet) - were up between 0.6% and 1.6% in pre-market trading. This morning\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s GDP report from the ONS showed that household spending grew by 1.7% in 2017 - the weakest since 2011. It reflects the tough backdrop faced by consumers since the Brexit vote in 2016, which drove a sharp fall in the value of the pound and pushed up the price of goods imported from abroad. As those price rises fed through to higher inflation, wage growth failed to keep pace, signalling falling real pay for workers. Households have responded to tighter budgets by spending less on non-essential items and becoming reluctant to commit to major spending decisions. Victoria Clarke, economist at Investec, explains: The detail today laid bare the squeeze on the household cash position sitting behind this subdued spending backdrop. Real household disposable income rose by just 0.1% over the quarter, a softening from the already subdued 0.3% increase in Q3. Wages and salaries were a positive influence to incomes growth but their influence was almost completely offset by the impact of rising inflation. Following a run of soft outturns, real household incomes grew by just 0.3% in 2017 as a whole. However, Paul Hollingsworth at Capital Economics say there is light at the end of the tunnel for UK consumers as inflation has already started to fall. With a sustained rises in real wages on the horizon, the outlook for spending growth remains bright. This supports our view that the economy will grow by around 2% this year, above the consensus estimate of 1.5%. Shares in Renault rose more than 5% after Bloomberg reported the French car maker is in talks to merge with Japanese car giant Nissan. Bloomberg says: Renault SA and Nissan Motor Co. are in talks to merge, seeking to solidify their two-decade-old alliance under a single stock as an unprecedented shift toward electric and shared cars transforms the industry, people with knowledge of the matter said. A deal would end the current alliance between the companies and marry them as one corporation, said the people, who asked not to be identified as the details aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t public. Renault currently owns 43 percent of Nissan while the Japanese carmaker has a 15 percent stake in its French counterpart. Carlos Ghosn, the chairman of both companies, is driving the negotiations and would run the combined entity, the people said. A merged giant would be a more formidable rival for Volkswagen AG and Toyota Motor Corp., allowing the partners to better pool resources as the industry shifts toward new-energy vehicles, autonomous driving and car-sharing services. While the alliance of Renault and Nissan has brought savings, the fragmented ownership structure has prevented the companies from reaping full benefits from their union. How the pound has fared against the dollar since the EU referendum: The pound is on course for its best quarterly performance against the dollar since 2015, despite dipping this morning. After taking a hammering in the aftermath of the Brexit vote in June 2016, the pound is currently up 4% against the dollar over the first quarter as it draws to a close. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the biggest quarterly rise since mid 2015. Against the euro, the pound has risen 1.4% since January, which would be the best performance since 2016. Growing expectations that the Bank of England will raise interest rates faster than expected over the coming months has boosted the pound. Developments in Brexit negotiations that have been interpreted as broadly positive have also helped the UK currency. Current trading: The pound is roughly flat against the dollar at $1.4066 It is down 0.1% against the euro at \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.1420 CME agrees \u00c2\u00a33.9bn deal for Michael Spencer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Nex Group The world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest futures exchange, CME Group, has agreed to buy Michael Spencer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Nex Group in a \u00c2\u00a33.9bn deal that will net the former Tory party treasurer \u00c2\u00a3670m. CME also picked London as its European headquarters, giving a much-needed boost to the UK government during its Brexit negotiations. The move comes after CME\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision last year to shut its loss-making London bourse and clearing house. Spencer, chief executive of Nex, owns a 17.6% stake in the financial broker he founded in 1986. It changed its name from Icap at the end of 2016 and is one of the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest money-broking firms. Spencer will join the CME board as a special advisor and will stay on for a minimum of two years to oversee the integration of the two businesses. The takeover, which still has to be approved by Nex shareholders, will lead to 750 job losses over the next three years in the combined business, or 16% of the total workforce. It is not clear where they will occur. Nex has 1,900 employees globally, including 634 in London and 42 in Bristol. CME employs 2,800 people worldwide, 400 of them in London. Last year Nex agreed to pay back donations of \u00c2\u00a325,000 made to Conservative general election candidates following a shareholder revolt. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s services sector continued to be the main driver of growth in the fourth quarter of 2017, despite being revised down. It accounts for about three quarters of the UK economy. Output in the sector increased by 0.4%, lower than the 0.6% growth estimated previously. Transport, storage and communications services grew by 1.1%, while output at hotels and restaurants fell 0.1%. Here are how some of the other major parts of the economy performed between October and December: Industrial production grew by 0.4% Manufacturing output rose 1.3% Construction output fell 0.1% Agriculture contracted by 1% Household spending grew by 0.3% Government spending increased by 0.4% The trade deficit widened to \u00c2\u00a39.34bn from \u00c2\u00a37.6bn in Q3 Business investment increased by 0.3% The ONS has revised its estimate for annual growth in 2017 back up to 1.8%. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s in line with its first estimate, before the ONS revised it down to 1.7% in its first revision. It is still the weakest growth in five years. Consumer spending grew, but at a weaker rate than previous years as the fall in real wages took its toll: The UK economy grew by 0.4% in the final three months of 2017, the Office for National Statistics confirmed in its latest estimate of GDP. It was unchanged from previous estimates. Rob Kent-Smith, a statistician at the ONS, gives a handy overview: Economic growth at the end of last year was unrevised with services and manufacturing continuing to drive growth. Household borrowing increased throughout 2017, while their saving was the lowest on record. However, the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s deficit with the rest of the world shrank, as the UK received increased earnings on foreign investments thanks to a growing world economy. The service sector picked up in the three months to January with architecture, leasing companies and health work all boosting growth. Brian Murphy, head of lending for the Mortgage Advice Bureau, has commented on the 0.2% fall in UK house prices reported by Nationwide: Given that some areas of the country, such as Northern Ireland and Wales, are seeing more significant increases in prices, while London is still seeing prices cool, suggests that the [headline figure] masks a broad degree of variance across the regions, which rather underscores the effect that dipping London and South East values are having on the wider average. That there is still such a marked North-South divide in average house properties values is, of course, no surprise. However, market conditions in London and thew South East market would appear to be somewhat lacklustre when compared to other areas, proving that consumer confidence is still very strong outside the capital and its commuter belt, as underscored by the ongoing paucity of stock in these areas. Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s unemployment rate fell to 5.3% in March from 5.4% in February. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the lowest rate since German reunification in 1990. The total number of unemployed people fell more than expected by 19,000 to 2.37 million. The positive backdrop for employment is likely to further boost consumer confidence in Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest economy. Nationwide has published its latest monthly house price index which shows the average price fell 0.2% in March, to \u00c2\u00a3211,625. It followed a 0.4% fall in March, and took the annual rate of house price growth to 2.1%. The last time the annual rate was weaker was June 2013. Here is how the picture looks regionally, where London is lagging behind the rest of the country: Robert Gardner, Nationwide\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chief economist, gives his view of the market: On the surface, the relatively subdued pace of house price growth appears at odds with recent healthy rates of employment growth, a modest pick-up in wage growth and historically low borrowing costs. However, consumer confidence has remained subdued, due to the ongoing squeeze on household finances as wage growth continues to lag behind increases in the cost of living. Looking ahead, much will depend on how broader economic conditions evolve, especially in the labour market, but also with respect to interest rates. Subdued economic activity and the ongoing squeeze on household budgets is likely to continue to exert a modest drag on housing market activity and house price growth this year. Nationwide is predicting house price growth of just 1% in 2018 overall. Here is our full story on Conviviality, which this morning said it would file for administration within a fortnight: The number of cars rolling off UK production lines fell again in February after a 17% drop in demand from the home market. A total of 145,475 cars were made in British factories last month, down 4.4% on a year earlier. Cars built for export, which account for about 80% of UK production, dipped 0.8%. Mike Hawes, chief executive, of the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders which produces the figures, said the figures were concerning: Another month of double digit decline in production for the UK is of considerable concern, but we hope that the degree of certainty provided by last week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Brexit transition agreement will help stimulate business and consumer confidence over the coming months. These figures also highlight the scale of our sector\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s dependency on exports, so a final deal that keeps our frictionless trade links with our biggest market, the EU, after December 2020 is now a pressing priority. Conviviality, the firm behind Bargain Booze and Wine Rack has announced this morning that it will appoint administrators within a fortnight, putting 2,600 jobs at risk. The British Beer &amp; Pub Association has warned some pubs could face shortage of some drinks in the short-term, because the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Matthew Clark and Bibendum subsidiaries are major suppliers. After failing to secure emergency funding from investors, Conviviality a brief statement: Following discussions with its lending banks, the board has resolved to file notice of intention to appoint administrators to the Company. Unless circumstances change, and in accordance with statutory requirements, the board intend to appoint administrators within 10 business days. The secured creditors can, however, appoint administrators without the requirement for notice. The directors intend to allow the business to continue to trade and the company continues to work alongside advisers in order to preserve as much value as possible for all stakeholders as it explores a number of inbound enquiries regarding a potential sale of all or parts of the business. Further announcements will be made as appropriate. Here is the background: And we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re off. Here are the opening scores across Europe: FTSE 100: +0.1% Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s DAX: +0.1% France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s CAC: +0.3% Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB: +0.2% Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s IBEX: +0.4% Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s STOXX 600: +0.1% Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. The one-year countdown to Brexit has begun. Concerns that the UK economy would suffer an immediate slump following the vote to leave the EU proved unfounded, and GDP has continued to grow, albeit at a modest pace. However, Britain is now lagging behind peers in the G7 and major eurozone economies, as the uncertainty surrounding Brexit and strained household finances weigh on activity. Figures to be published by the Office for National Statistics at 9.30am are expected to show the UK economy grew by 0.4% in the fourth quarter of 2017, unchanged from earlier estimates and following growth of 0.5% in the third quarter. Also coming up today: 9.30am BST: February mortgage approvals and consumer credit data from the Bank of England 1pm-5pm BST: After weeks of bitter wrangling, we will learn the fate of GKN at some point this afternoon. Will the UK engineering giant win its fight to retain independence, or will shareholders vote in favour of Melrose\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00c2\u00a38bn hostile takeover? 1.30pm BST: US weekly job losses will give the latest snapshot of the labour market in the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest economy",
