                "body":"<p>The unwinding of Rupert Murdoch\u2019s media empire, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2017/dec/14/rupert-murdochs-60bn-disney-deal-reshapes-his-media-empire\">via the sale to Bob Iger\u2019s Disney of his stake in Sky and his prime entertainment assets in 21st Century Fox</a>, was never likely to be a trouble-free affair for the media tycoon. And so it proved last week when Comcast, the US cable giant led by Brian Roberts that owns the NBC broadcasting network, launched a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2018/feb/27/comcast-murdoch-bid-sky-21st-century-fox\">\u00a322bn takeover bid</a> for Sky, seemingly out of nowhere.</p> <p>The $66bn Disney deal is complicated as it is, because wrapped within it is Murdoch\u2019s ongoing attempt to buy the 61% of Sky that he doesn\u2019t already own. If the regulators approve both transactions, the 86-year-old will get to hand over 100% of Sky to Disney as an extra gift. But if Comcast gets its way and snaps up a majority stake from Sky\u2019s independent shareholders, the plan could unravel. Here are the answers to questions posed by the deal.</p> <h2>Why is Sky so attractive?<br></h2> <p>For all the competitive threats posed by Netflix, Amazon and Apple, Sky is Europe\u2019s largest pay-TV operator: with 22 million customers, it\u2019s a money-making machine, producing almost \u00a32bn in annual profits. As the UK market reached saturation, Sky\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/jul/25/bskyb-buy-sky-italia-deutschland-fox\">move in 2014 to buy its sister companies in Germany, Austria and Italy</a> has given it that most attractive of draw cards: scope for significant growth. Sky has also been successful in launching on-demand services, such as Now TV, that go beyond the constraints of the satellite dish and meet the challenges of the Netflix era. Since changing the face of British pay-TV by acquiring the rights to Premier League football almost three decades ago, Sky has also become a major entertainment player, spending more than \u00a32bn annually on dramas such as <em>Riviera</em> and <em>Fortitude,</em> doing licensing deals for shows including <em>Game of Thrones</em> and <em>Billions</em>, and buying production companies, among them the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2014/jul/21/bskyb-purchase-great-british-bake-off-love-productions\">maker of <em>The</em> <em>Great British Bake Off</em></a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"93a367527731b27450fe26a7b45ed3ee2747fda1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/93a367527731b27450fe26a7b45ed3ee2747fda1/0_166_3155_1893/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Game of Thrones Emilia Clarke as Daenerys Targaryen and Kit Harington as Jon Snow\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sky\u2019s licensing deal for Game of Thrones proved lucrative.</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cSky has persuaded households across Europe not just to pay significant money to watch TV, but also to buy broadband, telephony and more recently mobile,\u201d says Alex DeGroote of stockbroker Cenkos. \u201cIt is a one-off opportunity to buy a clear strategic asset in the European media landscape. It will go for a big price.\u201d</p> <h2>Why are media giants Comcast and Disney so keen?<br></h2> <p>US media groups are seeing growth slow dramatically in their home market and searching abroad for a more dynamic bottom line. For Comcast, a Sky deal would make it the world\u2019s largest pay-TV operator, and increase its non-US revenues from 9% of the total to 25%.

                "bodyText":"The unwinding of Rupert Murdoch\u2019s media empire, via the sale to Bob Iger\u2019s Disney of his stake in Sky and his prime entertainment assets in 21st Century Fox, was never likely to be a trouble-free affair for the media tycoon. And so it proved last week when Comcast, the US cable giant led by Brian Roberts that owns the NBC broadcasting network, launched a \u00a322bn takeover bid for Sky, seemingly out of nowhere. The $66bn Disney deal is complicated as it is, because wrapped within it is Murdoch\u2019s ongoing attempt to buy the 61% of Sky that he doesn\u2019t already own. If the regulators approve both transactions, the 86-year-old will get to hand over 100% of Sky to Disney as an extra gift. But if Comcast gets its way and snaps up a majority stake from Sky\u2019s independent shareholders, the plan could unravel. Here are the answers to questions posed by the deal. Why is Sky so attractive? For all the competitive threats posed by Netflix, Amazon and Apple, Sky is Europe\u2019s largest pay-TV operator: with 22 million customers, it\u2019s a money-making machine, producing almost \u00a32bn in annual profits. As the UK market reached saturation, Sky\u2019s move in 2014 to buy its sister companies in Germany, Austria and Italy has given it that most attractive of draw cards: scope for significant growth. Sky has also been successful in launching on-demand services, such as Now TV, that go beyond the constraints of the satellite dish and meet the challenges of the Netflix era. Since changing the face of British pay-TV by acquiring the rights to Premier League football almost three decades ago, Sky has also become a major entertainment player, spending more than \u00a32bn annually on dramas such as Riviera and Fortitude, doing licensing deals for shows including Game of Thrones and Billions, and buying production companies, among them the maker of The Great British Bake Off. \u201cSky has persuaded households across Europe not just to pay significant money to watch TV, but also to buy broadband, telephony and more recently mobile,\u201d says Alex DeGroote of stockbroker Cenkos. \u201cIt is a one-off opportunity to buy a clear strategic asset in the European media landscape. It will go for a big price.\u201d Why are media giants Comcast and Disney so keen? US media groups are seeing growth slow dramatically in their home market and searching abroad for a more dynamic bottom line. For Comcast, a Sky deal would make it the world\u2019s largest pay-TV operator, and increase its non-US revenues from 9% of the total to 25%. Then there is the need to meet the global digital threat from deep-pocketed Silicon Valley rivals. \u201cThe arrival of Netflix and players like Amazon and Apple puts US companies like Disney, Comcast and Fox up against powerful new competitors,\u201d said Jerry Dellis of investment bank Jefferies. \u201cTo compete, these formerly US-centric businesses need more global reach. Sky provides a direct route to customers in more countries.\u201d The reason Murdoch is selling most of 21st Century Fox, and Sky with it, is because his empire hasn\u2019t been able to grow fast enough to fight the tech threat after his $80bn bid for Time Warner failed in 2014.

Peter Welford at Jefferies says the structure of any deal is uncertain:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p> We see the potential strategic rationale for the deal and have long highlighted Shire is currently trading at a substantial discount to our fundamental 4300p or so value given overhangs, notably haemophilia competitive concerns. Nevertheless Takeda\u2019s near.$42bn market cap versus Shire\u2019s $47bn or $66bn enterprise value raises questions on a potential deal structure....</p> <p>We presume Takeda would need a significant equity raise to acquire Shire, suggesting a \u201cmerger\u201d is perhaps better terminology, which may raise hurdles to the successful completion of any future deal.</p> </blockquote> <p>Jack Scannell at UBS says other bidders could emerge:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Since Takeda\u2019s market cap is close to Shire\u2019s we assume a potential offer would have to include a substantial percentage in equity and how Shire\u2019s board and shareholders would react is hard to predict. However as Shire\u2019s share price is significantly below the net present value of our cash flow estimates, Takeda could trigger discussion of other bidders.</p> <p> Shire does not strike us as an obvious take-over candidate. There is presumably a price at which the financial engineering would work. However, Shire\u2019s specialty focus and mix of therapeutic foci means that most buyers would struggle to extract substantial operational synergies while escaping from competition problems, in our view. Also Shire\u2019s low corporate tax rate could rise in most scenarios were the company acquired. It would also be a bold acquisition in our view given the uncertain trajectory of Shire\u2019s haemophilia business. A merger of equals in this context might be more feasible.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2018-03-28T12:15:53.943Z\">at 1.15pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5abb7826e4b0ea82609d1836\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-03-28T11:13:46.699Z\">12.13pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The potential offer for Shire has helped the FTSE 100 come off its worst levels after the morning\u2019s earlier declines.</p> <p>The UK\u2019s leading index is now down just 0.12% or around 8 points, with Shire up 18% and fellow drugs group GlaxoSmithKline 1.5% better.</p> <p>Elsewhere though the fallout from the US tech slump continues.

In a new report, the agency says:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Global momentum has lifted the eurozone\u2019s economic prospects, and it now appears to have reached cruising altitude. The economic and monetary union closed 2017 on a high note, with GDP growth at 2.5%, its fastest pace in a decade.</p> <p>...S&amp;P Global Ratings\u2019 economists say the chief reason for this is the revival of world trade, which has put the eurozone\u2019s industries back in motion. Capacity utilization was just short of its 2007 high, triggering stronger investment and boosting industry prospects for this year.</p> <p>However, the general fall in sentiment surveys at the start of 2018 indicates that eurozone growth is leveling off. Firms are increasingly reporting that supply constraints, rather than demand, are a drag on output. Nonetheless, for now, we expect the growth momentum will stay solid, thanks to the broad-based economic expansion and strong domestic fundamentals.</p> </blockquote> <p>It added:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p> Strong fundamentals in the eurozone suggest that economic expansion will continue at a brisk pace, and we have raised our GDP growth forecasts for the region to 2.3% this year and 1.9% in 2019.</p> <p>We\u2019ve also raised our euro-dollar exchange rate forecast to $1.27 in 2018 and $1.3 in 2019, since we expect the dollar\u2019s weakness will persist.</p> <p>The current growth cycle appears to have peaked, but the remaining slack in the labor market and productivity rebound will keep inflationary pressures in check until the end of 2019.</p> <p>Because inflation will likely remain subdued this year, we expect the ECB will only gradually wind down its asset purchase program from September until the end of this year. As the gap between structural and real unemployment diminishes, earnings growth will accelerate. Thus, we think underlying inflation is set to move closer to the ECB\u2019s target at the end of 2019, giving the ECB enough leeway to raise rates in Q3 2019.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5abb4edde4b0ea82609d1665\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-03-28T08:14:25.264Z\">9.14am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/neilwilson_etx/status/978906437593325569\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/ftse100?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#ftse100</a> under pressure, trend support being tested, touch here could signal a chance to rally? <a href=\"https://t.co/FAa65abmtJ\">pic.twitter.com/FAa65abmtJ</a></p>&mdash; Neil Wilson (@neilwilson_etx) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/neilwilson_etx/status/978906437593325569?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">March 28, 2018</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5abb4c34e4b0ee234a057697\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-03-28T08:06:39.350Z\">9.06am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Meanwhile the pound is edging higher, up 0.16% against the dollar at $1.4177 and 0.21% better against the euro at \u20ac1.1430.

Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>For all the gains seen in US markets over the past 18 months the bulk of these have been driven by tech stocks, and yesterday these tech stocks swooned quite sharply, reversing a good proportion of Monday\u2019s gains, in the process dragging the S&amp;P500 back down towards its 200 day moving average. </p> <p>This rolling over in tech stocks looks set to weigh on European markets this morning, with a lower open as markets mull over the potential for uncertainty over a tech sector that could catch a cold as a result of Facebook\u2019s woes around user data. </p> <p>With the increasing focus on what is going with respect to how Facebook has managed its users personal data, it must surely be only a matter of time before attention turns to the rest of the tech sector, and how companies like Alphabet, Twitter, Microsoft and Apple to name a few, manage their own users personal data.

The US economy is expected to have grown by 2.7% in the fourth quarter on an annualised basis, up from 2.5%. Jasper Lawler at London Capital Group said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The economic backdrop was supportive in the last quarter of 2017. Robust jobs growth and healthy consumer spending comfortably propped up the economy, which is expected to be reflected in an upwards revision for economic growth to 2.7% on an annualised basis from 2.5% in the previous estimate. The reading will not yet include the benefits from the tax cuts, nor the more recent uncertainties over global trade. However, given how quiet the economic calendar is, the reading is expected to attract attention anyway.</p> <p>A surprise to the upside, could boost the possibility of a June rate hike up from the CME FedWatch odds of 78%, lifting the dollar back towards 90.00. On the contrary, should growth remain around 2.5%, we could see buying demand for the dollar decline and the greenback look to test 89.00 once more.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>The agenda:</strong></p> <p>11.00 BST: CBI distributive trades survey</p> <p>13.30 BST: US fourth quarter GDP</p> </div>   </div>",
                "bodyText":"It was another volatile session for stock markets. After Tuesday\u2019s slump on Wall Street, driven predominantly by sharp declines in technology stocks, European markets opened mostly lower. However they came off their worst levels as the US market managed to stage a mild recovery, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average currently marginally in positive territory, up 35 points, although the tech-heavy Nasdaq is down around 1%. Amazon in particular is being hit by reports that the US president plans to go after the company and altering its tax treatment. The FTSE 100, now up around 9 points, was supported by news of a potential bid for UK listed pharmaceutical group Shire from Japan\u2019s Takeda. Shire\u2019s shares jumped, valuing the company at more than \u00a335bn at one point. Elsewhere there was more bad news for the UK high street, with retail sales falling in March for the first time since October, according to the CBI. But the US economy grew more strongly than expected in the final quarter. And there was a positive report on the eurozone economy from S&amp;P Global ratings. On that note, it\u2019s time to close for the day. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. Back with Shire, and Ketan Patel at EdenTree Investment Management says it could be a key moment if a deal goes ahead: If a bid does materialise from Takeda for drug maker Shire, it would be a watershed moment for Japanese pharma. There hasn\u2019t been a cross border transaction in the sector, excluding joint ventures and small generic M&amp;A. Takeda\u2019s cash laden balance sheet appears a good fit for Shire\u2019s struggling balance sheet, following recent large scale M&amp;A. The attraction for Takeda is the highly lucrative rare disease market in the US, which comes with exceedingly high margins and is largely exempt from the usual pricing pressure that affects the wider pharmaceutical sector. After Tuesday\u2019s tech-inspired slump, there is little respite for the sector despite US markets generally starting the day on a slightly more positive note. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is up 121 points or 0.53% in early trading, while the S&amp;P 500 has edged up 0.05%. But the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite has opened down 0.35%. The stronger than expected US GDP figure will revive talk about how many interest rate rises the Federal Reserve will sanction this year. Dennis de Jong, managing director at UFX.com, said: Robust jobs growth and healthy consumer spending have been attributed to today\u2019s stronger than expected US GDP data, as the country\u2019s economic outlook appears in rude health and the 3% growth target appears within touching distance. ...As a result of the strong economic outlook, questions may be raised around the possibility of Fed Chair Jerome Powell introducing a June rate hike. It may be a case of US growth being monitored before any rate decision is made, but markets could be volatile between now and then. The 2.9% growth in the US economy, although better than the initial estimates, shows a slowdown from the 3.2% rise recorded in the third quarter. The figures were helped by the biggest rise in consumer spending for three years, offset by a surge in imports. The Bureau of Economic Analysis said: The increase in real GDP in the fourth quarter primarily reflected positive contributions from personal consumption expenditures, nonresidential fixed investment, exports, residential fixed investment, state and local government spending, and federal government spending that were partly offset by a negative contribution from private inventory investment. Imports, which are a subtraction in the calculation of GDP, increased. Breaking news: Something for Donald Trump to tweet about. The US economy grew more strongly than expected in the final quarter, up 2.9% on an annualised basis compared to expectations of a 2.7% increase and an initial estimate of 2.5% growth. Here\u2019s some analyst reaction to the possible Shire deal. Peter Welford at Jefferies says the structure of any deal is uncertain: We see the potential strategic rationale for the deal and have long highlighted Shire is currently trading at a substantial discount to our fundamental 4300p or so value given overhangs, notably haemophilia competitive concerns. Nevertheless Takeda\u2019s near.$42bn market cap versus Shire\u2019s $47bn or $66bn enterprise value raises questions on a potential deal structure.... We presume Takeda would need a significant equity raise to acquire Shire, suggesting a \u201cmerger\u201d is perhaps better terminology, which may raise hurdles to the successful completion of any future deal. Jack Scannell at UBS says other bidders could emerge: Since Takeda\u2019s market cap is close to Shire\u2019s we assume a potential offer would have to include a substantial percentage in equity and how Shire\u2019s board and shareholders would react is hard to predict. However as Shire\u2019s share price is significantly below the net present value of our cash flow estimates, Takeda could trigger discussion of other bidders. Shire does not strike us as an obvious take-over candidate. There is presumably a price at which the financial engineering would work. However, Shire\u2019s specialty focus and mix of therapeutic foci means that most buyers would struggle to extract substantial operational synergies while escaping from competition problems, in our view. Also Shire\u2019s low corporate tax rate could rise in most scenarios were the company acquired. It would also be a bold acquisition in our view given the uncertain trajectory of Shire\u2019s haemophilia business. A merger of equals in this context might be more feasible. The potential offer for Shire has helped the FTSE 100 come off its worst levels after the morning\u2019s earlier declines. The UK\u2019s leading index is now down just 0.12% or around 8 points, with Shire up 18% and fellow drugs group GlaxoSmithKline 1.5% better. Elsewhere though the fallout from the US tech slump continues. Germany\u2019s Dax remains down 0.7%, while France\u2019s Cac is 0.9% lower. Meanwhile US futures are suggesting a rebound of sorts on Wall Street, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average forecast to open around 67 points higher. Here\u2019s our story on the possible takeover of Shire by Japan\u2019s Takeda: Shares in the UK-listed drugmaker Shire surged after Japan\u2019s biggest pharmaceutical company, Takeda Pharmaceutical, said it was considering making a takeover approach. Shire\u2019s shares jumped as much as 33% to \u00a338.79 on the news, and later traded 17% higher at \u00a336, valuing the company at \u00a332.8bn. Takeda\u2019s market value is about \u00a329bn, around the same as Shire\u2019s at last night\u2019s closing price. Shire is best known for its ADHD drug Adderall but its focus in recent years has been on rare diseases. The company is based in Dublin for tax purposes but run from Boston. Most of its operations are in the US. The news comes three-and-a-half years after US firm AbbVie abandoned its agreed $54bn (\u00a334bn) takeover of Shire, after a US clampdown on so-called tax inversions by US companies buying an overseas business to secure a lower tax rate. Shire then turned acquiror and completed its $32bn purchase of US firm Baxalta last June. In November it reported a drop in sales of haemophilia drugs, which became its biggest source of revenue following the deal. The full report is here: Here is the full statement from Takeda, which includes more detail of the Japanese company\u2019s thinking: Takeda believes that a potential transaction with Shire presents an opportunity to advance Takeda\u2019s stated Vision 2025, build on its current strong momentum, and create a truly global, value-based Japanese biopharmaceutical leader. In particular, a transaction with Shire would: \u00b7 strengthen Takeda\u2019s core therapeutic areas of oncology, GI and neuroscience \u00b7 accelerate Takeda\u2019s vision to be a leader in specialized medicines that are transformative to patients through the addition of Shire\u2019s leading global rare disease franchise \u00b7 further enhance Takeda\u2019s robust R&amp;D strategy, concentrating on key therapeutic areas \u00b7 reinforce a strong and large-molecule focused late-stage pipeline within Takeda\u2019s core therapeutic areas to complement Takeda\u2019s own pipeline and discovery capabilities \u00b7 balance Takeda\u2019s geographic focus to align with the market opportunity in the U.S. \u00b7 drive financial value from a strong combined financial profile Clearly defined strategic and financial objectives are core to Takeda\u2019s disciplined approach to acquisitions, including in relation to its dividend policy and credit rating, which are well-established. Any potential offer for Shire, if made, would have to align with this strict investment criteria. Back to Shire: More from the CBI\u2019s high street survey: More bad news for the high street, with a new survey showing a slump in sales this month. Reuters reports: British retail sales fell for the first time in five months in March as heavy snowfall combined with the financial strains on many households, a survey by the Confederation of British Industry showed on Wednesday. The CBI distributive trades survey\u2019s retail sales balance fell to -8 from +8 in February, confounding a median forecast of +15 in a Reuters poll of economists. \u201cAgainst a backdrop of stagnating household incomes and weak consumer confidence, the lengthy cold snap earlier this month has heaped added pressure on retailers,\u201d Ben Jones, a CBI economist, said. \u201cFreezing conditions and transport disruption caused people to avoid the high street. With many forced to work from home, telecoms firms saw record internet traffic, yet on-line shopping slowed sharply given the potential for disrupted deliveries.\u201d A measure of sales for the time of year was the weakest since April 2013, the survey showed. Retailers expected sales volumes and orders to grow in April but only at a subdued pace. Elsewhere, the latest report from the Bank of England\u2019s network of regional agents has just come out with some good news to cheer British workers. Used to detect early warning signs for the economy, the quarterly report compiles the views of businesses recorded by the Bank\u2019s 12 regional outposts. In their latest assessment, the agents say companies are handing out pay rises worth between 2.5% and 3.5% - which would be inflation-busting for staff at the top end of that range. Firms are also telling the agents inflation is beginning to fade. Elsewhere in the report for the first three months of the year, there\u2019s an interesting look at how company chief executives are preparing for Brexit. Apparently, two fifths from more than 3,000 firms surveyed are not spending any time at all each week on Brexit. They had better hope the government\u2019s transitional arrangements, agreed in principal earlier this month, will help smooth the process as advertised. Meanwhile, there\u2019s a contrarian view over the collapse of Carillion. Far from being the disaster for the wider construction industry forecast by experts, firms tell the agents it hasn\u2019t had much of an impact at all. There has been \u201clittle evidence of a significant impact on the supply chain or on the availability of credit to the sector\u201d so far, the agents report. Shire shares - which climbed as high as \u00a338.79 on news of the possible approach by Takeda - have come off their best levels. The rather conditional nature of the Japanese statement means Shire is now at \u00a335.45, still 15% better on the day. Takeda says it is at a preliminary and exploratory stage in considering a bid, and no approach has been made to the Shire board. Meanwhile Takeda - Japan\u2019s biggest pharmaceutical company - is worth some \u00a329bn. This is less than Shire\u2019s value after today\u2019s jump, but around the same as the UK-listed company was worth at last night\u2019s closing price. Shire is worth \u00a335bn after its shares jumped to \u00a338 on the news of Takeda\u2019s possible approach. Breaking news: Pharmaceutical group Shire has soared 25% after Japan\u2019s Takeda says it is considering making a takeover approach to the company. Takeda has until 5pm on 25 April to decide whether to make a firm bid or walk away. The Easter break couldn\u2019t have come at a worse time for stock markets, says David Morrison, senior market strategist at GKFX: Investors were already on edge having been shocked by February\u2019s equity sell-off triggered by the dual spike in volatility and bond yields. Despite a strong rebound, the major stock indices remain fragile with many in danger of breaking back below some major technical levels \u2013 in particular, the lower level of the S&amp;P\u2019s bullish trendline advance since February 2016. This has been brought sharply into focus with the sell-off in tech stocks, which have lead the market rally for so long, catalysed by the scandal surrounding Facebook\u2019s cavalier attitude to its users\u2019 data. Now we have a long holiday weekend which coincides with the close of the first quarter. Once again, bonds are in focus \u2013 particularly the US 10-year Treasury. But this time yields have slumped with the 10-year crashing back below the key 2.80% level which has held as support for the past six weeks. Investors are piling back into the perceived \u201csafe haven\u201d of fixed income as stock markets slide... And this comes against a backdrop of tighter monetary policy from the Federal Reserve, concerns over the outbreak of trade wars and worries about changes in key White House personnel leading to a more hawkish foreign policy. All-in-all, investors will see plenty of reasons to reduce equity exposure as we head into the weekend. Markets could be in for a run of volatility similar to the summer of 2015, says Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at IG: Markets remain under pressure as the sell-off in tech spreads once more to the wider equities space. The bounce on Tuesday looks like a flash in the pan, with more and more investors heading to the exit. It is looking increasingly likely that we have a re-run of August 2015 on our hands; equities then had months of volatility to contend with before the rally resumed. With trade wars and the tech scandal weighing on sentiment we may well have more downside to content with... The rout in global growth stocks has been seen in the falls in mining and bank names in London. Particularly hard hit among the banks are the Asia-focussed giants HSBC and Standard Chartered, while miners have seen further outflows as investors downgrade their optimistic views on global economic expansion. Oil prices are on the slide after a surprise rise in US stockpiles. Brent crude is currently down 0.6% at $69.68 a barrel while West Texas Intermediate - the US benchmark - is 1% lower at $64.6. The American Petroleum Institute said late on Tuesday that US weekly crude stocks had risen unexpectedly by 5.3m barrels to 430.6m barrels. Here\u2019s an interesting chart on market bubbles: The eurozone is seeing steady economic growth, thanks to a revival in world trade, according to S&amp;P Global Ratings. In a new report, the agency says: Global momentum has lifted the eurozone\u2019s economic prospects, and it now appears to have reached cruising altitude. The economic and monetary union closed 2017 on a high note, with GDP growth at 2.5%, its fastest pace in a decade. ...S&amp;P Global Ratings\u2019 economists say the chief reason for this is the revival of world trade, which has put the eurozone\u2019s industries back in motion. Capacity utilization was just short of its 2007 high, triggering stronger investment and boosting industry prospects for this year. However, the general fall in sentiment surveys at the start of 2018 indicates that eurozone growth is leveling off. Firms are increasingly reporting that supply constraints, rather than demand, are a drag on output. Nonetheless, for now, we expect the growth momentum will stay solid, thanks to the broad-based economic expansion and strong domestic fundamentals. It added: Strong fundamentals in the eurozone suggest that economic expansion will continue at a brisk pace, and we have raised our GDP growth forecasts for the region to 2.3% this year and 1.9% in 2019. We\u2019ve also raised our euro-dollar exchange rate forecast to $1.27 in 2018 and $1.3 in 2019, since we expect the dollar\u2019s weakness will persist. The current growth cycle appears to have peaked, but the remaining slack in the labor market and productivity rebound will keep inflationary pressures in check until the end of 2019. Because inflation will likely remain subdued this year, we expect the ECB will only gradually wind down its asset purchase program from September until the end of this year. As the gap between structural and real unemployment diminishes, earnings growth will accelerate. Thus, we think underlying inflation is set to move closer to the ECB\u2019s target at the end of 2019, giving the ECB enough leeway to raise rates in Q3 2019. Meanwhile the pound is edging higher, up 0.16% against the dollar at $1.4177 and 0.21% better against the euro at \u20ac1.1430. Lee Hardman, currency analyst at Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi, said: The ongoing reduction in Brexit risks and more hawkish outlook for Bank of England policy are the key drivers behind the pound\u2019s upward momentum. The pound has derived some additional support from a report that Irish officials have been told to expect new plans \u201cimminently\u201d on how Britain plans to avoid a hard border with Northern Ireland. While short on details, the report has further boosted confidence that the UK and EU can find a workable and timely solution to the Irish border issue to support plans for a \u201csmooth &amp; orderly Brexit\u201d. Nevertheless, it still remains a potential banana skin for the pound in the coming months if intensified Brexit talks do not progress as well as hoped. Among the day\u2019s company news, furniture group DFS has bucked the gloom in the high street with an upbeat outlook. It reported a 7.4% fall in underlying half year profits to \u00a330m, in line with expectations, and chief executive Ian Filby said: We have seen a strengthening trading performance across the first half of the financial year and through February into March. We therefore remain confident that, despite the current challenging market conditions, the group will deliver modest growth in [earnings] and generate strong cashflow across this financial year, in line with our expectations. Analysts at Stifel issued a buy note, saying: Management is striking a confident tone today (despite a challenging market), as the group heads into an easier comparison phase....The shares were pricing in bad news, so we\u2019d expect to see a decent relief rally today. Indeed the shares are up nearly 6% in early trading. Stifel added We still believe in the long-term attractions of DFS Furniture. It is a highly cash generative market leader, which is consolidating the physical market at the same time as some online pure players re-evaluate their business models. More on the tech fallout, which saw the US FANG stocks have their worst day for more than two years. Naeem Aslam, chief market analyst at Think Markets, said: The tech sector is predominantly getting battered, mainly due to the woes of Facebook\u2019s data breach. We clearly have three kind of investors when it comes to the Facebook; firstly there are some who are jumping out of the ship, pushing the stock price lower. Secondly, we have investors who are watching the show from the sideline and thinking there is more pain to come as we do not know how big the potential fine could be. This is not helping the stock price either. Finally, we have those who are not interested in Facebook anymore as they think that the regulatory burdensome on Facebook is too risky for their appetite and they do not want to get involved in this stock. We personally think, that Facebook has strong fundamentals and it has become the part of everyone\u2019s daily life, so once we have a clear idea about the potential sum which the firm would have to pay as a result of this situation, the stock price could present a potential opportunity. As for the FANG stock including Microsoft, Twitter, it is likely that the Facebook incident would open the door for more scrutiny for other firms, and lawmakers would see how other firms are using user data. This could really open the can of worms and open a potential opportunity for short sellers. Following the falls on Wall Street and in Asia, European markets have indeed dropped back in early trading. The FTSE 100 is down 0.7%, with software group Sage slipping 1.8% and mining shares also among the leading fallers. France\u2019s Cac and Spain\u2019s Ibex have fallen 0.9% while Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB is 0.88% lower. In Germany, the Dax has dropped 0.77%. In the wake of the decline of the US technology stocks, Europe\u2019s tech index is down 1.1%. Here are IG\u2019s opening calls for European markets: Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. An early rally on Wall Street went south by the close of play yesterday, and the turnaround is likely to weigh on European markets at today\u2019s open. Relief that the US and China appeared to be talking about averting a damaging trade war between the world\u2019s two biggest economies had given some support to markets. But a tech turnaround saw the Dow Jones Industrial Average drop 1.4% while the Nasdaq Composite dropped 2.93% and the S&amp;P 500 fell 1.73%. The so-called FANG technology stocks - Facebook, Amazon, Netflix, and Google (now Alphabet) were under pressure on fears of growing regulation in the wake of the Cambridge Analytica revelations. Tesla was also a big faller, down more than 8% on news of a Federal investigation into a fatal crash in California. The drop in the US filtered through to Asia, with the NIkkei 225 down 1.4% and the Hang Seng 1.57% lower. In Europe the FTSE 100 is forecast to open down around 50 points, back below 7000, while Germany\u2019s Dax could drop 120 points after European markets ended higher on Tuesday. Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets, said: For all the gains seen in US markets over the past 18 months the bulk of these have been driven by tech stocks, and yesterday these tech stocks swooned quite sharply, reversing a good proportion of Monday\u2019s gains, in the process dragging the S&amp;P500 back down towards its 200 day moving average. This rolling over in tech stocks looks set to weigh on European markets this morning, with a lower open as markets mull over the potential for uncertainty over a tech sector that could catch a cold as a result of Facebook\u2019s woes around user data. With the increasing focus on what is going with respect to how Facebook has managed its users personal data, it must surely be only a matter of time before attention turns to the rest of the tech sector, and how companies like Alphabet, Twitter, Microsoft and Apple to name a few, manage their own users personal data. If lawmakers do turn their attention to the rest of the sector, which seems likely, then it is hard not to see how other tech companies will escape scrutiny on how they use this user data, raising the prospect that we could uncover other practices that invite scrutiny. In the run-up to the Easter break there is a smattering of economic news in the form of the CBI\u2019s monthly snapshot of the retail sector and the latest US GDP figures. The US economy is expected to have grown by 2.7% in the fourth quarter on an annualised basis, up from 2.5%. Jasper Lawler at London Capital Group said: The economic backdrop was supportive in the last quarter of 2017. Robust jobs growth and healthy consumer spending comfortably propped up the economy, which is expected to be reflected in an upwards revision for economic growth to 2.7% on an annualised basis from 2.5% in the previous estimate. The reading will not yet include the benefits from the tax cuts, nor the more recent uncertainties over global trade. However, given how quiet the economic calendar is, the reading is expected to attract attention anyway. A surprise to the upside, could boost the possibility of a June rate hike up from the CME FedWatch odds of 78%, lifting the dollar back towards 90.00. On the contrary, should growth remain around 2.5%, we could see buying demand for the dollar decline and the greenback look to test 89.00 once more.

                "bodyText":"Before we close up for the day, here is a summary of the main developments: We are still awaiting the outcome of the battle for GKN. Will the engineering giant win its fight to retain independence, or will shareholders back Melrose\u2019s \u00a38bn hostile takeover approach. The decision is due by 5pm and we will have the latest updates here. After a roller-coaster week for markets, shares are up today on both sides of the Atlantic. The FTSE 100 is up 0.3% or 19 points at 7,064. There was some bad news from the UK retail sector, as the owner of Bargain Booze and Wine Rack - Conviviality - said it would appoint administrators within a fortnight after failing to secure emergency funds. UK house prices fell for a second month in March according to Nationwide, by 0.2%, as cash-strapped consumers proved unwilling to make major spending commitments. London continues to lag the rest of the country. The ONS confirmed the UK economy grew by 0.4% in the fourth quarter of 2017, and revised up annual growth in 2017 to 1.8% from an earlier estimate of 1.7%. A breakdown of the GDP report showed that household spending growth of 1.7% in 2017 was the weakest in six years, as falling real pay took its toll on family finances. In the US, initial jobless claims dropped to a 45-year low of 215,000 last week, in a further show of strength for America\u2019s labor market. The US Department of Justice announced that Barclays has agreed to pay $2bn to settle claims that it fraudulently sold residential mortgage-backed securities in the run-up to the financial crisis. On that note, it\u2019s time to close for the day. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back on Tuesday. US markets after the opening bell: Dow Jones: +0.5% at 23,974 S&amp;P 500: +0.5% at 2,617 Nasdaq: +0.5% at 23,974 Barclays has agreed to pay $2bn to settle claims that it fraudulently sold residential mortgage-backed securities in the run-up to the financial crisis. Announcing the levy, the US Department of Justice said Barclays had caused billions of dollars in losses to investors by engaging in a fraudulent scheme to sell 36 residential mortgage-backed securities (RMBS) deals between 2005 and 2007, misleading investors about the quality of the mortgage loans backing those deals. Richard Donoghue, United States Attorney for the Eastern District of New York, said: This settlement reflects the ongoing commitment of the Department of Justice, and this Office, to hold banks and other entities and individuals accountable for their fraudulent conduct. The substantial penalty Barclays and its executives have agreed to pay is an important step in recognizing the harm that was caused to the national economy and to investors in RMBS. As well as the fine imposed on the bank, two former Barclays executives have agreed to pay a combined sum of $2m in exchange for a dismissal of claims brought against them individually. The number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits fell to the lowest level in 45 years last week. Initial claims fell 12,000 to 215,000 in the week ending 24 March, the lowest since January 1973, the US Labor Department said. It followed 227,000 claims a week earlier, and was well below the 230,000 claims forecast by economists. Claims have now been below the 300,000 threshold - considered a measure of a strong labour market - for 158 consecutive weeks. That is the longest run of growth since 1970. John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, says he is concerned by this morning\u2019s ONS figures, which showed the savings ratio hit a record low of 4.9% in 2017. He says: These are deeply worrying figures. The fact that for the first time in 30 years households are now net borrowers, taking on more debt and seeing their incomes squeezed by inflation, while the savings ratio is at its lowest level since records began, should be setting off alarm bells in the Treasury. The chancellor stubbornly refused to use the spring statement to help working families, but he must now reconsider his policy of inaction as households are clearly reeling from the effects of eight years of Tory economic failure \u2013 with real wages still lower than when the Conservatives first came to power in 2010. The next Labour government will end austerity, introduce a \u00a310 per hour real living wage and cap interest on credit cards, to build a high wage, high skill economy of the future. President Trump has made very clear his feelings about Amazon in his first tweet of the day: Time for a European market update: FTSE 100: +0.2% at 7,061 Germany\u2019s DAX: +0.8% at 12,037 France\u2019s CAC: +0.6% at 5,161 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB: +0.2% at 22,386 Spain\u2019s IBEX: +0.7% at 9,620 Europe\u2019s STOXX 600: +0.4% at 371 US stock index futures are up with tech shares posting slim gains after being hammered earlier in the week. Shares in the so-called FANG group - Facebook, Amazon, Netflix, and Google (now Alphabet) - were up between 0.6% and 1.6% in pre-market trading. This morning\u2019s GDP report from the ONS showed that household spending grew by 1.7% in 2017 - the weakest since 2011. It reflects the tough backdrop faced by consumers since the Brexit vote in 2016, which drove a sharp fall in the value of the pound and pushed up the price of goods imported from abroad. As those price rises fed through to higher inflation, wage growth failed to keep pace, signalling falling real pay for workers. Households have responded to tighter budgets by spending less on non-essential items and becoming reluctant to commit to major spending decisions. Victoria Clarke, economist at Investec, explains: The detail today laid bare the squeeze on the household cash position sitting behind this subdued spending backdrop. Real household disposable income rose by just 0.1% over the quarter, a softening from the already subdued 0.3% increase in Q3. Wages and salaries were a positive influence to incomes growth but their influence was almost completely offset by the impact of rising inflation. Following a run of soft outturns, real household incomes grew by just 0.3% in 2017 as a whole. However, Paul Hollingsworth at Capital Economics say there is light at the end of the tunnel for UK consumers as inflation has already started to fall. With a sustained rises in real wages on the horizon, the outlook for spending growth remains bright. This supports our view that the economy will grow by around 2% this year, above the consensus estimate of 1.5%. Shares in Renault rose more than 5% after Bloomberg reported the French car maker is in talks to merge with Japanese car giant Nissan. Bloomberg says: Renault SA and Nissan Motor Co. are in talks to merge, seeking to solidify their two-decade-old alliance under a single stock as an unprecedented shift toward electric and shared cars transforms the industry, people with knowledge of the matter said. A deal would end the current alliance between the companies and marry them as one corporation, said the people, who asked not to be identified as the details aren\u2019t public. Renault currently owns 43 percent of Nissan while the Japanese carmaker has a 15 percent stake in its French counterpart. Carlos Ghosn, the chairman of both companies, is driving the negotiations and would run the combined entity, the people said. A merged giant would be a more formidable rival for Volkswagen AG and Toyota Motor Corp., allowing the partners to better pool resources as the industry shifts toward new-energy vehicles, autonomous driving and car-sharing services. While the alliance of Renault and Nissan has brought savings, the fragmented ownership structure has prevented the companies from reaping full benefits from their union. How the pound has fared against the dollar since the EU referendum: The pound is on course for its best quarterly performance against the dollar since 2015, despite dipping this morning. After taking a hammering in the aftermath of the Brexit vote in June 2016, the pound is currently up 4% against the dollar over the first quarter as it draws to a close. That\u2019s the biggest quarterly rise since mid 2015. Against the euro, the pound has risen 1.4% since January, which would be the best performance since 2016. Growing expectations that the Bank of England will raise interest rates faster than expected over the coming months has boosted the pound. Developments in Brexit negotiations that have been interpreted as broadly positive have also helped the UK currency. Current trading: The pound is roughly flat against the dollar at $1.4066 It is down 0.1% against the euro at \u20ac1.1420 CME agrees \u00a33.9bn deal for Michael Spencer\u2019s Nex Group The world\u2019s largest futures exchange, CME Group, has agreed to buy Michael Spencer\u2019s Nex Group in a \u00a33.9bn deal that will net the former Tory party treasurer \u00a3670m. CME also picked London as its European headquarters, giving a much-needed boost to the UK government during its Brexit negotiations. The move comes after CME\u2019s decision last year to shut its loss-making London bourse and clearing house. Spencer, chief executive of Nex, owns a 17.6% stake in the financial broker he founded in 1986. It changed its name from Icap at the end of 2016 and is one of the world\u2019s biggest money-broking firms. Spencer will join the CME board as a special advisor and will stay on for a minimum of two years to oversee the integration of the two businesses. The takeover, which still has to be approved by Nex shareholders, will lead to 750 job losses over the next three years in the combined business, or 16% of the total workforce. It is not clear where they will occur. Nex has 1,900 employees globally, including 634 in London and 42 in Bristol. CME employs 2,800 people worldwide, 400 of them in London. Last year Nex agreed to pay back donations of \u00a325,000 made to Conservative general election candidates following a shareholder revolt. Britain\u2019s services sector continued to be the main driver of growth in the fourth quarter of 2017, despite being revised down. It accounts for about three quarters of the UK economy. Output in the sector increased by 0.4%, lower than the 0.6% growth estimated previously. Transport, storage and communications services grew by 1.1%, while output at hotels and restaurants fell 0.1%. Here are how some of the other major parts of the economy performed between October and December: Industrial production grew by 0.4% Manufacturing output rose 1.3% Construction output fell 0.1% Agriculture contracted by 1% Household spending grew by 0.3% Government spending increased by 0.4% The trade deficit widened to \u00a39.34bn from \u00a37.6bn in Q3 Business investment increased by 0.3% The ONS has revised its estimate for annual growth in 2017 back up to 1.8%. That\u2019s in line with its first estimate, before the ONS revised it down to 1.7% in its first revision. It is still the weakest growth in five years. Consumer spending grew, but at a weaker rate than previous years as the fall in real wages took its toll: The UK economy grew by 0.4% in the final three months of 2017, the Office for National Statistics confirmed in its latest estimate of GDP. It was unchanged from previous estimates. Rob Kent-Smith, a statistician at the ONS, gives a handy overview: Economic growth at the end of last year was unrevised with services and manufacturing continuing to drive growth. Household borrowing increased throughout 2017, while their saving was the lowest on record. However, the UK\u2019s deficit with the rest of the world shrank, as the UK received increased earnings on foreign investments thanks to a growing world economy. The service sector picked up in the three months to January with architecture, leasing companies and health work all boosting growth. Brian Murphy, head of lending for the Mortgage Advice Bureau, has commented on the 0.2% fall in UK house prices reported by Nationwide: Given that some areas of the country, such as Northern Ireland and Wales, are seeing more significant increases in prices, while London is still seeing prices cool, suggests that the [headline figure] masks a broad degree of variance across the regions, which rather underscores the effect that dipping London and South East values are having on the wider average. That there is still such a marked North-South divide in average house properties values is, of course, no surprise. However, market conditions in London and thew South East market would appear to be somewhat lacklustre when compared to other areas, proving that consumer confidence is still very strong outside the capital and its commuter belt, as underscored by the ongoing paucity of stock in these areas. Germany\u2019s unemployment rate fell to 5.3% in March from 5.4% in February. That\u2019s the lowest rate since German reunification in 1990. The total number of unemployed people fell more than expected by 19,000 to 2.37 million. The positive backdrop for employment is likely to further boost consumer confidence in Europe\u2019s largest economy. Nationwide has published its latest monthly house price index which shows the average price fell 0.2% in March, to \u00a3211,625. It followed a 0.4% fall in March, and took the annual rate of house price growth to 2.1%. The last time the annual rate was weaker was June 2013. Here is how the picture looks regionally, where London is lagging behind the rest of the country: Robert Gardner, Nationwide\u2019s chief economist, gives his view of the market: On the surface, the relatively subdued pace of house price growth appears at odds with recent healthy rates of employment growth, a modest pick-up in wage growth and historically low borrowing costs. However, consumer confidence has remained subdued, due to the ongoing squeeze on household finances as wage growth continues to lag behind increases in the cost of living. Looking ahead, much will depend on how broader economic conditions evolve, especially in the labour market, but also with respect to interest rates. Subdued economic activity and the ongoing squeeze on household budgets is likely to continue to exert a modest drag on housing market activity and house price growth this year. Nationwide is predicting house price growth of just 1% in 2018 overall. Here is our full story on Conviviality, which this morning said it would file for administration within a fortnight: The number of cars rolling off UK production lines fell again in February after a 17% drop in demand from the home market. A total of 145,475 cars were made in British factories last month, down 4.4% on a year earlier. Cars built for export, which account for about 80% of UK production, dipped 0.8%. Mike Hawes, chief executive, of the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders which produces the figures, said the figures were concerning: Another month of double digit decline in production for the UK is of considerable concern, but we hope that the degree of certainty provided by last week\u2019s Brexit transition agreement will help stimulate business and consumer confidence over the coming months. These figures also highlight the scale of our sector\u2019s dependency on exports, so a final deal that keeps our frictionless trade links with our biggest market, the EU, after December 2020 is now a pressing priority. Conviviality, the firm behind Bargain Booze and Wine Rack has announced this morning that it will appoint administrators within a fortnight, putting 2,600 jobs at risk. The British Beer &amp; Pub Association has warned some pubs could face shortage of some drinks in the short-term, because the company\u2019s Matthew Clark and Bibendum subsidiaries are major suppliers. After failing to secure emergency funding from investors, Conviviality a brief statement: Following discussions with its lending banks, the board has resolved to file notice of intention to appoint administrators to the Company. Unless circumstances change, and in accordance with statutory requirements, the board intend to appoint administrators within 10 business days. The secured creditors can, however, appoint administrators without the requirement for notice. The directors intend to allow the business to continue to trade and the company continues to work alongside advisers in order to preserve as much value as possible for all stakeholders as it explores a number of inbound enquiries regarding a potential sale of all or parts of the business. Further announcements will be made as appropriate. Here is the background: And we\u2019re off.
