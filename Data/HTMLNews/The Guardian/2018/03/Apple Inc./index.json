Snapchat wasn\u2019t, because of the might of Facebook and its Instagram service. Snapchat is a second-tier player: Spotify and Dropbox are top-tier players. It is a completely different ballgame.\u201d</p> <p>Some big names are counting on Ek and his counterpart at Dropbox, Drew Houston. Lining up behind Dropbox and Spotify are ride-hailing service Uber \u2013 given a notional value of $50bn in 2015 \u2013 and the short-term letting agency Airbnb. The former isn\u2019t profitable; the latter is. With markets jittery, both Spotify and Dropbox are working hard to push a story of future profits and growth.</p> <p>On Wednesday, Spotify used a web presentation to reassure would-be investors that it has a clear path to profit, pointing out that revenues grew 39% to \u20ac4.1bn (\u00a33.6bn) in 2017, though financing costs from a \u20ac1bn loan helped push operating losses up 8% to \u20ac378m. \u201cThe trend towards profitability is clear when you look at operating losses as a percentage of revenue,\u201d it said soothingly.</p> <p>Spotify is also taking an unusual approach to its listing \u2013 going direct, so that its shares aren\u2019t handled by an investment bank or underwriters, but simply offered from the company on the exchange to would-be buyers.</p> <p>Analysing that approach last year, the <a href=\"http://fortune.com/2017/04/07/spotify-ipo-direct-listing/\" title=\"\">business magazine <em>Fortune</em> said</a>: \u201cIf an IPO is like a wedding, a direct listing is running off to elope. A faster, easier, cheaper route to the same result.\u201d Of course, like an elopement, you might not get the big benefits: an IPO guarantees money from institutional buyers snapping up millions of shares. A direct listing could flop.</p> <p>Others aren\u2019t so sure about Spotify\u2019s potential, based on its finances and its business model. Spotify users have the option of a free service, in exchange for listening to adverts intermittently, or paying a monthly subscription fee of \u00a39.99, $9.99 or \u20ac9.99 for no-advert streaming. It is a compelling service with 71 &#xa0;million paying users, but the cost in payments to artists and record companies is huge: it has forked out $9bn in royalties since it launched.</p> <p>According to one investor, Spotify\u2019s gross margin \u2013 a measure of profitability once certain costs are stripped out \u2013 is not high enough and indicates that royalty rates have to come down. \u201cA 20% gross margin business is not a good business,\u201d says venture capitalist David B Pakman. \u201cOne of two things has to happen: they have to enter new business lines with higher gross margins, or somehow magically transform the rate structure with labels.\u201d The latter rate is how much Spotify has to pay per track streamed.</p> <p>Dropbox, meanwhile, was valued at $10bn when it last raised capital in 2014, but that has been slashed to between $7bn and $8bn for its forthcoming IPO, which is intended to raise about $610m. Steve Jobs was famously dismissive of the company: in a 2009 meeting, the late Apple chief <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2012/01/23/dld-2012-drew-houston-yes-steve-jobs-called-dropbox-a-feature/\" title=\"\">told</a> Houston that he had \u201ca feature, not a product\u201d. In other words: Apple or Microsoft or Google could add Dropbox\u2019s functionality \u2013 you drop a file in the folder on your PC, and it\u2019s available on your phone or tablet \u2013 to their existing software for free.</p> <p>Houston shrugged off Jobs\u2019s disdain to build a company that in 2017 had 500 million users and $1.11bn in revenues. Not bad for a \u201cfeature\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"9b00a5b0e8306bb74190791c9d69a2308ed3c8ef\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9b00a5b0e8306bb74190791c9d69a2308ed3c8ef/0_0_1992_2490/800.jpg\" alt=\"Spotify\u2019s Daniel Ek\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Spotify\u2019s Daniel Ek has some big startups watching his IPO closely.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ilya S Savenok/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>So why has its notional value gone down? Partly it\u2019s the company\u2019s revenues: in the absence of profits (it made a net loss of $112m in 2017, almost halved from $210m in 2016), a typical measure of capitalisation is a five- or six-fold revenue multiple.

In 2012, the venture capitalist Bill Gurley <a href=\"http://abovethecrowd.com/2012/02/23/why-dropbox-is-a-major-disruption/\" title=\"\">called Dropbox \u201ca major disruption\u201d</a>, saying that Houston and his team had \u201ctaken a hard problem \u2013 file synchronisation \u2013 and made it brain-dead simple\u201d. But now such synchronisation is a feature offered by almost everyone.

Dropbox\u2019s challenge is persuading people to flip over to paying for something they can largely get for free: Apple and Google both offer unlimited photo storage and as much free file storage as Dropbox.</p> <p>So, for both companies, plenty of ancillary questions remain over these valuations.

coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business.</strong><br></p> \n  <p>The battle to take control of one of Britain\u2019s oldest engineering firms is hotting up today.</p> \n  <p>Melrose, the turnaround group, has intensified the pressure as it tries to seize control of GKN, in an increasingly bitter fight.</p> \n  <p>Over the weekend, <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2018/03/17/melrose-chief-launches-attack-gkn-bosses-losing-citys-confidence/\">Melrose CEO Simon Peckham blasted GKN\u2019s management, telling the Sunday Telegraph that</a>:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>\u201cGKN has been run by people who don\u2019t have an owner mentality, they have a manager mentality.</p> \n   <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a business that has slowly but surely lost the support of the UK institutional investment community.\u201d</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Relations between the two companies were already chilly (Melrose\u2019s plan for GKN includes dismissing its management and giving its staff more involvement). Peckham\u2019s intervention, at a time when major shareholders are having to choose who to back, ensures they are now sub-zero.</p> \n  <p><strong>And this morning, Melrose has announced that it has offered to put more money into GKN\u2019s pension scheme -- roughly \u00a31bn over the time it expected to own GKN.</strong></p> \n  <p><a href=\"https://www.investegate.co.uk/melrose-industries--mro-/rns/statement-re-final-offer-for-gkn-plc/201803190700060707I/\">It told the City</a> that this proposal is almost twice the amount of the \u00a3528 million deficit reduction package that the trustees recently agreed with GKN.</p> \n  <p>Melrose chairman <strong>Christopher Miller </strong>says:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>The proposal we have made to the trustees of up to \u00a31 billion of contributions under our ownership is a clear example of what Melrose does which is good for pensioners and shareholders alike and shows we are a good custodian for all stakeholders.</p> \n   <p>Melrose\u2019s measured approach represents certainty of strategy, value and management. We strongly urge GKN shareholders to accept our offer without delay.\u201d</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>That might assuage some concerns about whether Melrose is a suitable owner for GKN.</p> \n  <p>GKN, though, insists that Melrose\u2019s latest offer (worth around \u00a38bn) is too low. MPs also have concerns, given Melrose\u2019s track record of buying companies and breaking them up to release value.</p> \n  <p>Unions also fear job losses - and are expect to meet with Melrose today.</p> \n  <p>Shareholders have until 29th March to make a decision....</p> \n  <h2>Also coming up today....</h2> \n  <p>Finance ministers from the G20 group of advanced economies are meeting in Argentina today.

                "bodyText":"Time for a recap: Around $36bn has been wiped off Facebook\u2019s market capitalisation, after its worst day\u2019s trading in several years. Shares slumped by 6.7% after a whistleblower revealed a vast data breach that affected tens of millions of people. Politicians on both sides of the Atlantic are demanding answers. In America, senators are pushing for senior executives to be questioned on Capitol Hill. The Connecticut Attorney General is also opening a probe. In the UK, the information commissioner is launching an investigation. The ICO may search the offices of Cambridge Analytica on Tuesday, after Theresa May\u2019s spokesperson expressed concern over the revelations. Tonight, Channel 4 have revealed how the company\u2019s bosses talked of using honey traps, spies and fake news to help clients World stock markets were also dragged down by worries that Donald Trump\u2019s steel and aluminium tariffs would spark a trade war. In London, the FTSE 100 sagged to a 15-month low That\u2019s all for today. Thanks for reading and commenting. Just in: the Connecticut Attorney General is launching an investigation into Facebook. It will centre on the Observer\u2019s revelations that the Facebook profiles of 50 million people were harvested by Cambridge Analytica. Attorney General George Jepsen says: \u201cNews reports that personal user information from Facebook profiles was provided to third parties without user consent are concerning and raise serious questions about how this happened in the specific situation involving Cambridge Analytica and about Facebook\u2019s policies and practices more generally. Today, my office has in writing initiated an inquiry asking Facebook to answer a series of questions about this matter. While we cannot comment further at this time, Connecticut residents should know that my office takes privacy matters very seriously, and we will move as quickly as we responsibly can to get to the bottom of this situation.\u201d Bloomberg have more details of the growing pressure to make top tech executives face a Capitol Hill grilling: U.S. Senators Amy Klobuchar, a Democrat from Minnesota, and John Kennedy, a Republican from Louisiana, have called on the chairman of the Judiciary Committee to bring in technology company CEOs, including from Twitter Inc. and Alphabet Inc.\u2019s Google, for public questioning In a letter Monday to Senator Chuck Grassley, a Republican from Iowa, Klobuchar and Kennedy said they have \u201cserious concern regarding recent reports that data from millions of American was misused in order to influence voters.\u201d \u201cThe lack of oversight on how data is stored and how political advertisements are sold raises concerns about the integrity of American elections as well as privacy rights,\u201d the senators wrote. A hearing with the CEOs would allow the committee to learn \u201cwhat is being done to protect Americans\u2019 data and limit abuse of the platforms, as well as to assess what measures should be taken before the next elections.\u201d Global stock markets are now on their worst run since last November, according to Reuters data. Facebook was obviously one factor behind today\u2019s selloff. But, traders are also worried about a protectionist trade war breaking out. This overshadowed the \u2018Brexit breakthrough\u2019 between the UK and Brussels over a transition deal this morning. Breaking! Around $36bn has been wiped off Facebook\u2019s value today, as trading ends in New York after a rough session. Shares in the embattled social media giant ended down 6.7% at $172.5. That looks to be its biggest one-day loss in four years (and its biggest drop in value ever). That takes Facebook\u2019s market capitalisation down to just over $500bn, from $537bn on Friday night. Other tech stocks also suffered, dragging the Nasdaq down by 1.8%. The broad S&amp;P 500 index fell by 1.4%, with Facebook the biggest faller. Facebook\u2019s decision to hire a data forensic firm to examine the claims against Cambridge Analytica has caused some concern. Particularly as the UK Information Commissioner is planning to obtain a warrant on Tuesday to search its offices. New details of Cambridge Analytica\u2019s activities are emerging tonight. Undercover Channel 4 News reporters have recorded CEO Alexander Nix discussing the tactics it used. Here\u2019s a flavour: In a series of meetings with a reporter posing as a representative of a wealthy Sri Lankan family seeking political influence, Cambridge Analytica executives initially denied the company was in the business of using entrapment techniques. But Nix later detailed the dirty tricks the company would be prepared to pull behind the scenes to help its clients. When the reporter asked if Cambridge Analytica could offer investigations into the damaging secrets of rivals, Nix said it worked with former spies from Britain and Israel to look for political dirt. He also volunteered that his team were ready to go further than an investigation. \u201cOh, we do a lot more than that,\u201d he said over dinner at an exclusive hotel in London. \u201cDeep digging is interesting, but you know equally effective can be just to go and speak to the incumbents and to offer them a deal that\u2019s too good to be true and make sure that that\u2019s video recorded. Newsflash: Facebook has just released a statement, saying it has hired a forensics firm to investigate the claims against Cambridge Analytica. The social media giant says that Cambridge academic Aleksandr Kogan, who orchestrated the harvesting of Facebook data, has verbally agreed to take part in the audit. Whistleblower Christopher Wylie has \u2018thus far declined\u2019, Facebook says. The Wall Street selloff is gathering pace. Facebook\u2019s problems seem to be sparking wider alarm in the markets, with investors also worried about the risk of a trade war (and the prospect of a US interest rate rise on Wednesday) With just over an hour\u2019s trading to go, the Nasdaq is down almost 3% while the Dow is staring at a 450-point loss (-1.8%). More than $100bn has been wiped off the value of America\u2019s biggest tech companies today. Facebook is the worst performer (-7%), shedding around $35bn at pixel time. According to the Financial Times, that is one of the ten biggest one-day losses (in dollar terms) ever suffered by a technology company. Every member of the Nasdaq is currently in the red; Alphabet/Google is down 3.5%, Amazon are down 2.3%, NVIDIA has lost 4.8%, Apple is off 2% and Microsoft has shed 2.2%. The revelations about how Cambridge Analytica harvested tens of millions of Facebook profiles is fuelling calls for tighter regulation of the tech sector. And if that happens, the world\u2019s largest technology firms could find their growth squeezed, making it hard to justify their immense valuations (Facebook is still worth half a trillion dollars, despite today\u2019s share price slide) Jake Dollarhide of Longbow Asset Management believes the implications could be huge. He says (via Reuters): \u201cThere\u2019s the thought that the government might try to regulate tech. You open a slippery slope. If you regulate Facebook what\u2019s to say that wouldn\u2019t have a domino effect. Google, maybe Uber?\u201d What\u2019s to stop the government for getting its fingers in all these areas. People have thought right now the tech growth rate has no boundaries, no ceiling. Today people are beginning to question that. If it\u2019s the case now, will it still be the case in the future.\u201d US senator Amy Klobuchar, who represents Minnesota, is calling for top tech executives including Mark Zuckerberg to be called to account: Facebook\u2019s share price is stubbornly in the red, and on track for its worst day in five years: The UK government has weighed in on the unfolding Facebook data story. Theresa May\u2019s spokesman has said the PM backs an investigation by the information commissioner into the use of Facebook data by Cambridge Analytica, adding: The allegations are clearly very concerning, it\u2019s essential people can have confidence that their personal data can be protected and used in an appropriate way. More here: It\u2019s a grim start to the week for stock markets, as a combination of factors leave investors nursing losses. The technology sector has been hit by the Facebook controversy, and in the UK, the slump in Micro Focus shares following a profit warning. There is also nervousness ahead of this week\u2019s Federal Reserve meeting, which is expected to sanction another interest rate rise. The interest will be in seeing whether new Fed chair Jerome Powell hints at three or four increases in total this year. Signs of some agreement in the Brexit transition talks has lifted the pound to a one month high against the dollar. But the strength of sterling has helped push the FTSE 100 to its lowest level since December 2016. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 fell 121.21 points or 1.69% to 7042.93 Germany\u2019s Dax dropped 1.39% to 12,217.02 France\u2019s Cac closed down 1.13% at 5222.84 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB finished 0.98% lower at 22,633.10 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended down 0.99% at 9664.1 In Greece, the Athens market lost 0.79% to 807.44 On Wall Street the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 429 points or 1.72%. The Facebook controversy means investors are shying away from risk in general, sayd Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at IG: Markets are in full retreat this afternoon, and the drop has been exemplified by a triple-digit decline on the FTSE 100. The index has returned to December 2016 levels, a remarkable change from last when it was riding high above 7200. Devoid of big macro data, investors have focused on the growing scandal at Facebook and this has resulted in a full-blown flight from risk. Investors have begun to fear that the social media giant has encountered its first real obstacle, and that further investigation will uncover other data breaches. The market has been in love with Facebook for a long time now, but with questions surrounding other tech giants and their use of data, it could be only a matter of time until others of the hitherto untouchable \u2018FANG\u2019 stocks find themselves dragged into an official investigation. Another retailer in trouble, as US jewellery and accessories group Claire\u2019s files for bankruptcy. The company said its international operations were not included but it does plan to cut back on the number of its stores in Europe. The full story is here: Meanwhile in the UK, Carpetright shares are down 17.5% and Mothercare has lost 12.5% as investors fret about store closures and future prospects for both chains. It\u2019s not getting any better for Facebook. It\u2019s shares are now down 7% in the wake of the Cambridge Analytica controversy. The technology gloom on both sides of the Atlantic, including worries about an EU tax and in the UK the slump in Micro Focus shares, is one of the reasons for the day\u2019s market weakness. On Wall Street the Nasdaq Composite is down 2%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average has lost 280 points or 1.1%. Investors are also nervous ahead of this week\u2019s Federal Reserve meeting. A rate rise announcement on Wednesday is almost a done deal, but there is much nervousness about whether there will be three or four increases in total this year. In Europe, Germany\u2019s Dax is down 1.2% and France\u2019s Cac is 0.89% lower while the FTSE 100 has fallen 1.59%, not helped by a stronger pound after positive noises from the Brexit negotiations. Jasper Lawler, head of research at London Capital Group, said: A sharp decline in tech stocks, US politcal tension between and a \u2018death cross\u2019 on Germany\u2019s benchmark DAX index were all weighing on sentiment. Investors are extra touchy in the lead up to Wednesday\u2019s FOMC meeting and the first press conference from new Fed Chair Jerome Powell. The death cross, when the 50 day moving average crosses below the two-hundred day moving average, is a technical indication that the price trend for German stocks has turned downwards. Tech stocks saw some of the biggest declines on the day. Facebook\u2019s monopoly on personal data has put the company under the microscope again. There has been public outcry over the use of personal data harvested from Facebook data by Cambridge Analytica for use in election campaigns. The latest data scandal might well be the straw that breaks the camel\u2019s back for tighter industry regulation. Tighter regulation of how data is collected and used will inevitably curb growth for tech and social media companies that use the data to attract advertisers. Back with Facebook, and the company could now face regulation, sayis Peter Garnry, head of equity strategy at Saxo Bank: Facebook shares are down almost 4% as the Cambridge Analytica Files were revealed over the weekend by the Guardian. The files expose a major data scandal that Facebook did little to contain or correct. This scandal will fuel into the Mueller investigation and potentially pave the way for the regulation of Facebook as the social media platform is a national security asset because people\u2019s behaviour can be impacted through the network. Garney also warns about the impact of the EU Commission considering a technology tax of 3% on revenues: This is move to make technology companies, that are extensively using transfer pricing to avoid taxes in high tax rate countries, to pay more to society. These are just the first signs that major technology companies will be more regulated in the future. It is key for long-term investors in technology to have this on the radar. On a day when markets in Europe and the US are heavily in negative territory, Barclays is one exception to the rule. The bank\u2019s shares are up nearly 4% after it emerged that activist investor Edward Bramson had taken control of a 5% stake through his Sherborne Investors. It owns 1.94% of the bank\u2019s shares directly and the rest of the 5% through derivatives. Russ Mould, AJ Bell investment director, said: Sherborne has built a formidable reputation for squeezing improved financial and operational performance from the companies in which it invests and Edward Bramson clearly feels that Barclays shares are going cheap, given the prevailing discount to the book, or net asset value. The question now is what the activist investor thinks Barclays should be doing differently and how he intends to get those views across to the bank\u2019s boss, Jes Staley. The fall in Facebook\u2019s value has also hit founder Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s personal wealth. His stake in the business has fallen by around $4bn in the wake of the Cambridge Analytica controversy. But don\u2019t worry too much. He is still worth around $71bn, making him the world\u2019s fourth richest person according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. Today\u2019s sell off has wiped some $27bn off Facebook\u2019s value, as investors react to the revelations about its relationship with Cambridge Analytica. Breaking: Shares in Facebook have fallen at the start of trading in New York, after the social media giant was hit by a major data scandal. Yesterday, the Observer reported that data analytics firm Cambridge Analytica had harvested the Facebook profiles of millions of US voters, and used them to built a sophisticated tools to predict, and influence, how they would vote. The disclosure creates some huge questions for Facebook, as Cambridge Analytica worked for Donald Trump\u2019s successful election campaign. As my colleague Carole Cadwalladr reported: Christopher Wylie, who worked with a Cambridge University academic to obtain the data, told the Observer: \u201cWe exploited Facebook to harvest millions of people\u2019s profiles. And built models to exploit what we knew about them and target their inner demons. That was the basis the entire company was built on.\u201d Documents seen by the Observer, and confirmed by a Facebook statement, show that by late 2015 the company had found out that information had been harvested on an unprecedented scale. However, at the time it failed to alert users and took only limited steps to recover and secure the private information of more than 50 million individuals. Facebook is now facing criticism from politicians on both sides of the Atlantic. There are with suggestions that founder Mark Zuckerberg could be summoned to the UK parliament to answer questions. Conservative MP Damian Collins, who chairs the House of Commons digital, culture, media and sport select committee, has said he plans to recall Cambridge Analytica\u2019s CEO to explain why he told MPs last month that his company had not received data from Facebook. Collins says: \u201cWe will be contacting Alexander Nix next week asking him to explain his comments\u201d. Tech shares are also being hit by reports that Brussels is preparing to impose a digital tax on the EU revenues of companies such as Google, Facebook and Apple. Facebook is leading the selloff, falling from $185 per share to below $176 in early trading. Ding ding. The New York stock market has opened, and stocks are dropping in a broad-based selloff. The Dow Jones industrial average has shed around 100 points, or 0.4%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq is down almost 1%. Adam Leyland of The Grocer reckons the Conviviality crisis began after it floated on the stock market in 2013, and started executing ambitious takeover deal to consolidate the drinks trade. He point out that the company changed CFOs last autumn, and has also been hit by recent bad weather and the post-festive slump. Leyland writes: It seems incredible that a business could unravel as quickly as Conviviality has. But with tighter margins and sales commonplace after Christmas, plus tough trading and the snow to contend with, it\u2019s not inconceivable that an operation can quickly lose control of cashflow. And you lose it at your peril. The Grocer: Why has Conviviality spent out on company-owned stores? Newsflash: The CEO of Conviviality, which owns the Bargain Booze and Wine Rack chains, has resigned. Diana Hunter has stepped down with immediate effect, the company says, less than a week after the company\u2019s shares were suspended after two profits warnings. Conviviality is in a pickle. Firstly, it revealed that a spreadsheet error meant profits this year would be \u00a35.2m lower than expected. That was compounded last week when it discovered an unpaid \u00a330m tax bill. Conviviality, which is also a drinks wholesaler, is urgently seeking fresh funds from investors. Last week, Sky News reported that some were demanding Hunter\u2019s exit in return for their support. Brexit means colour-coding! The new draft Brexit deal text has been neatly shaded to show areas where there is full agreement (green), political agreement (yellow) and areas which are still under discussion (white0). It\u2019s official! Britain and the EU have taken a \u201cdecisive step\u201d towards withdrawal agreement, says Michel Barnier in Brussels. After intensive work, the two sides have jointly published a new version of the draft withdrawal deal for Brexit, says Barnier at his joint press-conference with David Davis. This includes \u201ccomplete accord\u201d on citizens right and Britain\u2019s financial settlement. But.. Barnier also cautions that a step is just a step - a lot of work remains to be done, especially on the Ireland border issue. So, they\u2019re closer, but they\u2019re not there yet. The pound is pushing a little higher, now up 0.7% against both the US dollar (to $1.405), and the euro (to \u20ac1.147). Politics Live has full details. Disappointingly, another 46 Carillion workers have been made redundant today by the Official Receiver. The receiver was unable to find fresh employment for these staff, following Carillion\u2019s fall into liquidation two months ago. This takes the total laid off to 1,582. In better news, 71 workers have been successfully transferred to a new supplier, which means 8,592 jobs have been saved - or almost half Carillion\u2019s workers. That leaves around 7,000 workers who are still working on outsourced public or private sector contracts which haven\u2019t yet been transferred to a new operator, or cancelled. The surge in the pound is helping to drag Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 down to a two-week low. Micro Focus is also doing its bit - shares are down a staggering 55% after this morning\u2019s gloomy update. This has helped wipe 90 points off the Footsie, or 1.2%. Other European markets are also starting the new week rather, er, weakly, with losses in Frankfurt (-0.9%), Paris (-0.7%), Milan (-0.4%) and Madrid (-0.5%) Investors are edgy ahead of several big news events this week, including the G20 finance ministers meeting in Buenos Aires (ending tomorrow), and Wednesday\u2019s Federal Reserve meeting which is likely to lead to a hike in US interest rates. Fed chair Jerome Powell\u2019s first press conference since replacing Janet Yellen will give the markets an insight into his thinking, and the likely pace of future rate hikes. A frisson of excitement is rippling through the foreign exchange floors, amid rumours of a Brexit breakthough. Britain\u2019s Brexit secretary David David is meeting with chief EU negotiator Michel Barnier now, ahead of the crunch EU summit later this week. And there are rumours that the two men will announce that the \u2018broad\u2019 terms of a transition deal have been agreed. If so, that would calm fears that Britain would crash over the cliff-edge into a hard Brexit in March 2019. The pound has gained almost a cent against the US dollar to $1.40, and is up 0.5% against the euro to \u20ac1.14 (both the highest levels since February) Barnier and Davis are due to hold a press conference at around 12.45pm Brussels time (11.45am GMT). Our Politics Live blog will have all the action (plus the latest on the Skripal poisoning). Back to GKN.... and Melrose has swiftly rubbished today\u2019s news that America\u2019s Dana will list shares in London if it succeeds in merging with GKN\u2019s auto business. A Melrose spokeswoman argues that City investors will still lose out, due to London\u2019s listing rules. \u2018A secondary UK listing will make little difference to the problems it creates for UK holders with Ohio-headquartered Dana maintaining its primary listing on the New York Stock Exchange. Without a primary UK listing the shares will remain outside the investment mandate of many UK funds who benchmark their performance against the UK indices. Such a listing does not allow indexation, so UK tracker funds can\u2019t hold the shares. Perhaps more significantly many of the UK listing rules which govern corporate behaviour, such as shareholder approval for significant acquisitions, do not apply to a standard listing. There will still be a major flowback issue which has implications for the underlying price the shares are offered at. Basically, it\u2019s a fudge which is unattractive to UK shareholders\u2019 In a busy morning for takeover news, UK property group Hammerson is fending off an approach from French mall operator Kl\u00e9pierre. Kl\u00e9pierre has announced this morning that it approached Hammerson about a possible \u00a35bn offer. If it went through, it would thwart Hammerson\u2019s attempt to merge with rival Intu and create Britain\u2019s biggest property firm. Hammerson has swiftly rejected Kl\u00e9pierre\u2019s approach as \u201centirely opportunistic\u201d and without merit, even though the 615p per share offer is around 40% over Hammerson\u2019s value last week. Hammerson shares have jumped 25% this morning, as traders anticipate a bidding battle for the company - which owns 37 shopping centres and retail parks including Birmingham\u2019s Bullring shopping centre. More here: Reuters reckons the takeover battle for GKN is heating up today, with both sides sweetening their pitch to shareholders. They write: Melrose, making a hostile bid, said it would inject about 1 billion pounds ($1.39 billion) into GKN\u2019s pension scheme, its latest attempt to convince shareholders to back its offer and win over political opponents of the deal. Shareholders have until March 29 to decide on that offer. GKN is trying to fight off the Melrose bid with an alternative $6.1 billion deal to merge its automotive business with U.S. company Dana Incorporated leaving GKN focused on its aerospace division. Dana said on Monday it would seek a secondary listing in London, enabling more UK shareholders to back the rival plan as some funds are subject to rules which prevent them from holding US stock. The US company also promised GKN investors a slice of its dividend as it said it would pay its current quarterly dividend of $0.10 per share to the enlarged shareholder base. Bloomberg\u2019s Sam Unsted says it\u2019s turning into a full-blown saga: Over in the City, investors have been distracted from the GKN-Melrose battle by a truly grim announcement from tech firm Micro Focus. Micro Focus, a FTSE 100-listed software provider, warned that revenues will fall by between 6% and 9% this year, which will eat into profits. It blames integration problems following its \u00a36.8bn takeover of Hewlett Packard Enterprise\u2019s software business last autumn, a deal that made Micro Focus Britain\u2019s biggest tech company. Micro Focus admits that it has struggled to implement its new IT system, which hit sales - leading to sales people quitting the business. Splitting HP\u2019s software operations from the rest of the business has caused further disruption to customer accounts, it admits, making it harder to win sales. Quite a mess. CEO Chris Hsu has resigned and is leaving with immediate effect to \u201cspend more time with his family and pursue another opportunity\u201d. Micro Focus insists it can fix these problems, and that the HP deal makes sense. But shareholders have reacted by wiping 50% off Micro Focus\u2019s share price. The unions who represent GKN employees across the UK will demand answers from Melrose over its plans for the company, when they meet today. Many GKN workers fear for their future, as Melrose\u2019s business model is to buy companies, make them more profitable, and then sell them again. One person\u2019s \u2018asset-stripper\u2019 is another one\u2019s \u2018turnaround specialist\u2019, of course. But unions are concerned that Melrose could load GKN up with debt, and take a dangerously short-term approach. Unite\u2019s assistant general secretary Steve Turner has warned: \u201cMelrose\u2019s bosses have been far from clear about the detail of their true intentions for GKN beyond vague platitudes and soundbites. \u201cQuestion marks remain around the levels of debt Melrose will pile on the company and what it means for jobs, long-term investment and product development. Turner also points out that aerospace giant Airbus - GKN\u2019s largest customer - has warned it couldn\u2019t work with the firm unless it knew its long-term plans. \u201cGKN\u2019s highly skilled UK workforce fear they will end up being sold off piecemeal, with their jobs either axed or shipped overseas to fund a debt-fuelled pay day if Melrose gets its way. That concern over Melrose\u2019s short-termism extends to major GKN customers such as Airbus too, which relies on a long-term relationship with GKN to develop the wings of the future. \u201cIf Airbus or other major customers take their business elsewhere it would blow a hole in revenues and destroy jobs and innovation. In another development, Melrose has lowered the \u2018Acceptance Condition\u2019 of its GKN offer, from 90% to 50% plus one share. That means it has lowered the bar to a successful takeover. GKN has hit back against Melrose\u2019s takeover bid. The UK engineering group has announced that, once it sells its Driveline business to American firm Dana, the resulting company will have a secondary listing on the London stock exchange as well as a primary listing in New York. That is designed to help GKN investors, who might have been forced to sell the shares they\u2019ll own in Dana-GKN Driveline if the deal goes through Driveline is GKN\u2019s automobile division. The \u00a34.4bn sale to Dana (who make axels and driveshafts) was hammered out 10 days ago as GKN battled to repel Melrose\u2019s advances. CEO Anne Stevens says that the deal makes sense for GKN shareholders, especially if they\u2019ll be able to hold onto equity in the new business through a London listing. \u201cSince announcing the deal to bring GKN Driveline and Dana together, I have had the opportunity to speak to many of our shareholders and explain why I am so excited about this prospect. \u201cThe complementary nature of the two businesses and our shared commitment to R&amp;D and long term investment creates a fantastic opportunity to build a world leading company and create meaningful shareholder value by delivering $235 million in synergies. \u201cThe listing on the London Stock Exchange will make it possible for more of our shareholders to participate in the expected value creation opportunity from the combined Dana and GKN Driveline business.\u201d Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. The battle to take control of one of Britain\u2019s oldest engineering firms is hotting up today. Melrose, the turnaround group, has intensified the pressure as it tries to seize control of GKN, in an increasingly bitter fight. Over the weekend, Melrose CEO Simon Peckham blasted GKN\u2019s management, telling the Sunday Telegraph that: \u201cGKN has been run by people who don\u2019t have an owner mentality, they have a manager mentality. \u201cIt\u2019s a business that has slowly but surely lost the support of the UK institutional investment community.\u201d Relations between the two companies were already chilly (Melrose\u2019s plan for GKN includes dismissing its management and giving its staff more involvement). Peckham\u2019s intervention, at a time when major shareholders are having to choose who to back, ensures they are now sub-zero. And this morning, Melrose has announced that it has offered to put more money into GKN\u2019s pension scheme -- roughly \u00a31bn over the time it expected to own GKN. It told the City that this proposal is almost twice the amount of the \u00a3528 million deficit reduction package that the trustees recently agreed with GKN. Melrose chairman Christopher Miller says: The proposal we have made to the trustees of up to \u00a31 billion of contributions under our ownership is a clear example of what Melrose does which is good for pensioners and shareholders alike and shows we are a good custodian for all stakeholders. Melrose\u2019s measured approach represents certainty of strategy, value and management. We strongly urge GKN shareholders to accept our offer without delay.\u201d That might assuage some concerns about whether Melrose is a suitable owner for GKN. GKN, though, insists that Melrose\u2019s latest offer (worth around \u00a38bn) is too low. MPs also have concerns, given Melrose\u2019s track record of buying companies and breaking them up to release value. Unions also fear job losses - and are expect to meet with Melrose today. Shareholders have until 29th March to make a decision.... Also coming up today.... Finance ministers from the G20 group of advanced economies are meeting in Argentina today. They\u2019ll be discussing trade, financial stability and cryptocurrencies (among other issues). The economic calendar heats up later this week, with UK inflation and unemployment data, plus interest rate decisions from the Bank of England and the US Federal Reserve. However, today is quieter, apart from some eurozone trade and construction data. The agenda: 10am GMT: Eurozone trade balance for January 10am GMT: Eurozone construction output figures for January All day: G20 finance ministers meet in Buenos Aires",

                "bodyText":"Before we close up for the day, here is a summary of the main developments: Stock markets in Asia fell heavily after China signalled it would retaliate against US tariffs. The Nikkei in Japan closed down 4.5%, while the Hang Seng in Hong Kong closed down 2.5% European markets followed Asia lower, as investors worried about an impending US-China trade war Falls on the FTSE 100 were limited by gains in Next, the index\u2019s top performer despite its declaration that it had faced its toughest period in 25 years. Investors were relieved by a lack of nasty surprises from the retailer MPs published a report demanding tougher rules on night flights before parliament gives Heathrow expansion the go-ahead European leaders gathered in Brussels welcomed the EU\u2019s temporary exemption from tariffs on US imports... ... but Belgium\u2019s prime minister said America\u2019s negotiating stance amounted to \u201ca gun to our heads.\u201d Donald Tusk, President of the European Council, called on the US to make the exemption permanent Back in the UK, Bank of England policymaker Gertjan Vlieghe put households on notice for borrowing costs to rise faster than previously thought over the next few years Wall Street opened slightly higher as investors more calmly digested China\u2019s retaliation against US trade tariffs. The Dow was up 0.4% That\u2019s all from us for today. Thank you for following the blog and for all the comments. Have a good weekend and please join us again on Monday. AM Time for another look at the markets. In the US, the Dow Jones is bucking the trend across global markets and continues to rise. Here are the latest scores on Wall Street: Dow Jones: +0.4% at 24,042 S&amp;P 500: +0.2% at 2,648 And in Europe: FTSE 100: +0.3% at 6,930 Germany\u2019s DAX: -1.3% at 11,946 France\u2019s CAC: -1% at 5,115 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB: -0.5% at 22,277 Spain\u2019s IBEX: -1% at 9,398 Europe\u2019s STOXX 600: -0.6% at 367 Brent crude oil prices have hit $70.03 a barrel, the highest since late January. The rise follows comments from the Saudi energy minister, who said OPEC countries would need to keep co-ordinating supply cuts with non-member countries, including Russia, into 2019. Back to the subject of trade wars... Ana Boata, senior economist at Euler Hermes, the trade credit insurer, has done some number crunching on what the dispute between the US and China might mean: The trade feud between the US and China could lead to potential export losses of $15.7bn. The US\u2019 25% tariff on imports for $60bn Chinese goods might cost China $15bn in export losses, while retaliatory Chinese tariffs on $3bn of US agrifood and steel products could see US exporters lose up to $700m. We expect vehicles and electronics to be next on the target list, while their attentions might also turn to financial services and intellectual property. US markets are slightly up after the opening bell on Wall Street: Dow Jones: +0.3% at 24,029 S&amp;P 500: +0.2% at 2,649 Nasdaq: +0.1% at 7,172 Bank of England rate-setter Gertjan Vlieghe has put households on notice for borrowing costs to rise faster than previously thought over the next few years. Using a speech in Birmingham, the member of the Bank\u2019s monetary policy committee said he saw a need for one or two rate hikes per year over the next few years, in comments likely to be seen as putting the Bank on track for raising the cost of borrowing in May. One of the seven MPC members who voted to leave rates unchanged on Thursday, he said he was increasingly confident that wage growth in Britain was just around the corner. \u201cThe data have shifted further in the direction that warrants a continuation of the removal of monetary stimulus,\u201d he said. Although he warned there was uncertainty about the strength of the economy, particularly as the UK leaves the European Union, Vlieghe said recent surveys and figures from the jobs market had convinced him of the need for higher interest rates. But despite the good news for workers from rising pay, he warned there was also a lower \u201cnew normal\u201d for wage growth, as pay rises are likely to be constrained by poor levels of productivity growth in the UK. The sluggish increase in the efficiency of British workers seen since the financial crisis - which has been poorer than other advanced economies - could mean average annual wage rises worth about 3% per year compared to about 4% previously, he said. Andrew Hunter, US economist at Capital Economics, says the durable goods data suggests business investment is in \u201chealthy shape\u201d. The 3.1% rebound in durable goods orders in February was encouraging, even if that headline figure was boosted by the more volatile transport category. Equipment investment still appears to have slowed in the first quarter overall, but the data suggest that won\u2019t last for long. The 26% in commercial aircraft orders was in line with the stronger orders reported by Boeing last month, while orders for defence aircraft also posted a big rebound. The 1.6% gain in motor vehicle orders was, however, stronger than expected given the recent declines in sales. Overall, business equipment investment still appears to have slowed in the first quarter, probably to between 6% and 8% annualised. But some slowdown appeared inevitable after the double-digit gains in the second half of last year and, in any case, the latest business surveys suggest that the outlook over the coming months remains bright. On a data-light Friday, we\u2019ve just had some stronger-than-expected numbers out of the US. Orders for durable goods - items ranging from kitchen appliances to aircraft that are expected to last three years or more - jumped 3.1% in February, as demand for transport equipment rose by 7.1%. The headline number was expected to come in at 1.5%, and growth of 3.1% followed a 3.5% fall in January, the commerce department said. Orders of non-defence related capital capital goods excluding aircraft - considered a bellwether for business spending plans - rose 1.8% last month. It was the biggest gain in five months and beat expectations of a 0.8% increase. Joseph Stiglitz, the Nobel prize-winning economist, says China can\u2019t be seen to show weakness against a \u201cbully\u201d like President Trump. He told Bloomberg Television in Beijing: Particularly when you have a bully like Trump, it would not be good to respond in a weak way. We know about appeasement from Munich. It\u2019s a different kind of a war but in a trade war, appeasement could lead to more and more demands. Stiglitz, a Columbia University economics professor, said China was in a better position than the US to withstand a trade war: [China is] sitting on $3 trillion of reserves that it can use to help those adversely affected. In the United States we don\u2019t have an economic framework that is able to respond to the particular places that will be affected by a trade war. The fiscal resources of the United States are strained. US futures have reversed earlier losses suggesting Wall Street could open slightly higher. Dow Jones futures are up about 0.1% while S&amp;P futures are up 0.2%. Trevor Greetham at investment company Royal London Asset Management says now could be the time to buy shares. In a note titled \u201cthe Donald dip becomes a Trump slump\u201d, he says: Stock markets have fallen back sharply towards their February lows. While the initial bout of market weakness this year was blamed on rising wage inflation and fears of higher interest rates, this time round it\u2019s in reaction to President Trump\u2019s announcement of a range of tariffs on imports from China. Although equities have taken a battering since the market melt-up at the turn of the year when US corporate tax cuts were the focus, these moves aren\u2019t so unexpected. It\u2019s quite normal for markets to remain edgy for a month or two after such a sharp reversal and a move back towards the initial lows is not surprising. Given this weakness, we\u2019re once again adding to equities and remain overweight stocks in the multi asset funds we manage. It\u2019s noteworthy that commodity markets haven\u2019t reacted particularly badly to the tariffs spat and emerging market equities are outperforming in the sell-off, both signs that global growth remains on track. With profits growing and interest rates still below inflation in major developed economies, the fundamentals and outlook remain positive. Cecilia Malmstrom, the EU\u2019s trade commissioner, has outlined her view on the bloc\u2019s temporary exemption from US tariffs in a series of tweets. The exemption was agreed after Malmstrom travelled to Washington for talks with US trade representative Robert Lighthizer and commerce secretary Wilbur Ross. Over in Brussels, where EU leaders are gathered for talks, positivity over the bloc\u2019s 40-day exemption on tariffs, granted by Washington, appears to be wearing thin. Belgium\u2019s Prime Minister, Charles Michel, said he was not impressed at the suspension of tariffs until 1 May: I have the impression that the US leader wants to negotiate with the European Union by putting a gun to our head. That\u2019s a strange way to negotiate with an ally. Here is our latest market roundup as China reacts to US steel tariffs: Peter Rosenstreich, a trader at Swissquote, the online bank, says markets are overreacting to \u201ctrade war hype\u201d: Markets are overreacting to President Donald Trump\u2019s threats of a trade war. Trump is using the issue for political gain, rather than actual trade repositioning. This will give him a nice bullet point for stump speeches in the 2020 campaign, but he gains little from sparking a full-blown trade conflict. Besides, the World Trade Organization is still in action. Craig Erlam at online trading site Oanda, says investors are concerned that an impending trade war will derail the global economy: For a person who\u2019s been obsessed with stock market gains since his election victory 16 months ago, US President Donald Trump doesn\u2019t appear too concerned about the impact his tariffs are having at the moment. Trump may be prepared to add the European Union to the list of those that are temporarily exempt from the tariffs \u2013 with Canada, Mexico and Australia having been allowed similar exemptions \u2013 but that has barely cushioned the blow for investors. Understandably, the prospect of a trade war between the world\u2019s two largest economies is not particularly desirable for investors. The global economy is finally starting the tick along nicely after a decade of efforts to repair the damage of the global financial crisis and the issues that followed and now we\u2019re potentially having to deal with an entirely self-inflicted and avoidable problem. Losses have widened across European market as investors digest the prospect of a US-China trade war. Here are the latest scores: FTSE 100: -1% at 6,884 Germany\u2019s DAX: -1.9% at 11,877 France\u2019s CAC: -1.9% at 5,068 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB: -1.7% at 22,008 Spain\u2019s IBEX: -1.5% at 9,345 Europe\u2019s STOXX 600: -1.5% at 364 Wall Street is also expected to open down: Dow Jones futures: -0.7% S&amp;P futures: -0.5% Nasdaq futures: -0.9% Donald Tusk, President of the European Council, has called on the US to make permanent the EU\u2019s temporary exemption from steel and aluminium tariffs. He says a good trading relationship between the US and EU is essential for \u201csecurity and prosperity\u201d in both regions: China\u2019s planned retaliation against US tariffs on steel imports includes a potential 25% levy on pork imported from the US. As Bloomberg explains, this would hit the US agricultural sector, particularly in Iowa, a key battleground in the 2016 presidential election: In its initial counterstrike, China announced a 25 percent levy on US pork imports - a heavy blow to Iowa, the top pork-producing state and a political battleground that swung to Trump in 2016 after going for Democrat Barack Obama in the previous two elections. Any hit to agricultural producers\u2019 earnings would be especially painful as falling commodity prices already are hurting rural America. US farm income is forecast to drop 6.7% this year to its lowest level since 2006, according to US department of agriculture estimates that assumed normal trade relations with China. \u201cWere farmers faced with falling prices for the exports and higher prices at home because of the import tariffs, the popularity of the tariffs would diminish quickly,\u201d said Mike Jakeman, a global analyst at the Economist Intelligence Unit. \u201cThis is a high-risk strategy for the U.S. administration and one that is likely to weaken, rather than strengthen, the global economy.\u201d EU leaders meeting in Brussels have welcomed President Trump\u2019s decision to row back on plans to impose tariffs on European steel. Washington said on Thursday tariffs would be suspended for the EU - America\u2019s biggest trading partner - Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, Mexico and South Korea. The tariffs are suspended until 1 May as discussions continue. A spokesman for the French government said this morning: Europe has clearly stated its intention to riposte and enter a trade war ... it\u2019s a good thing that President Trump changed his mind on tariff increases. Germany\u2019s economy minister, Peter Altmaier, said: I am very pleased that we have avoided a situation for the German steel and aluminium industry and its workers, that could have led to great uncertainty. We don\u2019t want further unilateral measures, rather we want sensible agreements. European commissioner Pierre Moscovici kept it simple: This is progress, let\u2019s keep talking. Theresa May has also welcomed the decision. Next is one of Britain\u2019s biggest retailers and the latest results for the year ending January 2018 reflect a tough trading backdrop on the UK\u2019s high streets. Pre-tax profits fell 8% to \u00a3726m, reflecting a 7.9% fall in sales in its shops. The drop was not enough to offset a 9% rise in online sales. Lord Wolfson, chief executive, said it had been an \u201cuncomfortable year\u201d, adding: In many ways 2017 was the most challenging year we have faced for 25 years. A difficult clothing market coincided with self-inflicted product ranging errors and omissions. At the same time, the business has had to manage the costs, systems requirements and opportunities of an accelerating structural shift in spending from retail stores to online. In the end our profits were in line with the forecast we issued in January 2017 and the company goes into the coming year in good financial health. However, investors are not perturbed by the fall in profits, given they were in line with expectations. In the absence of any nasty shocks, Next is now the biggest riser on the FTSE 100, up 3.3% at \u00a347.83. The FTSE 100 has fallen less than expected in early trading, currently down 33 points or 0.5% at 6,919. The losses have been limited by GlaxoSmithKline and Next, which are the top two risers this morning: Shares in the pharma giant GSK are being boosted by the decision to withdraw its interest in buying Pfizer\u2019s consumer healthcare business. GSK had been the favourite to buy the business in a multibillion-pound deal after Reckitt Benckiser pulled out. The rise in Next\u2019s shares follow the publication of its annual results, which show an 8% fall in pre-tax profits. More on that soon. And we\u2019re off... Europe\u2019s main markets have opened down, as predicted: FTSE 100: -0.5% Germany\u2019s DAX: -0.9% France\u2019s CAC: -0.9% Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB: -1.2% Spain\u2019s IBEX: -0.9% Tougher rules should be imposed on night flights and keeping costs down for passengers before parliament approves a third runway at Heathrow. That is the verdict of the transport select committee in a report published overnight. Concerns are centred on the environmental impact of Heathrow expansion, as Lilian Greenwood, the committee\u2019s chair, explains: At present, the draft national policy statement does not guarantee that passengers will be protected from the cost risks associated with the scheme. The secretary of state must set out how airport charges will be held down. She added: Thousands of people across London could be exposed to worse levels of noise, air quality and traffic congestion \u2013 there must be sufficient measures to protect or compensate them. Read our full story on the report: European markets are expected to follow Asia lower when they open in about 20 minutes. Here are the opening calls from traders at the spread-betting firm IG: Jasper Lawler at London Capital Group says the stand-off between the US and China is sending a chill through the markets: Despite Trump claiming that the tariffs would make the US \u201ca much stronger nation\u201d the markets are keenly aware that there will be no winners in a trade war. Worse still, the tit for tat responses that we are now seeing - and can expect to see more of - between the world\u2019s two largest economies, is damaging for their economies and the broader global economy. Good morning if you\u2019re just joining us \u2013 and hello again if you\u2019ve already been reading. It\u2019s been a very busy day so far on the stock and currency markets so here\u2019s a roundup of what\u2019s happened: Fears of a global trade war have intensified after China signalled it would retaliate against US tariffs. Beijing said it didn\u2019t want a trade war and urged the US to pull back from the brink. But it said it wasn\u2019t afraid of one and has drawn up a list of more than 100 US products that it will hit with duties if Donald Trump goes ahead with his tariffs on Chinese steel and aluminium. Stock markets in Asia have fallen sharply. The Nikkei in Japan closed down 4.51% and in Hong Kong and Shanghai, where trading is still going on, the markets are down 3.18% and 3.4%. European markets are set to open down as well with FTSE 100 on course to drop 0.74% Key industrial commodities have been hit as well, with the iron ore futures price down 5% and copper at a three-month low The yen is up as the US dollar continued to slump. The pound rose against the greenback to $1.415. For a roundup here\u2019s our news story: Spreadbetters are forecasting that the FTSE100 will lose about 0.8% when trading starts in London in an hour or so. Bourses are about to open in Europe though, and they too are expected to take a hefty hit. These are the predicted openings: Germany\u2019s DAX -1.6% France\u2019s CAC -1.5% S&amp;P 0.6% The Kospi index in Seoul, South Korea has closed down 3.29%, or 82 points at 2,414. The country has a large export industry and stands to lose out if there is a trade war between the US and China. It\u2019s largest trading partner is China and the US is its second biggest. SE Kim, an employee at a construction company in Seoul, told AP: I\u2019m worried that it would affect the national economy. If the US imposes tariffs on China like that, I think there would be some damage on us in the long term as well. It\u2019s been a pretty rough few days on the financial markets. Facebook\u2019s woes are punishing the tech sector, the US Fed hiked interests rates on Wednesday and the Bank of England rate setters were split 7-2 in favour of keeping rates on hold. Only a matter of time before that changes, many believe. And now the prospect of a trade war. Michael Hewson at CMC Markets says the potential for a big selloff in the tech sector is especially worrying: Investors should be rightly fearful of [the Facebook selloff] given that the tech sector has driven most of the gains in US markets over the past 18 months. A meltdown in this sector has the potential to get very messy indeed, with related ripple out effects. This week\u2019s Fed decision to raise rates and tweak its guidance appears to have cut the rug out further from under the US dollar as policymakers adopted a safety first approach to future rate rise expectations, leaving them unchanged for this year. This appears to have caught markets off balance sending bond yields sharply lower and the US 10 and 2-year spread back towards its previous lows, though some of these declines could also be attributed to concerns about tariffs. It\u2019s worth looking again at the statement from the Chinese commerce ministry earlier today. It said that China did not want a trade war, but it was \u201cnot afraid\u201d of having one. China doesn\u2019t hope to be in a trade war, but is not afraid of engaging in one. China hopes the United States will pull back from the brink, make prudent decisions, and avoid dragging bilateral trade relations to a dangerous place. The interesting thing here is that it does leave a bit of wriggle room so might not necessarily result in an all-out trade war as noted by some of our experts. The memorandum signed by Trump on Thursday allows for a 30-day consultation period that only starts once a list of Chinese goods to be taxed is published. Trump said he views the Chinese as \u201ca friend\u201d, and both sides are in talks so it could be resolved. The commerce industry said China was considering measures in two stages: a 15% hit on 120 US products, including steel pipes, dried fruit and wine worth $977m. China\u2019s list also included close to 80 fruit and nut products. Then it would levy 25% on $1.99bn of pork and recycled aluminium. The market in Tokyo is closed. It finished down 4.51%, or 974 points at 20,617. Masses of reaction from traders so let\u2019s try to roundup some of their comments. Masafumi Yamamoto, chief forex strategist at Mizuho Securities in Tokyo, sounded a slightly optimistic tone to Reuters by saying that US tariffs might not be quite as bad they appear. But then he essentially says it might get worse before it gets better: In the longer run, protectionist policies touted by the United States could be watered down, in turn limiting the negative effect on trade and the global economy. But until the United States makes such concessions, global stocks will be under pressure and the yen will appreciate, especially if China decides to confront the U.S. measures. Similarly, Vishnu Varathan of Mizuho Bank is quoted by Associated Press saying: Beijing is extending an olive branch and urging the U.S. to resolve trade disputes through dialogue rather than tariffs. Nevertheless, the first volley of shots and retaliatory response has been set off. Paul Eitelman, senior investment strategist at Russell Investments, tells Bloomberg: It\u2019s a significant step in escalation in trade tensions between the US and China. The biggest watchpoint from here is how China responds to this and any potential escalation that creates going forward. The Australian benchmark index, the ASX200, has closed down almost 2%. The big miners, such as BHP and Rio Tinto, were among the biggest losers amid concern that demand for the country\u2019s biggest export \u2013 iron ore \u2013 will be hurt by the tariffs. Elsewhere it\u2019s an even grimmer picture. In Tokyo the Nikkei is off a whopping 4.58%. The yen has risen as invesors seek a safe haven, but that\u2019s bad news for Japan\u2019s exporters, hence the big drop in equities. Australia fears it could be hit by steel tariffs after it emerged that an exemption promised by Donald Trump would run on 1 May.
