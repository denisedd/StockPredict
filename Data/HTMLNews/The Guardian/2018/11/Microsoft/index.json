morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business.</strong></p> <p>Japanese carmaker Nissan is reeling today after its chairman Carlos Ghosn was dramatically detained by prosecutors for allegedly under-reporting his salary and misusing the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s assets.</p> <p>Shares in Nissan have plunged in heavy trading in

                "bodyText":"The closing bell has rung out on the New York stock exchange, and we can see the damage: The Dow Jones industrial average closed down 555 points, or 2.2%, at 24,462.32 The S&amp;P 500 lost 49 points or 1.8% to end at 2,641.63 The Nasdaq shed 117 points, or 1.67%, to end at 6,911 Retail, energy and technology stocks all played their part in the selloff. Retailers were hurt by weak results from Target, while the 6% drop in the crude oil price dragged energy producers down. Goodnight. GW The tech-focused Nasdaq index is down 1.6% in late trading. The Dow is now flirting with a 600-point loss, down 2.3% today. Apple is now down 4.8%, as the tech selloff gathers pace. Microsoft has lost 3.1%, as has construction equipment maker Caterpillar. More reaction to today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s losses: With barely an hour\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trading to go, Wall Street is bobbing listlessly in the red. The Dow is currently down 529 points, or 2.2%, at 24,487. Many analysts are suggesting that Wall Street is entering a bear market, but David Kelly, chief global strategist for JPMorgan Funds, doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t agree. He reckons we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re going through a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153very normal\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd correction. Kelly don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think America is heading for recession, as the slowdown in the economy, and the trouble in the market, will deter the Federal Reserve from raising interest rates. It may also encourage the White House to stop the trade war with China too. Mohamed El-Erian of investment group Allianz believes Donald Trump has helped push the oil price down today. A little while ago, the US president offered Saudi Arabia some support over the brutal murder of Jamal Khashoggi last month. Trump also questioned whether crown prince Mohammed bin Salman knew about the killing -- despite the CIA concluding that he ordered it. Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s intervention will infuriate those pushing for justice for Khashoggi, but it also cuts the chances that Saudi Arabia hit back at the US by slashing oil production (thus the drop in the oil price). Jim Cramer of CNBC reckons the selloff is partly due to margin calls - demands for investors to put up money to cover losses. That can often trigger further selling, if investors need to find the cash to hold those existing positions. Oil is also suffering from fears that the US-China trade war will escalate. Hopes are fading that US president Donald Trump and Chinese president Xi Jinping could make a breakthrough at the G20 meeting at the end of November. Last weekend, US vice-president Mike Pence and Xi swapped barbs at a summit of Asia-Pacific leaders. Ashley Kelty, oil and gas research analyst at Cantor Fitzgerald Europe, says this has worried the markets: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153In terms of the collapse today, the wider selloff in equities \u00e2\u20ac\u201c sparked by weak retail and tech performance - has further exacerbated fears of weakening global demand amid a weaker economy and the spectre of escalations in the US-Sino trade war. The hopes that the US and China may be closer to a rapprochement were dashed at the APEC summit at the weekend, with expectations growing that a deal will not be struck at the G20 later this month, and subsequently new tariffs will be applied in the New Year. Rising US crude inventories are also pushing crude prices down, Kelty adds, even though oil producers have hinted at production cuts soon. While the news that OPEC+ said it would cut 1.4 million barrels of oil per day from production, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s looking likely that the cuts will have to be deeper in order to stabilise the price. We would anticipate further weakness until the reaction from OPEC+ and the G20 summit is clearer.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The oil price has now slid by over 5% today, thanks to oversupply fears and worries about slowing economic growth (which equals less demand). Brent crude has dropped to just $63.23 per barrel, a drop of over $3 per barrel today. Fiona Cincotta, senior market analyst at City Index, points out this takes oil deeper into a bear market (more than 20% off its recent peak). Fears of slowing global growth are fuelling concerns over global demand, just at a time when Saudi Arabia, Russia and the US continue to ramp up production The most recent Baker Hughes rig count increased by 2 last week, taking the number of rigs to 888, the highest number since March 2015. With oil trading heavily lower, the energy sector pipped tech stocks as the worst performer on the S&amp;P. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our news story on today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Wall Street wobbles: Every stock on the Dow is in the red today, as the gloom sweeps across trading floors. Apple is the biggest faller, down 3.7%, followed by Goldman Sachs (-3.2%) and Microsoft (-2.6%). Energy stocks are also dropping, tracking the lower oil price today. Chevron is down 2.5%. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no cheer on Wall Street this afternoon. The Dow is still deep in the red, down 439 points at 24,577, a drop of 1.7%. The S&amp;P 500 is down 1.4%, while the Nasdaq has lost 1.26% - dragged down by Apple, amid ongoing worries about iPhone sales. In London, the FTSE 100 has closed 53 points lower at 6948 points, down 0.75%. Other European markets were worse hit; Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s DAX lost 1.6% and France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s CAC finished 1.2% lower. A cocktail of worries are hitting stocks, as US investors take cover ahead of Thanksgiving. Fears over global growth, trade disputes, and the prospect of higher interest rates are all factors. Marketwatch explains: These doubts have accumulated to induce fears that we are growing nearer to the end of the current economic expansion, strategists say. Investors are particularly gloomy about technology companies. Tech stocks extended a decline that led the market lower Monday, with reports from China adding fuel to the day\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s selling after officials in Beijing uncovered widespread evidence of anticompetitive behavior by Korean rivals. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rout has dragged the US stock market back to its October lows, and rattled Europe too. Connor Campbell of SpreadEx says: As a taster of the alarming tech trouble, Apple was down 4.6%, tumbling to a near 7 month low of $177 having been at $230 around 7 weeks ago; Microsoft fell by the same amount, with their Dow sibling Alphabet slipping 2.2%. Investors are concerned that sooner rather than later the sector is going to be fully embroiled in the US-China trade battle, exacerbating the softness caused by reports of a slowdown in iPhone demand. Obviously this caused the already moody European indices to have a fit. The CAC found itself the wrong side of 4900 as it lost 1.6%, with the DAX hitting a near 2 year nadir after dropping 200 points. The FTSE, meanwhile, slid 90 points, slumping back towards the 6900 lows seen during October\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s nightmare. Ouch! Wall Street has opened with heavy losses. The Dow has tumbled by 586 points, down to 24,430, erasing its gains for this year. Tech stocks are getting hit again, with Apple down 4.5%. Retailer Target is down 10% after posting disappointing results today. European stock markets are generally in retreat today, as traders worry about economic growth prospects, the US-China trade war, and Brexit. In London, the FTSE 100 has shed around 0.7%, while Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s DAX has dropped by around 1.5% to a two-year low. With the oil price down 2%, and Bitcoin sliding, there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no shortage of nervousness in the markets. Fawad Razaqzada, market analyst at Forex.com, says: With equities (and cryptocurrencies) tumbling, volatility is clearly there, even if this week will be a quieter one for economic data. But can volatility remain elevated, especially towards the end of the week with the Thanksgiving holiday being observed on Thursday in the US (and on Friday in Japan)? Clearly some market participants would rather enjoy a long holiday break and await better opportunities next week. However, this time it may be different, and traders may actually hang around as volatility has not been at these elevated levels for prolonged periods in a while. Mark Carney refused to be drawn today on whether interest rates might rise or fall after Brexit, saying it all depends on the outcome. But Professor Costas Milas of Liverpool University argues that borrowing costs are unlikely to rise in 2019, due to its habit of under-estimating UK inflation. Professor Milas explains: The BoE targets inflation 2 years into the future. Look at the attached plot where I put together: (a) the Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 2-year inflation forecast based on constant interest rates, (b) the Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 2-year inflation forecast based on market expectations of interest rates and (c) the actual inflation outcome. Unfortunately, both forecasts move in opposite direction to the actual outcome (correlation is negative) which is a real worry. Nevertheless, under constant interest rates, the Bank has under-predicted CPI inflation by an annual average of 0.38%. Under market expectations of interest rates, however, the Bank has under-predicted CPI inflation by much more, that is, by an annual average of 0.54%. This is telling me that with/without hard-Brexit, it is more likely than not that the policy rate will remain at 0.75% in the next 2 years. Concerns over Brexit might be assuaged by the latest healthcheck on UK manufacturing. British factory orders bounced back in November after falling sharply in October, according to the CBI\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s monthly survey. The balance of companies reporting above-average order books, rather than weaker, rose to +10 this month, up from -6 in October. That suggest UK goods are still in demand, despite the uncertainty over trading conditions after Brexit. Rain Newton-Smith, CBI Chief Economist, warns that UK firms still need the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153right\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Brexit deal: The overwhelming message from business to the Government is to make progress, don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t go backwards. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We need frictionless trade for our world-beating manufactured goods and a transition period which draws us back from the cliff edge. Anything less than that and jobs and investment could suffer.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd In other news, cryptocurrencies are having a bad day, again. Bitcoin has slumped by around 7% to below $4,500 - a blow to anyone who piled in when it was \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcworth\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 almost $20,000 last December. Naeem Aslam of Think Markets blames the recent trend of \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcforking\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 cryptocurrencies into competing flavours, and the threat that regulators clamp down on \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcinitial coin offerings\u00e2\u20ac\u2122: Fundamentally speaking, the current sell-off is due to two main reasons; regulatory pressure and disagreement within the coin developer community, one of the biggest threats. The SEC reminded the crypto world that it has the final say over anything that smells like a security. The department issued civil penalties against two cryptocurrency companies because they failed to register initial coin offerings as securities. Investors will be given their refund and the firms will have to face fines. The fear is that the SEC may not stop here and might take similar action against several companies that adopted a similar path. The community needs to stick together and work towards a more meaningful fork. This is because, developers, on the one hand, try to convince the world that the supply is limited and, on the other hand, they keep looking at ways of triggering another kind of forks. Forking has become so common that it puts at risk the notion of limited supply altogether. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hearing showed that the Bank of England remains very worried about a no-deal Brexit, says Hinesh Patel, portfolio manager at Quilter Investors. Patel explains this would leave the Bank \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcbetween a rock and a hard place\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, with falling demand and rising inflation to balance. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153From the Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s perspective the biggest concern above all else is the threat of a disorderly Brexit. A tumultuous departure would leave the Bank in the impossible position of trying to manage the risk of rising imported inflation if the pound were to fall further, while also trying to create conditions that are supportive of growth through a difficult period for the economy. The Bank has been really clear and consistent in pointing out its view that Brexit uncertainty has stunted business investment, a key driver of growth. Therefore in the event of a disorderly Brexit, Carney and his colleagues would likely anticipate a further shrinkage in business investment and would be tempted to respond with stimulus, but that in turn makes it difficult for them to keep inflation down. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s why Mark Carney felt free to welcome Theresa May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s plan, as a transition deal would remove some of the unpredictable risks facing the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economic and financial system.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The committee hearing is over, so here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a quick recap. Bank of England governor Mark Carney has given Theresa May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s draft Brexit deal his backing. Speaking to the Treasury Committee this morning, Carney argued that a transition agreement would provide stability and confidence, and would be better for economic growth than the alternatives. Carney said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We have emphasised from the start the importance of having some transition between the current arrangements and the ultimate arrangements. So we welcome the transition arrangements in the withdrawal agreement ... and take note of the possibility of extending that transition period.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd This isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t a great surprise, of course; the Bank has long been warning that Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy would suffer from a hard break with the EU. But the timing is significant, just days before EU leaders decide whether to back the plan, teeing up a vote in Parliament before Christmas. MPs demanded to know whether the Bank was more likely to riase, or lower, interest rate if Britain left the EU without a deal. Carney, though, refused to commit, saying: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This would be a very unusual situation. It is very rare to see a large negative supply shock in an advanced economy. You would have to stretch back at least in our analysis until the 1970s to find analogies.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Bank policymakers also warned that UK firms aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t ready for Britain to crash out without a deal or a transition agreement. Chief economist Andy Haldane said that firms are increasingly worried about a no-deal Brexit. This is now hurting investment, and likely to drag on growth this quarter. Michael Saunders, an external member of its Monetary Policy Committee, said that few businesses have drawn up contingency plans; it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also too late for many to make plans before 29th March 2019. Deputy governor Sir Jon Cunliffe told the committee that the Bank would ensure that Britain didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t suffer a financial meltdown, as we saw in 2008. However, the big decision on Brexit must be taken by MPs, not the Bank. Saunders also warned that the Bank doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have the tools to magically fix the problems caused by a no-deal Brexit: If you have queues at Dover, the answer is not lower interest rates. Andy Haldane then gives a pithy explanation of Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s productivity crisis. He says that Britain has a longer tail of unproductive firms than other advanced economies. This has become worse since the financial crisis, such that even relatively productive firms in the second decile (the top 10%-19%) have been dragged down. Firms that were once the dog have joined the tail, Haldane says, to some laughter. Haldane does love a canine metaphor - in 2012, he compared setting financial regulation to a dog pursuing a frisbee. Q: Given all the talk about a no-deal Brexit, would it really be a shock if it happened? Mark Carney says there has been an expectation since the referendum that there won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be a disorderly Brexit. The fact is that a substantial proportion of companies, in a wide range of sectors, don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have contingency plans for a hard Brexit next spring. Onto wages, and the impact of migration on pay growth. Bank officials says earnings growth has firmed in recent months, over 3% per year. Michael Saunders argues that migration has been a source of growth, as workers coming into the UK have been better educated (on average) and brought skills that businesses need. A drop in inward migration would mean lower potential growth, and could mean lower actual growth too from lower consumer spending and a lack of staff, he warns. Q: But isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t there also a link between falling migration and recent pay growth? Pay is rising because the labour market is tight, Saunders insists. On business investment, BoE governor Mark Carney says he believes there is more downside risk from a no-deal Brexit than upside risk from a smooth deal. BoE chief economy Andy Haldane agrees, but also argues that the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153investment fundamentals\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd are bright for many companies. The potential return on investment is in low-double digits, while the cost of Capex is 2-3%, he explained. Q: Do businesses have enough time to put credible Brexit contingency plans in place? BoE committee member Michael Saunders says financial firms have done a lot of work already. But non-financial firms are very uncertain how they should prepare, and unwilling to spend large amounts on things that turn out to be unnecessarily. He doubts whether contingency plans could now be drawn up in time. The risk of a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcno deal\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Brexit is uncomfortably high, Carney says -- reiterating a point he made in August. Q: What is the long-term impact of a no-deal Brexit? Carney says that short-term supply disruption includes queues at Dover, people being confused about how the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153grandfathering\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd of contracts works. The Bank must distinguish between that, and long-term issues such as impact on demand, and labour supply. Mary Carney is now taking more questions about a no-deal outcome. The Bank needs to be in a position to support the UK if we ended up with no deal and no transition, by design or by accident, the governor says. He warns that some workers and capital could be \u00e2\u20ac\u0153stranded\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. There would also be an \u00e2\u20ac\u0153economic shock\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in Europe, particularly in Ireland, he adds - this wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t just be a problem for the UK. Carney also agrees with Michael Saunders\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 earlier point; most businesses haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t got contingency plans for no-deal Brexit. The main news line from today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hearing is that Bank of England governor Mark Carney has backed the Brexit deal unveiled by Theresa May last week. Carney told the Treasury committee that: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We have emphasized from the start the importance of having some transition between the current arrangements and the ultimate arrangements. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153So we welcome the transition arrangements in the withdrawal agreement ... and take note of the possibility of extending that transition period.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Carney also declared that this should \u00e2\u20ac\u0153support economic outcomes\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd; ie, avoiding the disruption and uncertainty of a no-deal Brexit. He also told MPs that the Bank will provide its assessment of the proposal, and a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcno deal\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 outcome next week. However, it will not include the option of staying in the EU (something Theresa May said was possible last week). Carney explained: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re not intending to look at providing additional analysis on the third scenario which is no Brexit at all.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Q: Won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t extending the transition period push up the cost of the Brexit divorce bill (from its current \u00c2\u00a339bn)? Mark Carney notes that any extra cost should be weighed against the economic benefits. Q: Would a longer transition provide businesses with enough confidence to invest? Business investment has been falling for several quarters, he replies. An agreement with transition, and with some expectation of a deep economic partnership in the fullness of time, would provide more clarity for business..and one would expect that to support investment over time, he adds. Q: The [Brexit] text agreement suggests that the transition agreement could be extended until 20xx. Does that concern you, governor? It narrows it down, replies Mark Carney wryly. He then explains that this highlights just how long it would take to negotiate all the aspects of the economic partnership, and implement it. Monetary Policy Committee member Michael Saunders then reiterates his warning about a no-deal Brexit: Most businesses are not prepared for a no-deal Brexit, and don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know really how to prepare. Over the last month or two, as the risk of a no-deal outcome has become more visible, we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve seen business confidence weaken and rising uncertainty. And that may have a some negative effect on near-term economic activity. Deputy governor Sir Jon Cunliffe warns MPs that the Bank of England can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t solve Brexit for them. Cunliffe tells the Treasury Committee: It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not for us to say which is the right outcome. Parliament and government will take that forward. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our job to be prepared for the worst,...and to provide parliament with information relevant to our mandate that is useful. Whatever the outcomes, people in the UK can have assurance that they won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t see a financial sector meltdown of the sort as they say in 2008. That means people can have \u00e2\u20ac\u0153trust in the institution doing its job\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, and delivering its inflation, Cunliffe explains, concluding: But how the outcomes will play out, and the choices, are down to parliament and government. Mark Carney reminds the committee that the Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economic forecasts have a range of outcomes -- and the upper end of those forecasts are based on the economy looking somewhat similar to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the status quo\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd after Brexit. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s another hint that Theresa May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s deal is better than a no-deal outcome. Rushnara Ali MP takes up the questioning, and accidentally calls Mark Carney \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcchancellor\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 rather than \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcgovernor\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. She then asks whether Britain is stuck between \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a rock and a hard place\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd when choosing between Theresa May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s deal and a no-deal Brexit. Carney doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t \u00e2\u20ac\u0153subscribe to that characterisation\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Instead, he says there is value in the PM\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s transition deal, all depending on what the UK is actually transitioning too. That means the political declaration about the final arrangement is very important. Q: Will interest rates be higher or lower after a no-deal Brexit? Honestly, it all depends, Mark Carney reiterates. Specifically, on whether it is more of a shock to demand (which might merit a stimulus from lower borrowing costs), or to supply (which could be inflationary, requiring higher rates) Carney explains that no-deal Brexit would be a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153real economy shock\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Central banks have a role, but they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re on a sidelines, he adds. BoE committee member Michael Saunders then weighs in, warning that moving to WTO rules quickly (if Britain left without a deal) would be a major supply shock. If you have queues at Dover, the answer is not lower interest rates. So you can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t assume that the Bank would cut interest rates, as it did in 2016 after the referendum. Q: If Britain leaves the EU without a deal, will the Bank boost its stimulus programme (to support the market) or raise interest rates (to support the pound)? It depends, Carney replies. There are very few previous examples of an advanced economy suffering a big supply shock, so the Bank doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have much evidence to go on. Charlie Elphicke MP asks Mark Carney about last week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s cabinet meeting on Brexit. Elphicke says that the pound jumped after Theresa May announced she had cabinet backing for her plan, but plunged the next morning when Brexit secretary Doninic Raab resigned. Elphicke claims that Raab had told the chief whip of his plans that night -- so shouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t this information have been immediately released, as it was market sensitive? Carney points out that sterling volatility is already very high, showing that investors expect plenty of Brexit drama. He believes May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s statement was appropriate. Political resignations aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t quite the same as corporate ones, he continues. The important thing is that anyone who has inside knowledge of events (such as Raab\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s plans) don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t trade on them. Q: Governor, do you still believe that a no-deal Brexit is unlikely? We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll find out relatively soon, Mark Carney grins. He explains that the Bank has been preparing for such an outcome since June 2016, to protect financial stability. So even if it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a very low probability, the financial stability committee has been getting ready. The Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chief economist, Andy Haldane, then warns that Brexit uncertainty is causing more economic damage. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We are seeing somewhat greater impact, particularly on the behaviour of companies,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd says Haldane. That means growth will probably be \u00e2\u20ac\u0153somewhat weaker\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in the fourth quarter of 2018, compared to the previous quarter (when growth rose to 0.6%). The Treasury committee begins the hearing by asking the Bank of England about Theresa May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s draft Brexit withdrawal agreement. Governor Mark Carney reminds MPs that the Bank has emphasised the important of a transition deal after Britain leaves the EU. He believes the withdrawal agreement would \u00e2\u20ac\u0153support economic outcomes\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd -- central banker speak for \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcgood for the economy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 (at least compared to other outcomes...) Q: Will your advice to parliament (due next week) look at three scenarios -- the PM\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s deal, no deal, and no Brexit? Carney says he wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t planning to provide additional advice on the idea that Brexit will not happen. Instead, the Bank will examine the withdrawal agreement, versus a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcno deal\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 outcome. This assessment will include the political declaration on the likely eventual relationship between the UK and EU \u00e2\u20ac\u0153as far as it can\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, the governor adds. Over in parliament, the Treasury Committee have begun quizzing the Bank of England. In the hot seats, we have: Dr Mark Carney, Governor of the Bank of England, Sir Jon Cunliffe, Deputy Governor for Financial Stability, Bank of England, Andy Haldane, Chief Economist and Executive Director, Monetary Analysis &amp; Statistics, Michael Saunders, Member of the Monetary Policy Committee, Bank of England Back in the UK, the Bank of England has announced it will publish its assessment of the monetary and financial effects of Theresa May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s draft withdrawal agreement for Brexit next week. This will give MPs the chance to read and digest the BoE\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s views, before they vote on the deal. It will include a comparison with a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153no deal, no transition\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd scenario. Given the Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s well-publicised views on Brexit, we can safely assume that it will conclude that May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s deal is better than a disorderly exit from the EU. The report, alongside the Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s latest stress test, will be published on Wednesday November 28th. Carlos Ghosn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s arrest is an early test of Japan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new plea-bargaining system, brought in this year to target corporate wrong-doing. Under these rules, potential suspects can negotiate deals with prosecutors in exchange for information on another party. On Monday, Nissan explained that a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcwhistle-blower\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 had brought Ghosn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s misconduct to light, but didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t give more details. According to the Asahi newspaper, this referred to a company employee gave prosecutors information on Ghosn in return for lighter treatment. Deutsche Bank analysts have warned there is a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153high likelihood\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd that Carlos Ghosn will lose his leadership role at Renault (where he is CEO and chairman), plus the chairmanships of Nissan and Mitsubishi. Forbes reports that Carlos Ghosn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ex-wife, Rita, has also weighed in: A scandal that brings down powerful people like Ghosn brings with it catcalls from people they have left in their wake. Ghosn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ex-wife, Rita Ghosn, posted this message to social media on Monday: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153All narcissists are hypocrites. They pretend to have morals and values that they really don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t possess. Behind closed doors, they lie, insult, criticize, disrespect and abuse. They can do and say whatever they want, but how dare you say anything back to them or criticize them. They have a whole set of rules for others, but follow none of their own rules, and practice nothing of what they preach.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Rita and Carlos Ghosn have four children, all now grown-up. Following the couple\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s split, Carlos married his second wife Carole in 2016 - a union celebrated with a party at Versailles. My colleague Nils Pratley predicts that Ghosn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s arrest will trigger an almighty battle between Japan and France for control of the Nissan-Renault-Mitsubishi alliance. He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also struck by Nissan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s willingness to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153trash\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Ghosn, as if he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d already been found guilty in the courts.... They do corporate scandals differently in Japan. The downfall of Carlos Ghosn over alleged under-statement of income and \u00e2\u20ac\u0153numerous\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd acts of misconduct was spectacular in its own right, but the accompanying press conference by Nissan chief executive Hiroto Saikawa was an event in itself. Saikawa did not merely report the allegations against his chairman, which is what you might expect on day one in equivalent circumstances at a European and US company. He also trashed Ghosn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s legacy, criticised his decision-making and speculated as to how the alleged misdeeds could have happened. That content would normally be reserved for the full corporate post-mortem, or at least until the legal process had run its course. More here: More details of the allegations against Carlos Ghosn have emerged today. Public broadcaster NHK reported that Nissan paid \u00e2\u20ac\u0153huge sums\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to buy luxury houses for Ghosn in four cities around the globe. The properties, in Rio de Janeiro, Beirut, Paris and Amsterdam, were acquired \u00e2\u20ac\u0153without any legitimate business reason\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, it claimed. NHK also reported that Ghosn received some compensation due to other executives (it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not clear how this could have happened, though). More developments: Mitsubishi will hold a board meeting next week to decide whether to dismiss Ghosn as chairman. [reminder: Mitsubishi is partly owned by Nissan, making it the smallest member of Ghosn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s auto alliance]. Newsflash: Renault says it will hold a board meeting later today to discuss the situation. Just in: France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s finance minister has declared that Carlos Ghosn is no longer currently fit to lead Renault. Speaking on French radio, Bruno Le Maire also called for Renault to set up an interim management structure, following Ghosn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s detention in Japan. He told France Info Radio that: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Carlos Ghosn is no longer in a position where he is capable of leading Renault.... Renault has been weakened, which make it all the more necessary to act quickly.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Le Maire\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s intervention is significant as the French government owns a 15% sake in Renault. Le Maire also said he had asked French tax authorities to examine Ghosn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s affairs and that they had found nothing of particular note (thanks to Reuters for the quotes!) Renault\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s share price has dropped 3.3% at the start of trading in Paris, adding to yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 8% slide. Traders are worried that its alliance with Nissan could be threatened by Ghosn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s anticipated dismissal from the Japanese carmaker. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s selloff has driven Nissan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s share price down to its lowest level since July 2016. As you can see, it was already trading at a two-year low before Carlos Ghosn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shock arrest: Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Japanese carmaker Nissan is reeling today after its chairman Carlos Ghosn was dramatically detained by prosecutors for allegedly under-reporting his salary and misusing the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s assets. Shares in Nissan have plunged in heavy trading in Tokyo, ending down almost 5.5%, as the Japanese capital was gripped by Ghosn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s dramatic fall from grace. This pulled the Nikkei down to a three-week low. Staff at Nissan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s HQ in Yokohama are also in shock, after hearing that their board plans to dismiss Ghosn on Thursday for \u00e2\u20ac\u0153serious misconduct\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. At a gripping press conference late on Monday night, Nissan CEO Hiroto Saikawa, laid into Ghosn, saying: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I feel a strong sense of indignation and despair.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Astonishingly, Saikawa said he hadn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t decided whether Ghosn was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a charismatic figure or a tyrant\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, adding critically: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I have to say that this is a dark side of the Ghosn era which lasted for a long time.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Earlier today, Japan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s prosecutors confirmed that they are investigating whether Ghosn and Representative Director Greg Kelly conspired to understate Ghosn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s compensation over five years starting in fiscal 2010 - as Nissan claim. The pair are accused of only reporting half of Ghosn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s true salary, of almost 10 billion yen (\u00c2\u00a369m) over the period. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a shocking development, which threatens the whole future of the Nissan-Renault-Mitsubishi alliance created and led by Ghosn over many years. Renault\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shares slumped to a three-year low on Monday, and may be under further pressure today. But the dramatic turn of events has also left some observers wondering if Ghosn is being unceremoniously shoved out of the door (and into the hands of the authorities) in a palace-style coup. Also coming up today MPs will be quizzing top officials from the Bank of England on the state of the UK economy this morning. Governor Mark Carney can also expect fresh questions about the Brexit negotiations, as Theresa May strives to get her draft deal past MPs. Michael Hewson of CMC Markets suspects Carney would rather not be probed about Brexit issues at such a sensitive time. At such a politically sensitive moment Bank of England Governor Mark Carney is probably cursing the fact that he will have to not only answer questions on the central bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s outlook for the UK economy to the Treasury Select Committee later this morning, but he will also probably find himself dragged into the cross hairs of the current merits of the deal that the Prime Minister has cooked up with the EU, against the risks of leaving without a deal. His answers will inevitably invite scrutiny from both sides of the political divide.

Government borrowing of \u00c2\u00a38.8bn last month (consensus \u00c2\u00a36.2bn, CE \u00c2\u00a37.0bn) was up from \u00c2\u00a37.2bn in the same month last year and marked the largest October deficit for three years.

This leaves borrowing in the fiscal year to date down by 30% compared to last year. While this is still the lowest since 2005, it is above the OBR\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s October Budget forecast for a 36% reduction over the year as a whole.</p> <p>This could be a worrying sign for the Chancellor. If this trend continues, the giveaways in the October Budget could see him breach his near-term fiscal targets.

The expectation that a Brexit \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcbounce\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 would deliver a spike in business and investment following an agreed deal gave the Chancellor the room to put off the hard decision on putting up taxes.

Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE 100 has gained 102 points or 1.5% to 7050, while Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB jumped 1.4%. Trade wars, Brexit and the Italian budget row remain unsolved, of course, but they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re not weighing on stocks quite as heavily. Bart Hordijk, Market Analyst at Monex Europe, suspects the Italian budget row will bubble on into 2019: \u00e2\u20ac\ufffdThe fact that there are no easy compromises for both parties involved is for us an indicator that this conflict will continue to simmer in the background for the coming months.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd A mass of US economic data has landed on the markets, ahead of tomorrow\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Thanksgiving break. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve just learned that: US home sales rose slightly in October, by 1.4%. That end a six-month run of declines, but the annual rate (5.22m per year) is still lower than this time last year. Orders for durable goods sank by 4.4% in October, the biggest drop since July 2017. It was mainly due to weaker demand for aircraft (a volatile factor) The number of Americans signing on for unemployment benefit rose to 224,000 last week, a four-month high (but still low in historical terms) US consumer confidence has dropped; the University of Michigan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s morale index fell to 97.5 this month, down from 98.3, and weaker than expected. All in all, a fairly underwhelming picture. DING DING! Trading is underway in New York, as traders return to the fray after Tuesday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s turmoil. And shares are rising in early trading; the Dow has gained 160 points or 0.6% to 24,625 points. That takes a small chunk out of yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 550-point tumble. Technology shares are among the risers, with Apple up 1.5%. It could be a calmer session, as traders get ready for tomorrow\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Thanksgiving festivities. A top bond expert reckons there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a small chance that Italy ends up defaulting on its debts. PIMCO\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chief investment officer for global fixed income, Andrew Balls (brother of former-politician-and-occasional-dancer Ed) also suggested that Rome could issue a parallel currency, or even return to the lira. Reuters has more details: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Italian sovereign default is unlikely but it is not a zero probability. The more plausible scenario is a combination of issuing a parallel currency or even redenomination,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Balls said at a conference in London. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153California issued a parallel currency in 2008 so if it could happen there it is not obvious it couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t happen in Italy.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Short-term Italian debt is also strengthening, presumably on hopes of an eventual resolution between Italy and Brussels. If Italy refuses to cut its spending plans, it could ultimately be fined 0.5% of its GDP. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the end of a long process, though, as this chart shows: Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s GDP in 2017 was around \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.7trillion, so a fine could reach almost \u00e2\u201a\u00ac8bn. Readers may well wonder how that would improve Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fiscal position. Deputy PM Matteo Salvini has declared he is ready to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153confront Juncker, Moscovici or whoever\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd over Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s budget plans. The leader of the right-wing League party defended the proposals, saying they would deliver growth, and thus eventually cut Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s mountain of debt. Salvini says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Over five years the debt increased by \u00e2\u201a\u00ac300 billion on the basis of budgets that some applauded. If the country doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t grow, then the debt goes up, if it grows, it goes down.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd He also called on Europe to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153respect the Italian people\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, adding on Twitter: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6since we pay at least 5 billion more than what comes back. Job rights, healthcare and education rights, less taxes and more security: we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re moving forward!\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Meanwhile, Antonio Tajani, president of the European parliament and vice-president of Forza Italia, the centre-right party led by Silvio Berlusconi, Salvin\u00c3\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s coalition partner before general elections in March, said he is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153very worried\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd about the commission\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s assessment of the budget. Tajani says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153In addition to violating the rules, the budget does not stimulate growth or investment. We are isolated, the spread [between German and Italian bonds\u00e2\u20ac\u2122] is firmly above 300 points, the stock exchange is at its lowest since 2016, we have already lost \u00e2\u201a\u00ac300 billion, and the mistrust among entrepreneurs is growing.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s little reaction to the EC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rejection of Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s budget in the markets. Italian bonds are holding onto their earlier gains (driven by hopes of a compromise), meaning 10-year debt is trading at a yield of 3.52% (from 3.6%). Hinesh Patel, portfolio manager at Quilter Investors, says investors expect a reconciliation: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153In some respects this is a win for the populists, who will use this decision to fuel criticism of the EU policymakers they cast as the enemy of the Italian electorate. But Italy is at risk of divorcing itself from economic realities if it presses ahead despite this ruling from the European Commission. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The immediate reaction from markets suggests that reconciliation is expected. Although Italian bond yields have been increasing for several months, a clear signal that the bond market\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s confidence in Italy is fragile. The result is that the government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ability to borrow diminishes and the credit they can obtain comes at a higher cost. This is a crucial factor when you consider that the bumper budget intended to stimulate the economy will require increased government borrowing. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Despite the nervousness this stand-off may cause in financial markets, it is worth remembering that the European Commission has these controls and governance capabilities over member states for a reason. At the height of the European sovereign debt crisis 24 countries were under Excessive deficit procedures, a burden which France, for instance, has only just been able to shake off. While it is a surprise that we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve reached this impasse, the European Commission is ultimately just delivering on its mandate.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The head of Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s coalition government, prime minister Giuseppe Conte, has hit back. Conte insists that his country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u0153excellent\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd budget should go ahead, and hope to persuade the EC of his case this weekend. Reuters has the details: The Italian government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 2019 budget is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153excellent\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and in the interests of both Italy and Europe, Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said on Wednesday. Earlier in the day the European Commission took its first step towards disciplining Italy over the budget, setting up a confrontation that could last months and eventually lead to fines. Conte reiterated he would hold talks with European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker on Saturday. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Obviously during the course of the conversation we will finally have the chance to talk in detail and fully explain this budget,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said. Analyst Emanuele Canegrati of City trading firm BP Prime says the EC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ruling is blow to Italy (although not an unexpected one...) Danske Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Aila Mihr points out that European ministers will have their say next month: The FT\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Mehreen Khan reckons the EC pulled its punches today, and any knock-out blow probably won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t come for some months: EC Vice-President Valdis Dombrovskis has told reporters in Brussels that the Commission had no choice... \u00e2\u20ac\u0153With regret, that today we confirm our assessment that Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s draft budget plan is in particularly serious non-compliance with the Council recommendation of 13 July.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We conclude that the opening of a procedure for excessive deficit based on the debt is thus warranted.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd European commissioner Pierre Moscovici says the door is still open for Italy to change it budget plans to meet EC rules.... NEWSFLASH: The European Commission has again rejected Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s draft budget for 2019. In an escalation of the row between Brussels and Rome, the EC has ruled that Rome has \u00e2\u20ac\u0153seriously violated\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd debt rules, and will begin disciplinary procedures. Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s populist government has refused to succumb to pressure to change its deficit target of 2.4% of GDP as it seeks to move forward with election campaign promises, such as introducing a universal basic income, cutting taxes and lowering the retirement age. In response to the news of disciplinary action, Matteo Salvini, Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s deputy prime minister and leader of the far-right League, said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153A letter from the EU? I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m also waiting for one from Father Christmas.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd More details and reaction to follow... Despite October\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rising deficit, the UK government argues that the public finances are on a firmer footing: A HM Treasury spokesperson says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This is our best year-to-date borrowing performance since 2005, thanks to people\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hard work and the government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s careful management of the public finances Our balanced approach is getting debt falling while supporting our vital public services, keeping taxes low, and investing in Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s future.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd More retail pain: Furniture group Ikea has said 350 UK jobs are at risk, as part of a shake-up of its global business. In total, Ikea is planning to shed 7,500 jobs world wide, as it strives for \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a greater focus on adding value to its customers\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. But....Ikea is also planning to create 11,500 new jobs in the next few years - by opening 30 new \u00e2\u20ac\u0153touchpoint\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Ikea stores in city centres, and by investing in its digital and logistics operations. The OECD has also weighed in on Brexit, by backing Theresa May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s draft withdrawal agreement. It has also called for Britain to force \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the closest possible relationship\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd with the EU after the divorce - something Theresa May will be discussing with EC president Juncker tonight. America and China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade war has force the OECD thinktank to slash its forecasts for global growth. The OECD now believes the world economy will only grow by 3.5% in 2019, down from a previous forecast of 3.7%. Much of the blame is being pinned on the tit-for-tat tariffs on US and Chinese trade, and the threat of more being imposed next year. The OECD believes the world economy is now heading for a soft landing, but an escalated trade war could turn it into a hard one. As Laurence Boone, the OECD\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chief economist, puts it: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re not talking about a plateau [of growth] any more, but a slowdown.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s more details: Matt Whittaker of the Resolution Foundation has dug into today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s public finances, and shows how the UK is making little impact on its debt mountain: The jump in UK borrowing last month may show that the government is, as promised, easing the chains of austerity (a little), as the economy slows. John Hawksworth, chief economist at PwC, explains: Public borrowing in October 2018 was \u00c2\u00a31.6 billion higher than in October 2017, reflecting rapid growth in government spending last month but only a modest rise in tax receipts. This is consistent with indications from business surveys and the latest retail sales data that the economy slowed markedly as we moved into the autumn, due in large part to increased uncertainty around Brexit. The rise in UK borrowing last month will worry chancellor Philip Hammond, says Andrew Wishart of Capital Economics. He writes: The first public finances figures released since the Budget bucked the recent trend of improvement. Government borrowing of \u00c2\u00a38.8bn last month (consensus \u00c2\u00a36.2bn, CE \u00c2\u00a37.0bn) was up from \u00c2\u00a37.2bn in the same month last year and marked the largest October deficit for three years. The increase in borrowing compared to last year was due to a \u00c2\u00a32.2bn rise in \u00e2\u20ac\u0153other\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd (most likely departmental) spending. This leaves borrowing in the fiscal year to date down by 30% compared to last year. While this is still the lowest since 2005, it is above the OBR\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s October Budget forecast for a 36% reduction over the year as a whole. This could be a worrying sign for the Chancellor. If this trend continues, the giveaways in the October Budget could see him breach his near-term fiscal targets. And if there is a no deal Brexit, the resulting economic slowdown would probably cause the public finances to deteriorate further. Admittedly, this could be offset to some extent by the UK not paying part of the financial settlement. Ross Campbell, ICAEW Public Sector Director, points out that Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s public finances depend on a good Brexit deal: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153In the most recent Budget, the Chancellor pledged further investments into the NHS, roads and schools, and again loosened his target for deficit reduction. It looks like Hammond and May have bet on a positive outcome from Brexit, assuming a deal would be struck and pass parliament. The expectation that a Brexit \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcbounce\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 would deliver a spike in business and investment following an agreed deal gave the Chancellor the room to put off the hard decision on putting up taxes. With no clear support in Parliament for the deal, this is a high risk strategy. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We need to remember that if the Government is not able to get its deal with the EU through parliament then all such bets are off. In his budget speech, the Chancellor admitted as much. If the deal doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get through then even if negotiations continue, it is more than likely that the budget will need to be revisited.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Economist Philip Shaw of Investec says the big picture is that UK public finance are improving, despite October\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stumble. The surprise jump in UK borrowing last month erodes some of the year-on-year improvement in the public finances: However, the government is still on track to borrow less in 2018-19 than in 2017-28. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s deficit swelled to \u00c2\u00a38.8bn last month because the government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s income didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t keep pace with spending. The Office for National Statistics explains: Central government receipts in October 2018 increased by 1.2% compared with October 2017, to \u00c2\u00a359.9 billion; while total expenditure increased by 7.7% to \u00c2\u00a365.4 billion. Much of this annual growth in central government receipts in October 2018 came from Value Added Tax (VAT), Income Tax and tobacco duties; while interest and dividend receipts (largely dividend transfers from the Bank of England Asset Purchase Facility Fund) (BEAPFF) have fallen on October 2017. Newsflash: Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ran up a much larger budget deficit than expected last month. The UK borrowed \u00c2\u00a38.8bn last month, \u00c2\u00a31.6bn more than in October 2017. This is the highest October borrowing for three years. On a happier note, Britain has borrowed \u00c2\u00a326.7bn in the current financial year-to-date, \u00c2\u00a311.2 billion less than in the same period in 2017. This is the lowest annual deficit at this stage of the year since 2005. More to follow... European stock markets are clawing their way back from yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s selloff. The main indices are all higher, partly due to hopes of detente between Rome and Brussels over the Italian budget. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s excitement in the bond markets this morning, following reports that Italy might compromise over its 2019 budget plans. According to the La Stampa newspaper, deputy PM Matteo Salvini could be open to revising its budget, by cutting planned spending on a new basic income scheme, and unwinding a pension reform. If so, that might help ward off a clash with the European Commission, which will give its judgment on the Italian budget later today (possibly 11am GMT). However, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not clear if Italy is actually prepare to lower its planed deficit from 2.4% of GDP, or accept that its growth forecasts may be too optimistic. Still, bond traders are hopeful - the yield (or interest rate) on Italian 10-year debt has dropped from 3.6% to 3.51%. That shows they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re seen as a safer option today. Despite Kevin Hassett\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s claim that Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tax policies are working, America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade deficit with China has actually grown this year. The gap hit $375bn in 2017, and is on rack to exceed this level in 2018 thanks to rollicking imports of China-made technology, electrical equipment, machinery and clothes. Analysts at JP Morgan have warned that the US-China trade war will hurt economic growth. They told clients: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We forecast that the US imposes an additional 25% tariff on virtually all goods imports from China early next year. This will drag materially on activity in China and could accelerate the decline in global business confidence now underway.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd One of President Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s top economic advisers has suggested there could be a case for \u00e2\u20ac\u0153evicting China\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd from the World Trade Organisation (WTO). Kevin Hassett, chairman of the president\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Council of Economic Advisers, told the BBC that China had \u00e2\u20ac\u0153misbehaved\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd as a member of the WTO, claiming: We never really envisioned that a country would enter the WTO and then behave the way that China has. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a new thing for the WTO to have a member that is misbehaving so much. He also claimed that the WTO was failing the US, as it takes so long to rule on trade disputes: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153it takes five or six years and then the damage is done\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Hassett also claimed that Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hardball strategy on international trade is working. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s questionable, when the US Trade Representative has ruled that China hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t change its policies.... Hopes of a ceasefire in the US-China trade wars are fading today, after America launched a fresh salvo of criticism at Beijing. In a new report, US Trade Representative (USTR) Robert Lighthizer rules that China has not changed its \u00e2\u20ac\u0153unfair\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and \u00e2\u20ac\u0153unreasonable\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd practices, despite pressure from America and the imposition of tariffs on $250bn of Chinese sales to the US. The move raises tensions ahead of the G20 meeting of world leaders later this month, where presidents Trump and Xi are expected to discuss the issue. Lighthizer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s comments came in an update of the U.S. Trade Representative\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Section 301\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd investigation into China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s intellectual property and technology transfer policies. The USTR declared that China had not responded \u00e2\u20ac\u0153constructively\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to the initial section 301 reports. In particular, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s unhappy that the Chinese government has persisted in using foreign investment restrictions to push US companies to share technology and intellectual property with Chinese entities. Lighthizer says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We completed this update as part of this Administration\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s strengthened monitoring and enforcement effort. This update shows that China has not fundamentally altered its unfair, unreasonable, and market-distorting practices that were the subject of the March 2018 report on our Section 301 investigation.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Global markets are extremely edgy today, as investors fret about global growth prospects, the US-China trade war, Brexit, and Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s row with the EU over its budget plans. Last night, Wall Street suffered one of its shakiest days of the year. The Dow Jones industrial average slumped by 551 points, or 2.2%, to 24,465 points, wiping out its gains for 2018. Technology shares continued their recent losses, with Apple shedding almost 5%. But other sectors also suffered, with retailers Target and Lowe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s both disappointing investors with their latest results. This followed a rough day in Europe, which saw Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s DAX hit a new 52-week low. Economic growth fears also savaged the oil price on Tuesday, sending crude sliding by over 6%. The trading floor chatter is that the long bull market may be fizzling out. Craig Erlam of City firm OANDA says: Another troubling start to the week in financial markets is further denting investor sentiment as we approach the open on Wednesday, with futures currently stable but vulnerable to another tumble. US tech stocks are once again leading the way, plunging on the back of a combination of individual concerns \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Apple iPhone sales for example \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and general weaker risk appetite. The FAANG stocks extraordinary performance in the first half of the year has put them front and centre once the market turned and some now find themselves in negative territory for 2018, with others not far behind. While many would argue a correction has been on the cards for some time due to the growing list of risks to the outlook, be that rising US interest rates, Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s aggressive trade agenda, Brexit, Italy or one of a number of other headwinds, how bad it will get is difficult to say. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re already near the October lows and in correction territory, even close to bear market in some cases such as the DAX, if this is just a corrective move, I would expect investors to start eyeing up some bargains soon. Also coming up today There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s lots in the economic calendar, particularly from America as they clear the decks before Thanksgiving. New home sales and durable goods orders will give a picture of the strength of the US economy. City traders will scrutinise the latest UK public finance figures to see if the government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fiscal plans are on track. However, that will be overshadowed by Theresa May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trip to Brussels to discuss the Brexit deal with Jean-Claude Juncker. In the eurozone, the Commission is expected to confirm that Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 2019 budget isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t acceptable. That paves the way for the EC to launch an excessive deficit procedure which could lead to Italy being fined (although it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a long process). The agenda: 9.30am GMT: UK public finances for October 10am GMT: OECD releases its latest economic outlook 1.30pm GMT: US durable goods orders and weekly jobless figures 3pm GMT: US home sales, Michigan sentiment survey 3.30pm GMT: US oil inventory figures",

Some new research by Barclaycard has suggested that this year in the UK we will spend \u00c2\u00a31.6bn on experience gifts this Christmas, as people veer away from sending and receiving physical gifts, and look towards presents that can make memories. And are also super-Instagram material. Barclaycard also say that their consumer survey suggested that this year spending in the Xmas period itself on entertainment and events such as gigs, beauty treatments and adventure days will be up 115% on last year If you are thinking of gifting someone an experience, then there are some deals around today that can save you a bit of cash - and they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll never know you skimped by ordering it on Cyber Monday ;-) Virgin Experience Days are offering a selection of deals as part of their Cyber Weekend promotion. It is worth having a dig around the full list, but here are some of the highlights: 50% off the View from The Shard Experience for two adults (Now \u00c2\u00a332, was \u00c2\u00a364) 75% off a Winery and Brewery Tour for two with tastings (Now \u00c2\u00a37.50, was \u00c2\u00a330) 35% off a London Bungee Jump for one (Now \u00c2\u00a349, was \u00c2\u00a380) 25% off a Vintage Afternoon Tea Bus Tour for two (Now \u00c2\u00a382.50, was \u00c2\u00a3110) 60% off a Supercar experience in 24 locations across the UK (Now \u00c2\u00a355, was \u00c2\u00a3139) There also some deals on London Musicals Aladdin in the West End is offering tickets from \u00c2\u00a325 as a limited Black Friday weekend promotion, with savings on tickets of up to 39%.

It would be remiss of me to spend a whole day live blogging special Cyber Monday offers and then neglect to mention one rather close to home... The Guardian and The Observer What\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s happening? Brilliant offers across our range of print and digital subscription packages Where\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s it happening?

There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a decent (if slightly exaggerated) price drop on Huawei Band 2 Pro Fitness Wristband at Amazon, and you can also get the Fitbit Unisex Versa Health and Fitness Smartwatch for \u00c2\u00a3159 from the online retail giant. The Garmin Fenix 5 Multisport GPS Watch also has a hefty online discount on it at the moment, bringing it down to \u00c2\u00a3309.99. As one of the Guardian\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s resident Doctor Who nerds there was absolutely no way I was going to get through live blogging Cyber Monday without somehow cramming a Cyberman reference in there. And it is even topical, because episode Kerblam! the other week was about the perils of working in a mostly-automated factory sending out parcels and gifts. Ahem. Fortunately there are some Doctor Who-related deals I can tell you about. Big Finish, who produce Doctor Who audio dramas based on the original series, often with the original actors, have been offering discounts on a range of titles featuring the Time Lord\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Fantastic Foes, including the Master, the Daleks, the Ice Warriors, and of course, the Cybermen. Access the deals here using the code FANTASTIC. If you are buying for someone whose cult interests go a bit further than Doctor Who, then it is worth dropping in on the Forbidden Planet special offers page - they have discounts on a range of about 50 items including merchandise for Harry Potter, Rick &amp; Morty, Star Wars, and Deadpool. One of the things I suggested in my piece today about thoughtful presents you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve still got time to make or order was using old photos to make a nostalgic present for relatives or old friends. And you can do that slightly cheaper today, as printing service Photobox are offering up to 50% off everything, with an additional 20% off if you use the code CYBER20. Unfortunately you can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get a 20% discount on the amount of time it takes you to sort out the mess of photos stored on your laptop. Shopping online isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t without potential pitfalls, and Hannah Maundrell, Editor in Chief of online comparison service money.co.uk, has this advice for people doing their Christmas shopping today. She says shoppers should \u00e2\u20ac\u0153factor in the cost of delivery when you compare prices online. Check whether you can click and collect for free, as this can be a good way to save if you live near a store.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd She also warns us to be on our guard, saying \u00e2\u20ac\u0153just because a retailer tells you they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve cut the price of an item you can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t take it as gospel; you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll only know it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s good value by shopping around. Be suspicious and check.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd And there is a reminder of the consumer rights you enjoy when ordering online: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153You get 14 days from the day your order arrives to return it and get a refund. This gives you the flexibility to cancel if you find your bargain cheaper elsewhere. There are some exceptions, like personalised goods, but it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s guaranteed on most other purchases.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd If possible, she says, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153pay for items that cost over \u00c2\u00a3100 by credit card to get protection, so you can go to your credit card company for a refund if there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s an issue.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Her final warning is one that applies to virtually everything on the internet, whether it is fake news or a Cyber Monday bargain: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153If a deal seems too good to be true, treat it with a healthy degree of uncertainty.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd One of the things about Christmas is that it inevitably leads into the new year, and grand plans to re-invent yourself into a healthier lifestyle. What if you could prepare for that moment in advance? Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s how you can do that, and save a little bit of money as well, with Cyber Monday deals on subscription boxes. HelloFresh is a subscription service that allows you to download the app and pick from a selection of recipes each week to be delivered to your door in neat packages with all of the fiddly ingredients portioned out and prepared for you. They often have good introductory deals, but their Cyber Weekend deal takes it one step further, offering 55% off your first 2 boxes/weeks (and you are not obliged to continue your subscription). Birchbox are offering 2 boxes for \u00c2\u00a35 using the code FRIYAY, a promotion they claim is their \u00e2\u20ac\u0153best offer ever.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Usually, boxes are \u00c2\u00a310 each, making this a 75% discount. Plus, December\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s box will have a bumper 7 products, and again, the subscription can be cancelled at any time. KiwiCo deliver monthly crates of educational and creative activities for kids of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153every age and interest\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and they are currently offering 60% off the first crate for those who sign up on Cyber Monday. Lifebox are part of the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Wellness Revolution\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, delivering a selection of superfood snacks to subscribers every month as a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153convenient and affordable way of discovering new and delicious wholefoods.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd You can also buy their boxes as a one-off, and for Black Friday they are reducing the price of their Classic and Energy boxes to \u00c2\u00a317.21 (was \u00c2\u00a322.95). With about ten hours of Cyber Monday still to go, here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a summary of some of the best deal lists we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve posted so far: Video games and consoles Major UK retailers Smart speakers and home voice assistants Phones and phone accessories Homeware deals Flights and holidays Museums and attractions Plus we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve covered magazine subscriptions, books, vacuum cleaners and kitchen mixers among other things. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m also interested in you sending me any weird and super-niche Cyber Monday offers by email to martin.belam@theguardian.com. Pro-tip 1: Don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t buy your partner gadgets to do household chores as Christmas presents. Pro-tip 2: If you need a new household chore gadget anyway, today is a good day to buy it cheaper than usual.

SHARK IF250UKT True Pet Cordless Vacuum Cleaner Currys PC World have reduced this Shark vacuum cleaner to \u00c2\u00a3279 (was \u00c2\u00a3479) in their Cyber Monday sale.

Like the other John Lewis deals mentioned, this also comes with a 2 year guarantee included and the option to add further protection against accidental damage for \u00c2\u00a310. Happy holiday hoovering! The chances are that you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be in charge of buying the presents for at least one football fanatic in the family, and football merchandise is an easy, if obvious, choice for those sometimes-hard-to-buy-for children. Going to club websites today will yield you some savings. At the top of the Premier League Manchester City, Liverpool, Spurs, Chelsea, Arsenal and Everton are all offering discounts on selected lines ranging from 20% at Chelsea to 50% at Arsenal. A quick trip down the leagues showed club shops from the likes of Leeds and Sunderland joining in, so it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s worth checking directly with clubs to see if there is a deal on. Even my beloved Leyton Orient have some special offers on, so maybe it is finally the year someone will get me a nice woolly hat to wear at Brisbane Road. As a nation we are still in the grip of bake-off fever, which means the market for kitchen gadgets has never been healthier or more competitive. Here are some deals on stand mixers if you are looking to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153soup\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd up your kitchen gear. You see what I did there. KitchenAid 150 Artisan 4.8L Stand Mixer For anyone who has been waiting to get their hands on the cult favourite KitchenAid Artisan mixer - now is the time. This mixer has been dramatically reduced by several retailers, but most notably, Currys have reduced their price from \u00c2\u00a3549.99 to \u00c2\u00a3274 (a \u00c2\u00a3275.99 saving). Plus, they are offering a further discount code giving customers 10% off their order when they spend over \u00c2\u00a3200 on 2 or more small kitchen appliances and there is also the option to pay monthly. Kenwood kMix KMX754 Stand Mixer The Kenwood kMix has also seen large reductions across the board - AO, Amazon and John Lewis have all reduced their prices to \u00c2\u00a3179. However, John Lewis include a 2 year guarantee with their deal, and you can add an additional 2 years of protection against accidental damage for \u00c2\u00a315. Fearne by Swan: 6 Litre Die Cast Stand Mixer After bringing out several successful cookbooks, Fearne Cotton released her own range of kitchen appliances with Swan. Her 6 Litre stand mixer has not been reduced by many retailers, but Amazon are offering a saving of \u00c2\u00a3175, making it \u00c2\u00a3124.99 (down from \u00c2\u00a3299.99) in four colours, and they are also including free delivery. Sage The Scraper Mixer BEM430 Heston Blumenthal\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 4.7L stand mixer is on offer at almost 30% off from ECookshop, with free delivery available. While this is a better deal than the likes of AO and Amazon are offering, if you do spot it cheaper elsewhere, ECookshop will endeavour to price match. Also, while we are thinking about the kitchen, do take five minutes to read Zoe Williams\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 amazing interview with bake-off\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Kim-Joy Running a live blog about Cyber Monday is a bit like going shopping, but without any of the fun. And by the end of the day I won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have got my Christmas shopping sorted either. However, it does mean you run into a lot of rather leftfield suggestions for ways for people to invest and save money. Probably the most obscure promo I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve seen cross my inbox so far today is for Farmers Weekly. They\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve extended their weekend sale and today, for the last day, you can subscribe to the Web+ digital version of Farmers Weekly for \u00c2\u00a350+VAT. Go on, you know you want to. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not the only place you can get subscription discounts on magazines however. Magazine.co.uk is offering \u00c2\u00a315 off when you subscribe to three titles. iSubscribe, on the other hand, is offering 10% off and a \u00c2\u00a35 credit voucher if you take out magazine subscriptions before the end of today. GreatMagazines.co.uk is offering 20% off new subscriptions over the value of \u00c2\u00a325, and that deal runs until the end of tomorrow. Another magazine with a special deal going on is Anorak, the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dchappy mag for kids\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 aimed at boys and girls aged between 6 and 12 years old. They are offering 20% off all their single issues and posters with the code HAPPYANORAK. You can have a browse here. Incidentally, you can email me at martin.belam@theguardian.com if you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve seen an even more obscure Cyber Monday deal. Books make a lovely gift, since the choice often says something personal about you, and there are some bargains to be had out there on Cyber Monday. WH Smith are offering 50% off or more on selected titles and Waterstones have a similar deal, while Book Depository have up to 60% off their promotional titles. You can get 20% off online purchases at Foyles with the code BLACKFRIDAY20. CYBER25 is the code you need to unlock 25% discounts with Book People. Don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t forget that the Guardian Bookshop is also offering deals and gift suggestions with up to 30% discount, which you can find here. Need a bit of inspiration? Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s what our books team were recommending back in the autumn. West Elm are offering 20% off everything in stock, including items that are already in clearance, quoting the puntastic code \u00e2\u20ac\u0153FRIYAY\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in store or online.

For example: Save \u00c2\u00a31000 on selected mattresses Save up to \u00c2\u00a3750 off Hendricks fabric sofas Save \u00c2\u00a3100 on the Jacobs Storage Bench Save \u00c2\u00a330 on bed linen Anthropologie have 20% discounts on selected lines until midnight tonight.

They are also offering free standard delivery on all orders which will be automatically applied at checkout. Other homewares brands that are offering Cyber Monday discounts include Wayfair, Debenhams, and Sofa.com. And with that, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m going to pop to have some lunch at the Guardian canteen, where I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m hoping there will be some cracking Cyber Monday deals on quinoa and hummus. For the Apple iPhone XR, while Carphone Warehouse are offering a saving of \u00c2\u00a3470 on the a 24 month Vodafone contract for the iPhone XR until midnight (\u00c2\u00a336 per month, \u00c2\u00a359.99 upfront cost), mobiles.co.uk are offering the same deal except with no upfront cost. If it is the Google Pixel you are after, Carphone Warehouse are also offering \u00c2\u00a3510 off their Google Pixel 3 24 month contract with Vodafone, including 100GB of data and unlimited texts and minutes (\u00c2\u00a336 per month, \u00c2\u00a329.99 upfront cost) Mobilephonesdirect.co.uk\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s top deal for Cyber Monday is a 24 month contract for the Huawei Mate 20 Pro (128GB) at \u00c2\u00a345 a month with no upfront cost. This deal comes with 50GB data, unlimited minutes and texts, an O2 SIM card, free delivery and one month\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s free insurance. Appliances Direct meanwhile have dramatically reduced the price of the Samsung Galaxy S9 by \u00c2\u00a3240, making it \u00c2\u00a3499. Mobiles.co.uk are pushing several extended deals for Cyber Monday.

In the market for an iPhone XS? In among the buymobiles.net Cyber Monday offers you can pick one up for \u00c2\u00a337 per month with 80GB of data. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s an upfront cost of \u00c2\u00a3119, but it looks to be one of the better deals for that handset today. On the accessories front, Gear4 have big discounts on protective cases for your phones, including 70% off the Piccadilly range and 50% off the Battersea range, which will apparently protect your phone from a 16 foot drop. Screen protectors for the Apple iPhone 6/7/8, iPhone X/XS, iPhone XS Max and iPhone XR are down to \u00c2\u00a320.99 from \u00c2\u00a329.99.

Feel Unique, meanwhile, have a range of Cyber Monday deals promising up to 33% off of over 25,000 beauty and perfume products, and the exciting bonus of a mystery gift if you spend over \u00c2\u00a350. *spooky ooo-oooo-oh ghost noise* One big question around Black Friday and Cyber Monday that remains - is it actually making anybody any happier? A couple of days ago my colleague reported on whether the backlash against Black Friday had already started in the UK. Greenpeace is among a group of organisations promoting MAKE SMTHNG as an alternative to the consumer spending over this weekend. During it artists and crafters run workshops on ways to reuse, repair or recycle goods, rather than buying something new. There is some data too about how the Black Friday shopping experience makes people unhappy. HappyOrNot, the company that produce the little machines where you can register how happy you are with a consumer experience by pressing a range of smiley or not-smiley faces, measured 575,000 feedbacks from customers in places like Lidl, Zara, and Tesco. They claim that analysing the data shows that we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve just lived through the unhappiest UK Black Friday they have on record. As well as a year-on-year decline in happiness, in the UK, Black Friday was slightly unhappier (79.8%) for UK shoppers than an average day in 2018 (80.3%). UK shopper happiness also dropped drastically throughout the day, starting at 84.3% for early birds at 9am, and ending at 78% for those still slogging round the shops at 9pm. None of that today though - with Cyber Monday you can happily do it all from your phone of course. By the way, if you are struggling for Christmas inspiration, we have this year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s gift guide over here. And here are 12 ideas for gifts that keep giving throughout the year, by taking out a subscription service for someone. The jury is still out on whether having a smart speaker in your home is giving corporations undue surveillance in our private spaces, or whether all that worry is out-weighed by it just really being handy to be able to shout out \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Hey, whatsisface, play my electronic surveillance playlist, ta\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, or turn the lights off without getting off the sofa. If you are in the market for one, here are some options: Amazon have a range of discounts on their home speaker products, including \u00c2\u00a335 off the Echo, \u00c2\u00a330 off the Echo Dot, and \u00c2\u00a330 off the second generation Echo Plus. Google offer a variety of smart speakers and their flagship Google Home Hub. You can pick the latter up with a \u00c2\u00a340 discount from ao.com, which brings the price down to \u00c2\u00a399. Currys PC World are also offering deals across the whole range of voice assistants. Amidst the frenzy of Black Friday and Cyber Monday, there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been a move in the US to try and get \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Museum Sunday\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to be a thing in the middle of it, where people promote more thoughtful activities than shopping. Although, obviously, getting people to part with their cash to attend attractions is still part of the agenda. It hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t particularly caught on in the UK yet, but there are some deals around on museums and attractions if you know where to look. If Lego is your thing, then Legoland in Windsor have a new Haunted House Monster Party Ride launching in spring 2019, and some Cyber Monday offers on booking for it in advance. The deal works out at \u00c2\u00a335 per person based on a family of two adults and two children, and can be accessed here before midnight. When it presumably turns into a Lego pumpkin or something. A Merlin Annual Pass can get you into 32 UK attractions including Madame Tussauds, the London Eye, Alton Towers, Sea Life centres and Warwick Castle. They are offering three months for free, making it last 15 months, if you order during their Cyber week offer. It could make a great gift for a family - but there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s quite a bit of small print to note though, and lots of times when you might want to be taking the kids out, like August and Bank Holidays, are excluded from the major attractions. Not a visit, but the Natural History Museum have been running Black Friday and Cyber Monday discounts in their online store all weekend. If there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a transport nerd in your life, then the Black Friday sale at the London Transport Museum might be worth a visit - among the offers there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a range of reproduction vintage posters down to half-price. Oh, and if you do want an educational angle on Black Friday, this article from the Museum of London about how a march on Parliament by suffragettes on 18 November 1910 came to be known as Black Friday due to the repeated assaults on the protesting women might make an antidote to the spending it has come to be associated with today. As well as offers on hotels, airlines often join in Black Friday and Cyber Monday with a series of deals to help you jet away in the new year. British Airways have offers on luxury holidays which expire at midnight tonight, including saving \u00c2\u00a3100 on holidays with a minimum spend of \u00c2\u00a32,500 per booking, and saving \u00c2\u00a350 on holidays with a minimum spend of \u00c2\u00a31,250 per booking. Which don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t seem like huge savings to be honest. Club Med\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cyber Monday promotion boasts that holidaymakers can save up to \u00c2\u00a3520 per person on all-inclusive holidays. Destinations include skiing in the French Alps and holidays in the Caribbean, covering flights that depart from London, Manchester, Birmingham, Edinburgh and more. Expedia claim to have secured \u00e2\u20ac\u0153special low Black Friday &amp; Cyber Monday fares from top airlines\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd - they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve gathered the details here. Fleetway also have some deals on flights and holidays - some of the options are gathered together here. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also a \u00c2\u00a3100 discount on all holidays over \u00c2\u00a31200 if you enter the code BLACKFRIDAY when booking before 29 November. Norwegian, the low-cost long-haul airline, have up to 30% off flights booked before the end of the day - it might finally be the moment to book that trip to the US. Ryanair have a slightly more convoluted deal going on. If you book a room somewhere with them, you get 10% of the vale back as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Flight credit\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd on your account that you can then, presumably, spend on the flights to get there. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also a more straightforward \u00c2\u00a330 off flights offer. Virgin Atlantic are offering up to \u00c2\u00a3150 off flight and hotel combinations, you need to enter the code BF2018 when booking. The shift to online retailing has made times tough on the high street for department stores. Some of them, like Fenwick, Fortnum &amp; Mason, Harrods and Selfridges have stayed out of the Cyber Monday fray. Others, like Debenhams, are offering plenty of deals. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a quick whizz around the discounts available online today from some of the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s major department stores: Debenhams What\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s happening? \u00e2\u20ac\u015312 days of amazing deals\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in their \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Black Friday spectacular\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Where?

Where? \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Up to 60%\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd off, screams the shop\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s website.

                "bodyText":"And finally, the Dow has closed 108 points higher, or 0.44%. Worries over the prospect of a deeper US-China trade war were tempered by Larry Kudlow\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s suggestion that Donald Trump could cut a deal with president Xi. But Wall Street still felt nervous, with traders worrying what might happen at the G20 meeting. Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s threat to impose tariffs on hundreds of billions more Chinese imports has worried investors - as it would hurt companies such as Apple. General Motors shares ended in the red, down 2.5%, after being roasted by the president on Twitter. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s all for today. GW It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s looking like a quiet finish to trading in New York. With 15 minutes to go, the Dow is up 75 points or 0.3% at 24,715, the S&amp;P 500 is 0.2% higher, and the Nasdaq is flat. Donald Trump is right to criticise Theresa May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade deal, according to a former UK cabinet minister. Peter Mandelson, who also served as an EU trade representative, says the US president was talking \u00e2\u20ac\u0153perfect sense\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd when he said the UK would struggle to sign a trade deal with America. If we enter the transition period immediately after Brexit on 30 March next year, we will still be bound by all EU rules \u00e2\u20ac\u201c without having a say over them \u00e2\u20ac\u201c for a period of at least 21 months. The prime minister herself has begun to suggest that this transition period will need to be extended and article 132 of the withdrawal agreement says this extension could last until 31 December 2022. This would mean that for almost four years, the UK would have to follow all EU trade rules and stay inside the customs union. While it may be possible to begin negotiating a new trading relationship with some countries if they were interested during the transition, nothing could be implemented before the transition period had expired. Nor is it clear that there would be anything to negotiate beyond that point, if there is no solution to the Irish border question. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s because the backstop is deployed in the absence of a solution, so the UK remains in the customs union indefinitely. None of this would make negotiating a notional trade deal with the UK a high priority for other countries, including the US. CNBC have more details of Larry Kudlow\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s comments on trade, and Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s willingness to make a deal with China: Washington and Beijing have re-engaged about a path toward a trade agreement, and the summit offers \u00e2\u20ac\u0153an opportunity to break through what has been disappointing discussions\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in recent months, Kudlow told reporters on Tuesday. At the G-20, Trump will focus on issues including alleged Chinese theft of intellectual property, ownership of American companies in China and tariffs and non-tariff barriers, the National Economic Council director said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re having now a lot of communication with the Chinese government at all levels,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Kudlow said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We were at a total standstill. Nothing was going on.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders has been asked about president Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tweets about GM. However, she couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t give more details about any withdrawal of subsidies, saying: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know that there is a specific timeline.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Shares in GM are now down 3% following Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s blast. Newsflash: Donald Trump has just threatened to withhold government subsidies from General Motors. He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s furious that the company announced plans to close plants and lay off thousands of staff (plunging its workforce into uncertainty but boosting GM\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shares). Trump, though, isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t addressing that fact that his tariffs on imported steel have driven up GM\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s costs, and probably contributed to CEO Mary Barra\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision President Donald Trump is open to reaching a trade deal with China but is prepared to go ahead with more tariffs if one isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t struck, National Economic Council director Larry Kudlow has said, via Marketwatch. Apple shares are still under pressure, down 1% at $173.31. The threat of fresh US tariffs is worrying traders, as UBS analyst Timothy Arcuri explains: Apple is a significant employer in China and this administration has urged the company to move more manufacturing to the U.S.,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd . \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This could simply be a negotiating tactic ahead of the G20 Summit later this week, though we do note that this administration has proven a willingness to push forward with such actions. David Madden of CMC Markets UK sums up the day: Stock markets are in the red following yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bullish move. Fears regarding, US-China trade, Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s budget and Brexit all play into the mix. President Trump warned that that levy on Chinese imports might be increased, and further tariffs could be announced. This dampened investors\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 hopes about a deal being struck at the G20 summit. European stock markets have closed, with small losses across the board. The FTSE 100 ended 19 points lower at 7,016, a small reversal on Monday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rally. Well, this might be awkward. Apple CEO Tim Cook and Ivanka Trump, the president\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s daughter and advisor, are visiting schools in Idaho together on Tuesday. They\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be dropping in on Idaho\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Wilder School District, which has signed up to Apple\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ConnectEd program. That means all students at two schools, Wilder Elementary and Wilder Middle-High School, receive iPads as part of a $100m grant from Apple. Teachers received MacBooks and iPad minis. Ivanka sounds excited about it; perhaps a bright pupil might ask about trade wars?.... The global economy could suffer badly over the next decade if the US-China trade war escalates, according to new research from Rabobank. The Dutch financial services group has calculated that the global economy would lose out on 0.7 percentage points of growth by 2030, unless the two sides reach a ceasefire. And if further tariffs are imposed, as Donald Trump is threatening, the impact would be much worse -- wiping out 2 percentage points of growth. And there are no winners in this scenario, Rabobank says. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s more details: Escalating trade war could see global GDP growth drop 2 per cent meaning hundreds of billions of dollars in lost growth by 2030, compared to a no-trade-war scenario China would be hit hardest with the economy losing $2,100bn by 2030, with US incurring a $370bn hit Euro area to feel knock-on effect with combined economy seeing a $60bn shortfall by 2030 Hugo Erken, senior economist at Rabobank, says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Our analysis demonstrates the stark reality that an ongoing trade war between the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s two largest economies has much broader ramifications that transcend their own borders. It shows that in a globalised economy, there are no real winners from such policies.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Capital Economics has spotted some worrying signs in today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s US consumer confidence report: Although they have generally picked up over the past couple of months specifically, the shares of respondents planning to buy a home, motor vehicle or major appliance remain lower than their 2017 peaks. That shift in sentiment is already showing up in weaker housing activity, and we suspect it won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be long before that weakness starts to spread to other rate-sensitive sectors of the economy. Wall Street is recovering some of its early losses, in choppy trading. The Dow is now down 100 points, having been 200 points south just after the open. Just in: US consumer confidence has dipped, but remains high by historical standards. The Conference Board\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s consumer confidence index slipped to 135.7 this month, down from 137.9 in October. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a bigger fall than expected. According to the Board, Americans are a little less optimistic about future business conditions and their own wage growth. More positively, consumers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 assessment of current conditions increased slightly, with job growth the main driver of improvement. The trade war jitters could see Apple lose the crown of being America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s most valuable company. Its market capitalisation has dropped to around $815bn in early trading, I reckon. That takes it below Microsoft, which is currently worth some $817bn. Less than four months ago, Apple was celebrating becoming the first US company to be worth one trillion dollars. Recent stock market volatility has taken a big chunk out of its value. Fiona Cincotta, senior market analyst City Index, explains why Apple\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shares are vulnerable to trade war fears: Preparing the ground for the talks with his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping this Saturday President Trump has laid out his threats. He plans to increase tariffs to 25% on $200 billion in Chinese-made goods if a deal is not reached and potentially bringing in tariffs on imports of iPhones and Macbooks made in China. While China is not budging on the tariff front \u00e2\u20ac\u201c it is responding in kind to any US tariff increases\u00e2\u20ac\u201c the country has been addressing the issue of opening up to foreign investments and companies. Ding ding. The New York stock exchange is open, and traders are giving their verdict on the US-China trade spat. The Dow Jones industrial average has fallen by 209 points, or 0.84%, to 24,437 points. Apple has dropped by 1.5%, following Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s threat to impose tariffs on another $267bn of Chinese imports, including iPhones made in China. Some reaction to the US house price data: Just in: US house price growth has slowed to a near two-year low. The closely-watched Case-Shiller index shows that US house prices only rose by 5.5% year-on-year in September, down from 5.7% in August. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the lowest rate since January 2017, and may show that recent US interest rate hikes are making mortgages less affordable. Global stock markets are weakening, as investors digest Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s threat to impose more tariffs on China unless Beijing backs down over trade. The Europe-wide Stoxx 600 index has lost around 0.5%, with Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE 100, German DAX and French CAC all losing ground. Wall Street is now expected to drop when trading begins in an hour\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time. The Dow is called down 150 points, or 0.6%. Lukman Otunuga, research analyst at FXTM, says investors should brace for \u00e2\u20ac\u0153potential fireworks\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd between the US and China. Markets will be keeping a very close eye to see whether both sides are able to find some middle ground. While a breakthrough deal seems highly unlikely following Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s recent threats, any display of friendship and interest for further discussions will be welcomed by the financial markets. However, if talks descend into arguments with trade relations between the two nations deteriorating further, risk aversion may reign as fears mount over a full-blown trade war between the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s two largest economies becoming reality. Theresa May has just hit back against Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s criticism of her Brexit plans. The PM has insisted that the UK will be able to sign a new trade deal with the US. The political declaration [with the EU] makes clear that we will have an independent trade policies. We will be able to strike trade deals across the world. May added that Britain already has a team of trade experts talking to the US about a possible deal. However, this raises the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcchlorinated chicken\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 question; how can Britain stay closely aligned to European rules, while also signing deals with other countries whose standards are different, and still minimise trade frictions? Harvard economist Jeffrey Frankel agrees that the US-China trade war is hurting the global economy....and Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s exit from the EU isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t helping either! He writes: The trade war appears to be among the reasons for a renewed slowdown in China. The Chinese slowdown, in turn, will have spillover effects on other countries, especially commodity exporters. The European economy has also slowed in 2018, with Germany even reporting a surprising contraction in the third quarter. Trade is among the reasons: reduced demand from China, unprecedented uncertainty about US trade policy and the looming prospect of a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153hard\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Brexit in which the United Kingdom leaves the European single market and customs union. Frankel argues that Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade war is rebounding on the US -- the trade gap with China has actually widened this year, even though Americans are paying more for Chinese goods. Brexit is also making people poorer (due to the slump in the pound after the 2016 vote) he adds: Current trade policies are working to reduce real incomes in the US, Britain and many other countries. But monetary policy cannot counteract the effects. Only voters can do that. The full piece is worth a read, and online here: Donald Trump launched his trade war with China back in March, by proposing tariffs on $60bn of imports. This was followed with 10% tariffs on another $20bn of goods (which Trump is now threatening to increase to 25% in January). Beijing retaliated both times, making US goods more expensive. Worryingly, there are now signs that these tit-for-tat moves have hurt China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy. Bloomberg has spotted that several indicators of business conditions and market sentiment have weakened -- including stock market valuations and small business confidence. Their chief Asia economist Chang Shu warns: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Early indicators point to further weakness in the Chinese economy. The economies of China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s major trading partners continued to decelerate. The weakness in the equity market would not only impact sentiment, but also constrain firms\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 liquidity.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Just in: UK retail sales have been stronger than expected this month, but shopkeepers are anxious about the future. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s according to the latest \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcdistributive trades\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 survey from the CBI. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the main findings: 36% of respondents reported that sales volumes were up in the year to November, while 17% said they were down, giving a balance of 19% Retailers expect sales volumes to pick up next month (+22%), with 34% expecting them to rise and 12% to fall Sales were poor for the time of year in November, with a balance of (-10%), an improvement on October (-22%) The volume of orders placed upon suppliers recovered in November, with 36% of survey respondents reporting a rise and 21% reporting a fall, giving a balance of +15%. Firms anticipate that orders will grow at a similar pace next month (+15%) Retailers expect their overall business situation to deteriorate over the next three months (-9%) Look who\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s in Beijing today.... We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve not seen much of David Cameron since he quit Downing Street shortly after the 2016 EU referendum, and took delivery of a new \u00c2\u00a325,000 shed in which to write his memoirs. Last December he got a new job, running a \u00c2\u00a3750m fund to improve transport links between China and its trading partners, as part of the Belt and Road initiative. So perhaps that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s why he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s in the Chinese capital today, for talks with premier Li Kequiang. The trade war is a major headache for China, as it tries to manage its economic transformation while avoiding a sharp economic slowdown. With US relations looking ropey, Beijing needs allies in other parts of the world. So it may be significant that China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s president Xi has just landed in Spain for an official visit, ahead of the G20 meeting in Argentina. Xi is expected to meet with King Felipe VI and Queen Letizia for an official palace reception, followed by talks with prime minister Pedro Sanchez. Spanish newswire EFE says the visit is aimed at \u00e2\u20ac\u0153strengthening strategic ties between the two countries\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. It will also give Spanish firms a chance to invest in Chinese infrastructure projects such as the Belt and Road Initiative. EFE adds: Xi will also visit the Senate, the City Hall of Madrid and end his visit with a gala dinner at the Royal Palace hosted by the Spanish royal couple. A business forum with the executives of major Spanish and Chinese companies is also scheduled to be held to promote investments in both countries. Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade war threats have taken the shine of Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock markets today. After a strong rally on Monday, the trading floors are more subdued today. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE 100 has dipped back into the red, as Thomas Cook\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s profits warning dampens the mood. Shares in banks and oil producers are also down, while utilities (a classic defensive stock) are up. Russ Mould of stockbrokers AJ Bell says the markets are in \u00e2\u20ac\u0153limbo\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, awaiting developments on the US-China trade dispute. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Interestingly investors didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t seem troubled by a new warning from US President Donald Trump who said he is likely to go ahead with a hike on tariffs on Chinese goods. The Shanghai composite index was barely changed and Hong Kong\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Hang Seng index only dipped 0.17%. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The market is perhaps waiting for Mr Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s upcoming meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping to see whether the current talk simply amounts to scare tactics or whether he is serious about targeting additional Chinese goods with tariffs.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Over in the City, shares in holiday firm Thomas Cook have plunged by a third after another profits warning. Thomas Cook surprised investors by rushing out its financial results this morning. They show that underlying profits for 2018 would be \u00c2\u00a330m less than expected at \u00c2\u00a3250m \u00e2\u20ac\u201c \u00c2\u00a330m lower than it was expecting two months ago. The company has also suspended its dividend, which helped to send shares slumping to a six-year low. Thomas Cook blamed this summer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s heatwave, which encouraged Brits to stay at home. More here: Baird analyst William Power says Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s threatened tariffs on Apple products are another blow to the tech giant, on top of existing worries about iPhone demand. Yesterday afternoon President Trump alluded to possible tariffs on iPhones and other Apple products, which is likely to create fresh demand concerns following recent supply chain rancour. While we take the negative supply chain comments with the proverbial grain of salt, there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s little question that higher iPhone prices due to potential tariffs would likely negatively impact demand and profitability at some level. We certainly acknowledge the near-term risk, but remain positive on the long-term position and would buy on weakness. Donald Trump has also managed to weaken the pound, by shoving a spanner into Theresa May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Brexit plans. Last night, the US president declared that the agreement on the table looks like a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153great deal for the EU\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd that would stop the UK trading with the US. These comments have infuriated the UK government, as May tries desperately to persuade MPs to back the plan. Her effective deputy, cabinet minister David Lidington, has claimed that Trump is incorrect, and said he \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcregrets\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 them (Westminster code for \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcI wish he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d shut up\u00e2\u20ac\u2122). Lidington told the Today Programme that a UK-US trade deal is achievable: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The United States is a tough negotiator. President Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s always said very plainly \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcI put America first\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. Well, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d expect the British prime minister to put British interests first.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd City traders,though, believe Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s intervention is significant -- the pound is down almost a cent to $1.2745 vs the US dollar. The president of Indonesia is growing increasingly pessimistic that China and the US could resolve their trade dispute, when they met at the G20 summit later this week. Joko Widodo told business leaders that: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m hoping for a miracle during the G20 meeting, that they will come together, but my feeling is they won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said. Widodo has already seen the animosity between the two sides, when US VP Mike Pence clashed with President Xi at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) gathering last week. Co-operation was in short supply, Widodo told a forum of Indonesian CEOs... \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This is the first time in 29 years of APEC that an APEC meeting produced no communique.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Beijing have responded to Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s comments. Foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang told reporters that presidents Trump and Xi had agreed to reach a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcmutually beneficial\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 arrangement on trade earlier this month. Commodity prices have also been hit by Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s threat to hike existing tariffs on China, and possibly extend them to all Chinese imports. Traders are calculating that a full-blooded trade war will hurt demand for metals such as zinc, nickel and aluminium Shares in UK tech firm Dialog Semiconductor, a key Apple supplier, have dropped 2.2% in early European trading. Apple shares fell over 2% in after-hours trading, following Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s threat to escalate the trade war. Wall Street is clearly concerned that the dispute with China could escalate in 2019, hurting sales of iPhones. America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s technology industry has hit out at Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s threat to impose steeper tariffs on goods from China, such as iPhones. Jose Castaneda, spokesperson for the Information Technology Industry Council, has warned that consumers will suffer the consequences: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Despite the pain Americans have felt in communities across the United States as a result of tariffs, the president has signalled he wants to continue this short-sighted trade war. Imposing a new round of tariffs would cause a shock that will reverberate across America and the globe. It would further threaten global supply chains, leading to higher prices for the electronic devices people rely on every day and even the loss of American jobs. It is deeply disappointing the president wants to undermine his opportunity to create meaningful progress before the discussions even begin. ITI urges him to give negotiations a chance and work toward an agreement that resolves this growing trade dispute.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Trade war fears are rippling through the markets again today, after Donald Trump threatened to impose fresh tariffs on goods from China. The US president undermined hopes of a ceasefire with Beijing, by declaring it was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153highly unlikely\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd that he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d accept an offer from Chinese president Xi Jinping, to avert new levies coming into force next January. There had been optimism that Trump and Xi could reach an agreement, perhaps at this week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s G20 summit, that would deter America from imposing steeper tariffs on more Chinese imports. Bu speaking to the Wall Street Journal, Trump dashed those hopes by predicting that he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll probably raise the existing tariffs on $200bn of Chinese imports in January, from 10% to 25%. Trump also raised the stakes further, by threatening to slap tariffs on another $267bn -- meaning virtually all Chinese imports into America would be more expensive. He declared: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153If we don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t make a deal, then I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m going to put the $267 billion additional on.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd This could includes tariffs on Apple products imported from China, the president added -- something that hit iPhone and MacBook users in the pocket. Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s insisted that Beijing needs to heed the US\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s concerns over trade, saying: China has to open up their country to competition from the United States.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Tariffs are effectively a tax on consumers (unless the importer swallows the cost themselves). Trump thinks Americans can cope with pricier goods, saying: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I can make it [the tariff] 10 per cent, and people could stand that very easily.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The folk on Main Street may disagree, so Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meeting with Xi at the G20 summit this weekend will be closely watched. Also coming up today Brexit, and the Italian budget row, will both be on investors\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 minds today.
