                "bodyText":"Black Friday, Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest shopping event, is nearly upon us, and with many high street retailers struggling, shoppers can expect to bag some good bargains. It originated in the US, where stores mark the start of the festive shopping season the day after the Thanksgiving public holiday with big price cuts and promotions. It has become a fortnight-long \u00c2\u00a310bn shopping extravaganza, while some retailers, including Carphone Warehouse and Halfords, offer Black Friday-themed discounts for all of November.

It has tens of thousands of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153lightning deals\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd that offer bargains in limited quantities.

Emerging economies in Asia, primarily China, will be responsible for much for the new oil consumption in the coming years, so oil prices will remain very sensitive to the region\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economic performance.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd</p> </blockquote> <p><em> <br></em></p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5bf7ff7ee4b0c6aba9994f5a\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-11-23T13:29:35.221Z\">1.29pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"33678998ac6d5d46745ec0a6d16072903de6b14d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/33678998ac6d5d46745ec0a6d16072903de6b14d/0_127_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A picket wears stickers related to the strike outside the entrance of an Amazon fulfillment centre in San Fernando de Henares near Madrid, Spain, November 23, 2018.

                "bodyText":"Finally, here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our news story on the meltdown in the oil market: Plus the latest from America, where Black Friday has been a little less boisterous this year... Amazon has reiterated that today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s protests didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t stop it handling customer orders, saying: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We were fully operational today as our associates focused on delivering for our customers. Any reports to the contrary are simply wrong. We respect the rights of groups and individuals to have their voice, but for us it was business as usual inside our Fulfillment Centres.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Some shoppers have also been having a jolly time, by the look of it.... More from the GMB: Currys PC World report that Nintendo Switch, Xbox 1 and iPad minis were their most popular products today. Sales of Ring smart doorbells are up 200% (they let you see who\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s at the door remotely, and chat to them). Barclaycard has updated its transaction data; by 3pm, the number of UK payments handled today was up 10% on last year, but the amount spent is down 12%. Despite being one of Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s most depressed markets, Black Friday in Greece is so popular that it began four days ago and will only end next week on \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcCyber Monday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. The Hellenic Confederation of Commerce and Entrepreneurship, which represents small and medium-sized businesses announced this afternoon that one in two Greeks had taken advantage of the super sale with clothes and electronic goods flying off shop shelves nationwide. Buoyed by good weather consumers could be seen in central Athens flooding stores earlier in the day. Greeks trawling the net for buys have increased by a whopping 26%, according to data compiled by the national statistics agency. Earlier this week Paypal said it had calculated e-shopping has jumped 50% on Black Friday and Cyber Monday in Greece, a country where hardships still abounds on the back of the nation\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s long-running economic crisis and where these events were foreign concepts not that long ago. Plenty of charities, local groups and fashion brands are doing Black Friday differently. Sarah Butler explains: Greenpeace has teamed up with partners including Fashion Revolution and Shareable to back Make Smthing week, during which artists and crafters lead workshops on creative ways to reuse, repair or recycle goods. Events taking place over the weekend include ShareFest in Totnes, Festival of Sustainable Fashion in London\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Hackney and Leeds Community Clothes Exchange. The Charities Aid Foundation is backing the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s efforts for global charity event Giving Tuesday on 27 November, which encourages people to do something for \u00e2\u20ac\u201c or give something to \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a charity they care about. Celebrities including blogger and Strictly Come Dancing participant Joe Sugg, Ricky Gervais and Martin Lewis are supporting the day which last year raised \u00c2\u00a3213m online alone around the world. In the UK, PayPal will match donations made on the day via its fundraising page or app up to a total of \u00c2\u00a350,000. Some brands will also be supporting charitable efforts on the day including clothing chain FatFace, tea label Pukka Herbs and Pret a Manger. Fatface will donate up to \u00c2\u00a3100,000 of profits made over the weekend to charities including Nepal Appeal, the Prince\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Trust Tomorrow\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Talent programme and recycled swimwear maker Ocean Positive. It will also give the top 10 trading stores \u00c2\u00a32,000 each to donate to local community charities.... Rebecca Long Bailey MP, Shadow Business Secretary, is pushing the government to protect workers facing redundancy at Ellesmere Port: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This is devastating news for workers and their families in the run up to Christmas and is especially shocking considering the car maker\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s recent return to profit. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Bosses must now urgently meet with unions to ensure that there are no compulsory redundancies and work to provide long term certainty to workers and their families during this difficult time. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This distracted Government cannot sit back and allow for the decimation of such a vital industry with its highly skilled workforce, the loss of which will be felt not just locally but nationally.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Bleak news from the UK car sector -- Vauxhall is cutting 241 jobs at its Ellesmere Port plant, which makes the Astra model. In a statement, the company says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This restructuring is critical to ensure that the Ellesmere Port plant develops its competitiveness during this difficult time within the industry,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The firm, owned by US auto group GM, had already cut jobs earlier this year, and in 2017. This is eBay\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest Black Friday ever, according to Rob Hattrell, UK VP of eBay, who adds: We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re expecting up to 100 million visits to our marketplace over this weekend and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve lined up some great deals \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the X Box One is performing exceptionally well this week. Black Friday isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t just about tech, we are seeing high sales volumes in Menswear, DIY equipment and furniture too. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not just about the big brands, we support thousands of small businesses on our platform like Velocity Electronics, and on Cyber Monday we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be handing over our biggest advertising space on Piccadilly Lights to them. The dropping oil price is part of a broader theme.... Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our comprehensive round-up of the best offers out there: Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has backed the push for better conditions at Amazon: Brent crude has now plunged by 28% since early October, when it was trading at $84 per barrel. Newsflash: Oil is having a Black Friday sale of its own. Brent crude has just fallen through the $60/barrel mark for the first time since October 2017. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a 4.5% drop today, extending its earlier losses. US crude is also slumping deeper, down 6.6% at just over $51 per barrel. Why? Traders are concluding that slower economic growth and ongoing trade wars means less demand for energy. Cailin Birch, global commodities analyst at the Economist Intelligence Unit, explains: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Oil prices\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 recent slide primarily reflects the weakening outlook for global oil demand. The US\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision to issue waivers for major importers of Iranian oil has erased earlier fears that US sanctions would create a supply crunch. Against that backdrop, the slowing pace of Chinese GDP growth, and therefore energy demand growth, is a concern. Emerging economies in Asia, primarily China, will be responsible for much for the new oil consumption in the coming years, so oil prices will remain very sensitive to the region\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economic performance.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The other big trend this year is that more shoppers are buying on their mobiles, rather than making that cold and lonely trek to a special 5am opening. Sarah Butler explains: Argos said half of its orders so far had been made on a handset, up from 40% last year, while Carphone Warehouse said its sales through smartphones were up 8% year on year. Midnight until 1am was the busiest period for online shopping with 87% of sales made via mobiles, according to one estimate. Barclaycard reports that there are more UK Black Friday shoppers than last year, but they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re spending less. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the details: 16% increase in the volume of payment transactions compared to the same period on Black Friday last year 21% decrease in the amount spent compared to Black Friday last year Shoppers need to be extra-careful not to fall for a bad deal today, says Nicla Di Palma, equity analyst at Brewin Dolphin. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153After a tough year for the UK high street and the dominance of online retailers, this year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Black Friday will cover a broader range of products and offer more pronounced discounts. This could see customers lured away from Christmas deals, as they stock up on products ahead of the festive period. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The competition between retailers is intensifying and this should, in theory, benefit customers. But, as today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Which report highlights, customers need to be vigilant as to whether those amazing Black Friday deals really are what they claim to be. The report said 87% of the Black Friday deal items they investigated were available for the same price, or cheaper, at other times of the year.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd More protests, this time at Amazon\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Milton Keynes offices. This time, the GMB have turned up with an ASBO (anti-social behaviour order), accusing the company of deliberately using loopholes to cut its corporation tax bill. For the record, Amazon UK paid a corporation tax bill of \u00c2\u00a34.5m last year -- half as much as in the previous 12 months, despite a 35% rise in turnover. Tax is paid on profits, not revenue, of course. Amazon tells us that it is business as usual today, despite the protests in the UK, and strikes in Germany, Spain and Italy. The e-commerce giant says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Our European Fulfillment Network is fully operational and we continue to focus on delivering for our customers and reports to the contrary are simply wrong.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd In Madrid, unions have hung a banner reading \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Exploitation without rights\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd on the fence outside an Amazon logistics centre. Police are guarding the entrance... Back in the markets, oil is continuing to slide. Brent crude is now down 3% at $60.55 per barrel, the lowest since November 2017. US crude has slumped by 5% as traders brace for a supply glut. The GMB union have created a powerful video for Black Friday, urging Amazon to treat its workers fairly, not like unfeeling automatons: French environmental groups ANV Cop21 and Les Amis de la Terre (Friends of the Earth) are also protesting against Amazon today. They\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve just dumped a load of broken electronics devices outside its French headquarters in Clichy, in northwest France. Les Amis de la Terre accuse Amazon of causing environmental damage by destroying unsold products and failing to help recovery electrical and electronic waste - as well as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153waging an economic war\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd on other retailers. Just in: A video clip from Spain of Amazon workers striking, at its San Fernando de Henares warehouse. Unions across Europe are holding protests today against the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcinhuman conditions\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 at retail giant Amazon. They\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re using Black Friday as an opportunity to highlight problems at Amazon, including tough performance targets, jobsite hazards, and anti-union hostility. In the UK, the GMB union is holding a protest at five stores - including in Swansea: The GMB says: Amazon fosters a brutal, high-pressure work environment in which speed is valued over safety, according to warehouse employees, and the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s demanding goals over long, gruelling shifts cause widespread injuries. For example, a GMB survey of UK workers found that 9-in-10 have pain on the job. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I have repetitive strain, and spondylosis with arthritis,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said one Amazon worker organising with the GMB who fears retaliation. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The work is dehumanising, you are a number not a person. if you have health issues, the Amazon way is to pay you off and replace you with temporary workers with less terms and conditions. Elsewhere, chronic pain is too common. Workers in Germany, Italy and Spain are planning to strike today, causing disruption on one of Amazon\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest days of the year. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the details: Germany: Amazon workers, members of ver.di, walked off the job this morning at the Bad Hersfeld facility at 8:30 a.m. Italy: Italian labour union FILCAMS CGIL announced a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153state of agitation\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and Black Friday solidarity actions at several Amazon facilities. Spain: The Comisiones Obreras (CCOO) will lead a strike at Amazon\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s San Fernando de Henares on November 23 and 24. The Madrid-area facility employs 1,800 workers and was last on strike during Amazon Prime Day in May. United Kingdom: The GMB will hold large protests outside of five Amazon warehouses in the UK. One of those \u00e2\u20ac\u0153fulfilment centres,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd the 1,500 worker Rugeley warehouse, was recently called \u00e2\u20ac\u0153one of the most dangerous places to work in Britain.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Chris Williamson, Chief Business Economist at IHS Markit, on the eurozone slowdown: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The cooling of Eurozone business growth to a four- year low adds to signs that the economy faces a disappointing end of the year. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Manufacturing remains the main area of weakness, linked in part to having been hit hard once again by deteriorating exports. The slowdown is also being temporarily exacerbated by persistent disappointing car sales. However, November also brought further signs that the manufacturing-led slowdown is spilling over to services, as consumer and corporate demand was often reported to have weakened in the face of headwinds such as rising political uncertainty, tighter financial conditions and higher prices. Uh ho.... growth across the eurozone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s private sector has hit its lowest level since the end of 2014 That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s according to the latest survey of purchasing managers in Europe, from data firm Markit. Firms reported slower order book growth and falling exports, alongside deteriorating optimism about the outlook, plus rising costs and prices. This dragged Markit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s PMI, a measure of growth, down to 52.4 (from 53.1 in October). That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a 47-month low. Manufacturing firms suffered particularly badly - suggesting that the trade disputes triggered by America this year are now hurting. Markit says: Manufacturers commonly blamed slower growth on subdued global demand, rising political and economic uncertainty, trade wars and especially sluggish car sales. The survey also shows that Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy lost pace. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s worrying, especially as the German economy shrank between July and September. Shoppers are being urged not to be tricked by dubious \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcbargains\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 today. My colleague Sarah Butler has the details: Research from consumer group Which? released this week found that nearly nine in 10 \u00e2\u20ac\u0153deals\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd available on Black Friday last year had been even cheaper at other times of year. Jon Holt, head of financial services at KPMG, said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Black Friday plays on the excitement of spending while frictionless finance and cheap credit puts that buying buzz within everyone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s grasp. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Our poll found that 51% of respondents didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t even think the discounts they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re offered on Black Friday are a genuine saving! Having an economy disproportionately built on debt is not sustainable for consumers, retailers or financial services.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Retailers are also at risk of diving further into the red as a result of slashing prices, according to credit ratings agency Moody\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s. It said retailers without a carefully thought-out strategy only succeeded in booking sales they would have made anyway in December, but at lower levels of profit. The nation\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s inboxes are bursting with Black Friday offers: Sergio Bucher, chief executive of Debenhams, says Black Friday is one of the retailer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest days of the year, and well worth the heavy discounting of prices. He told BBC Radio 4\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Today programme: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the starting gun of the Christmas campaign. Yes, customers are going to be coming to stores and buying some discounted products, but they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll also buy some full-priced products, they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be having a coffee, eating a piece of cake, drinking gin and tonic. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This Friday we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re going to be selling probably pretty much four times as much as a normal Friday so it is a big event for us. It is one of our biggest days of the year.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Commenting on recent speculation that Debenhams could be the next big high street name to go under, Bucher insisted the department store chain has a future despite announcing plans a month ago to close about 50 stores. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Retail overall is a tough place to be right now... we started our transformation about 12 months ago. If you were to go to Watford where we opened a new store you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d see a completely different face of Debenhams so I think that we have a very strong plan and we are transforming our product range as well. We are definitely here to stay. I bought shares two weeks ago, so I wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have done that if I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have trust.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Yes there are a number of stores we will need to close in the future. We see a future for Debenhams with about 100 stores with a bigger online business, and we have started conversations with our landlords.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Black Friday got off with a whimper, rather than a bang, this morning. Some retailers threw their doors open early, but there was little sign of a rush. My colleague Jasper Jolly trudged to Tesco Extra in Surrey Quays, south-east London, and found only a handful of eager punters in the pre-dawn chill. Staff at the Tesco, one of more than 700 holding Black Friday sales across the country, unlocked the giant store at 5am, an hour earlier than usual. They easily outnumbered the seven people waiting outside. Brendan Boshell, a 26-year-old working at a small start-up, was the first outside, hoping to snap up a bargain Xbox One games console. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m quite surprised I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m the only one,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he says, after reading about fights for products . In the past, police waited at different stores during the Black Friday sales. Factcheck: Donald Trump seems to have mixed up his oil price numbers in that tweet. US crude only peaked at $76 per barrel last month - it was Brent crude that got into the 80s. Donald Trump has been keen to take some credit (OK, all the credit) for the drop in oil prices, as these tweets show: Certainly, Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s refusal to condemn Saudi Arabia over the murder of Jamal Khashoggi has cut the risk that Riyadh hits back with a supply shock [this position leaves the White House is now at odds with the CIA over the case]. Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade war has also left America with an oil glut, as China has cut imports of US crude. In addition, Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision to grant waivers to allow certain countries to keep buying Iranian oil has also pushed prices down - while also startling the Saudis. Forbes has a good take: Saudi Arabia was caught off guard by the decision to grant waivers, which resulted in too much oil in the market. The price of oil predictably plunged, but Saudi Arabia has vowed to cut production. They are also working with other countries to engineer an even bigger production cut. The President is now attempting to pacify Saudi Arabia by giving the country a pass on the murder of dissident journalist Jamal Khashoggi in October, and by publicly thanking them on Twitter. But that will be unlikely to compensate for billions in lost revenue over what Saudi Arabia undoubtedly considers to be a double cross. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Jasper Lawler of London Capital Group on the sliding oil price: Oil experienced another volatile session overnight. Swings of over 1% have been the norm in the latter part of this week and volatility has been high since the beginning of November. This highlights just how jittery the oil market is right now. US inventories hitting their highest level in 11 months fuelled concerns over a global crude glut amid a worsening economic outlook. The fact that oil traders shrugged off expectations that OPEC will start withholding supply in 2019 to rein in a glut reflects just how concerned oil traders are over the future outlook. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. The oil price is sliding this morning, as oversupply fear and trade war angst continues to take their toll. Brent crude has dropped to $61.52 per barrel overnight, its cheapest point since early December 2017. US crude is under pressure too - down 2% today to just $53.39 per barrel, a level not seen since October 2017. Several factors are in play. In particular - signs that supply glut is building up. The fracking industry generating more supplies, and Iran\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s production is still getting to the markets thanks to US sanction waivers. Opec, the producers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 cartel, is likely to vote to cut production when it meets next month. That expectation isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t providing much relief now, though. Oil is also being hit by the general drop in asset prices this autumn, and also suffering from fears that the global economy will slow in 2019. Stephen Innes of trading firm OANDA explains: The overhang from swelling US inventories which remain freshly minted in trader minds suggests the massive crude glut continues to outweigh OPEC output cut although tentatively curbing traders downside ambitions. But while a weaker oil price gives Opec a headache, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s good news for countries who import the stuff. Motorists ought to see some benefits at the petrol pump, eventually.... Also coming up today It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Black Friday, famously a time when Americans put down their turkey drumsticks, pick up their credit card, and head to the mall. European retailers have embraced the idea too -- so we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be watching for any notable deals, queues and scuffles. Amazon couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t even wait for the big day itself (honestly, what happened to tradition?), and launched a pop-up shop in London yesterday: Plus, we get new data showing how the eurozone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s private sector is faring this month.

It has not, for instance, addressed any criticism of Coates\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pay deal, which some have found jarring in a week when new figures showed an alarming rise in the number of child problem gamblers. Charles and Liz Ritchie, who founded the Gambling With Lives charity after their son, Jack, killed himself after a gambling addiction, said they found Coates\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s payout \u00e2\u20ac\u0153particularly upsetting\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in the circumstances. While Coates gives much of her cash to good causes, such as the Douglas Macmillan Hospice and Alzheimer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Research UK, her foundation\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s page on the Charity Commission website offers no indication of whether any of it goes to problem gambling treatment. Her largesse is also partly funded by a relatively low UK corporation tax rate, and the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00c2\u00a378m tax contribution last year was rather less than one might expect, thanks in part to subsidiaries in jurisdictions such as Gibraltar, a haven for gambling firms. Bet365 has also been coy about where its customers are based. A Guardian investigation in 2014 found that punters in China \u00e2\u20ac\u201c where betting is banned in all but a few tightly controlled arenas \u00e2\u20ac\u201c were jailed after apparently placing bets on the Bet365 website. The company said it was not breaking any laws but would not confirm whether or not it accepted stakes. In this week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s accounts Bet365 said disclosing any more about its regional income \u00e2\u20ac\u0153would be severely prejudicial to the interests of the group\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. A recruitment page reveals the company is looking for \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Chinese language customer account advisors\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, though it could be targeting Chinese speakers in the UK or elsewhere. Unless Bet365 volunteers more information, it will remain one of Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s most opaque companies \u00e2\u20ac\u201c but also one of its most successful.",

Where? The Cyber Week sale runs from 26 November until 3 December here. Some new research by Barclaycard has suggested that this year in the UK we will spend \u00c2\u00a31.6bn on experience gifts this Christmas, as people veer away from sending and receiving physical gifts, and look towards presents that can make memories. And are also super-Instagram material. Barclaycard also say that their consumer survey suggested that this year spending in the Xmas period itself on entertainment and events such as gigs, beauty treatments and adventure days will be up 115% on last year If you are thinking of gifting someone an experience, then there are some deals around today that can save you a bit of cash - and they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll never know you skimped by ordering it on Cyber Monday ;-) Virgin Experience Days are offering a selection of deals as part of their Cyber Weekend promotion. It is worth having a dig around the full list, but here are some of the highlights: 50% off the View from The Shard Experience for two adults (Now \u00c2\u00a332, was \u00c2\u00a364) 75% off a Winery and Brewery Tour for two with tastings (Now \u00c2\u00a37.50, was \u00c2\u00a330) 35% off a London Bungee Jump for one (Now \u00c2\u00a349, was \u00c2\u00a380) 25% off a Vintage Afternoon Tea Bus Tour for two (Now \u00c2\u00a382.50, was \u00c2\u00a3110) 60% off a Supercar experience in 24 locations across the UK (Now \u00c2\u00a355, was \u00c2\u00a3139) There also some deals on London Musicals Aladdin in the West End is offering tickets from \u00c2\u00a325 as a limited Black Friday weekend promotion, with savings on tickets of up to 39%. Kinky Boots tickets are on sale for up to 43% off from lastminute.com and Encore Tickets, starting at a very reasonable \u00c2\u00a317.50.

Motown The Musical has deals on tickets for up to 46% off (starting at \u00c2\u00a321.50), and they have also taken the cost of booking fees off orders made for performances between 22nd - 29th December. It would be remiss of me to spend a whole day live blogging special Cyber Monday offers and then neglect to mention one rather close to home... The Guardian and The Observer What\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s happening? Brilliant offers across our range of print and digital subscription packages Where\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s it happening? You can become a subscriber here. What\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the deal? Save 50% for three months on print and digital subscriptions to The Guardian and The Observer. Offer ends Sunday 2 December. If you are in the market for smart watches, then there are some good deals kicking around today on the web. You can save \u00c2\u00a360 on the Apple Watch Series 3 over at John Lewis, while Withings are offering their Full Black Smart Watch at half-price. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a decent (if slightly exaggerated) price drop on Huawei Band 2 Pro Fitness Wristband at Amazon, and you can also get the Fitbit Unisex Versa Health and Fitness Smartwatch for \u00c2\u00a3159 from the online retail giant. The Garmin Fenix 5 Multisport GPS Watch also has a hefty online discount on it at the moment, bringing it down to \u00c2\u00a3309.99. As one of the Guardian\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s resident Doctor Who nerds there was absolutely no way I was going to get through live blogging Cyber Monday without somehow cramming a Cyberman reference in there. And it is even topical, because episode Kerblam! the other week was about the perils of working in a mostly-automated factory sending out parcels and gifts. Ahem. Fortunately there are some Doctor Who-related deals I can tell you about. Big Finish, who produce Doctor Who audio dramas based on the original series, often with the original actors, have been offering discounts on a range of titles featuring the Time Lord\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Fantastic Foes, including the Master, the Daleks, the Ice Warriors, and of course, the Cybermen. Access the deals here using the code FANTASTIC. If you are buying for someone whose cult interests go a bit further than Doctor Who, then it is worth dropping in on the Forbidden Planet special offers page - they have discounts on a range of about 50 items including merchandise for Harry Potter, Rick &amp; Morty, Star Wars, and Deadpool. One of the things I suggested in my piece today about thoughtful presents you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve still got time to make or order was using old photos to make a nostalgic present for relatives or old friends. And you can do that slightly cheaper today, as printing service Photobox are offering up to 50% off everything, with an additional 20% off if you use the code CYBER20. Unfortunately you can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get a 20% discount on the amount of time it takes you to sort out the mess of photos stored on your laptop. Shopping online isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t without potential pitfalls, and Hannah Maundrell, Editor in Chief of online comparison service money.co.uk, has this advice for people doing their Christmas shopping today. She says shoppers should \u00e2\u20ac\u0153factor in the cost of delivery when you compare prices online. Check whether you can click and collect for free, as this can be a good way to save if you live near a store.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd She also warns us to be on our guard, saying \u00e2\u20ac\u0153just because a retailer tells you they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve cut the price of an item you can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t take it as gospel; you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll only know it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s good value by shopping around. Be suspicious and check.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd And there is a reminder of the consumer rights you enjoy when ordering online: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153You get 14 days from the day your order arrives to return it and get a refund. This gives you the flexibility to cancel if you find your bargain cheaper elsewhere. There are some exceptions, like personalised goods, but it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s guaranteed on most other purchases.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd If possible, she says, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153pay for items that cost over \u00c2\u00a3100 by credit card to get protection, so you can go to your credit card company for a refund if there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s an issue.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Her final warning is one that applies to virtually everything on the internet, whether it is fake news or a Cyber Monday bargain: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153If a deal seems too good to be true, treat it with a healthy degree of uncertainty.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd One of the things about Christmas is that it inevitably leads into the new year, and grand plans to re-invent yourself into a healthier lifestyle. What if you could prepare for that moment in advance? Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s how you can do that, and save a little bit of money as well, with Cyber Monday deals on subscription boxes. HelloFresh is a subscription service that allows you to download the app and pick from a selection of recipes each week to be delivered to your door in neat packages with all of the fiddly ingredients portioned out and prepared for you. They often have good introductory deals, but their Cyber Weekend deal takes it one step further, offering 55% off your first 2 boxes/weeks (and you are not obliged to continue your subscription).

Happy holiday hoovering! The chances are that you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be in charge of buying the presents for at least one football fanatic in the family, and football merchandise is an easy, if obvious, choice for those sometimes-hard-to-buy-for children. Going to club websites today will yield you some savings. At the top of the Premier League Manchester City, Liverpool, Spurs, Chelsea, Arsenal and Everton are all offering discounts on selected lines ranging from 20% at Chelsea to 50% at Arsenal. A quick trip down the leagues showed club shops from the likes of Leeds and Sunderland joining in, so it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s worth checking directly with clubs to see if there is a deal on. Even my beloved Leyton Orient have some special offers on, so maybe it is finally the year someone will get me a nice woolly hat to wear at Brisbane Road. As a nation we are still in the grip of bake-off fever, which means the market for kitchen gadgets has never been healthier or more competitive. Here are some deals on stand mixers if you are looking to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153soup\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd up your kitchen gear. You see what I did there. KitchenAid 150 Artisan 4.8L Stand Mixer For anyone who has been waiting to get their hands on the cult favourite KitchenAid Artisan mixer - now is the time. This mixer has been dramatically reduced by several retailers, but most notably, Currys have reduced their price from \u00c2\u00a3549.99 to \u00c2\u00a3274 (a \u00c2\u00a3275.99 saving).

Sage The Scraper Mixer BEM430 Heston Blumenthal\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 4.7L stand mixer is on offer at almost 30% off from ECookshop, with free delivery available. While this is a better deal than the likes of AO and Amazon are offering, if you do spot it cheaper elsewhere, ECookshop will endeavour to price match. Also, while we are thinking about the kitchen, do take five minutes to read Zoe Williams\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 amazing interview with bake-off\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Kim-Joy Running a live blog about Cyber Monday is a bit like going shopping, but without any of the fun. And by the end of the day I won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have got my Christmas shopping sorted either. However, it does mean you run into a lot of rather leftfield suggestions for ways for people to invest and save money. Probably the most obscure promo I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve seen cross my inbox so far today is for Farmers Weekly. They\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve extended their weekend sale and today, for the last day, you can subscribe to the Web+ digital version of Farmers Weekly for \u00c2\u00a350+VAT. Go on, you know you want to. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not the only place you can get subscription discounts on magazines however. Magazine.co.uk is offering \u00c2\u00a315 off when you subscribe to three titles. iSubscribe, on the other hand, is offering 10% off and a \u00c2\u00a35 credit voucher if you take out magazine subscriptions before the end of today. GreatMagazines.co.uk is offering 20% off new subscriptions over the value of \u00c2\u00a325, and that deal runs until the end of tomorrow.

They are offering 20% off all their single issues and posters with the code HAPPYANORAK. You can have a browse here. Incidentally, you can email me at martin.belam@theguardian.com if you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve seen an even more obscure Cyber Monday deal. Books make a lovely gift, since the choice often says something personal about you, and there are some bargains to be had out there on Cyber Monday. WH Smith are offering 50% off or more on selected titles and Waterstones have a similar deal, while Book Depository have up to 60% off their promotional titles. You can get 20% off online purchases at Foyles with the code BLACKFRIDAY20. CYBER25 is the code you need to unlock 25% discounts with Book People. Don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t forget that the Guardian Bookshop is also offering deals and gift suggestions with up to 30% discount, which you can find here. Need a bit of inspiration? Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s what our books team were recommending back in the autumn. West Elm are offering 20% off everything in stock, including items that are already in clearance, quoting the puntastic code \u00e2\u20ac\u0153FRIYAY\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in store or online.

For example: Save \u00c2\u00a31000 on selected mattresses Save up to \u00c2\u00a3750 off Hendricks fabric sofas Save \u00c2\u00a3100 on the Jacobs Storage Bench Save \u00c2\u00a330 on bed linen Anthropologie have 20% discounts on selected lines until midnight tonight.

They are also offering free standard delivery on all orders which will be automatically applied at checkout. Other homewares brands that are offering Cyber Monday discounts include Wayfair, Debenhams, and Sofa.com. And with that, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m going to pop to have some lunch at the Guardian canteen, where I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m hoping there will be some cracking Cyber Monday deals on quinoa and hummus. For the Apple iPhone XR, while Carphone Warehouse are offering a saving of \u00c2\u00a3470 on the a 24 month Vodafone contract for the iPhone XR until midnight (\u00c2\u00a336 per month, \u00c2\u00a359.99 upfront cost), mobiles.co.uk are offering the same deal except with no upfront cost.

This deal comes with 50GB data, unlimited minutes and texts, an O2 SIM card, free delivery and one month\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s free insurance. Appliances Direct meanwhile have dramatically reduced the price of the Samsung Galaxy S9 by \u00c2\u00a3240, making it \u00c2\u00a3499.

In the market for an iPhone XS? In among the buymobiles.net Cyber Monday offers you can pick one up for \u00c2\u00a337 per month with 80GB of data. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s an upfront cost of \u00c2\u00a3119, but it looks to be one of the better deals for that handset today. On the accessories front, Gear4 have big discounts on protective cases for your phones, including 70% off the Piccadilly range and 50% off the Battersea range, which will apparently protect your phone from a 16 foot drop. Screen protectors for the Apple iPhone 6/7/8, iPhone X/XS, iPhone XS Max and iPhone XR are down to \u00c2\u00a320.99 from \u00c2\u00a329.99.

Feel Unique, meanwhile, have a range of Cyber Monday deals promising up to 33% off of over 25,000 beauty and perfume products, and the exciting bonus of a mystery gift if you spend over \u00c2\u00a350. *spooky ooo-oooo-oh ghost noise* One big question around Black Friday and Cyber Monday that remains - is it actually making anybody any happier? A couple of days ago my colleague reported on whether the backlash against Black Friday had already started in the UK. Greenpeace is among a group of organisations promoting MAKE SMTHNG as an alternative to the consumer spending over this weekend. During it artists and crafters run workshops on ways to reuse, repair or recycle goods, rather than buying something new. There is some data too about how the Black Friday shopping experience makes people unhappy. HappyOrNot, the company that produce the little machines where you can register how happy you are with a consumer experience by pressing a range of smiley or not-smiley faces, measured 575,000 feedbacks from customers in places like Lidl, Zara, and Tesco. They claim that analysing the data shows that we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve just lived through the unhappiest UK Black Friday they have on record. As well as a year-on-year decline in happiness, in the UK, Black Friday was slightly unhappier (79.8%) for UK shoppers than an average day in 2018 (80.3%). UK shopper happiness also dropped drastically throughout the day, starting at 84.3% for early birds at 9am, and ending at 78% for those still slogging round the shops at 9pm. None of that today though - with Cyber Monday you can happily do it all from your phone of course. By the way, if you are struggling for Christmas inspiration, we have this year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s gift guide over here. And here are 12 ideas for gifts that keep giving throughout the year, by taking out a subscription service for someone. The jury is still out on whether having a smart speaker in your home is giving corporations undue surveillance in our private spaces, or whether all that worry is out-weighed by it just really being handy to be able to shout out \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Hey, whatsisface, play my electronic surveillance playlist, ta\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, or turn the lights off without getting off the sofa. If you are in the market for one, here are some options: Amazon have a range of discounts on their home speaker products, including \u00c2\u00a335 off the Echo, \u00c2\u00a330 off the Echo Dot, and \u00c2\u00a330 off the second generation Echo Plus. Google offer a variety of smart speakers and their flagship Google Home Hub. You can pick the latter up with a \u00c2\u00a340 discount from ao.com, which brings the price down to \u00c2\u00a399. Currys PC World are also offering deals across the whole range of voice assistants. Amidst the frenzy of Black Friday and Cyber Monday, there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been a move in the US to try and get \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Museum Sunday\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to be a thing in the middle of it, where people promote more thoughtful activities than shopping. Although, obviously, getting people to part with their cash to attend attractions is still part of the agenda. It hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t particularly caught on in the UK yet, but there are some deals around on museums and attractions if you know where to look. If Lego is your thing, then Legoland in Windsor have a new Haunted House Monster Party Ride launching in spring 2019, and some Cyber Monday offers on booking for it in advance. The deal works out at \u00c2\u00a335 per person based on a family of two adults and two children, and can be accessed here before midnight. When it presumably turns into a Lego pumpkin or something. A Merlin Annual Pass can get you into 32 UK attractions including Madame Tussauds, the London Eye, Alton Towers, Sea Life centres and Warwick Castle. They are offering three months for free, making it last 15 months, if you order during their Cyber week offer. It could make a great gift for a family - but there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s quite a bit of small print to note though, and lots of times when you might want to be taking the kids out, like August and Bank Holidays, are excluded from the major attractions. Not a visit, but the Natural History Museum have been running Black Friday and Cyber Monday discounts in their online store all weekend. If there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a transport nerd in your life, then the Black Friday sale at the London Transport Museum might be worth a visit - among the offers there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a range of reproduction vintage posters down to half-price. Oh, and if you do want an educational angle on Black Friday, this article from the Museum of London about how a march on Parliament by suffragettes on 18 November 1910 came to be known as Black Friday due to the repeated assaults on the protesting women might make an antidote to the spending it has come to be associated with today. As well as offers on hotels, airlines often join in Black Friday and Cyber Monday with a series of deals to help you jet away in the new year. British Airways have offers on luxury holidays which expire at midnight tonight, including saving \u00c2\u00a3100 on holidays with a minimum spend of \u00c2\u00a32,500 per booking, and saving \u00c2\u00a350 on holidays with a minimum spend of \u00c2\u00a31,250 per booking. Which don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t seem like huge savings to be honest. Club Med\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cyber Monday promotion boasts that holidaymakers can save up to \u00c2\u00a3520 per person on all-inclusive holidays. Destinations include skiing in the French Alps and holidays in the Caribbean, covering flights that depart from London, Manchester, Birmingham, Edinburgh and more. Expedia claim to have secured \u00e2\u20ac\u0153special low Black Friday &amp; Cyber Monday fares from top airlines\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd - they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve gathered the details here. Fleetway also have some deals on flights and holidays - some of the options are gathered together here. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also a \u00c2\u00a3100 discount on all holidays over \u00c2\u00a31200 if you enter the code BLACKFRIDAY when booking before 29 November. Norwegian, the low-cost long-haul airline, have up to 30% off flights booked before the end of the day - it might finally be the moment to book that trip to the US. Ryanair have a slightly more convoluted deal going on. If you book a room somewhere with them, you get 10% of the vale back as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Flight credit\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd on your account that you can then, presumably, spend on the flights to get there. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also a more straightforward \u00c2\u00a330 off flights offer. Virgin Atlantic are offering up to \u00c2\u00a3150 off flight and hotel combinations, you need to enter the code BF2018 when booking. The shift to online retailing has made times tough on the high street for department stores. Some of them, like Fenwick, Fortnum &amp; Mason, Harrods and Selfridges have stayed out of the Cyber Monday fray. Others, like Debenhams, are offering plenty of deals. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a quick whizz around the discounts available online today from some of the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s major department stores: Debenhams What\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s happening? \u00e2\u20ac\u015312 days of amazing deals\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in their \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Black Friday spectacular\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Where?

They say they have lowered hundreds of their prices \u00e2\u20ac\u0153even further\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Where? The discounts are gathered together here. What? Offers include discounts on Mulberry and UGG, as well as deals on Apple, Samsung and Sonos products. Liberty What\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s happening?

Up to 30% off, with 15% off beauty. The deals aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t grouped together as easily as on other websites though, so you have to have a bit of a rummage through the men\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s, women\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s and kid\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s goods to bargain hunt. If you think \u00c2\u00a324 for two pairs of socks is a bargain, of course. If you are after fabrics though, today is the day, as there is 20% of a huge range. A huge amount of attention on Black Friday and Cyber Monday naturally goes to the biggest UK retailers - but there are also a lot of deals to be had from smaller shops and manufacturers on the sites they use to sell. Etsy has gathered together all the items with Cyber Monday discounts on their site into one place. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a huge range of discounted jewellery and clothing, on offer, and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also a good chance to pick up a few bits to make your home even more festive with a range of discounted Christmas decorations on offer.
