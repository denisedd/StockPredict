                "bodyText":"Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s my colleague Richard Partington on today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s EC growth figures: The UK will sink to the bottom of the European economic growth league next year to join Italy as the slowest-growing economy in the EU, before falling further the year after to anchor the table alone, according to European commission forecasts. The EU\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s gloomy predictions are based on a soft Brexit \u00e2\u20ac\u201c meaning Britain is expected to lag behind all its EU peers even if Theresa May can reach a deal with Brussels before 29 March. The commission forecasts that consumer spending growth will remain weak, continuing a subpar performance since the EU referendum in June 2016. It said business investment would stay subdued, while external demand for UK goods will dwindle. The commission predicted the result would be GDP growth of 1.2% in 2019 and 2020. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s probably all for today.... The latest US jobs data shows its labor market remains historically strong. Just 214,000 people filed new claims for unemployment benefit last week, not far from the lowest level ever. The number of people receiving benefits after an initial week of aid dropped by 8,000 to just 1.62 million, the lowest level since July 28, 1973. With such strong data, the Republicans might have been expected to put up a stronger fight in defending the House of Representatives.... Economists at HSBC have bad news for Germany: they believe its economy probably shrank over the summer. The first estimate of German GDP in the third-quarter of 208 is released next Wednesday. HSBC believes it will show the economy contracted by 0.1%, down from a previous forecast of +0.4%. In a new report, they say: After thirteen consecutive quarters with positive quarterly growth rates, the German economy seems likely to have taken a breather in Q3 2018. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s partly due to the slump in exports in September, in the face of trade conflicts (as covered earlier this morning). HSBC explain how this could mean net trade dragged on growth: The headwinds from the slowdown in world trade might also have been weighing on German export activity, which could have affected GDP negatively on the expenditure side. At the same time, import growth remains quite strong, resulting in the trade surplus hitting its lowest level since March 2014 in July. New European car emission tests have also hurt vehicle production in recent months, a key area of the German economy. Set your alarm clocks for 7am GMT next Wednesday, when the German growth figures are released. Newsflash: The International Monetary Fund has just weighed in on the EU-Italy budget row, backing Brussels. In a new report, the IMF predicts that Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s growth will sink to just 0.9% in 2020 (worst than the UK). It also says Rome should focus on cutting its debts, rather than borrowing more to spur growth.... It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s worth noting that the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s independent Office for Budget Responsibility is less gloomy about growth prospects. Last week the OBR forecast UK growth of 1.3% in 2018 (matching the EC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s view). The fiscal watchdog then spies growth accelerating to 1.6% in 2019, dipping to 1.4% in 2020. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s significantly better than the EC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s prediction of just 1.2% growth each year. And the OBR has an advantage: It knew about Philip Hammond\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcgiveaway budget\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 when it produced its number. The EC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s forecasts were inked in on 22 October, a week before the budget. So Britain might not be in as much peril as the EC believes. Sky News\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ed Conway has tweeted this point too: Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s growth forecasts have also escalated the row between Brussels and Rome over Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s budget. The Commission\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s forecast that Italy will grow by only 1.2% in 2019 is below the 1.5% predicted by its new government. That means the EC believes Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s budget deficit will hit 2.9%, not the 2.4% predicted by Rome (which Brussels has already rejected). Brussels insists that Italy submits a new budget by next Tuesday, which would mean dropping some of the spending plans which its coalition government promised in this year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s election. EU commissioner Moscovici has told reporters in Brussels that: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153There cannot be a sort of negotiation on this.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd But Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s administration hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t shown signs of backing down, arguing that the economy needs stimulating, and that a fiscal boost will pay for itself in higher growth. You can read the EC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new Autumn economic forecasts online here. The UK section starts on page 140 (p152 of the pdf). The EC is keen to point out that its forecasts are based on the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153purely technical assumption\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd that the EU and UK maintain their current trading relationship after Brexit. In other words, Britain is expected to lag behind Europe in the event of a soft Brexit, rather than a hard Brexit that causes significant disrupion to trade. On that basis, the EU predicts that: Consumer spending growth will be weak in 2019, as real wage growth will be modest. Business investment growth will rebound in 2019, but remain \u00e2\u20ac\u0153relatively subdued following a prolonged period of heightened uncertainty.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Net trade\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s contribution to growth will continue to dwindle, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153alongside slowing external demand\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. That adds up to growth of just 1.2% in both 2019 and 2020. But the EC also warns there are large, downside risks to these forecasts - if Brexit is less benign, growth will be slower, it fears. In ANOTHER gloomy warning, credit rating agency Moody\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s has predicted that global economic growth was likely to slow in the next two years. Reuters has the details: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We expect global growth to slow to under 3.0% in 2019 and 2020, from an estimated 3.3% in 2017-18\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, the agency said in a new report. Moody\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also fears that the US-China trade war will intensify in 2019, hurting the wider global economy. It wasy: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153In both countries, the overall direct macro impact on growth will be manageable. However, persistent and broadening tensions between the two largest economies globally are increasingly likely to have widespread negative implications by undermining investment.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The UK is expected to be the third slowest-growing EU member this year (at +1.3%), behind Italy (+1.1%) and Denmark (1.2%). Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s EC forecasts show the UK sinking to joint last place with Italy in 2019, at +1.2%. In 2020, the UK is expected to underperform every EU member with growth of 1.2%, while Italy creeps up to 1.3%. These forecasts are inevitably speculative, as the Commission simply doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know how Brexit will pan out. It also can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be sure what policies Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new populist government will follow. But it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not a great outlook for either country.... The European Commission\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s latest assessment of the UK economy isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t terribly encouraging, as Britain prepares to leave the EU next year. The EC expects growth to remain weak, and unemployment to rise: UK GDP growth is currently subdued and expected to remain so over the forecast horizon. Private consumption growth is forecast to remain weak as real wages grow modestly and households look to maintain savings. Heightened uncertainty means that business investment growth is likely to remain constrained. The net trade contribution to growth is projected to decrease in-line with a moderation in external demand. Employment growth is expected to slow significantly, leading to a modest rise in unemployment. Inflation should ease as the impact of sterling\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 2016 depreciation unwinds. The Commission is optimistic that unemployment will keep falling over the next couple of years. The eurozone jobless rate is already at a 10-year low, dropping to 8.1% in September. The EC hopes it will fall to 7.5% in 2020 -- if so, it would still be much higher than in the UK (4%) and the US (3.7%). The EC predicts that Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy faces a tough few years. UK growth is forecast at just 1.3% this year, and 1.2% in 2019 and 2020. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the joint lowest for any (current) EU country next year, alongside Italy. Germany, in contrast, is expected to grow by 1.7% this year, 1.8% in 2018 and 1.7% in 2020. The UK growth forecasts are based on the assumption that Britain and the EU maintain the current \u00e2\u20ac\u0153status quo\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in their trading relationship after Brexit. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not guaranteed, given the slow progress in agreeing a withdrawal agreement... Valdis Dombrovskis, Vice-President for the Euro and Social Dialogue, says Europe needs to take precautions before the next down: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153All EU economies are set to grow this year and next, which will bring more jobs. However, uncertainty and risks, both external and internal, are on the rise and start to take a toll on the pace of economic activity. We need to stay vigilant and work harder to reinforce the resilience of our economies. At EU level, it means taking concrete decisions on further strengthening our Economic and Monetary Union. At national level, there is even a stronger case for building up fiscal buffers and reducing debt while making sure that the benefits of growth are also felt by the most vulnerable members of society.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The EC is hopeful that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153barring major shocks\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Europe should be able to sustain above-potential economic growth, robust job creation and falling unemployment. However, this baseline scenario is subject to a growing number of interconnected downside risks, from a possible oil spike to the risk of an intensified trade war. Newsflash: Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy will slow steadily over the next few years as trade wars, geopolitical tensions and higher oil price all bite. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s according to the latest projections from the European Commission, just released. They show that growth in the euro area is forecast to ease from a 10-year high of 2.4% in 2017 to 2.1% in 2018. It is then seen dropping to 1.9% in 2019, and 1.7% in 2020. The wider European Union is expected to growth by 2.2% this year, slowing to 2.0% in 2019 and 1.9% in 2020. The Commission blames three factors, saying Rising global uncertainty, international trade tensions and higher oil prices will have a dampening effect on growth in Europe. More to follow! Germany isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t the only European country hitting a soft patch. Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s industrial output shrank by 0.1% in September, official data shows, the first drop since July 2016. Separately, French manufacturers have slashed their investment plans. They now expect to spend 1% less this year than in 2017, not 4% more. European stock markets have shrugged off Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s export slowdown. The Stoxx 600 index has risen by 0.6%, as shares benefit from the prospect of the Democrats keeping Donald Trump in check. Kit Juckes of Soci\u00c3\u00a9t\u00c3\u00a9 G\u00c3\u00a9n\u00c3\u00a9rale says: There is very little going on, and yet there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a lot happening. US election uncertainty removed, equity markets hope they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve found the ideal combination of slightly less fiscal easing and slightly less monetary tightening that a more restrained president Trump will have to deliver. An outbreak of glee has hit markets.... But in the longer run, US political deadlock will lead to slower growth from mid-2019 onward, Juckes adds. German factory chiefs will be hoping for a breakthrough in the US-China trade dispute soon, before the slump in exports deepens. And overnight, a top Chinese diplomat has suggest that presidents Trump and Xi could make progress at the G20 world leaders\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 meeting in Argentina in three weeks time. Politburo member Yang Jiechi told U.S. national security adviser John Bolton that: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153China is committed to working with the U.S. to achieve a no-confrontational, conflictless, mutually respectful co-operation in which both sides win. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Both sides should seek an appropriate solution through equal and mutually beneficial negotiations.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Yang\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s comments were released by China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Foreign Ministry, suggesting Beijing is keen to get its message out. Carsten Brzeski of ING agrees that Germany exporters are suffering from slowing world trade. He also blames new car emissions tests; production has suffered as automakers scramble to meet these tough new rules. Brzeski fears next week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s German GDP figures for July-September could be a stinker: Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade data ends a disappointing week for German industry. Available monthly data suggests that the economy had its worst quarterly performance in 3Q since the beginning of 2015. The first GDP estimate will be released next week on Wednesday. The 0.8% drop in German exports in September is the biggest since February. The FT reckons it \u00e2\u20ac\u0153could be another sign that Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest economy is feeling the effects of a slowdown in global trade\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Monthly data can be volatile, but German exports have looked underwhelming for several months now: Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Germany has suffered a drop in exports as the trade tensions swirling around the globe hit Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest economy. German exports shrank by 0.8% in September, statistics body Destatis reported this morning, dashing expectations of a 0.3% rise. Imports declined by 0.4% (against expectations of a 0.8% rise). This shrank Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade surplus to around \u00e2\u201a\u00ac17.6bn, from \u00e2\u201a\u00ac18.2bn in August, on a seasonally adjusted basis. Alarmingly, exports were actually lower than in September 2017, even though the world economy has expanded over the last year. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the details, from Destatis: Exports, September 2018 \u00e2\u201a\u00ac109.1bn -0.8% on the previous month (calendar and seasonally adjusted) -1.2% on the same month a year earlier Imports, September 2018 \u00e2\u201a\u00ac90.7bn -0.4% on the previous month (calendar and seasonally adjusted) +5.3% on the same month a year earlier It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the latest sign that Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy has slowed sharply this year. Third-quarter GDP figures due next Wednesday may confirm that growth stalled over the summer. German exporting powerhouse seems to be suffering badly from America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s protectionist stance on trade. The tariffs imposed on EU steel, and a swathe of Chinese products entering the US, are creating new frictions and dampening demand. Also coming up today Asian stock markets have rallied, as investors continue to welcome the US election results. Last night, the Dow jumped by 545 points (or 2.1%), the best day post-midterm rally since 1982, as Wall Street anticipated gridlock in Congress now the Democrats have control of the house. European markets are likely to gain ground at the open too, with the FTSE 100 called up 20 points: The European Commission issues its latest forecasts for the European economy this morning, and may confirm that growth is slowing. Investors will also be waiting to hear from the US Federal Reserve, when it sets monetary policy tonight. The Fed isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t expected to raise rates until December, but its views on the US economy may move the markets The agenda 10am GMT: European Commission 1.30pm GMT: US weekly jobless figures 7pm GMT: Federal Reserve interest rate decision",

The sector has turned at spectacular speed.</p> <p>It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s just a demonstration of the thrills and spills of investing in technology, it could be said. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s something in that idea, of course, since nobody owns these stocks for a dull life. Investors are betting on fabulous rates of earnings growth, projected many years into the future. It only takes a modest shift in the financial weather for valuation to be whacked.</p> <p>Yet tech stocks do not inhabit an entirely different investment universe. There are at least two reasons why the current tech rout may be signalling broader market worries.</p> <p>First, investors may be looking at 2019 and deciding that the only way is slower for the global economy. One engine \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the US \u00e2\u20ac\u201c has been running in overdrive this year as President Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tax cuts have fed into the system. That effect will fade and next year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s story will be the pace at which the US Federal Reserve lifts interest rates. There is a risk of the Fed doing too much, too soon. Meanwhile, the other global driver \u00e2\u20ac\u201c China \u00e2\u20ac\u201c is spluttering. A growth rate of 6.5% looks good from a western perspective but is the slowest since the 2008 financial crisis. There is nothing that will obviously improve next year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s outlook.</p> <p>That is partly because of the second factor \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the US-China trade war. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153If you want a short-term solution, there is no solution,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Jack Ma, the Alibaba billionaire in September, predicting 20 years of trade hostility. Investors didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to believe it, but they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve having to reassess.</p> <p>Hopes of a truce at this month\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s G20 are low and falling after US vice-president Mike Pence said at an Asia Pacific conference this week that the US \u00e2\u20ac\u0153will not change course until China changes its ways\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Meanwhile, China has launched a high-profile price-fixing investigation into three big computer chip makers, including one US firm. That affair may be unrelated, but it clearly doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t make peace over intellectual property more likely. On current form, you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d bet that the next round of US tariff hikes \u00e2\u20ac\u201c scheduled for January \u00e2\u20ac\u201c will happen.</p> <p>\u00e2\u20ac\u0153All good things eventually come to an end,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Goldman Sachs\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 market analysts on Tuesday, striking a bearish tone in their predictions for 2019. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Cash will represent a competitive asset class to stocks for the first time in many years,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd the Wall Street bank said. That is eye-catching, as end-of-year forecasts are supposed to be, but it reflects the suddenly downbeat mood. If Apple can no longer shift more iPhones at higher prices, which is the micro worry about the tech sector, something big may have changed.</p> <h2>Bumpy road ahead for Renault</h2> <p>The reaction of senior Renault executives to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/nov/20/ghosns-arrest-casts-doubt-on-fate-of-three-car-alliance\">the arrest of Carlos Ghosn</a> was fascinating. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153On your behalf, we would like to state here our full support for our chairman and CEO,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd wrote chief operating officer Thierry Bollor\u00c3\u00a9 to staff, before stating that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the governance bodies are playing their full role in defending Groupe Renault\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s corporate interest\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd.</p> <p>It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not hard to read between the lines. On the Renault side, they clearly don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t trust the process by which Ghosn has been accused of under-reporting his income at Nissan and committing \u00e2\u20ac\u0153numerous\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd misdeeds. And they clearly suspect this affair will turn into a battle for control of a three-way corporate alliance that also contains Mitsubishi.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to the daily Business Today email\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/3887\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for Business Today\" data-form-description=\"Get the headlines and editors' picks every weekday morning.\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk</figcaption> </figure>  <p>One can understand Renault management\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s suspicions. Nissan chief executive Hiroto Saikawa didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t wait to hear if Ghosn denies the fraud charges. Nor did he attempt to explain if Nissan, or its auditors, could have been complicit in any alleged wrongdoing. He just seemed anxious to condemn the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153negative\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd aspects of Ghosn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s regime and ignore the obvious questions about lax governance at Nissan itself.</p> <p>If Renault\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s top brass smell a power grab, you couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t blame them. Given the relative recent performance of the two companies, Renault, owner of 43% Nissan, desperately needs the partnership to hold. The FT\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s revelation on Tuesday that Ghosn had been planning a merger between Renault and Nissan before his arrest in Tokyo, and that Japanese firm\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s board was opposed, will only deepen tensions.</p> <p>Good luck to the French government, owner of 15% of Renault. This tale looks set to become very messy very quickly.</p>",

There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s something in that idea, of course, since nobody owns these stocks for a dull life. Investors are betting on fabulous rates of earnings growth, projected many years into the future. It only takes a modest shift in the financial weather for valuation to be whacked. Yet tech stocks do not inhabit an entirely different investment universe. There are at least two reasons why the current tech rout may be signalling broader market worries. First, investors may be looking at 2019 and deciding that the only way is slower for the global economy. One engine \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the US \u00e2\u20ac\u201c has been running in overdrive this year as President Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tax cuts have fed into the system. That effect will fade and next year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s story will be the pace at which the US Federal Reserve lifts interest rates. There is a risk of the Fed doing too much, too soon. Meanwhile, the other global driver \u00e2\u20ac\u201c China \u00e2\u20ac\u201c is spluttering. A growth rate of 6.5% looks good from a western perspective but is the slowest since the 2008 financial crisis. There is nothing that will obviously improve next year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s outlook. That is partly because of the second factor \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the US-China trade war. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153If you want a short-term solution, there is no solution,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Jack Ma, the Alibaba billionaire in September, predicting 20 years of trade hostility. Investors didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to believe it, but they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve having to reassess. Hopes of a truce at this month\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s G20 are low and falling after US vice-president Mike Pence said at an Asia Pacific conference this week that the US \u00e2\u20ac\u0153will not change course until China changes its ways\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Meanwhile, China has launched a high-profile price-fixing investigation into three big computer chip makers, including one US firm. That affair may be unrelated, but it clearly doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t make peace over intellectual property more likely. On current form, you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d bet that the next round of US tariff hikes \u00e2\u20ac\u201c scheduled for January \u00e2\u20ac\u201c will happen. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153All good things eventually come to an end,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Goldman Sachs\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 market analysts on Tuesday, striking a bearish tone in their predictions for 2019. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Cash will represent a competitive asset class to stocks for the first time in many years,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd the Wall Street bank said. That is eye-catching, as end-of-year forecasts are supposed to be, but it reflects the suddenly downbeat mood. If Apple can no longer shift more iPhones at higher prices, which is the micro worry about the tech sector, something big may have changed. Bumpy road ahead for Renault The reaction of senior Renault executives to the arrest of Carlos Ghosn was fascinating. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153On your behalf, we would like to state here our full support for our chairman and CEO,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd wrote chief operating officer Thierry Bollor\u00c3\u00a9 to staff, before stating that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the governance bodies are playing their full role in defending Groupe Renault\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s corporate interest\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not hard to read between the lines. On the Renault side, they clearly don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t trust the process by which Ghosn has been accused of under-reporting his income at Nissan and committing \u00e2\u20ac\u0153numerous\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd misdeeds. And they clearly suspect this affair will turn into a battle for control of a three-way corporate alliance that also contains Mitsubishi. One can understand Renault management\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s suspicions. Nissan chief executive Hiroto Saikawa didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t wait to hear if Ghosn denies the fraud charges. Nor did he attempt to explain if Nissan, or its auditors, could have been complicit in any alleged wrongdoing. He just seemed anxious to condemn the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153negative\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd aspects of Ghosn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s regime and ignore the obvious questions about lax governance at Nissan itself. If Renault\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s top brass smell a power grab, you couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t blame them. Given the relative recent performance of the two companies, Renault, owner of 43% Nissan, desperately needs the partnership to hold. The FT\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s revelation on Tuesday that Ghosn had been planning a merger between Renault and Nissan before his arrest in Tokyo, and that Japanese firm\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s board was opposed, will only deepen tensions. Good luck to the French government, owner of 15% of Renault. This tale looks set to become very messy very quickly.",

It owns the Stoke City Football Club, while many of its 4,000-member workforce are based at its sprawling headquarters near Hanley, Stoke\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s de facto city centre. Bet365 does not seem keen on media scrutiny and rarely answers inquiries, choosing to disclose only what it must in regulated filings with Companies House. It has not, for instance, addressed any criticism of Coates\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pay deal, which some have found jarring in a week when new figures showed an alarming rise in the number of child problem gamblers. Charles and Liz Ritchie, who founded the Gambling With Lives charity after their son, Jack, killed himself after a gambling addiction, said they found Coates\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s payout \u00e2\u20ac\u0153particularly upsetting\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in the circumstances. While Coates gives much of her cash to good causes, such as the Douglas Macmillan Hospice and Alzheimer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Research UK, her foundation\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s page on the Charity Commission website offers no indication of whether any of it goes to problem gambling treatment. Her largesse is also partly funded by a relatively low UK corporation tax rate, and the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00c2\u00a378m tax contribution last year was rather less than one might expect, thanks in part to subsidiaries in jurisdictions such as Gibraltar, a haven for gambling firms. Bet365 has also been coy about where its customers are based. A Guardian investigation in 2014 found that punters in China \u00e2\u20ac\u201c where betting is banned in all but a few tightly controlled arenas \u00e2\u20ac\u201c were jailed after apparently placing bets on the Bet365 website. The company said it was not breaking any laws but would not confirm whether or not it accepted stakes. In this week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s accounts Bet365 said disclosing any more about its regional income \u00e2\u20ac\u0153would be severely prejudicial to the interests of the group\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. A recruitment page reveals the company is looking for \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Chinese language customer account advisors\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, though it could be targeting Chinese speakers in the UK or elsewhere. Unless Bet365 volunteers more information, it will remain one of Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s most opaque companies \u00e2\u20ac\u201c but also one of its most successful.",

                "bodyText":"Nissan\u00e2\u20ac\u02dcs former chair Carlos Ghosn has denied allegations that he used company funds to pay for his luxury lifestyle, claiming he had no intention of making false financial statements. The Brazil-born tycoon, who has not spoken publicly since he was arrested last Monday, told prosecutors he did not intend to understate his income on financial reports, according to Japanese public broadcaster NHK. Ghosn, who was sacked as Nissan chairman last Thursday, is at the centre of a corruption investigation that has stunned the business world and put in doubt one of the most successful car alliances of the last 20 years. The scandal is also being viewed increasingly as a battle between Nissan and Renault, the French car company that Ghosn also runs and which has a controlling share in the Japanese carmaker. Prosecutors accuse Ghosn and fellow executive Greg Kelly of underreporting the former chairman\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s income by around 5bn yen ($44m). Kelly also denied the allegations, saying Ghosn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s salaries were paid appropriately, news reports said. Local media reported that Nissan had formed a secret team earlier this year to probe the alleged financial misconduct. A small team involving Nissan\u00e2\u20ac\u02dcs board members carried out its internal investigation confidentially on concerns about possible destruction of evidence by Ghosn, Japan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Kyodo News reported, quoting unnamed sources. Ghosn is being held custody in a Tokyo detention centre, which prosecutors hope to extend beyond Wednesday to continue their questioning. Meanwhile Renault-Nissan executives are understood to be preparing to shield their joint operations from a looming power struggle between the carmakers. Top executives from both manufacturers and third partner Mitsubishi will attend mid-week operations committee meetings in Amsterdam that had been planned before Ghosn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s detention in Japan. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153There is no change in our alliance relationship,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd a Mitsubishi spokesman said. While Nissan and 43.4% owner Renault have vowed to safeguard the partnership, the Japanese carmaker\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chief executive Hiroto Saikawa also made clear he wants to end its French parent\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s control of the alliance. Renault has refrained from dismissing Ghosn as chair and CEO, while demanding that Nissan share its findings from the months-long internal investigation that led to his arrest. The French finance minister, Bruno Le Maire, said the Paris government and Renault had yet to see evidence to support Nissan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s allegations of wrongdoing. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We still have no information on the reproaches against Carlos Ghosn and on the charges that Nissan transmitted to the Japanese justice.

Seven of the eight members of the board of Mitsubishi, part of an industry alliance created by Ghosn that also includes Renault, held an extraordinary meeting on Monday to decide his fate, days after Nissan sacked him as chair. The news came as the chief executive of Nissan said the Japanese carmaker could seek to change the terms of the alliance with Renault. Ghosn, who allegedly also abused company assets for personal use, remains in detention in Tokyo but has reportedly denied the allegations, according to Japanese media. He has not been charged.

He denies allegations of financial misconduct, claiming he had no intention of making false reports, according to Japanese public broadcaster NHK. Greg Kelly, a former representative director at Nissan who is suspected of masterminding the deception, also denies the allegations, saying Ghosn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s salary had been paid appropriately. Neither man has been charged. Under Japanese law, a suspect can be held without charge for up to 23 days. A spokesman for Nissan said its board had decided unanimously to end Ghosn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 19-year reign as chairman last Thursday \u00e2\u20ac\u0153based on the copious amount and compelling nature of the evidence of misconduct presented\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. The Mitsubishi board comprises Ghosn, Masuko, two executives each from Nissan and Mitsubishi group companies, as well as two outside appointees \u00e2\u20ac\u201c an academic and a writer. France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy minister, Bruno Le Maire, has urged Nissan to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153quickly\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd share its evidence against Ghosn, saying the latter would stay on as head of Renault \u00e2\u20ac\u0153until there are tangible charges\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Le Maire added, however, that he did not believe \u00e2\u20ac\u0153conspiracy theories\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd that Ghosn had been the victim of a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153palace coup\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to prevent him from merging Nissan and Renault. He said France and Japan were keen to strengthen the companies\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 alliance. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The alliance is in the interest of [the] Japanese and French, and I wish for a strengthening of the alliance that would respect existing cross-shareholding,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Le Maire told BFM TV.",

                "bodyText":"It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been a good day across European stock markets, despite the waves of political risk out there. Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB has closed 2.7% higher, as the suggestions from Rome that it could compromise over its budget reassured traders (even though they were rather vague hints). In London, the FTSE 100 ended 83 points higher at 7,036, a gain of 1.2%. Fiona Cincotta of City Index says a dollop of Brexit optimism helped UK shares rise. Optimism was the name of the game in trading on Monday as the FTSE joined its European peers rallying higher. As shoppers were taking advantage of Cyber Monday discounts, bargain hunters were also scouring global markets. On the FTSE, rebounding oil prices, boosting oil majors and a strong showing from financials overshadowed a drop in base metal prices dragging on the miners. Banks put in a noticeably strong performance with the likes of HSBC, Royal Bank of Scotland and Barclays dominating the upper reaches of the FTSE. Banks surged thanks to a double whammy of Brexit optimism, following the signing off the Brexit deal by EU leaders, and the spill over effect from Italy potentially avoiding disciplinary procedures from Brussels. Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s DAX gained 1.5%, while the French CAC rose by 1%. Italian bonds have also strengthened, as Capital Economics explains: Markets have responded positively to conciliatory comments from Italian government officials over the weekend and on Monday which suggest that the government might change its budget deficit target for 2019. On Monday, the ten-year government bond yield in Italy fell by around 20 basis points from its close on Friday, leaving it just above 3.2%. The spread to German Bunds fell below 300 basis points, to its lowest level in around two weeks. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s all for today. GW Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our news story on the GM job cuts, which are deeper than I first suggested: Shares in GM have jumped 5% as Wall Street welcomes its plan to close factories and cut jobs. Back at the European Parliament, Mario Draghi has urged MEPs to learn the lessons of the last eurozone crisis: The US car industry has been hit with a blow - General Motors is cutting over 5,000 jobs, and closing three factories. Bad news for workers, and hardly a sign that Donald Trump is bringing jobs back to America.... The Detroit Free Press has details: General Motors will close three assembly plants by the end of 2019, it said Thursday, including Detroit-Hamtramck, Lordstown in Ohio and Oshawa in Ontario. Approximately 5,600 jobs are at stake: roughly 1,500 in Hamtramck; 1,600 in Lordstown; and about 2,500 in Oshawa. The Hamtramck plant makes the Chevrolet Volt and Impala, the Cadillac CT6 and the Buick LaCrosse. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153GM is continuing to take proactive steps to improve overall business performance, including the reorganization of its global product development staffs, the realignment of its manufacturing capacity and a reduction of salaried workforce,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd the company said in a news release Monday. Over in New York, shares have opened higher after last week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s truncated sessions (due to Thanksgiving). The Dow has gained 1.3%, or over 300 points, in early trading. I think we can read between the lines here.... Mario Draghi has also called for eurozone government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s to respect the eurozone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u02dccommon rules\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s an unsubtle hint to Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s government to adjust its 2019 budget, to avoid breaching EC deficit targets. Newsflash: the Eurozone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s top central bank has warned that Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy is slowing. Testifying to MEPs, Mario Draghi, president of the ECB, flagged up that recent data have been \u00e2\u20ac\u0153somewhat weaker than expected\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd [reminder: growth in the eurozone has slowed to just 0.2%]. He is pinning some of the blame on trade conflicts, a hint that Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tariffs on European steel, and his clashes with China, are hurting the global economy. Draghi also blamed \u00e2\u20ac\u0153some country and sector-specific factors\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd -- which probably includes the slowdown in Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s car sector following new emission tests. The ECB chief isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t panicking though; he argues that such as slowdown is to be expected, adding: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153There is good reason to be confident that underlying inflation will gradually rise in the period ahead. Recent developments confirm the Governing Council\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s earlier assessments of the medium-term inflation outlook.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve not heard anything from Carlos Ghosn since he was arrested a week ago after landing in Japan. But these photos give a glimpse of life at the Tokyo Detention Center where he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s spent the last week, being questioned about claims he misused Nissan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s funds and deliberately under-reported his salary to the Tokyo stock exchanges. Newsflash: Israel has raised interest rates, for the first time since 2011. We have some grim, but unsurprising news for UK workers -- they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve suffered the weakest real wage growth of any advanced economy in the last decade. According to the International Labour Organization, Britain ranked bottom of a group of nine wealthy nations for its pay performance since 2009. Real wages (stripping out the impact of inflation) have shrunk by 5% in the UK since the financial crisis. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s slightly worse than Italy and far behind other major G20 nations such as the US and Germany. South Korea had the strongest real wage growth at 15%. Carlos Ghosn was a uniquely powerful business chief - chairing three car companies under the Nissan-Renault-Mitsubishi alliance. Indeed, he was hailed as a popular hero in Japan before his arrest last week. Professor Konstantinos Stathopoulos, professor of accounting and finance at Alliance Manchester Business School, says this shows the perils of putting too much faith in a single leader: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Mitsubishi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s move to dismiss Carlos Ghosn as chairman is the result of another significant corporate governance failure under the watch of a super boss. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It follows his arrest and subsequent firing as chairman of Nissan and raises important questions over board oversight in companies that operate across different jurisdictions and, importantly, use unconventional corporate structures. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Ghosn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s departure is one in a number of high-profile business leaders who have been removed from their positions in recent months. But this idea of the super boss won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t go away any time soon, since it serves \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and is fuelled by \u00e2\u20ac\u201c societal norms rather than corporate needs. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Shareholders are likely to have a good understanding of the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153true\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd value of a company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s boss, but as a society we seem to prefer associating failures or successes to individuals, rather than the business as a whole. The hero and villain stories will always be more appealing.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Back in the UK, the search for the face of Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new \u00c2\u00a350 note has moved forwards (a little). The Bank of England has released a lengthy list of suggestions from the public, since it invited nominations for a worthy, deceased scientist. Some famous names are on the list -- from Ada Lovelace and Alan Turing (the godparents of modern computing) to Francis Crick and Rosalind Franklin (who cracked the structure of DNA). Physicist James Clerk Maxwell, chemist Dorothy Hodgkin and engineers Isambard Kingdom Brunel and John Logie Baird are also on the list. So are some more obscure names, and a few remarkable ones -- including Margaret Thatcher (who studied under Hodgkin and worked as a chemist before making more of a splash in politics) and comedy actor Will Hay (who was a successful amateur astronomer when not entertaining the public with classics like Oh! Mr Porter) You can still nominate worthy candidates here. While Mitsubishi was meeting to dismiss Carlos Ghosn, Nissan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new interim chairman was updating staff on the situation. Hiroto Saikawa told employees in Japan, and around the globe, that he was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153shocked\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd at his former mentor\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s alleged misconduct. AFP has more details: At a 45-minute meeting attended by hundreds of staff at the firm\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Yokohama HQ and broadcast internally to other sites, Saikawa stressed that the scandal should not affect day-to-day operations. Saikawa, who rose through the Nissan ranks under Ghosn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s wing, has already spoken of his \u00e2\u20ac\u0153great resentment and dismay\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd at the allegations. According to Japanese media, Nissan formed a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153secret\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd cell within the firm to look into the alleged financial misdeeds. Christian Stadler, professor of strategic management at Warwick Business School, has predicted that more heads may roll... \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It is not surprising that Mitsubishi has followed Nissan in sacking Carlos Ghosn, he may not be the only person to lose his job over this scandal. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It will be interesting to see whether any Nissan executives are forced to resign as well. It seems implausible that they did not know about his incredibly lucrative financial arrangements. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The executives probably know this could jeopardise their own positions. Therefore I am inclined to think it was not them who exposed Mr Ghosn, despite speculation that the leak was an attempt to get rid of him. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153A more plausible interpretation is that Nissan CEO Hiroto Saikawa\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s statement of shock was an attempt to protect himself after being surprised that this became such a scandal.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Mitsubishi have released a statement to the Tokyo stock market, confirming that Carlos Ghosn has been dismissed as chairman. They say that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153it is considered difficult\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd for Ghosn to do the job, following the allegations of financial misconduct at Nissan. Ghosn retains a seat on Mitsubishi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s board, though -- as only a shareholder vote can remove a serving board member. Losing two chairmanships in a week is bad enough, but Carlos Ghosn also face the possibility of a decade behind bars -- IF the allegations of financial misconduct are proved in court. Our Japan correspondent Justin McCurry explains: Carlos Ghosn has been sacked as chairman of Mitsubishi Motors, a week after the disgraced auto tycoon was arrested over allegations that he underreported his income by millions of dollars \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a crime that carries a possible 10-year prison sentence. Seven of the eight members of the board of Mitsubishi, part of an industry alliance created by Ghosn that also includes Renault, held an extraordinary meeting on Monday to decide his fate, days after Nissan sacked him as chairman. Ghosn, who allegedly also abused company assets for personal use, remains in detention in Tokyo but has reportedly denied the allegations, according to Japanese media. Mitsubishi said its chief executive, Osamu Masuko, will become temporary chairman. Ghosn, 64, was once hailed as a visionary after saving Nissan from bankruptcy in 1990s by spearheading its alliance with Renault. Nissan then took a 34% stake in Mitsubishi, which employs more than 30,000 people, in 2016. The group grew to be the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s top-selling car company, with some 10.6m vehicles rolling off the production line last year. It employs about 450,000 people worldwide. While Nissan vowed to retain its ties to Renault, reports in Japan claimed Nissan executives were disturbed by Ghosn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s plans to turn the alliance into a full-blown merger. More here: Ghosn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s case is an early test of Japan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new corporate whistle-blowing laws. These laws are meant to make it easier to tackle crimes such as tax evasion and bribery, by offering more lenient sentences to insiders who report such crimes. But there are already concerns over Ghosn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s arrest, as Magdalena Osumi of The Japan Times reports: Nobuo Gohara, a former prosecutor and now lawyer at Gohara Compliance and Law Office in Tokyo, believes the legal grounds for Ghosn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s arrest are murky. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I think it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a common procedure for prosecutors to collect enough hard evidence and consult with legal authorities, but this time around it was not clear what the hidden payment was,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Gohara said at a news conference at the Foreign Correspondents\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Club of Japan in Tokyo. He called the investigation that led to Ghosn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s arrest \u00e2\u20ac\u0153violent\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and \u00e2\u20ac\u0153haphazardly done.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Associated Press\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s take on Ghosn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s dismissal from Mitsubishi today: The board of Japanese automaker Mitsubishi Motors, which is allied with Renault and Nissan, voted Monday to dismiss Carlos Ghosn as its chairman after his arrest last week, citing a lack of trust. Prosecutors arrested Ghosn on Nov. 19 on suspicion of under-reporting his income by $44 million over five years. Nissan Motor Co. ousted him as its chairman last week, saying an internal investigation found Ghosn abused company money and assets. Mitsubishi said its current CEO, Osamu Masuko, will serve as both acting chairman and CEO pending a general shareholders meeting. It said Ghosn had lost the trust of Nissan and would find it difficult to continue to act as chairman. Masuko told reporters the board\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision was unanimous. Seven of Mitsubishi Motors Corp.\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s eight-member board attended Monday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meeting, the company said. Motoko Rich of the New York Times points out that Carlos Ghosn hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t actually been charged by the authorities, after a week of questioning. Journalists Peter Hoskins flags up that Ghosn still has one job left - chair and CEO of Renault. Over the weekend, more allegations of financial misconduct by Carlos Ghosn appeared in the newspapers. Insiders claimed that Nissan had made donations to a foreign university attended by one of his daughters, and also funded family trips. There are also claims that Nissan paid for several luxury homes around the world for their former chairman, who is also accused of misstating his salary by 5 billion yen (\u00c2\u00a334m) over several years. Ghosn insists that he is innocent. Japanese newspaper The Mainichi explains: Ghosn has been telling investigators that he did not commit any wrongdoing. His close aide Greg Kelly, who is also under arrest in the same case, has told an individual who met him in detention that Ghosn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u0153executive remuneration was properly listed in the financial statements\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd submitted to the authorities. Kelly is also quoted as saying that he \u00e2\u20ac\u0153did not receive illicit instructions\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd from Ghosn, according to those related to the case. Mitsubishi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s CEO (and new interim chairman) Osamu Masuko has told reporters that sacking Ghosn was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153an agonising decision,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd but a necessary one to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153protect the company\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. The decision to remove Ghosn from the chairmanship was unanimous, Mitsubishi says. Newsflash: Japanese automaker Mitsubishi has sacked chairman Carlos Ghosn, a week after the car magnate was arrested over allegations of financial misconduct. Mitsubishi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s board acted four days after Nissan also voted to remove Ghosn, who is accused of misusing company funds and under-declaring his salary. Ghosn, who is currently locked up in a Tokyo detention centre, became Mitsubishi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chairman two years ago when he added the company to his Nissan-Renault alliance. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Reuters\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 early take: Ghosn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ouster marks the end of his chairmanship of Japanese automakers, just two years after he was praised for bringing a steadying hand to Mitsubishi Motors following a cheating scandal in 2016. CEO Osamu Masuko will become temporary chairman, the automaker said. The move comes amid discontent over French partner Renault SA\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s role in the 19-year alliance of which Ghosn was the driving force. Sealed in 1999 when Nissan was rescued from near-bankruptcy, it was enlarged in 2016 to include Mitsubishi and enabled the members to jointly develop products and control costs. The alliance vies with Volkswagen AG and Toyota Motor Corp for the ranking of the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest automaker. More to follow! Just in: German business morale has fallen again, for the third month running. IFO, the Munich-based thinktank, reports that its business morale index dropped to 102.0, from 102.9 in October, and lower than expected. IFO chief Clemens Fuest warned that storm clouds are gathering: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Sentiment among German businesses weakened further this month. Companies scaled back their assessments of the current business situation albeit from a high level. Their business expectations also clouded over.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd IFO also fears that the German economy could be facing an economic turnaround, having contracted by 0.2% in the last quarter... There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no sign of a Brexit Bounce in the City this morning, after EU leaders signed off the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s withdrawal agreement yesterday. The pound is still bobbing in the $1.28 zone against the US dollar, as traders ponder whether Britain will avoid crashing out of the block without a deal in four months time. With the parliamentary maths still against Theresa May, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not clear what will happen if MPs reject the proposal later this month. Some analysts expect a second vote, remembering the row over America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s TARP bailout programme a decade ago. Labour\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shadow Brexit spokesman, Keir Starmer, has argued this morning that the process could be extended - giving more time to negotiate a new deal. But with EU leaders insisting yesterday that no other deal is possible, there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not much to cheer investors this morning. Shorter-dated Italian government debt are strengthening sharply this morning. The yield (or interest rate) on Italian two-year bonds has fallen to 0.7%, from 0.95% on Friday. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a big move, suggesting Italy is seen as a less-risky investment. European stock markets are roaring back! Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB has jumped by 3%, following Matteo Salvini\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s conciliatory comments on the budget, led by financial stocks. In London, the FTSE 100 has gained 75 points, or over 1%, to 7026 points. Connor Campbell of SpreadEx says investors are cheered by the prospect that relations between Italy and the EU are thawing. Comments from Italian deputy PM Matteo Salvini on Sunday, hinting that the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s controversial 2.4% budget deficit could be lowered, came after reports of a meeting between Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte and European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker on Saturday night. These signs of progress were like catnip for good news-hungry investors, explaining the over-sized reaction of the European indices. A junior Italian government minister has also hinted that the 2019 budget could be tweaked, to address Brussels\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 concerns. Armando Siri, a transport ministry undersecretary, told the Il Messaggero newspaper that: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153In order to save the budget and avoid an increase in market turbulence ... a small fine-tuning (of the deficit target) could be considered,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Italian banking shares have surged by almost 5% in early trading, as relief ripples through trading floors in Milan. Italian bonds are rallying this morning, on hopes of a breakthrough in the long-running budget battle with Brussels. Yesterday, deputy PM Matteo Salvini appeared to signal that Rome could lower its borrowing targets, which would calm the storm with the EU. The comments came just days after the EU again rejected Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 2019 budget, over plans to run a 2.4% deficit to meet its government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s spending promises. Salvini hinted that there is room to negotiate, telling newswire AdnKronos: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I think nobody is fixated on this, if there is a budget which makes the country grow, it could be 2.2 percent or 2.6 percent.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Clearly a 2.6% deficit would only prompt more ire from Brussels! But the idea that the deficit could be trimmed is cheering investors. This has driven the yield on Italian 10-year bonds down to just 3.2%, a two-month low, and narrowing the spread with German debt: Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Political drama is looming over the financial markets again, as traders watch events from Westminster to the Crimean sea. The news that EU leaders have backed Theresa May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Brexit deal isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t giving the pound a lift. Sterling is bobbing around the $1.28 mark, where it ended last week, as investors ponder whether the agreement can possibly get through parliament. As David Madden of CMC Markets says: Theresa May has a difficult task ahead of her as she has to sell the withdrawal agreement to her own party. The EU over the weekend made it very clear that it is a take it or leave it situation in relation to the deal. Prime Minister May will struggle to get fellow Conservatives to support her as many pro-Brexit and anti-Brexit MPs don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t like the deal she struck. There are questions about what would happen in the event of the deal being voted down \u00e2\u20ac\u201c it would open up the possibility of a no-deal Brexit. Investors are also concerned by the latest military tensions between Moscow and Kiev. Last night, Russia fired at several Ukrainian ships and captures three vessels off the coast of Crimea. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the biggest clash since the invasion of Crimea four years ago, and another geopolitical risk to worry the markets. Oil could also be volatile today, after plunging to its lowest level in over a year on Friday. Also coming up today It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cyber Monday, so retailers will be doing their best to dip into our pockets. European Central Bank president Mario Draghi is testifying to the European Parliament lawmakers; expect questions on Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s budget, Brexit, and weakening growth in the eurozone.

The strong figures from John Lewis will raise hopes of a better than expected Christmas for the retailer after early data for Black Friday, which fell on 23 November, suggested shoppers had cut back this year. Barclaycard said that shoppers had spent 10% less on the day by mid-afternoon, while footfall in town centres, shopping centres and retail parks was down by 6%, according to the shopper monitoring firm Springboard. Part of that change was because shoppers were able to spread their bargain hunting over a longer period of time because retailers began discounting earlier. Figures from the CBI, released on Tuesday, revealed that overall retail sales increased last month, especially at supermarkets and at shops selling household and recreational goods. Analysts said the pick-up in sales was better than expected after a poor October when sales dropped to their weakest level since last April. But the amount of goods sold dropped in shops selling clothing, footwear, furniture and carpets, and in hardware and DIY stores. And the broadly healthier picture in November after a weak October was unable to prevent an eighth quarter in a row of declining employment across the retail sector. Anna Leach, the CBI head of economic intelligence, said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153While it is encouraging to see headline retail sales growth strengthen in November after a weak outturn in October, the quarterly survey continues to paint a gloomy picture of the sector.

                "bodyText":"And finally, the Dow has closed 108 points higher, or 0.44%. Worries over the prospect of a deeper US-China trade war were tempered by Larry Kudlow\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s suggestion that Donald Trump could cut a deal with president Xi. But Wall Street still felt nervous, with traders worrying what might happen at the G20 meeting. Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s threat to impose tariffs on hundreds of billions more Chinese imports has worried investors - as it would hurt companies such as Apple. General Motors shares ended in the red, down 2.5%, after being roasted by the president on Twitter. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s all for today. GW It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s looking like a quiet finish to trading in New York. With 15 minutes to go, the Dow is up 75 points or 0.3% at 24,715, the S&amp;P 500 is 0.2% higher, and the Nasdaq is flat. Donald Trump is right to criticise Theresa May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade deal, according to a former UK cabinet minister. Peter Mandelson, who also served as an EU trade representative, says the US president was talking \u00e2\u20ac\u0153perfect sense\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd when he said the UK would struggle to sign a trade deal with America. If we enter the transition period immediately after Brexit on 30 March next year, we will still be bound by all EU rules \u00e2\u20ac\u201c without having a say over them \u00e2\u20ac\u201c for a period of at least 21 months. The prime minister herself has begun to suggest that this transition period will need to be extended and article 132 of the withdrawal agreement says this extension could last until 31 December 2022. This would mean that for almost four years, the UK would have to follow all EU trade rules and stay inside the customs union. While it may be possible to begin negotiating a new trading relationship with some countries if they were interested during the transition, nothing could be implemented before the transition period had expired. Nor is it clear that there would be anything to negotiate beyond that point, if there is no solution to the Irish border question. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s because the backstop is deployed in the absence of a solution, so the UK remains in the customs union indefinitely. None of this would make negotiating a notional trade deal with the UK a high priority for other countries, including the US. CNBC have more details of Larry Kudlow\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s comments on trade, and Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s willingness to make a deal with China: Washington and Beijing have re-engaged about a path toward a trade agreement, and the summit offers \u00e2\u20ac\u0153an opportunity to break through what has been disappointing discussions\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in recent months, Kudlow told reporters on Tuesday. At the G-20, Trump will focus on issues including alleged Chinese theft of intellectual property, ownership of American companies in China and tariffs and non-tariff barriers, the National Economic Council director said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re having now a lot of communication with the Chinese government at all levels,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Kudlow said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We were at a total standstill. Nothing was going on.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders has been asked about president Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tweets about GM. However, she couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t give more details about any withdrawal of subsidies, saying: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know that there is a specific timeline.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Shares in GM are now down 3% following Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s blast. Newsflash: Donald Trump has just threatened to withhold government subsidies from General Motors. He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s furious that the company announced plans to close plants and lay off thousands of staff (plunging its workforce into uncertainty but boosting GM\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shares). Trump, though, isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t addressing that fact that his tariffs on imported steel have driven up GM\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s costs, and probably contributed to CEO Mary Barra\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision President Donald Trump is open to reaching a trade deal with China but is prepared to go ahead with more tariffs if one isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t struck, National Economic Council director Larry Kudlow has said, via Marketwatch. Apple shares are still under pressure, down 1% at $173.31. The threat of fresh US tariffs is worrying traders, as UBS analyst Timothy Arcuri explains: Apple is a significant employer in China and this administration has urged the company to move more manufacturing to the U.S.,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd . \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This could simply be a negotiating tactic ahead of the G20 Summit later this week, though we do note that this administration has proven a willingness to push forward with such actions. David Madden of CMC Markets UK sums up the day: Stock markets are in the red following yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bullish move. Fears regarding, US-China trade, Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s budget and Brexit all play into the mix. President Trump warned that that levy on Chinese imports might be increased, and further tariffs could be announced. This dampened investors\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 hopes about a deal being struck at the G20 summit. European stock markets have closed, with small losses across the board. The FTSE 100 ended 19 points lower at 7,016, a small reversal on Monday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rally. Well, this might be awkward. Apple CEO Tim Cook and Ivanka Trump, the president\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s daughter and advisor, are visiting schools in Idaho together on Tuesday. They\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be dropping in on Idaho\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Wilder School District, which has signed up to Apple\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ConnectEd program. That means all students at two schools, Wilder Elementary and Wilder Middle-High School, receive iPads as part of a $100m grant from Apple. Teachers received MacBooks and iPad minis. Ivanka sounds excited about it; perhaps a bright pupil might ask about trade wars?.... The global economy could suffer badly over the next decade if the US-China trade war escalates, according to new research from Rabobank. The Dutch financial services group has calculated that the global economy would lose out on 0.7 percentage points of growth by 2030, unless the two sides reach a ceasefire. And if further tariffs are imposed, as Donald Trump is threatening, the impact would be much worse -- wiping out 2 percentage points of growth. And there are no winners in this scenario, Rabobank says. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s more details: Escalating trade war could see global GDP growth drop 2 per cent meaning hundreds of billions of dollars in lost growth by 2030, compared to a no-trade-war scenario China would be hit hardest with the economy losing $2,100bn by 2030, with US incurring a $370bn hit Euro area to feel knock-on effect with combined economy seeing a $60bn shortfall by 2030 Hugo Erken, senior economist at Rabobank, says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Our analysis demonstrates the stark reality that an ongoing trade war between the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s two largest economies has much broader ramifications that transcend their own borders. It shows that in a globalised economy, there are no real winners from such policies.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Capital Economics has spotted some worrying signs in today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s US consumer confidence report: Although they have generally picked up over the past couple of months specifically, the shares of respondents planning to buy a home, motor vehicle or major appliance remain lower than their 2017 peaks. That shift in sentiment is already showing up in weaker housing activity, and we suspect it won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be long before that weakness starts to spread to other rate-sensitive sectors of the economy. Wall Street is recovering some of its early losses, in choppy trading. The Dow is now down 100 points, having been 200 points south just after the open. Just in: US consumer confidence has dipped, but remains high by historical standards. The Conference Board\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s consumer confidence index slipped to 135.7 this month, down from 137.9 in October. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a bigger fall than expected. According to the Board, Americans are a little less optimistic about future business conditions and their own wage growth. More positively, consumers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 assessment of current conditions increased slightly, with job growth the main driver of improvement. The trade war jitters could see Apple lose the crown of being America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s most valuable company. Its market capitalisation has dropped to around $815bn in early trading, I reckon. That takes it below Microsoft, which is currently worth some $817bn. Less than four months ago, Apple was celebrating becoming the first US company to be worth one trillion dollars. Recent stock market volatility has taken a big chunk out of its value. Fiona Cincotta, senior market analyst City Index, explains why Apple\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shares are vulnerable to trade war fears: Preparing the ground for the talks with his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping this Saturday President Trump has laid out his threats. He plans to increase tariffs to 25% on $200 billion in Chinese-made goods if a deal is not reached and potentially bringing in tariffs on imports of iPhones and Macbooks made in China. While China is not budging on the tariff front \u00e2\u20ac\u201c it is responding in kind to any US tariff increases\u00e2\u20ac\u201c the country has been addressing the issue of opening up to foreign investments and companies. Ding ding. The New York stock exchange is open, and traders are giving their verdict on the US-China trade spat. The Dow Jones industrial average has fallen by 209 points, or 0.84%, to 24,437 points. Apple has dropped by 1.5%, following Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s threat to impose tariffs on another $267bn of Chinese imports, including iPhones made in China. Some reaction to the US house price data: Just in: US house price growth has slowed to a near two-year low. The closely-watched Case-Shiller index shows that US house prices only rose by 5.5% year-on-year in September, down from 5.7% in August. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the lowest rate since January 2017, and may show that recent US interest rate hikes are making mortgages less affordable. Global stock markets are weakening, as investors digest Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s threat to impose more tariffs on China unless Beijing backs down over trade. The Europe-wide Stoxx 600 index has lost around 0.5%, with Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE 100, German DAX and French CAC all losing ground. Wall Street is now expected to drop when trading begins in an hour\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time. The Dow is called down 150 points, or 0.6%. Lukman Otunuga, research analyst at FXTM, says investors should brace for \u00e2\u20ac\u0153potential fireworks\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd between the US and China. Markets will be keeping a very close eye to see whether both sides are able to find some middle ground. While a breakthrough deal seems highly unlikely following Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s recent threats, any display of friendship and interest for further discussions will be welcomed by the financial markets. However, if talks descend into arguments with trade relations between the two nations deteriorating further, risk aversion may reign as fears mount over a full-blown trade war between the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s two largest economies becoming reality. Theresa May has just hit back against Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s criticism of her Brexit plans. The PM has insisted that the UK will be able to sign a new trade deal with the US. The political declaration [with the EU] makes clear that we will have an independent trade policies. We will be able to strike trade deals across the world. May added that Britain already has a team of trade experts talking to the US about a possible deal. However, this raises the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcchlorinated chicken\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 question; how can Britain stay closely aligned to European rules, while also signing deals with other countries whose standards are different, and still minimise trade frictions? Harvard economist Jeffrey Frankel agrees that the US-China trade war is hurting the global economy....and Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s exit from the EU isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t helping either! He writes: The trade war appears to be among the reasons for a renewed slowdown in China. The Chinese slowdown, in turn, will have spillover effects on other countries, especially commodity exporters. The European economy has also slowed in 2018, with Germany even reporting a surprising contraction in the third quarter. Trade is among the reasons: reduced demand from China, unprecedented uncertainty about US trade policy and the looming prospect of a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153hard\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Brexit in which the United Kingdom leaves the European single market and customs union. Frankel argues that Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade war is rebounding on the US -- the trade gap with China has actually widened this year, even though Americans are paying more for Chinese goods. Brexit is also making people poorer (due to the slump in the pound after the 2016 vote) he adds: Current trade policies are working to reduce real incomes in the US, Britain and many other countries. But monetary policy cannot counteract the effects. Only voters can do that. The full piece is worth a read, and online here: Donald Trump launched his trade war with China back in March, by proposing tariffs on $60bn of imports. This was followed with 10% tariffs on another $20bn of goods (which Trump is now threatening to increase to 25% in January). Beijing retaliated both times, making US goods more expensive. Worryingly, there are now signs that these tit-for-tat moves have hurt China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy. Bloomberg has spotted that several indicators of business conditions and market sentiment have weakened -- including stock market valuations and small business confidence. Their chief Asia economist Chang Shu warns: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Early indicators point to further weakness in the Chinese economy. The economies of China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s major trading partners continued to decelerate. The weakness in the equity market would not only impact sentiment, but also constrain firms\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 liquidity.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Just in: UK retail sales have been stronger than expected this month, but shopkeepers are anxious about the future. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s according to the latest \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcdistributive trades\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 survey from the CBI. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the main findings: 36% of respondents reported that sales volumes were up in the year to November, while 17% said they were down, giving a balance of 19% Retailers expect sales volumes to pick up next month (+22%), with 34% expecting them to rise and 12% to fall Sales were poor for the time of year in November, with a balance of (-10%), an improvement on October (-22%) The volume of orders placed upon suppliers recovered in November, with 36% of survey respondents reporting a rise and 21% reporting a fall, giving a balance of +15%. Firms anticipate that orders will grow at a similar pace next month (+15%) Retailers expect their overall business situation to deteriorate over the next three months (-9%) Look who\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s in Beijing today.... We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve not seen much of David Cameron since he quit Downing Street shortly after the 2016 EU referendum, and took delivery of a new \u00c2\u00a325,000 shed in which to write his memoirs. Last December he got a new job, running a \u00c2\u00a3750m fund to improve transport links between China and its trading partners, as part of the Belt and Road initiative. So perhaps that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s why he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s in the Chinese capital today, for talks with premier Li Kequiang. The trade war is a major headache for China, as it tries to manage its economic transformation while avoiding a sharp economic slowdown. With US relations looking ropey, Beijing needs allies in other parts of the world. So it may be significant that China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s president Xi has just landed in Spain for an official visit, ahead of the G20 meeting in Argentina. Xi is expected to meet with King Felipe VI and Queen Letizia for an official palace reception, followed by talks with prime minister Pedro Sanchez. Spanish newswire EFE says the visit is aimed at \u00e2\u20ac\u0153strengthening strategic ties between the two countries\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. It will also give Spanish firms a chance to invest in Chinese infrastructure projects such as the Belt and Road Initiative. EFE adds: Xi will also visit the Senate, the City Hall of Madrid and end his visit with a gala dinner at the Royal Palace hosted by the Spanish royal couple. A business forum with the executives of major Spanish and Chinese companies is also scheduled to be held to promote investments in both countries. Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade war threats have taken the shine of Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock markets today. After a strong rally on Monday, the trading floors are more subdued today. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE 100 has dipped back into the red, as Thomas Cook\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s profits warning dampens the mood. Shares in banks and oil producers are also down, while utilities (a classic defensive stock) are up. Russ Mould of stockbrokers AJ Bell says the markets are in \u00e2\u20ac\u0153limbo\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, awaiting developments on the US-China trade dispute. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Interestingly investors didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t seem troubled by a new warning from US President Donald Trump who said he is likely to go ahead with a hike on tariffs on Chinese goods. The Shanghai composite index was barely changed and Hong Kong\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Hang Seng index only dipped 0.17%. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The market is perhaps waiting for Mr Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s upcoming meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping to see whether the current talk simply amounts to scare tactics or whether he is serious about targeting additional Chinese goods with tariffs.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Over in the City, shares in holiday firm Thomas Cook have plunged by a third after another profits warning. Thomas Cook surprised investors by rushing out its financial results this morning. They show that underlying profits for 2018 would be \u00c2\u00a330m less than expected at \u00c2\u00a3250m \u00e2\u20ac\u201c \u00c2\u00a330m lower than it was expecting two months ago. The company has also suspended its dividend, which helped to send shares slumping to a six-year low. Thomas Cook blamed this summer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s heatwave, which encouraged Brits to stay at home. More here: Baird analyst William Power says Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s threatened tariffs on Apple products are another blow to the tech giant, on top of existing worries about iPhone demand. Yesterday afternoon President Trump alluded to possible tariffs on iPhones and other Apple products, which is likely to create fresh demand concerns following recent supply chain rancour. While we take the negative supply chain comments with the proverbial grain of salt, there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s little question that higher iPhone prices due to potential tariffs would likely negatively impact demand and profitability at some level. We certainly acknowledge the near-term risk, but remain positive on the long-term position and would buy on weakness. Donald Trump has also managed to weaken the pound, by shoving a spanner into Theresa May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Brexit plans. Last night, the US president declared that the agreement on the table looks like a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153great deal for the EU\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd that would stop the UK trading with the US. These comments have infuriated the UK government, as May tries desperately to persuade MPs to back the plan. Her effective deputy, cabinet minister David Lidington, has claimed that Trump is incorrect, and said he \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcregrets\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 them (Westminster code for \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcI wish he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d shut up\u00e2\u20ac\u2122). Lidington told the Today Programme that a UK-US trade deal is achievable: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The United States is a tough negotiator. President Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s always said very plainly \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcI put America first\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. Well, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d expect the British prime minister to put British interests first.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd City traders,though, believe Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s intervention is significant -- the pound is down almost a cent to $1.2745 vs the US dollar. The president of Indonesia is growing increasingly pessimistic that China and the US could resolve their trade dispute, when they met at the G20 summit later this week. Joko Widodo told business leaders that: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m hoping for a miracle during the G20 meeting, that they will come together, but my feeling is they won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said. Widodo has already seen the animosity between the two sides, when US VP Mike Pence clashed with President Xi at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) gathering last week. Co-operation was in short supply, Widodo told a forum of Indonesian CEOs... \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This is the first time in 29 years of APEC that an APEC meeting produced no communique.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Beijing have responded to Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s comments. Foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang told reporters that presidents Trump and Xi had agreed to reach a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcmutually beneficial\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 arrangement on trade earlier this month. Commodity prices have also been hit by Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s threat to hike existing tariffs on China, and possibly extend them to all Chinese imports. Traders are calculating that a full-blooded trade war will hurt demand for metals such as zinc, nickel and aluminium Shares in UK tech firm Dialog Semiconductor, a key Apple supplier, have dropped 2.2% in early European trading. Apple shares fell over 2% in after-hours trading, following Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s threat to escalate the trade war. Wall Street is clearly concerned that the dispute with China could escalate in 2019, hurting sales of iPhones. America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s technology industry has hit out at Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s threat to impose steeper tariffs on goods from China, such as iPhones. Jose Castaneda, spokesperson for the Information Technology Industry Council, has warned that consumers will suffer the consequences: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Despite the pain Americans have felt in communities across the United States as a result of tariffs, the president has signalled he wants to continue this short-sighted trade war. Imposing a new round of tariffs would cause a shock that will reverberate across America and the globe. It would further threaten global supply chains, leading to higher prices for the electronic devices people rely on every day and even the loss of American jobs. It is deeply disappointing the president wants to undermine his opportunity to create meaningful progress before the discussions even begin. ITI urges him to give negotiations a chance and work toward an agreement that resolves this growing trade dispute.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Trade war fears are rippling through the markets again today, after Donald Trump threatened to impose fresh tariffs on goods from China. The US president undermined hopes of a ceasefire with Beijing, by declaring it was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153highly unlikely\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd that he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d accept an offer from Chinese president Xi Jinping, to avert new levies coming into force next January. There had been optimism that Trump and Xi could reach an agreement, perhaps at this week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s G20 summit, that would deter America from imposing steeper tariffs on more Chinese imports. Bu speaking to the Wall Street Journal, Trump dashed those hopes by predicting that he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll probably raise the existing tariffs on $200bn of Chinese imports in January, from 10% to 25%. Trump also raised the stakes further, by threatening to slap tariffs on another $267bn -- meaning virtually all Chinese imports into America would be more expensive. He declared: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153If we don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t make a deal, then I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m going to put the $267 billion additional on.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd This could includes tariffs on Apple products imported from China, the president added -- something that hit iPhone and MacBook users in the pocket. Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s insisted that Beijing needs to heed the US\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s concerns over trade, saying: China has to open up their country to competition from the United States.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Tariffs are effectively a tax on consumers (unless the importer swallows the cost themselves). Trump thinks Americans can cope with pricier goods, saying: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I can make it [the tariff] 10 per cent, and people could stand that very easily.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The folk on Main Street may disagree, so Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meeting with Xi at the G20 summit this weekend will be closely watched. Also coming up today Brexit, and the Italian budget row, will both be on investors\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 minds today.
