                "bodyText":"A European Union plan to tax Google, Facebook and other internet firms risks failure after a handful of member states announced their opposition. EU countries are studying proposals to levy a 3% tax on big internet companies that make money from user data or digital advertising, in a bid to level the playing field with bricks-and-mortar companies that pay more tax. But the idea, which must be agreed unanimously by all 28 member states, is running into serious opposition, as Ireland, Sweden and Denmark made their criticism public on Tuesday. Germany had initially supported the idea in a joint agreement with France, but is now seeking to water down and delay the proposals, moves that are causing deep frustration in Paris. A dozen countries are moving ahead with their own national digital taxes, with Spain and the UK among the recent converts. The chancellor, Philip Hammond, announced last week that the UK was prepared to go it alone, with a \u201cnarrowly-targeted\u201d digital services tax that is expected to come into force in April 2020 and raise \u00a3400m for the exchequer. Opponents to the digital tax fear the wrath of Donald Trump\u2019s White House, which regards the EU\u2019s efforts to ensure \u201cfair taxation\u201d of internet giants as an attack on American companies, a charge the EU rejects. Denmark\u2019s finance minister, Kristian Jensen, said that given the way that the tax \u201chas been framed as aiming at US companies, of course there will be a reaction from the United States.\u201d Ireland, which hosts big tech firms including Apple, Facebook and Google, is also opposed. \u201cWhat kind of reaction would this bring if this was a model that was imposed on us?\u201d Irish finance minister Paschal Donohoe asked his counterparts during the live-streamed debate. The French finance minister, Bruno Le Maire, argues that an EU digital tax could spur efforts for an international agreement, led by the the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development thinktank. Paris fears that failure to agree such a high-profile proposal before May\u2019s European elections will be a gift to anti-EU populists, such as Marine Le Pen, the leader of the National Rally, formerly the Front National, who claim the EU is in hock to big business. But Le Maire offered a big concession, when he announced on Tuesday that France would support delaying the introduction of an EU tax to allow the OECD to make a comprehensive proposal. Behind the scenes, Paris is deeply disappointed that Berlin has gone cool on the idea after the two countries agreed the initiative more than 18 months ago and reaffirmed it in June in the Meseburg declaration, a Franco-German vision of the EU\u2019s future. It stated the two would aim for \u201can EU agreement on a fair digital taxation by the end of 2018\u201d. The French government is unconvinced that US reaction is any reason to delay, arguing that Germany has no excuse if even the UK, traditionally seen as Washington\u2019s closest ally in Europe, can propose a digital tax. Le Maire still hopes for an agreement in December, but interventions from other member states suggests that is a tall order. Sweden\u2019s economy minister, Magdalena Andersson, said her country could not support the proposal. \u201cI see no government in Sweden that would have any other opinion on this issue.\u201d Hartwig L\u00f6ger, Austria\u2019s finance minister, who chaired the meeting, put a brave face on the divisions, arguing more clarity was needed on whether countries had technical or political objections. \u201cThere is the motivation to find a harmonised solution for Europe,\u201d he said after the meeting. \u201cEven now we have 11 countries \u2013 soon it will be 12 with Spain \u2013 which have national individual solutions on digital taxation.\u201d",

                "bodyText":"US stock markets continued to fall on Tuesday, wiping out all of 2018\u2019s gains as a slide in technology stocks grew into a wider selloff and fears of a trade war with China worried investors. The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 555 points in New York, a slide of 2.2% and the Nasdaq, home to Amazon, Facebook and many other tech giants, was down another 1.7% following sharper falls on Monday. The leading tech companies have now lost a combined $1tn in value since their year highs. But what started as a sell-off of high-flying tech companies spread on Tuesday as the oil price tumbled and investors sold investments in retailers, energy companies and bitcoin. US markets rallied briefly but have now erased all the gains they have made this year. Analysts said there were likely to be more wild swings to come. \u201cI don\u2019t think Santa Claus is going to waltz in and give us a rally for Christmas,\u201d said Michael Antonelli, managing director of institutional sales trading at Robert W Baird in Milwaukee.

                "bodyText":"The US-China trade standoff will continue to weaken confidence in the global economy into next year, economists have warned, as the increasingly gloomy outlook for growth dragged on share markets across the world. Plunging oil prices and intensifying concerns about technology stocks in the US spread contagion to Asia Pacific markets on Wednesday after renewed losses on Wall Street. But as the broad losses in Wall Street pulled its key indices into the red for this year, economists at JP Morgan warned that the trade dispute between the world\u2019s two biggest economies threatens more trouble ahead. \u201cWe forecast that the US imposes an additional 25% tariff on virtually all goods imports from China early next year. This will drag materially on activity in China and could accelerate the decline in global business confidence now underway,\u201d the JP Morgan team wrote in a note to clients. Although they forecast that the Chinese authorities will throw more policy stimulus to offset a hit from the tariffs and keep GDP growth at 6%, the team predicted that markets must prepare for the Federal Reserve to raise borrowing costs another four times next year. The prospect of more rate hikes will set alarms bells ringing in emerging markets, which have already been squeezed of liquidity by the rise of the US dollar over the past few months. Stocks from Sydney to Shanghai were in the red on Wednesday afternoon, although they had pared earlier, heavier losses. The Nikkei in Tokyo was off 0.3% while the Australian benchmark index dropped 1.2% in the morning to a fresh 21-month low. Oil prices, which dropped 6% on Tuesday, pushed energy stocks lower as investors fretted about weaker global growth and specualtion about the end of the tech stock boom. Brent crude was up 1.2% in early trade on Wednesday. Soichiro Monji, senior economist at Daiwa SB Investments in Tokyo, told Reuters: \u201cIt is difficult to pinpoint a single factor driving the global risk aversion. Apple and trade tensions seem to be touted as factors every other day, but it is difficult to blame them for all the woes. \u201cThe markets appear to be starting to prepare for a loss of momentum in the global economy, although it is doing quite well at the moment.\u201d Plummeting oil prices \u2013 weakened by wider uncertainty in global shares \u2013 had hurt Australian energy stocks, with the sector dropping by more than 3% early on. The Aussie dollar had slipped to US72.14c overnight but recovered to US72.37c. The falls come as two closely watched indicators survey pointed to trouble ahead for the Australian economy. The Westpac\u2013Melbourne Institute leadingindex, which indicates the likely pace of economic activity three to nine months into the future, fell from 0.41% in September to just 0.08% in October. Westpac\u2019s chief economist, Bill Evans, said: \u201cWith this latest slowdown, the index growth rate continues to point to slowing momentum into the new year. He blamed weak wages growth, falling property prices in Sydney and Melbourne and a very low savings rate for the poor outlook for consumer spending. In addition, the NAB monthly cashless retail sales index published on Wednesday said data mapping suggested that the official Australia Bureau of Statistics measure of retail sales would grow at a worse-than-expected 0.2% month-on-month in October. The big four banks were all down, with the losses led by ANZ, which posted a 0.77% drop to $25.105. Commonwealth Bank, whose chair, Catherine Livingstone, was on the stand at the banking royal commission on Wednesday morning, fell 0.6%. Tech shares continued to fall, losing more than 2.8% early, with telco stocks also down. Australian Associated Press and Reuters contributed to this report.",

Be suspicious and check.\u201d</p> <p>And there is a reminder of the consumer rights you enjoy when ordering online: \u201cYou get 14 days from the day your order arrives to return it and get a refund. This gives you the flexibility to cancel if you find your bargain cheaper elsewhere. There are some exceptions, like personalised goods, but it\u2019s guaranteed on most other purchases.\u201d</p> <p>If possible, she says, \u201cpay for items that cost over \u00a3100 by credit card to get protection, so you can go to your credit card company for a refund if there\u2019s an issue.\u201d</p> <p>Her final warning is one that applies to virtually everything on the internet, whether it is fake news or a Cyber Monday bargain: \u201cIf a deal seems too good to be true, treat it with a healthy degree of uncertainty.\u201d<br></p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5bfc0519e4b0c6aba9996c4d\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-11-26T14:39:09.340Z\">2.39pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>One of the things about Christmas is that it inevitably leads into the new year, and grand plans to re-invent yourself into a healthier lifestyle.

Some new research by Barclaycard has suggested that this year in the UK we will spend \u00a31.6bn on experience gifts this Christmas, as people veer away from sending and receiving physical gifts, and look towards presents that can make memories. And are also super-Instagram material. Barclaycard also say that their consumer survey suggested that this year spending in the Xmas period itself on entertainment and events such as gigs, beauty treatments and adventure days will be up 115% on last year If you are thinking of gifting someone an experience, then there are some deals around today that can save you a bit of cash - and they\u2019ll never know you skimped by ordering it on Cyber Monday ;-) Virgin Experience Days are offering a selection of deals as part of their Cyber Weekend promotion. It is worth having a dig around the full list, but here are some of the highlights: 50% off the View from The Shard Experience for two adults (Now \u00a332, was \u00a364) 75% off a Winery and Brewery Tour for two with tastings (Now \u00a37.50, was \u00a330) 35% off a London Bungee Jump for one (Now \u00a349, was \u00a380) 25% off a Vintage Afternoon Tea Bus Tour for two (Now \u00a382.50, was \u00a3110) 60% off a Supercar experience in 24 locations across the UK (Now \u00a355, was \u00a3139) There also some deals on London Musicals Aladdin in the West End is offering tickets from \u00a325 as a limited Black Friday weekend promotion, with savings on tickets of up to 39%. Kinky Boots tickets are on sale for up to 43% off from lastminute.com and Encore Tickets, starting at a very reasonable \u00a317.50. Dreamgirls at the Savoy Theatre is another production that is taking part in Cyber Monday deals (which last until 30 November), with savings of up to 28% on tickets within the C and D price bands plus no booking fee. Motown The Musical has deals on tickets for up to 46% off (starting at \u00a321.50), and they have also taken the cost of booking fees off orders made for performances between 22nd - 29th December. It would be remiss of me to spend a whole day live blogging special Cyber Monday offers and then neglect to mention one rather close to home... The Guardian and The Observer What\u2019s happening? Brilliant offers across our range of print and digital subscription packages Where\u2019s it happening? You can become a subscriber here. What\u2019s the deal? Save 50% for three months on print and digital subscriptions to The Guardian and The Observer. Offer ends Sunday 2 December. If you are in the market for smart watches, then there are some good deals kicking around today on the web. You can save \u00a360 on the Apple Watch Series 3 over at John Lewis, while Withings are offering their Full Black Smart Watch at half-price. There\u2019s a decent (if slightly exaggerated) price drop on Huawei Band 2 Pro Fitness Wristband at Amazon, and you can also get the Fitbit Unisex Versa Health and Fitness Smartwatch for \u00a3159 from the online retail giant. The Garmin Fenix 5 Multisport GPS Watch also has a hefty online discount on it at the moment, bringing it down to \u00a3309.99. As one of the Guardian\u2019s resident Doctor Who nerds there was absolutely no way I was going to get through live blogging Cyber Monday without somehow cramming a Cyberman reference in there. And it is even topical, because episode Kerblam! the other week was about the perils of working in a mostly-automated factory sending out parcels and gifts. Ahem. Fortunately there are some Doctor Who-related deals I can tell you about. Big Finish, who produce Doctor Who audio dramas based on the original series, often with the original actors, have been offering discounts on a range of titles featuring the Time Lord\u2019s Fantastic Foes, including the Master, the Daleks, the Ice Warriors, and of course, the Cybermen. Access the deals here using the code FANTASTIC. If you are buying for someone whose cult interests go a bit further than Doctor Who, then it is worth dropping in on the Forbidden Planet special offers page - they have discounts on a range of about 50 items including merchandise for Harry Potter, Rick &amp; Morty, Star Wars, and Deadpool. One of the things I suggested in my piece today about thoughtful presents you\u2019ve still got time to make or order was using old photos to make a nostalgic present for relatives or old friends. And you can do that slightly cheaper today, as printing service Photobox are offering up to 50% off everything, with an additional 20% off if you use the code CYBER20. Unfortunately you can\u2019t get a 20% discount on the amount of time it takes you to sort out the mess of photos stored on your laptop. Shopping online isn\u2019t without potential pitfalls, and Hannah Maundrell, Editor in Chief of online comparison service money.co.uk, has this advice for people doing their Christmas shopping today. She says shoppers should \u201cfactor in the cost of delivery when you compare prices online. Check whether you can click and collect for free, as this can be a good way to save if you live near a store.\u201d She also warns us to be on our guard, saying \u201cjust because a retailer tells you they\u2019ve cut the price of an item you can\u2019t take it as gospel; you\u2019ll only know it\u2019s good value by shopping around. Be suspicious and check.\u201d And there is a reminder of the consumer rights you enjoy when ordering online: \u201cYou get 14 days from the day your order arrives to return it and get a refund. This gives you the flexibility to cancel if you find your bargain cheaper elsewhere. There are some exceptions, like personalised goods, but it\u2019s guaranteed on most other purchases.\u201d If possible, she says, \u201cpay for items that cost over \u00a3100 by credit card to get protection, so you can go to your credit card company for a refund if there\u2019s an issue.\u201d Her final warning is one that applies to virtually everything on the internet, whether it is fake news or a Cyber Monday bargain: \u201cIf a deal seems too good to be true, treat it with a healthy degree of uncertainty.\u201d One of the things about Christmas is that it inevitably leads into the new year, and grand plans to re-invent yourself into a healthier lifestyle. What if you could prepare for that moment in advance? Here\u2019s how you can do that, and save a little bit of money as well, with Cyber Monday deals on subscription boxes. HelloFresh is a subscription service that allows you to download the app and pick from a selection of recipes each week to be delivered to your door in neat packages with all of the fiddly ingredients portioned out and prepared for you. They often have good introductory deals, but their Cyber Weekend deal takes it one step further, offering 55% off your first 2 boxes/weeks (and you are not obliged to continue your subscription). Birchbox are offering 2 boxes for \u00a35 using the code FRIYAY, a promotion they claim is their \u201cbest offer ever.\u201d Usually, boxes are \u00a310 each, making this a 75% discount. Plus, December\u2019s box will have a bumper 7 products, and again, the subscription can be cancelled at any time. KiwiCo deliver monthly crates of educational and creative activities for kids of \u201cevery age and interest\u201d and they are currently offering 60% off the first crate for those who sign up on Cyber Monday. Lifebox are part of the \u201cWellness Revolution\u201d, delivering a selection of superfood snacks to subscribers every month as a \u201cconvenient and affordable way of discovering new and delicious wholefoods.\u201d You can also buy their boxes as a one-off, and for Black Friday they are reducing the price of their Classic and Energy boxes to \u00a317.21 (was \u00a322.95). With about ten hours of Cyber Monday still to go, here\u2019s a summary of some of the best deal lists we\u2019ve posted so far: Video games and consoles Major UK retailers Smart speakers and home voice assistants Phones and phone accessories Homeware deals Flights and holidays Museums and attractions Plus we\u2019ve covered magazine subscriptions, books, vacuum cleaners and kitchen mixers among other things. I\u2019m also interested in you sending me any weird and super-niche Cyber Monday offers by email to martin.belam@theguardian.com. Pro-tip 1: Don\u2019t buy your partner gadgets to do household chores as Christmas presents. Pro-tip 2: If you need a new household chore gadget anyway, today is a good day to buy it cheaper than usual. Here\u2019s a selection of deals on vacuum cleaners: DYSON V7 Motorhead Cordless, Bagless Vacuum Cleaner Peddler are offering up to 37% off the Dyson V7 Motorhead Vacuum Cleaner, bringing it down from \u00a3370 to \u00a3234.19. However, if you would make use of Dyson\u2019s \u2018Toolkit\u2019 including additional tools for mattresses, hard-to-reach areas and dried in dirt, Currys PC World are offering the Dyson V7 Motorhead Vacuum in a bundle deal with the Dyson Handheld Toolkit for a combined price of \u00a3249. iRobot Roomba 980 Vacuum Cleaner Save \u00a350 on the iRobot Roomba at John Lewis &amp; Partners, making it \u00a3799, and get a 2 year guarantee included. Also good fun if you\u2019ve got cats or dogs round the house. SHARK IF250UKT True Pet Cordless Vacuum Cleaner Currys PC World have reduced this Shark vacuum cleaner to \u00a3279 (was \u00a3479) in their Cyber Monday sale. Plus, you can utilise another discount code on top of this promotion, which takes 10% off the marked price when you quote VACUUM10 at checkout, and there is the option to pay monthly. VAX Air Lift Steerable Pet Max Upright Bagless Vacuum Cleaner This well-reviewed vacuum cleaner has been reduced by several retailers with a saving of around \u00a350, to \u00a3129. However, John Lewis &amp; Partners and Currys PC World are both offering an included 2 year guarantee in their deals. Miele Classic C1 Edition Powerline Bagged Vacuum Cleaner With a saving of \u00a351, the Miele Classic C1 Edition Vacuum is now \u00a399 at John Lewis &amp; Partners, who claim this deal is \u2018exclusive\u2019 to their customers. Like the other John Lewis deals mentioned, this also comes with a 2 year guarantee included and the option to add further protection against accidental damage for \u00a310. Happy holiday hoovering! The chances are that you\u2019ll be in charge of buying the presents for at least one football fanatic in the family, and football merchandise is an easy, if obvious, choice for those sometimes-hard-to-buy-for children. Going to club websites today will yield you some savings. At the top of the Premier League Manchester City, Liverpool, Spurs, Chelsea, Arsenal and Everton are all offering discounts on selected lines ranging from 20% at Chelsea to 50% at Arsenal. A quick trip down the leagues showed club shops from the likes of Leeds and Sunderland joining in, so it\u2019s worth checking directly with clubs to see if there is a deal on. Even my beloved Leyton Orient have some special offers on, so maybe it is finally the year someone will get me a nice woolly hat to wear at Brisbane Road. As a nation we are still in the grip of bake-off fever, which means the market for kitchen gadgets has never been healthier or more competitive. Here are some deals on stand mixers if you are looking to \u201csoup\u201d up your kitchen gear. You see what I did there. KitchenAid 150 Artisan 4.8L Stand Mixer For anyone who has been waiting to get their hands on the cult favourite KitchenAid Artisan mixer - now is the time. This mixer has been dramatically reduced by several retailers, but most notably, Currys have reduced their price from \u00a3549.99 to \u00a3274 (a \u00a3275.99 saving). Plus, they are offering a further discount code giving customers 10% off their order when they spend over \u00a3200 on 2 or more small kitchen appliances and there is also the option to pay monthly. Kenwood kMix KMX754 Stand Mixer The Kenwood kMix has also seen large reductions across the board - AO, Amazon and John Lewis have all reduced their prices to \u00a3179. However, John Lewis include a 2 year guarantee with their deal, and you can add an additional 2 years of protection against accidental damage for \u00a315. Fearne by Swan: 6 Litre Die Cast Stand Mixer After bringing out several successful cookbooks, Fearne Cotton released her own range of kitchen appliances with Swan. Her 6 Litre stand mixer has not been reduced by many retailers, but Amazon are offering a saving of \u00a3175, making it \u00a3124.99 (down from \u00a3299.99) in four colours, and they are also including free delivery. Sage The Scraper Mixer BEM430 Heston Blumenthal\u2019s 4.7L stand mixer is on offer at almost 30% off from ECookshop, with free delivery available. While this is a better deal than the likes of AO and Amazon are offering, if you do spot it cheaper elsewhere, ECookshop will endeavour to price match. Also, while we are thinking about the kitchen, do take five minutes to read Zoe Williams\u2019 amazing interview with bake-off\u2019s Kim-Joy Running a live blog about Cyber Monday is a bit like going shopping, but without any of the fun. And by the end of the day I won\u2019t have got my Christmas shopping sorted either. However, it does mean you run into a lot of rather leftfield suggestions for ways for people to invest and save money. Probably the most obscure promo I\u2019ve seen cross my inbox so far today is for Farmers Weekly. They\u2019ve extended their weekend sale and today, for the last day, you can subscribe to the Web+ digital version of Farmers Weekly for \u00a350+VAT. Go on, you know you want to. It\u2019s not the only place you can get subscription discounts on magazines however. Magazine.co.uk is offering \u00a315 off when you subscribe to three titles. iSubscribe, on the other hand, is offering 10% off and a \u00a35 credit voucher if you take out magazine subscriptions before the end of today. GreatMagazines.co.uk is offering 20% off new subscriptions over the value of \u00a325, and that deal runs until the end of tomorrow. Another magazine with a special deal going on is Anorak, the \u2018happy mag for kids\u2019 aimed at boys and girls aged between 6 and 12 years old. They are offering 20% off all their single issues and posters with the code HAPPYANORAK. You can have a browse here. Incidentally, you can email me at martin.belam@theguardian.com if you\u2019ve seen an even more obscure Cyber Monday deal. Books make a lovely gift, since the choice often says something personal about you, and there are some bargains to be had out there on Cyber Monday. WH Smith are offering 50% off or more on selected titles and Waterstones have a similar deal, while Book Depository have up to 60% off their promotional titles. You can get 20% off online purchases at Foyles with the code BLACKFRIDAY20. CYBER25 is the code you need to unlock 25% discounts with Book People. Don\u2019t forget that the Guardian Bookshop is also offering deals and gift suggestions with up to 30% discount, which you can find here. Need a bit of inspiration? Here\u2019s what our books team were recommending back in the autumn. West Elm are offering 20% off everything in stock, including items that are already in clearance, quoting the puntastic code \u201cFRIYAY\u201d in store or online. They are also featuring 40% off bonus deals for certain collections including flannel bed linen, square dinnerware, mongolian cushion covers, terrariums and more. Habitat have savings \u201cacross 100s of lines\u201d until midnight tonight, letting customers know that \u201ctoday is your last chance to bag a seriously good deal.\u201d Unlike many of their counterparts, Habitat are not using a blanket percentage off, and instead have specific deals on certain lines. For example: Save \u00a31000 on selected mattresses Save up to \u00a3750 off Hendricks fabric sofas Save \u00a3100 on the Jacobs Storage Bench Save \u00a330 on bed linen Anthropologie have 20% discounts on selected lines until midnight tonight.

Whilst several of the items are already selling out, some of the remaining deals include: Maija Pendant lights in black (Was \u00a379, now \u00a324) Liza cabinet (Was \u00a3529, now \u00a3264) Chapo mirror (Was \u00a3229, now \u00a3171) Ginsberg bench (Was \u00a3270, now \u00a3140) Ancona shelving unit (Was \u00a3549, now \u00a3329) DFS are offering several deals today which, despite the endless internet jokes about endless DFS sales, will end at midnight. They include up to half price off their Autumn/Winter collection, and up to \u00a3350 savings when you purchase an Exclusive Brand product and any other item. H&amp;M Home are running a Cyber Monday promotion which gives customers up to 50% off selected items until midnight tonight, and an additional 10% off for H&amp;M Club members. They are also offering free standard delivery on all orders which will be automatically applied at checkout. Other homewares brands that are offering Cyber Monday discounts include Wayfair, Debenhams, and Sofa.com. And with that, I\u2019m going to pop to have some lunch at the Guardian canteen, where I\u2019m hoping there will be some cracking Cyber Monday deals on quinoa and hummus. For the Apple iPhone XR, while Carphone Warehouse are offering a saving of \u00a3470 on the a 24 month Vodafone contract for the iPhone XR until midnight (\u00a336 per month, \u00a359.99 upfront cost), mobiles.co.uk are offering the same deal except with no upfront cost. If it is the Google Pixel you are after, Carphone Warehouse are also offering \u00a3510 off their Google Pixel 3 24 month contract with Vodafone, including 100GB of data and unlimited texts and minutes (\u00a336 per month, \u00a329.99 upfront cost) Mobilephonesdirect.co.uk\u2019s top deal for Cyber Monday is a 24 month contract for the Huawei Mate 20 Pro (128GB) at \u00a345 a month with no upfront cost. This deal comes with 50GB data, unlimited minutes and texts, an O2 SIM card, free delivery and one month\u2019s free insurance. Appliances Direct meanwhile have dramatically reduced the price of the Samsung Galaxy S9 by \u00a3240, making it \u00a3499. Mobiles.co.uk are pushing several extended deals for Cyber Monday. Among other things they are offering an iPhone XR on Vodafone with 100GB data for \u00a336 per month and a Samsung Galaxy S9 on Vodafone with 40GB data in a deal which works out to \u00a328 per month. In the market for an iPhone XS? In among the buymobiles.net Cyber Monday offers you can pick one up for \u00a337 per month with 80GB of data. There\u2019s an upfront cost of \u00a3119, but it looks to be one of the better deals for that handset today. On the accessories front, Gear4 have big discounts on protective cases for your phones, including 70% off the Piccadilly range and 50% off the Battersea range, which will apparently protect your phone from a 16 foot drop. Screen protectors for the Apple iPhone 6/7/8, iPhone X/XS, iPhone XS Max and iPhone XR are down to \u00a320.99 from \u00a329.99.

Feel Unique, meanwhile, have a range of Cyber Monday deals promising up to 33% off of over 25,000 beauty and perfume products, and the exciting bonus of a mystery gift if you spend over \u00a350. *spooky ooo-oooo-oh ghost noise* One big question around Black Friday and Cyber Monday that remains - is it actually making anybody any happier? A couple of days ago my colleague reported on whether the backlash against Black Friday had already started in the UK. Greenpeace is among a group of organisations promoting MAKE SMTHNG as an alternative to the consumer spending over this weekend. During it artists and crafters run workshops on ways to reuse, repair or recycle goods, rather than buying something new. There is some data too about how the Black Friday shopping experience makes people unhappy. HappyOrNot, the company that produce the little machines where you can register how happy you are with a consumer experience by pressing a range of smiley or not-smiley faces, measured 575,000 feedbacks from customers in places like Lidl, Zara, and Tesco. They claim that analysing the data shows that we\u2019ve just lived through the unhappiest UK Black Friday they have on record. As well as a year-on-year decline in happiness, in the UK, Black Friday was slightly unhappier (79.8%) for UK shoppers than an average day in 2018 (80.3%). UK shopper happiness also dropped drastically throughout the day, starting at 84.3% for early birds at 9am, and ending at 78% for those still slogging round the shops at 9pm. None of that today though - with Cyber Monday you can happily do it all from your phone of course. By the way, if you are struggling for Christmas inspiration, we have this year\u2019s gift guide over here. And here are 12 ideas for gifts that keep giving throughout the year, by taking out a subscription service for someone. The jury is still out on whether having a smart speaker in your home is giving corporations undue surveillance in our private spaces, or whether all that worry is out-weighed by it just really being handy to be able to shout out \u201cHey, whatsisface, play my electronic surveillance playlist, ta\u201d, or turn the lights off without getting off the sofa. If you are in the market for one, here are some options: Amazon have a range of discounts on their home speaker products, including \u00a335 off the Echo, \u00a330 off the Echo Dot, and \u00a330 off the second generation Echo Plus. Google offer a variety of smart speakers and their flagship Google Home Hub. You can pick the latter up with a \u00a340 discount from ao.com, which brings the price down to \u00a399. Currys PC World are also offering deals across the whole range of voice assistants. Amidst the frenzy of Black Friday and Cyber Monday, there\u2019s been a move in the US to try and get \u201cMuseum Sunday\u201d to be a thing in the middle of it, where people promote more thoughtful activities than shopping. Although, obviously, getting people to part with their cash to attend attractions is still part of the agenda. It hasn\u2019t particularly caught on in the UK yet, but there are some deals around on museums and attractions if you know where to look. If Lego is your thing, then Legoland in Windsor have a new Haunted House Monster Party Ride launching in spring 2019, and some Cyber Monday offers on booking for it in advance. The deal works out at \u00a335 per person based on a family of two adults and two children, and can be accessed here before midnight. When it presumably turns into a Lego pumpkin or something. A Merlin Annual Pass can get you into 32 UK attractions including Madame Tussauds, the London Eye, Alton Towers, Sea Life centres and Warwick Castle. They are offering three months for free, making it last 15 months, if you order during their Cyber week offer. It could make a great gift for a family - but there\u2019s quite a bit of small print to note though, and lots of times when you might want to be taking the kids out, like August and Bank Holidays, are excluded from the major attractions. Not a visit, but the Natural History Museum have been running Black Friday and Cyber Monday discounts in their online store all weekend. If there\u2019s a transport nerd in your life, then the Black Friday sale at the London Transport Museum might be worth a visit - among the offers there\u2019s a range of reproduction vintage posters down to half-price. Oh, and if you do want an educational angle on Black Friday, this article from the Museum of London about how a march on Parliament by suffragettes on 18 November 1910 came to be known as Black Friday due to the repeated assaults on the protesting women might make an antidote to the spending it has come to be associated with today. As well as offers on hotels, airlines often join in Black Friday and Cyber Monday with a series of deals to help you jet away in the new year. British Airways have offers on luxury holidays which expire at midnight tonight, including saving \u00a3100 on holidays with a minimum spend of \u00a32,500 per booking, and saving \u00a350 on holidays with a minimum spend of \u00a31,250 per booking. Which don\u2019t seem like huge savings to be honest. Club Med\u2019s Cyber Monday promotion boasts that holidaymakers can save up to \u00a3520 per person on all-inclusive holidays. Destinations include skiing in the French Alps and holidays in the Caribbean, covering flights that depart from London, Manchester, Birmingham, Edinburgh and more. Expedia claim to have secured \u201cspecial low Black Friday &amp; Cyber Monday fares from top airlines\u201d - they\u2019ve gathered the details here. Fleetway also have some deals on flights and holidays - some of the options are gathered together here. There\u2019s also a \u00a3100 discount on all holidays over \u00a31200 if you enter the code BLACKFRIDAY when booking before 29 November. Norwegian, the low-cost long-haul airline, have up to 30% off flights booked before the end of the day - it might finally be the moment to book that trip to the US. Ryanair have a slightly more convoluted deal going on. If you book a room somewhere with them, you get 10% of the vale back as \u201cFlight credit\u201d on your account that you can then, presumably, spend on the flights to get there. There\u2019s also a more straightforward \u00a330 off flights offer. Virgin Atlantic are offering up to \u00a3150 off flight and hotel combinations, you need to enter the code BF2018 when booking. The shift to online retailing has made times tough on the high street for department stores. Some of them, like Fenwick, Fortnum &amp; Mason, Harrods and Selfridges have stayed out of the Cyber Monday fray. Others, like Debenhams, are offering plenty of deals. Here\u2019s a quick whizz around the discounts available online today from some of the UK\u2019s major department stores: Debenhams What\u2019s happening? \u201c12 days of amazing deals\u201d in their \u201cBlack Friday spectacular\u201d Where?

Where? The discounts are gathered together here. What? Offers include discounts on Mulberry and UGG, as well as deals on Apple, Samsung and Sonos products. Liberty What\u2019s happening? Rather than anything as trite as Black Friday or Cyber Monday, Liberty have been running \u201cThe event before Christmas\u201d which ends today. What? Up to 30% off, with 15% off beauty. The deals aren\u2019t grouped together as easily as on other websites though, so you have to have a bit of a rummage through the men\u2019s, women\u2019s and kid\u2019s goods to bargain hunt. If you think \u00a324 for two pairs of socks is a bargain, of course. If you are after fabrics though, today is the day, as there is 20% of a huge range. A huge amount of attention on Black Friday and Cyber Monday naturally goes to the biggest UK retailers - but there are also a lot of deals to be had from smaller shops and manufacturers on the sites they use to sell.

In their price match section they are promising 15% off MAC make-up, 20% off Barbour, and 30% off Levi\u2019s and Ralph Lauren. A word of caution though - it still pays to shop around and do your own price comparisons on Cyber Monday. Don\u2019t just take a retailer\u2019s word for it that they are the cheapest available today. Remember, it\u2019s not like the horror of having to flit from crowded shop to crowded shop making price checks, so it really is worth looking around. Black Friday and Cyber Monday have become key fixtures in the retail run-up to Christmas. My colleague Rebecca Smithers reports today that customers in the UK are expected to have spent around \u00a37bn across the weekend.

Black Friday, the US-inspired discount event, was the busiest day but business was more broadly spread across the week than in previous years, as the company launched its own discounts earlier in the week and matched the promotional prices of rival stores under its \u201cnever knowingly undersold\u201d pledge. The strong figures from John Lewis will raise hopes of a better than expected Christmas for the retailer after early data for Black Friday, which fell on 23 November, suggested shoppers had cut back this year. Barclaycard said that shoppers had spent 10% less on the day by mid-afternoon, while footfall in town centres, shopping centres and retail parks was down by 6%, according to the shopper monitoring firm Springboard. Part of that change was because shoppers were able to spread their bargain hunting over a longer period of time because retailers began discounting earlier. Figures from the CBI, released on Tuesday, revealed that overall retail sales increased last month, especially at supermarkets and at shops selling household and recreational goods. Analysts said the pick-up in sales was better than expected after a poor October when sales dropped to their weakest level since last April. But the amount of goods sold dropped in shops selling clothing, footwear, furniture and carpets, and in hardware and DIY stores. And the broadly healthier picture in November after a weak October was unable to prevent an eighth quarter in a row of declining employment across the retail sector. Anna Leach, the CBI head of economic intelligence, said: \u201cWhile it is encouraging to see headline retail sales growth strengthen in November after a weak outturn in October, the quarterly survey continues to paint a gloomy picture of the sector. Business sentiment remains poor, investment intentions are flat, and headcount continues to decline.\u201d Some analysts fear that Black Friday only served to pull forward sales which could have been booked at full price in October or December. On Tuesday, fast fashion retailer Quiz reported a 2% fall in underlying profits in the six months to 30 September partly as a result of the \u00a3400,000 it was owed by House of Fraser when the department store fell into administration in August. Offsetting the good period at John Lewis, the department store\u2019s sister chain Waitrose had a difficult week. Sales slipped 1.6% despite a 43% rise in sales of mince pies and a 17% lift in mulled wine sales. Sales of homewares and other non-food were the hardest hit with sales down 6.9%.",
