Brazil\u2019s environmental agency rejected the company\u2019s bid for a licence for the fourth time on Tuesday, requesting more information. A Greenpeace expedition in April documented coral in the area where Total plans to drill, after an earlier discovery of a massive coral reef nearby. Greenpeace also opposes Total\u2019s investment in offshore oil production in French Guiana, which will boost its presence in the potentially lucrative area. Total faces more protests this month, after France\u2019s largest farmers\u2019 union called for a blockade of refineries in protest at the company\u2019s decision to use imported palm oil at a new biofuel production site.",

                "bodyText":"The UK government has cleared the way for Rupert Murdoch\u2019s 21st Century Fox to buy Sky on the condition it sells Sky News to another organisation. It also approved a rival bid for the British broadcaster from US media giant Comcast, setting up a multibillion-pound bidding war. Fox is attempting to buy the 61% of Sky that it does not already own, in a deal valuing the company at \u00a318.5bn, but the bid has been complicated by concerns that it would leave Murdoch with too much control over the UK media.

The culture secretary, Matt Hancock, approved the Comcast deal in a statement in the House of Commons on Tuesday afternoon.

The deal has left Sky News employees nervous about their futures but in an email to staff channel boss John Ryley noted that both bids contained \u201ccommitments to guarantee the funding and editorial independence of Sky News\u201d. \u201cI will update as and when there are further developments but in the meantime, all we can do is to continue the great job we\u2019ve been doing and concentrate on what we do best which is making the best news content for mobile, television and radio,\u201d he said. The Labour deputy leader, Tom Watson, said Sky News has \u201calways been a beacon for independent and rigorous journalism\u201d and said his priority is \u201censuring Sky News thrives going forward\u201d. He warned that if Sky News is sold to Disney \u2013 and Disney\u2019s bid for overall control of Fox is unsuccessful \u2013 it would leave the 24-hour news channel \u201cisolated from Sky and owned by a foreign company with few news interests in the UK\u201d. The takeover bids are part of a complex web of global media deals, with giant companies competing to buy smaller businesses in the hope of securing their long-term future in the face of challenges from streaming services such as Amazon and Netflix.

Comcast has said that it will issue an Offer Document within 28 days all pre-conditions being met (implicitly by 13 July). Within 60 days of this, Sky must convene the shareholder meeting at which the Comcast proposal is to be voted on (by 11 Sep).</p> <p>Assuming it is not blocked by the Culture Secretary, Fox would announce a firm offer around 19 June. High Court approval would then be sought and the Scheme of Arrangement document would be posted out within 28 days of the offer announcement (around 17 July). Sky\u2019s shareholder meeting would need to take place within 21 days (7 Aug) with court approval after that. In reality, Sky\u2019s board will need to manage timetables such that shareholders are able to give adequate consideration to both offers.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5b16ae01e4b022a3efa10c1d\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-06-05T15:39:52.893Z\">4.39pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Sky shares close higher, RBS drops 5%</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Sky shares have edged up 0.29% to \u00a313.54 after the US government cleared the Comcast and Fox bids for the company, albeit the latter was given the go-ahead on the condition that Sky News was sold.</p> <p>Meanwhile Royal Bank of Scotland has closed down 5.3% at 266p, compared to the 271p a share the government received in the sale of the latest tranche of its shares.</p> <p>Overall the FTSE 100 finished down 0.7% at 7686.8, undermined by a rise in sterling after better than expected service sector figures put a possible interest rate rise back on the agenda.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2018-06-05T15:41:25.342Z\">at 4.41pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5b16a1bee4b003306906450c\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-06-05T15:03:20.988Z\">4.03pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Elsewhere the US tech boom continues:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/charliebilello/status/1004006863648755718\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Facebook: All-Time High<br>Apple: All-Time High<br>Amazon: All-Time High<br>Netflix: All-Time High<br>Nasdaq 100: All-Time High <a href=\"https://t.co/5IDbGT0hsV\">pic.twitter.com/5IDbGT0hsV</a></p>&mdash; Charlie Bilello (@charliebilello) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/charliebilello/status/1004006863648755718?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">June 5, 2018</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5b16a471e4b022a3efa10bae\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-06-05T14:58:23.971Z\">3.58pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>A bidding war for Sky is now on the cards but it is hard to judge how much higher the offers will go, says Neil Wilson, chief market analyst for Markets.com:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Sky shares traded up about half a per cent [on the day] at \u00a313.55 as the Fox and Comcast bids were effectively waved through by culture secretary Matt Hancock. The commitment by Fox to let go of Sky News always looked like it be sufficient to assuage the media plurality concerns. For Comcast there were never any media plurality worries as it\u2019s got little European presence. </p> <p> A bidding war looms of course. The bid on the table from Comcast is an all-cash offer worth \u00a312.50 per share, so an increased offer is priced in already. But the fact that the shares are not roaring higher suggests investors are displaying some hesitation about whether Murdoch will significantly increase his offer. He may not have to - the option for Fox is to switch from the current Scheme of Arrangement to a Takeover Offer, which would allow it to use its 39% of shares in the vote. </p> <p> Then it\u2019s up to Comcast and we\u2019ll see just deep the pockets are - how badly does it want to diversify from the US and get exposure to Sky\u2019s attractive recurring revenues in Europe? The fact it thinks the deal would be accretive to free cash per share from year one suggests it can. And all this is muddied by the fact that Comcast has admitted it is in advanced stages of preparing an offer for the businesses that Fox has agreed to sell to Disney. </p> <p> A bidding war seems on the cards but we just don\u2019t know how far either side will push this. Comcast shares are down a touch and are around 25% lower from their highs this year, indicative of investor fears about it paying over the odds. Disney shares were also a shade lower and are around 10% off their 2018 highs. Either way it\u2019s shaping up to be a battle royale between Comcast and Disney this summer and Sky shareholders will be winners now the deals have been cleared by the government.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5b16a0e0e4b069235b5d1f7f\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-06-05T14:44:32.875Z\">3.44pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Ben Bird, media sector specialist at management consultancy Vendigital, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The culture secretary\u2019s decision to allow the 21<sup>st</sup> Century Fox bid to go ahead, subject to a request that Sky News is divested, is essentially good news for the consumer as the consolidation is all about safeguarding content.</p> <p>It will be especially heartening for others in the media sector that the CMA is not intending to block the bid. This could be a sign that the organisation has recognised that there is a real need for medium and large-scale companies in the sector to leverage their scale.</p> <p>Sky is not immune to the disruption facing the industry, with the rise of agile competitors such as Amazon and Netflix. Attracting the attention of consumers has become more difficult and the business needs to reduce costs where it can, whilst continuing to produce quality content.</p> <p>Other media companies will be willing the bid to complete successfully \u2013 particularly with the outcome of the CMA\u2019s investigation into Trinity Mirror\u2019s proposed takeover of Northern &amp; Shell still pending.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5b16a01ce4b069235b5d1f7a\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-06-05T14:37:23.247Z\">3.37pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>More from the CMA:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/ITVJoel/status/1004007167446409226\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Too much influence?

                "bodyText":"In a busy day for corporate news, two events dominated. This morning the UK government sold a 7.7% stake in the bailed out Royal Bank of Scotland, raising \u00a32.5bn but crystallising a \u00a32.1bn loss on the price originally paid to rescue the bank. The final cost of the bailout could be \u00a330bn... or perhaps even more. The government defended the timing of the sale but some analysts suggested it was done to get it out of the way before the Brexit vote next week. Critics said it was a wasted opportunity to help reform the banking sector. The other big development was culture minister Matt Hancock\u2019s decision on the bids for Sky. He gave the go-ahead to the Comcast offer, and also the bid from 21st Century Fox, provided the Murdoch-controlled business agreed to sell Sky News to Disney or another buyer. Sky welcomed the news, which is likely to prompt a full takeover battle for the business while 21st Century Fox said it had already submitted plans to sell Sky News to Disney. But Labour expressed concerns about the sale of Sky News, saying its independence must be protected. Elsewhere the latest snapshot of the UK services sector showed stronger than expected growth which lifted the pound - on the basis it puts an interest rate rise back on the agenda - and sent the FTSE 100 0.7% lower. On that note, it\u2019s time to close for the day. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. Here is a handy run-through of the possible timetable for the Sky bids, courtesy of Jefferies analyst Jerry Dellis: Comcast\u2019s Rule 2.7 announcement of 25 Apr outlined its intention to make a Takeover Offer for Sky subject to pre-conditions being met. Competition clearance from the EU is now the final pre-condition. A decision will be made by 15 June according to the EC Competition website. Comcast has said that it will issue an Offer Document within 28 days all pre-conditions being met (implicitly by 13 July). Within 60 days of this, Sky must convene the shareholder meeting at which the Comcast proposal is to be voted on (by 11 Sep). Assuming it is not blocked by the Culture Secretary, Fox would announce a firm offer around 19 June. High Court approval would then be sought and the Scheme of Arrangement document would be posted out within 28 days of the offer announcement (around 17 July). Sky\u2019s shareholder meeting would need to take place within 21 days (7 Aug) with court approval after that. In reality, Sky\u2019s board will need to manage timetables such that shareholders are able to give adequate consideration to both offers. Sky shares have edged up 0.29% to \u00a313.54 after the US government cleared the Comcast and Fox bids for the company, albeit the latter was given the go-ahead on the condition that Sky News was sold. Meanwhile Royal Bank of Scotland has closed down 5.3% at 266p, compared to the 271p a share the government received in the sale of the latest tranche of its shares. Overall the FTSE 100 finished down 0.7% at 7686.8, undermined by a rise in sterling after better than expected service sector figures put a possible interest rate rise back on the agenda. Elsewhere the US tech boom continues: A bidding war for Sky is now on the cards but it is hard to judge how much higher the offers will go, says Neil Wilson, chief market analyst for Markets.com: Sky shares traded up about half a per cent [on the day] at \u00a313.55 as the Fox and Comcast bids were effectively waved through by culture secretary Matt Hancock. The commitment by Fox to let go of Sky News always looked like it be sufficient to assuage the media plurality concerns. For Comcast there were never any media plurality worries as it\u2019s got little European presence. A bidding war looms of course. The bid on the table from Comcast is an all-cash offer worth \u00a312.50 per share, so an increased offer is priced in already. But the fact that the shares are not roaring higher suggests investors are displaying some hesitation about whether Murdoch will significantly increase his offer. He may not have to - the option for Fox is to switch from the current Scheme of Arrangement to a Takeover Offer, which would allow it to use its 39% of shares in the vote. Then it\u2019s up to Comcast and we\u2019ll see just deep the pockets are - how badly does it want to diversify from the US and get exposure to Sky\u2019s attractive recurring revenues in Europe? The fact it thinks the deal would be accretive to free cash per share from year one suggests it can. And all this is muddied by the fact that Comcast has admitted it is in advanced stages of preparing an offer for the businesses that Fox has agreed to sell to Disney. A bidding war seems on the cards but we just don\u2019t know how far either side will push this. Comcast shares are down a touch and are around 25% lower from their highs this year, indicative of investor fears about it paying over the odds. Disney shares were also a shade lower and are around 10% off their 2018 highs. Either way it\u2019s shaping up to be a battle royale between Comcast and Disney this summer and Sky shareholders will be winners now the deals have been cleared by the government. Ben Bird, media sector specialist at management consultancy Vendigital, said: The culture secretary\u2019s decision to allow the 21st Century Fox bid to go ahead, subject to a request that Sky News is divested, is essentially good news for the consumer as the consolidation is all about safeguarding content. It will be especially heartening for others in the media sector that the CMA is not intending to block the bid. This could be a sign that the organisation has recognised that there is a real need for medium and large-scale companies in the sector to leverage their scale. Sky is not immune to the disruption facing the industry, with the rise of agile competitors such as Amazon and Netflix. Attracting the attention of consumers has become more difficult and the business needs to reduce costs where it can, whilst continuing to produce quality content. Other media companies will be willing the bid to complete successfully \u2013 particularly with the outcome of the CMA\u2019s investigation into Trinity Mirror\u2019s proposed takeover of Northern &amp; Shell still pending. More from the CMA: The full CMA report is available here. From the 414 page Competitions and Markets Authority report on the possible Sky bids, here is its view on the timetable for a Sky News sale: Sky shares have done little since Hancock unveiled his decision on both the Comcast and 21st Century Fox bids. They stood at \u00a313.53 when Hancock stood up, and are now almost imperceptibly higher at \u00a313.56. That compares with the \u00a310.75 a share on offer from Fox, and the better offer from Comcast of \u00a312.50 a share. Here\u2019s a link to the full statement from Matt Hancock on both bids for Sky: Here\u2019s the key section from Matt Hancock\u2019s statement -- outlining why 21 Century Fox must sell off Sky News in return for the government approving its takeover for Sky. I agree with the CMA that divesting Sky News to Disney, as proposed by Fox, or to an alternative suitable buyer, with an agreement to ensure it is funded for at least ten years, is likely to be the most proportionate and effective remedy for the public interest concerns that have been identified. The CMA report sets out some draft terms for such a divestment, and Fox has written to me to offer undertakings on effectively the same terms. The proposals include significant commitments from Fox. But there are some important issues on the draft undertakings which still need to be addressed. I need to be confident that the final undertakings ensure that Sky News: remains financially viable over the long-term; is able to operate as a major UK-based news provider; and is able to take its editorial decisions independently, free from any potential outside influence. As a result, I have asked my officials to begin immediate discussions with the parties to finalise the details with a view to agreeing an acceptable form of the remedy, so we can all be confident Sky News can be divested in a way that works for the long term. Under the legislation, I am required to consult formally for 15 days on the undertakings. Subject to the willingness of the parties to agree the details, I aim to publish this consultation within a fortnight. I am optimistic that we can achieve this goal, not least given the willingness 21st Century Fox has shown in developing these credible proposals. However, if we can\u2019t agree terms at this point, then I agree with the CMA that the only effective remedy now would be to block the merger altogether. This is not my preferred approach. Here\u2019s a clip of Chris Bryant suggesting that Kay Burley will drive Matt Hancock out of parliament if Sky News hits the buffers. Anything Martin Bell can do, Kay can do too..... Liberal Democrat MP Christine Jardine says her party has concerns about Fox\u2019s proposed takeover of Sky. She welcomes the plan for Sky News to be divested... but wonders if rival bidder Comcast will give similar reassurances about media independence if it wins the battle for Sky. Matt Hancock replies that Comcast has given undertakings and assurances. By law, he looked at its bid for Sky because of its material size. He concluded that Comcast\u2019s bid did not raise public interest concerns, so the government will not issue an intervention notice. Hancock adds that he hopes the Sky takeover battle will reach a conclusion that \u201cdemonstrates with confidence\u201d that Sky News will be independent and viable, so parliament can be content with the state of media plurality in future. Back in parliament, Labour MP Chris Bryant has criticised the proposal for Sky News to be sold off if 21st Century Fox wins the takeover battle for Sky. He warns that Sky News could be starved of money by whoever buys it (either Disney or another owner). So, in a few years they\u2019ll come back to the government and ask to be subsumed back into Fox. To laughter, Bryant suggests that Matt Hancock could even find himself facing a TV news veteran at the polling booth. Kay Burley will be out of a job, and she\u2019ll stand in West Sussex and defeat him, because most people in this country would prefer a diversity of ownership of media and we want to keep Sky as independence as possible. Hancock replies that he relishes the prospect of a contest in West Sussex with anyone (!) but doesn\u2019t accept that Sky News will be starved of funds in the future. Here\u2019s a clip of Tom Watson telling parliament that Labour has serious concerns about the proposed sale of Sky News, and that the channel\u2019s \u2018independent and rigorous\u2019 independence must be protected. Here\u2019s our media editor, Jim Waterson, on today\u2019s announcement: The UK government has approved a bid from US media giant Comcast to take over Sky, while indicating it is minded to approve a rival bid from Rupert Murdoch\u2019s 21st Century Fox providing it sells Sky News to another organisation. The decisions are likely to set up a multibillion-pound bidding war for the British broadcaster. Fox is attempting to buy the 61% of Sky that it does not already own, in a deal valuing the company at \u00a318.5bn, but the bid has been complicated by concerns that it would leave Murdoch with too much control over the UK media. Comcast, which owns US TV network NBC and Universal Studios, made a rival bid earlier this year that valued Sky at \u00a322bn. The culture secretary, Matt Hancock, approved the Comcast deal in a statement in the House of Commons, while indicating he will also approve the Murdoch deal if Sky News is offloaded to an appropriate buyer in order to avoid excessive influence by the the mogul\u2019s family over the UK news business. Here\u2019s his full story: Rupert Murdoch\u2019s 21st Century Fox has also welcomed the government\u2019s decision. In a statement to shareholders, 21CF says it has already submitted plans to sell Sky News to Disney (to address those concerns about media plurality). Here\u2019s its statement: 21st Century Fox (\u201c21CF\u201d) welcomes today\u2019s announcement by the Secretary of State for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport that he has cleared 21CF\u2019s proposed acquisition of the remaining shares in Sky on broadcasting standards, as recommended by the Competition and Markets Authority (\u201cCMA\u201d). Regarding the effects on media plurality we note that the CMA recommended to the Secretary of State that divestiture is \u201cthe most effective and proportionate remedy\u201d. 21CF has already submitted proposed undertakings to achieve the divestiture of Sky News to Disney. We note that the Secretary of State agrees with this solution and has instructed officials from the Department for Culture, Media and Sport (\u201cDCMS\u201d) to agree final undertakings that he would be prepared to accept and consult on within the two-week timeframe. We now look forward to engaging with DCMS and we are confident that we will reach a final decision clearing our transaction. Sky says it welcomes Matt Hancock\u2019s announcements (not a surprise, as it paves the way for a full-blooded takeover battle for the company). It adds: In respect of 21CF\u2019s proposed acquisition of Sky, Sky notes that the Secretary of State considers that the undertakings provided by 21CF have provided a good starting point to overcome the adverse public interest effects of the proposed merger that he has identified, and that DCMS Officials have now been instructed to seek to agree final undertakings with 21CF. The Secretary of State has stated that, dependent on the outcome of these discussions, he would hope to be in a position to consult on any agreed final undertakings within the next two weeks. Shadow culture secretary Tom Watson is responding to Hancock now. He warns that selling Sky News to Disney could backfire, if the planned takeover of 21 CF by Disney should collapse. This could leave Sky News vulnerable. The CMA\u2019s and Hancock have concluded that that the takeover would not threaten broadcasting standards. Watson, though, queries this view. He suggests that upcoming court cases brought against The Sun could show maladministration by Fox, which might make the minister change his view. Now onto 21 Century Fox\u2019s takeover bid for Sky. Matt Hancock tells MPs that the Competition and Markets Authority has concluded that 21CN\u2019s bid could operate against the public interest, for two reasons: potential erosion of Sky News\u2019s editorial independence. Increased influence of Murdoch family trust on public opinion and the UK\u2019s political agenda. Hancock says various remedies have been proposed. He says that the idea of divesting Sky News to Disney [which is hoping to take over 21st Century Fox] or to an alternative provider with funding for at least 10 years, is the most proportionate and effective remedy to address these concerns. Hancock is saying he will approve 21 Century Fox\u2019s bid for Sky can proceed - if he is satisfied that Sky News\u2019 independence is guaranteed. Hancock says he has asked officials to begin immediate discussions with 21 CF to draw up a final proposal for Sky News to be divested in a satisfactory way. Culture minister Matt Hancock says he has considered Comcast and 21 Century Fox\u2019s bids for Sky separately. Comcast first.... Hancock rules that the deal does not does not raise public interest concerns. So, he will not be issuing an intervention notice. That\u2019s a green light for Comcast! Heathrow questions are finally over. Matt Hancock has descended from his holding pattern and is giving his statement on the Sky takeover now. Matt Hancock will give his decision on the Sky takeover once transport secretary Chris Grayling finishes answering questions from MPs about Heathrow Airport. The government has decided to back plans to build a third runway at Heathrow, after years of prevarication. Plenty of MPs want their say. Some support the plan -- as do unions and business groups. But other MPs (especially with constituencies in or near West London) are very worried about the environmental impact. It\u2019s also ironic that London is getting another runway while the railways network in the North of England suffers severe disruption after decades of under-investment. Our Politics Live blog has the details: The Financial Times predicts that both Sky takeover offers will get the green light from the government today. The FT\u2019s Matthew Garrahan explains: The fate of competing bids for Sky by 21st Century Fox and Comcast will become clear today when culture secretary Matt Hancock delivers the UK government\u2019s verdict on whether to block or clear each offer. Fox, which is controlled by Rupert Murdoch, has been embroiled in regulatory scrutiny for 18 months with its bid to take full control of Sky, offering \u00a310.75 a share, valuing the company \u2014 which was founded by Mr Murdoch \u2014 at about \u00a318.5bn. Comcast made a competing offer earlier this at \u00a312.50 a share, which valued Sky at about \u00a322bn. Mr Hancock is expected to clear both bids \u2014 possibly with some conditions attached \u2014 setting the scene for a bidding war for Sky. Separately, Fox and Comcast are embroiled in another takeover tussle: Walt Disney is attempting to buy Fox\u2019s entertainment assets \u2014 including its 39 per cent stake in Sky \u2014 in a deal worth $66bn including debt. More here. Breaking away from the RBS share sale, the UK government is about to rule whether either Rupert Murdoch or US conglomerate Comcast - or both - should be allowed to take full control of broadcaster Sky. Culture minister Matt Hancock will make a statement on the situation in parliament shortly. Murdoch\u2019s 21 Century Fox (21CF) currently owns 39% of Sky, and launched a full takeover bid in December 2016. However, the bid has been held up by concerns that it will give Murdoch too much control on the UK media landscape. In January, the Competition and Markets Authority said 21st Century Fox\u2019s bid was not in the public interest due to concerns about media plurality. Fox has since offered some concessions, such as making Sky News a legally separative business. Comcast launched its own bid for Sky in April. It could potentially derail Murdoch\u2019s plan to sell most of 21CF to Disney in a $66bn (\u00a347bn) deal. So Hancock\u2019s decision could be extremely significant for Sky\u2019s future, and the wider media landscape.... If you\u2019re just tuning in, here\u2019s our economics editor Larry Elliott on today\u2019s RBS share sale: Philip Hammond has been forced to defend the government\u2019s decision to sell part of its stake in RBS after an overnight sale of shares left taxpayers nursing a \u00a32bn loss. The chancellor said the offloading of almost 8% of the company\u2019s shares for \u00a32.5bn was a significant step in returning the high street bank \u2013 bailed out by Labour during the depths of the 2008 financial crisis \u2013 to the private sector. But the sale of 925m shares at 271p each was at a price significantly lower than the 502p at which the Treasury bought its stake a decade ago and led to criticism that ministers had sold at the wrong time. Hammond said: \u201cThis sale represents a significant step in returning RBS to full private ownership and putting the financial crisis behind us. The government should not be in the business of owning banks. The proceeds of this sale will go towards reducing our national debt. This is the right thing to do for taxpayers as we build an economy that is fit for the future.\u201d John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, said: \u201cThere is no economic justification for this sell-off of RBS shares. There should be no sales of RBS shares, full stop. But particularly with such a large loss to the taxpayers who bailed out the bank. Prem Sikka, emeritus professor of accounting at the University of Essex, said: \u201cWhy sell? Taxpayers bailed out the bank and when there is a glimpse of recovery and profits, the government sells it at a loss to ensure that profits are collected by its friends in the City.\u201d Shares in RBS have not traded above the price the government bought them at since 2010 and never once hit the 625p-a-share break-even price calculated by the National Audit Office (NAO) to take into account the cost of finance. More here: Hammond forced to defend RBS shares sale after \u00a32bn loss to taxpayers Laith Khalaf, Senior Analyst, Hargreaves Lansdown, reminds us JUST HOW BIG Royal Bank of Scotland had become after years of dealmaking under the leadership of Fred Goodwin. \u2018It\u2019s now clear the losses sustained by the taxpayer on the RBS bailout are going to be substantial, though this really reflects the price paid for financial stability in the depths of the global banking crisis. In essence the RBS bailout cushioned the blow of the financial crisis, and spread the pain across many years, a decision which is now beginning to become more measurable. We will never know what the outcome would have been if RBS had been allowed to fail, though it\u2019s important to recognise the scale of RBS at the time. The bank may have its roots in the cobbled streets of Edinburgh, but it became one of the world\u2019s biggest banks, with a \u00a32.4 trillion balance sheet at the height of its power. To put that number in context, it\u2019s bigger than the annual output of the whole UK economy and compares with the $639 balance sheet of Lehman\u2019s Brothers just before it filed for bankruptcy. It\u2019s just possible therefore that the collapse of RBS could have taken all the other dominos with it. Clearly the losses that are now being sustained on the government shareholding are deeply unwelcome, but the alternative to a bailout might have been far worse.\u2019 My colleague Richard Partington has been crunching the numbers... The Unite union have blasted the government over today\u2019s share sale. Rob MacGregor, Unite national officer, says Philip Hammond and colleagues should use their power as majority shareholders to improve the bank, not sell out at a loss: \u201cThe government is attempting to wash its hands with Royal Bank of Scotland at the expense of the taxpayer. This bargain basement sale of over seven per cent of the bank\u2019s shares is a betrayal of public finances and represents a total loss of over \u00a33 billion for taxpayers since the original bail-out in 2008. Staff are clear that the government should be focusing its attentions on keeping RBS bank branches open and improving the corporate governance of this institution. \u201cThe catalogue of failures across the bank ranging from thousands of staff cuts, closing hundreds of bank branches and also the sale of financial products which resulted in the $4.9 billion US fine demonstrates the systematic failures by the management to effectively run this organisation. Staff across the business are continuing to pay for the mistakes at the top whilst the government merely looks the other way.\u201d Labour\u2019s shadow City minister, Jonathan Reynolds, argues that the government is selling up at precisely the wrong moment: He\u2019s referring to the $4.9bn (\u00a33.6bn) penalty which the US Department of Justice hit RBS with last month, for misselling toxic securities in the run-up to the financial crisis. That fine was smaller than expected, so one of the biggest clouds over RBS has finally lifted. That should give the bank\u2019s shares a lift in the coming months. Then again.... there\u2019s still the risk that the UK economy falls into recession, especially if Brexit turns out badly. Jane Sydenham, Investment Director at City firm Rathbones, argues that Philip Hammond is wise to sell some shares while he can: With the economy in relatively good shape and interest rates likely to rise in the not-too-distant future, it\u2019s a good time for the government to start selling the RBS stock. Although the sale of stocks is still loss-making for the tax payer, it\u2019s important that the government gets as much back as possible while they can, instead of waiting too long and potentially seeing the economy move into trouble again. With this risk in mind, there is no point waiting even if it does mean accepting a loss. I\u2019ve just realised that the true break-even price of the RBS bailout is even higher than I thought. The 625p break-even point was set by the National Audit Office last summer, when it assessed the government\u2019s first sale of RBS shares in 2015. It is based on the cost of the government borrowing \u00a345bn to fund the RBS bailout (the NAO estimated that UK bonds were being sold at 3.7% per year at the time.) So, that figure includes the financial cost of the rescue. But, it doesn\u2019t cover the additional cost of repaying the debt since 2015. As this NAO chart shows, the true cost of the bailout keeps rising the longer the taxpayer holds onto its shares. So the break-even price could already be closer to \u00a37.... In City jargon, the government sold part of its stake in RBS through an \u201caccelerated bookbuilding process to institutional investors\u201d In practice, that means 925m shares were sold to banks, hedge funds, pension funds, insurance companies, and other organisations who manage our money. Citigroup, Goldman Sachs and J.P. Morgan all acted as \u2018bookrunners\u2019 for the placing, which means they persuaded the institutional investors to take part (readers can speculate why it takes THREE investment banks to handle this sort of thing.....). Economics journalist Dharshini David points out that the buyers will probably make a profit (once RBS\u2019s shares rise above 271p). Some critics say the government is wasting a great opportunity by simply selling their stake in Royal Bank of Scotland. Labour MP Gareth Thomas argues that the Treasury could turn the bank into a building society with a remit to help the UK economy: Positive Money, a group which campaigns for a fairer banking system, argues that RBS should be broken up. Fran Boait, executive director of Positive Money, says today\u2019s share selloff is a \u2018colossal wasted opportunity\u2019. As well as losing the taxpayer billions of pounds, the government is also losing the ability to reshape Britain\u2019s banking system. \u201cInstead of selling off its majority stake, the government should use its position to break up RBS into smaller, regional banks, with alternative business models that emphasise lending to SMEs and productive industry. \u201cSuch innovation is needed to direct lending to the real economy, which has been been starved of investment in recent years.\u201d Graham Spooner, investment research analyst at The Share Centre, recommends that RBS investors hold onto their shares. Spooner argues that the bank\u2019s financial performance is improving, so it should resume paying dividends to investors soon. Spooner says: \u201cInstitutional shareholders paid more or less the market price [in today\u2019s sale] so they must have some confidence in the banks longer-term recovery. As well as this, the bank could be a step nearer to paying a dividend. \u201cThe negative is that the government still have a large holding of 62.4% which is set to overhang the market for some time; the government cannot sell any more for 90 days. \u201cWhile shares are up slightly from a year ago off the back of improved performance and improved confidence leading to a change in our recommendation from a \u2018sell\u2019 to a \u2018hold\u2019, shares in early trading this morning have fallen by 3.4%. We maintain our \u2018hold\u2019 recommendation due to the increased likelihood of a dividend payment and the CEO\u2019s restructuring plans.\u201d Nearly 10 year ago, there were suspicions that taxpayers would never recover the tens of billions of pounds that were injected into Britain\u2019s banks as the world\u2019s financial system was shaking at its foundations. The Labour government announced the bailout of RBS, Lloyds and HBOS on 13 October 2008 - one of many dramatic days during the crisis. Prime minister Gordon Brown declared that taking stakes in the banks would create a \u2018rock of stability\u2019 to help Britain through the unfolding crisis. But George Osborne, then the shadow chancellor, warned that the financial consequences would be severe, telling parliament: But, of course, the scale of what the taxpayer is on the hook for is only just starting to dawn on the British people: this is the biggest bail out in the world so far, paid for by the biggest increase in debt by any peacetime Government and funded by the \u00a311,000 of extra borrowing that will now be heaped on every family in the country. Chancellor Alastair Darling insisted that the government would sell its shares \u2018in due course\u2019: In relation to ordinary shares, we will get a dividend when dividends are payable, and when we sell our shares the money will come back to the taxpayer. There was no suggestion then that Britain would still be a majority shareholder in RBS a decade later.... Prem Sikka, Emeritus Professor of Accounting at the University of Essex, argues that today\u2019s sale is a mistake: Fiona Cincotta, senior market analyst at City Index, fears the UK government will suffer further losses on its RBS shareholding: Even with carefully timed sales the government may not be able to regain the full sum it put into keeping the bank afloat. RBS is currently working through a turnaround plan designed to build it back up to its pre-financial crisis strength. Reuters\u2019 columnist Jamie McGeever agrees: Economist Shaun Richards pins the blame on the former Labour chancellor, Alastair Darling for bailing out RBS in 2008: The BBC\u2019s Joe Lynam flags up that RBS\u2019s shares have fallen this morning, as the government\u2019s stake hits the market. Newsflash: The British economy is showing signs of having come through the worst of its recent slowdown triggered by bad weather, as the dominant services sector grew more quickly than expected. The reading on the Markit/CIPS UK Services PMI rose to 54.0 in May from 52.8 a month earlier. Economists had forecast 53.0 on a scale where anything above 50 indicates expansion. The pound has jumped by half a percent against the US dollar to $1.337, on expectations that the Bank of England might raise interest rates in August. But growth at eurozone companies has slowed to its lowest rate in one-and-a-half years, Markit reports. More on this later.... Unless Royal Bank of Scotland\u2019s share price rallies in the next few years, Britain\u2019s taxpayers are going to suffer a massive loss on the 2008 bailout. The government still owns around 7.5 billion RBS shares. If they were all sold at today\u2019s price of 271p, it would create an additional loss of \u00a317bn compared to the 502p purchase price. If you include today\u2019s sale, and the one in 2015, and the total loss would be around \u00a320bn. But using the NAO\u2019s break-even price of 625p, the loss on our remaining RBS shares would actually be \u00a326.5bn. That\u2019s on top of the \u00a33bn loss crystallised today, and the \u00a31.9bn loss on the 2015 share sale - taking the potential loss over \u00a330bn. These are immense sums of money -- not far short of England\u2019s entire schools budget of \u00a339bn. But we need to consider the counter-factual -- what would have happened if the government had allowed RBS to fail in 2008? Alastair Darling, the then-chancellor, later revealed that RBS was about to run out of money unless he stepped in, thanks to its disastrous takeover of Dutch rival ABN Amro, and huge losses thanks to the US subprime crisis. Darling and Brown\u2019s \u00a345bn bailout may have helped avoid a major economic disaster, as Michael Hewson of CMC Markets explains: If the rest of the government stake is sold at a similar price then the total loss comes to something in the region of \u00a321bn, a sizeable loss indeed from the original \u00a345bn, but nonetheless probably needs to be measured against what the economic cost might have been if the bank had been allowed to fail. Ultimately taxpayers and politicians of whatever persuasion need to ask themselves if a \u00a32-3bn loss on this particular stake is a price worth paying for a smaller safer bank, as well as banking system, with the upside that the billions of pound it unlocks can be better used for things like the NHS, and other public services. \u2022 This block was amended on 6 June 2018 because an earlier version referred to England\u2019s school budget as that for the UK. Gordon Brown\u2019s government invested \u00a345bn into Royal Bank of Scotland to maintain financial stability following the collapse of Lehman Brothers, not in search of a quick profit. But there\u2019s no argument that RBS has proved a disappointing investment. The bank\u2019s shares haven\u2019t traded above the 502p (the taxpayers\u2019 purchase price) since 2010. And they\u2019ve never hit the NAO\u2019s 625p break-even price since the bailout was finalised at the end of 2008. Back in 2015, the government sold its first tranche of RBS shares at 330p each (creating a loss of \u00a31.9bn according to the National Audit Office). The NAO also concluded that the 2015 sale achieved value for money - and indeed, it looks like a steal compared to today\u2019s share price..... Philip Hammond is \u201cmoving to cash in his chips\u201d by selling some Royal Bank of Scotland shares before the Brexit negotiations reach their climax, says analyst Neil Wilson of Markets.com. Wilson also points out that RBS looks to be in \u2018decent shape\u2019, compared to a few years ago. Crucially, it has also settled its long-running legal problems in America (over misconduct in the run-up to the financial crisis. He explains: RBS has come a long way in recent years. From racking up c\u00a350bn in losses in ten years due in large part to mega restructuring charges and impairment charges, the bank has turned a corner. As noted a month ago, the settling of the DoJ case was key, removing the last big overhang and paving the way for the government to sell off its stock and for dividends to return. Attributable profits in the last quarter tripled to \u00a3792m, versus \u00a3259m in the same period in 2017, whilst the pre-tax operating profit was up 70% at \u00a31.2bn. The government\u2019s critics will look at these figures, and conclude that we\u2019re selling up at the wrong time. Shares in Royal Bank of Scotland have fallen by 3.3% in early trading to 271p -- matching the price which the government sold its shares this morning. The UK government is defending its decision to sell part of its RBS stake for around half the price they paid for it. Treasury Economic Secretary John Glen says it is \u2018unrealistic\u2019 to think that Britain should hold onto all its RBS shares until taxpayers can recoup their full investment in the bank. Glen told Radio 4\u2019s Today Programme that: I would love it if we could sell the shares at a much higher price, obviously, that is what everyone would like to do, but we need to be realistic and look at the market conditions. Glen argues that RBS is in a \u201cmuch healthier position\u201d than a decade ago, and that this is the right time to recover some money for taxpayers. Ross McEwan, the chief executive of RBS, is pleased that his largest shareholder has cut its stake: McEwan says: \u201cI am pleased that the government has decided the time is now right to re-start the share sale process This is an important moment for RBS and an important step in returning the bank to private ownership. It also reflects the progress we have made in building a much simpler, safer bank that is focussed on delivering for its customers and its shareholders.\u201d Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Nearly 10 years after the worst financial crisis in decades, Britain has managed to reduce its stake in Royal Bank of Scotland - but at a hefty loss. The UK government has sold 925 million RBS shares this morning, at 271p each. This lowers the taxpayers\u2019 stake in the bank from 70.1% to 62.4%, raising \u00a32.5bn for the public coffers. Chancellor Phillip Hammond has hailed the move, saying: This sale represents a significant step in returning RBS to full private ownership and putting the financial crisis behind us. The government should not be in the business of owning banks. The proceeds of this sale will go towards reducing our national debt - this is the right thing to do for taxpayers as we build an economy that is fit for the future. However, the move also crystallises a hefty loss for taxpayers. Gordon Brown\u2019s government bought its majority stake in RBS for around 502p in autumn 2008, to protect the bank from collapsing (and possibly taking the UK economy with it). So, Hammond\u2019s sale price of 271p means the UK has lost just over \u00a32bn on these shares. And the damage is arguably even worse. Last year, the National Audit Office estimated that the break-even price for an RBS share sale was 625p -- once you factor in the financing costs of acquiring the shares. By the NAO\u2019s logic, that means a loss of nearly \u00a33.3bn today! Opposition MPs are lining up to criticise today\u2019s share sale. John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, said: \u201cThere is no economic justification for this sell-off of RBS shares. There should be no sales of RBS shares, full stop. But particularly with such a large loss to the taxpayers who bailed out the bank.\u201d We\u2019ll be tracking reaction to the sale this morning.... Also coming up today: Data firm Markit is releasing its regular healthcheck on the world\u2019s services companies across the globe. Economists predict that the UK services PMI will come in at 53.4, slightly higher than April\u2019s 53.2, indicating growth accelerated a little. We also get the latest UK car registration figures - analysts predict a small rise, for the second month running.

                "bodyText":"TSB bosses faced another bruising session in front of the Treasury select committee as they were quizzed about the continuing IT meltdown which hit 1.9m of its customers. Chief executive Paul Pester said 2,200 customers had suffered fraudulent attempts to access their accounts since the IT problems first surfaced. Of these 1,300 had received compensation. Earlier FCA boss Andrew Bailey mentioned a figure of 10,600 incidents, but Pester clarified that the figure referred to alerts sent to accounts when suspicious activity was detected by the bank\u2019s systems. Pester said the bank had set up a dedicated fraud line to deal with the overwhelming number of enquiries, and waiting times were only a few minutes. But committee chair Nicky Morgan said she had received reports during the meeting of people holding on for nearly 30 minutes before hanging up. MP John Mann expressed amazement when Pester and TSB chair Richard Meddings professed ignorance of a case when someone had received a letter giving details of someone else\u2019s bank account. He also slammed the level of compensation - \u00a3100 - awarded to a constituent for their ruined wedding. With Pester profusely apologising several times during the course of the meeting, Mann said the level of compensation amounted to \u201c\u00a31 per apology\u201d. Morgan described the level of compensation as \u201cabsolutely inadequate.\u201d Overall Pester said the bank had spent \u00a370m on compensation and additional resources to cope with fixing the problems so far. He was also forced to deny he had deliberately misled the committee at its previous hearing. Mann asks if heads will roll, but Meddings says that will depend on the outcome of an investigation by Slaughter and May into the causes of the fiasco. Pester says he will not fall on his sword since he wants to fix the problems, while on the thorny question of possible golden parachutes, Meddings says if people are found to be grossly negligent that will be taken into account in the terms of their departure. The meeting ended with Nicky Morgan saying she expected the TSB executives to be called back again to update the committee on the progress in fixing the problems. On that note, it\u2019s time to close for the day. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. In her closing remarks Morgan says unfortunately the saga goes on. The FCA letter says ... TSB has not been open and transparent. The committee cannot remember such a letter from the FCA. She says, you have confirmed the IT migration has lead to people being fraudulently deprive of their money, life experiences such as weddings and house purchases ruined, the compensation is absolutely inadequate and the problems continue. This cannot be something you want, ultimately it is not only damaging to TSB but also to other banks in the sector and to online banking. Unfortunately, although we are grateful to you for your time... it did take an hour and half for you to thank your staff. I suspect we will ask you to come back again, because we will be keeping a very close eye on what is going on to put all of this right. Question: will it look at culpability of individuals and the role of the Spanish bank? Meddings says it will look at the relationship with the platform supplier. Question: what is the scope of the instructions to Slaughter and May? Medding says we can provide the terms of reference. The reason it\u2019s a law firm is that part of the terms is about the governance around the decision made to migrate. Question: how many people have switched to TSB? Pester says we have not been attracting many new customers to our current accounts. Morgan asks how much overtime are staff having to do in branches? Pester says he can\u2019t give figures. Branch transactions are taking longer than we would like. Branches are not operating normally. Morgan says some of the fraud is done with sim cards so is TSB in contact with the mobile companies? Pester says yes they have been. Morgan says there are people trying to call the fraud line and have waited 15 minutes and 27 minutes and given up. She asks when the Slaughter and May report will be published. Meddings says there is no date but they have started work. He says he hopes it\u2019s several weeks, not longer than that. But not before the summer holidays. They haven\u2019t given me a deadline date. Montes is asked if Sabadell should be paid by TSB for this failure? He says, we are quite conscious about the damage to TSB customers. We know most of it came from bad functioning of the system after migration. We have committed resources to work to a solution. There have not been any kind of discussions about payments,. There won\u2019t be until the solution is finished. Question: who was really in charge here during this process? Pester: The responsibility and decision was with the TSB board. Question: Was the timing, decision making, risk management controlled by TSB? Pester: Ultimately yes although we used a range of suppliers to opine whether we were in a position to migrate. Question: clerks here found a forum with customers complaining of receiving letters for other people. Why are you not prepared to make sure your customers are not being defrauded? Pester says he has acknowledged TSB has sent multiple letters in the same envelope. Again he apologises. Question: how many customers have left the bank? Pester: 12,500 customers have switched away, but I do not know causes. Question: how many staff have you recruited? Pester: 2,200 Question: are you paying them full overtime? Pester: yes, we are paying twice normal rate for overtime. Question: so why weren\u2019t they adequately resourced in the first place? Pester: we did increase resource before migration, but we didn\u2019t expect this level of problems. We would never have done the migration if we had known we would have these issues. Question: Payments to Sabadell for migration were delayed until completion. Why? Pester: To account for any cost overruns. Question: will the payments be made? Pester: it will depend on the report into what happened. On compensation, Pester says if people are not happy they can come back to us. He says it is easy to register a complaint. But Pester is accused of not taking on board how serious some of these problems (eg the ruined wedding) are. Question: can you give a guarantee on a minimum amount? Pester says he will write to the committee with the figures. Pester is asked about TSB\u2019s profits which he says are around \u00a3200m. He says money should not be an object for resources. Question: and should not be an object for compensation? Pester says of course not. Question: how much have you employed for resources and compensation? Pester says we have no set amount. Meddings says we will set an appropriate compensation framework. To date bank has cancelled charges worth \u00a329m. Have compensated people for fraud of \u00a311.2m, and backlog means it is probably \u00a320m year to date. Incremental resources, overtime and people, IBM etc, about another \u00a320m. Montes says the figures are consolidated into Sabadell accounts. Question. You have dealt with 24,094 complaints out of 95,063. This is not a significant number. Should you be adding more resources to address this problem? Pester says we have added 466 extra complaints handlers, over the last week. We dealt with the 24,000 before this, our aspiration is to close this down as quickly as possible. Every complaint we attempt to deal with within eight weeks of receiving it. Question: are you prepared to put in extra staff? Meddings says absolutely yes. We are adding resource as fast as it is possible to do. We have taken more people into branches and call centres, they have to be trained so we are bringing on resources and will continue to do so. Question: the compensation figures are extraordinarily small. Will anyone who is forced out get golden parachutes? Meddings says we will look at conclusions, take necessary action. It will depend on outcome and nature of the fault. If they are found to have been grossly negligent that will be taken into account in the terms of their departure. Question about the letters written by TSB to direct debit companies when customers wanted to switch, saying customers had died. Pester says there were 370 people affected and caused by an error in the software. Pester says they are speaking to the customers\u2019 new banks to contact customers and offer them compensation. Pester says they are correcting the error with the direct debit companies. Morgan says you talk about things being resolved but they may not be resolved to the satisfaction of the customers. Mann says you are in breach of data protection law, you are paying pitiful levels of compensation which I find deeply disturbing, you pay yourselves massive amounts of money. Can we be certain some heads are going to roll? Meddings says it would be wrong to prejudge. But depending on what investigation we will take action. Mann asks them - especially Pester - if they will fall on their swords before they are pushed. Pester says his focus is on fixing this for customers, I am passionate about TSB, I don\u2019t think anyone else will be as committed as me, when we get to end of this procedure we will see. Mann says where is the leadership? Meddings says senior seats carry responsibility and we have chosen these seats. It\u2019s important to establish what went wrong and where there is culpability we will act on it. Mann asks how many heads will roll? Meddings says it is important not to prejudge. Slaughter and May are conducting an independent review, we will publish it and take action on the basis of its findings. If I am found to be culpable then the actions will attach to me. John Mann asks how could one of his constituents receive someone else\u2019s details. Pester says he apologies. I don\u2019t know how it happened, I don\u2019t know the circumstances. It\u2019s not something we do intentionally. Mann asks Meddings the same question. Meddings says I can\u2019t answer without knowing details. Mann asks if this an ongong problem. Pester said he is not aware of it. Mann says his constituent wrote to TSB and heard nothing back. You\u2019re saying you\u2019re not aware and that\u2019s astonishing. I\u2019m struggling that you\u2019re even aware of the problem. Mann asks about a constituent whose wedding was ruined and how much she received. Meddings says she has been compensated but can\u2019t say how much. But it would compensate for distress. Mann says it\u2019s \u00a3100. [Silence] Medding says he apologises. Mann says its \u00a31 per apology in this session. Mann now asks why Sabadell chief operating officer Miguel Montes is still in his job. Montes also apologies, and admits not all problems have been solved. Mann asks how embarrassed is he that his bank\u2019s reputation has been sullied by people who don\u2019t know how people received other people\u2019s details. Montes says, we are very embarrassed. Mann: How embarrassed are you about the level of compensation for someone who\u2019s wedding has been ruined? Montes: I have no competence to answer this question. Mann: Do you have confidence in working with people who don\u2019t bother compensating someone when it\u2019s raised in parliamentary committee. Is that good for your brand reputation. Montes: our brand reputation has been damaged. We have worked night and day, we have progress but not enough. Paul and his team have been clear we will do whatever it takes to compensate customers. Mann says Meddings reputation is on the line as well. How long will this take? Meddings says, we are working vigilantly. We are digging ourselves out of a hole. We have challenges with the call lines, and occasionally in the branches. Mann says the branches are bailing you out, and you have put the call centre staff in a difficult situation. Meddings thanks the bank\u2019s staff for having to deal with the situation. Question: The FCA has never written such a letter. Do you accept you should take more personal responsibility. Pester says, I am taking complete and utter responsibility.. All I can do is focus on fixing the situation. Question: Many on the committee believe you have misled the committee. Pesters says, I\u2019m sorry if you feel that, I have given the best information I had. Morgan says in a letter on 25 April you wrote everything it running smoothly for vast majority of customers. FCA said this was an example of poor communication. Do you regret that phrase? Pester apologies if he misled anyone. The use of that phrase was to show credit card, debit payments [etc] key parts were working well but we had serious problems with customer access. He says we have tried to communicate as well as we can. Question about whether Pester made confusing statement about IBM\u2019s role. Are IBM doing a full review or are they there just to help the situation? Pestere says they are there to help us fix problems, then perform a review to help us understand how this could have occurred. I apologise for my loose use of wording. Question: this is not the only loose use of wording. You said it was middlewear but it was more than this and you seem to know this from the IBM slides. Pester said the IBM findings are early findings and observations and say most of the problems are related to the applications, middleware and network ather than the underlying infrastructure. I tried to explain this in the first session. [Pester is asked to hand over the slides and does so.] Question: The FCA reminded TSB that communications should be fair and not misleading. Do you accept you misled customers and the committee. Pester says he does not accept he misled committee. The FCA did ask TSB to change and improve communications on 25 April. We did that a day later, and then the FCA said our communications were excellent. Question: Bailey wrote on 30 May and said the TSB\u2019s use of figures risked giving too positive a view. Do you accept he feels you have not been frank? Pester says Bailey also said there is no reason to believe TSB has made misleading statements and I apologise if you think. Question: This is your MO, you\u2019re saying its not that bad. This infuriates everyone, people feel they are being misled. Pester says this is not my intent. I\u2019m apologetic if you feel I\u2019m trying to spin the information. Question: Bailey says your quoting of averages is misleading. Pester says he\u2019s sorry if he appears to be unhelpful but he is telling the facts as he sees them. Question: In how many cases since the migration, when there has been an investi of the customer being liable, has there been a delay in compensation. Pester says we said we are not challenging or investigating customers as we created the uncertainty. To the best of my knowledge the answer is zero. MPs are giving more examples of customers suffering problems. Pester apologises if he gave the impression he was downplaying the seriousness of the problems facing the bank. He also says he is sorry if the committee thinks he is not keeping his customers up to date. Question: Either you knew about the scale of the issues with the fraud line [at the time of the previous committee session] and you didn\u2019t tell us or you didn\u2019t know there was a serious problem with fraud line. Pester says I told you the information I had at the time. Question: Banks should refund by the end of the following day when there is fraud. Has TSB done that? Pester admits TSB has not done that. Morgan talks about a self employed printer who wanted to access his money. He talks to TSB, gets another call from a mobile, is advised to talk to the person on the mobile. Then he thinks he\u2019s been defrauded, finds \u00a324,550 been taken from his account and TSB say he does not know how long it will be to get his money back. He has problems contacting TSB, finally gets his money back, changes account. Then he gets a letter, saying TSB is not at fault, and it offered \u00a3192. Is that a fair outcome. Pester says the details are distressing and I apologise. We will of course look at this case, and address them. He was caught up in that attack, I would like to take his case further. Chairman Richard Meddings also apologies, says its difficult to comment on whether the payments are sufficient. They don\u2019t necessarily seem to be a correct calculation, but we are attempting to set a framework of compensations taking into account stress and consequential loss. Morgan says the more important point, and where TSB is tone deaf, where the letter suggests customer has to prove the point. Meddings says, I get your point. When fraudsters raid accounts, banks can says customers are negligent but we are trying to compensate in full without asking about liability. Morgan says during last hearing, the TSB twitter account said fraud lines were experiencing higher than usual levels. If twitter knew that why didn\u2019t you? Pester apologies (again!) and says the number he gave in good faith was the number he had at the time. Morgan says does TSB deserve nickname of Terribly Shambolic Bank? Pester says this whole situation has been a terrible situation for TSB customers. All I can do is work hard to fix this situation. Morgan says Pester had said in a letter yesterday that between 23 April to 31 May, some 2,200 TSB customers had experienced attempts to access their accounts and 1300 suffered financial loss. But the FCA mentioned 10,000 incidents. For some customers this is not happening once but several times. Isn\u2019t it typical that every time TSB is asked, you try to be clever with the numbers. Pester says he\u2019s sorry if that seems to be the case. The FCA number refers to alerts on accounts, pointing out unusual transaction patterns, which trigger text messages to see if they are genuine. If we don\u2019t hear we block the accounts until we are able to speak to the customer. The 2,200 number is number of customers who had attempts to defraud. Morgan says how many fraud incidents where people had money taken out of their accounts were there? Pester says 1300 had money taken out of their account by fraudsters, and we have refunded them. Morgan points out Pester said at the last hearing that people were waiting only three minutes on the fraud line. Pester says at the last meeting we had not been subject to fraud attacks at that level, it started on the first bank holiday in May, peaked on 15 May, then came under control since. At first meeting we were not subject to those levels of attack. That was the true statement of the situation at the time. I am sorry if I appear to have been unforthright in evidence. Pester says the system tracking fraud still blocks accounts if it detects unusual patterns etc, so there are other ways than just customer reporting fraud. Morgan says fraud system hasn\u2019t been working properly though. Pester says the volume of attacks were 70 times the normal level of attacks. That overwhelmed TSB. So we put in a dedicated line. Fraud is a terrible experience. That fraud line has a two to three minute wait time. I apologise profusely to those customers who have suffered fraud. Pester says it is still the same team, but we recruited more partners so we could respond more quickly. Morgan asks how long people have waited over recent weeks. Pester says it is a priority line so it is a matter of minutes. We have tightened up our fraud defences, and now volume is two or three times normal level. Morgan says people are talking about waiting for hours. Pester says that was before the new line. He apologises again and says it was unacceptable. The level of fraud was unprecedented. But Morgan says in your planning you anticipated an increase in fraudulent activity, so it wasn\u2019t unprecedented. Pester says sadly yes, we had our teams on high intensity when we migrated but it was higher than expected. I have been shocked to read of customers waiting five, seven, nine hours. When I saw that I said we had to fix this. Putting a new line in was very important. Now TSB are up and Nicky Morgan begins with the issue of fraud. Question: Have conditions create a spate of fraudulent activity? Pester says he regrets but the situation gave an opportunity for fraudsters to target customers. Morgan says they have to phone a dedicated fraud line, and is the route to get compensation. Pester agrees but they says customers can report fraud to branches or online, but there is a dedicated line. Ultimately though it all ends up with fraud team. The FCA session ends on that note. John Mann ask who should be held to account? Bailey says that\u2019s the purpose of the investigation. But at the moment the most important thing is to dig out of hole. Mann says will you use the full range of your powers? Bailey says we will use the powers. Question: The last IT meltdown was Co-op. How many other banks are at similar risks with antiquated IT systems? Bailey says there are major IT changes going on most weekends in the banking systems. This year in particular there has been ringfencing. In this case it was a complete replatforming, from the Lloyds sytems to a new one. Most institutions are operating on systems which have evolved over years. [In terms of risk for other banks] Bailey says he hopes not but you never know. There is a lot still to learn about this one, he says. What would it take for us to observe this in a way TSB management did not, what level of intrusion would be needed? We were involved in the Visa incident, that was a hardware failure. We seek to learn but can\u2019t give an assurance these things will never happen again. Question: Will you set out what minimum compensation should be? Bailey says we will want to see how they set it up and calibrate it. There should be a minimum standard below which compensation applies. Services have not been affected evenly, this is one of the problems. Bailey is told the FCA should set down the law otherwise people will not have confidence, especially given the problems small businesses have faced with banks, especially GRG. Bailey says he hopes they appreciate how much the FCA has been involved with TSB. He says the FCA put a team on site very quickly. Question: TSB have appointed Deloitte to look at compensation, how is it going? Bailey says we are pleased they have brought in outside resources, they have been overwhelmed. They are taking it seriously but we want to see it up and running. Howard says they are recruiting staff to deal with compensation. They have started to resolve and settle complaints. Bailey says this should happen quite quickly, it is not very complex. The timeline is short in terms of when things went wrong. Question: In some cases when customers asked to switch, bank has written to some of their direct debit accounts saying they had died, are you aware of this? Bailey says that is another example of putting in a fix in to solve a problem and another part sends out a letter. Don\u2019t think they did that intentionally. Question: Does it undermine the system if people see this happening and are reluctant to switch. Bailey says longer term we will have to see the level of switching and if it is happening effectively. Question: are you confident no other banks do this? Bailey says I think we would know that. Sutherland says it\u2019s a TSB issue. Question: Who controlled the timing of migration of IT systems {TSB or parent company?] Bailey says that will be a major part of the investigation. It was utilising [parent company] Sabadell\u2019s platform but the responsibility rests with TSB managment... But this can\u2019t descend into finger pointing [between TSB and Sabadell] On the question of accountability, Bailey says in this case there is a relationship with an outsourcer (in this case part of the parent company). You can\u2019t outsource responsibility, and it rests with the management of the TSB. Question: have TSB now got it right? Bailey says they have improved considerably. The days of the rather generalised and rosy statements, we haven\u2019t seen them so often. But it is still important, there are a lot of things going wrong in branches, quite basis and important things. These things still need fixing and it will take time. Question: were your expectations on communications reflected in Pester\u2019s testimony. Bailey says it should have been a more thorough and balances communications situation. My bias would be tell it as it is and communicate extensively. Question: have you ever issued a letter quite like this before, including saying Pester was too optimistic and statements to the public were poor? Bailey says we don\u2019t have these situations too often. Some parts of the bank\u2019s service are functioning, and it\u2019s fair enough to point that out but there is a danger of overemphasis of that which gets away from the fact there are parts that are troubled. Sutherland says they have a torrid time with the branch systems, leading to very busy branches. It\u2019s quite clear those systems problems still exist. It\u2019s the bits that are not working we are not hearing so much about. Here\u2019s what FCA chief Andrew Bailey told MPs about the fraud attempts on TSB customers (at 2.40pm) I\u201dm going to be a little bit circumspect about what we say about fraud\u2026as we don\u2019t want to give information that fraudsters could use against the firm. We think there\u2019s been just over 10,000, 10,600, incidents, and that has resulted in a level of payout. FCA special advisor John Sutherland then explained how the number of \u2018alerts\u2019 of possible fraud are still rising. These alerts lead to customer accounts being blocked or stopped while the situation is investigated - but TSB is struggling to cope. Sutherland said: \u201cTSB is resourcing up to clear those alerts as soon as they can, but they are still on an upward trend. That doesn\u2019t indicate so much that there is an increasing amount of fraud, it\u2019s just that they not resourcing themselves yet to clear them fast enough. Sutherland then talked about the \u201chuge variability\u201d in TSB\u2019s ability to handle calls from customers who may have been defrauded, with just one in 10 getting through at the busiest times. Clearly that\u2019s not acceptable. Question: Do you feel TSB has adhered to the requirements on communcating the situation. Bailey says we have had some frank conversations about communications, and we said in our letter we were not satisfied. There is an onus of overcommunication, to tell customers what is happening. There is uncertainty at the start about what the situation is. Looking at the daily service levels, they were very volatile. Looking at averages doesn\u2019t give the entire picture. There should have been more communication and it needed to be more reflective of the fact it was a volatile and uncertain situation. Its not easy to communicate volatile. But otherwise you see a lot of criticism from customers. A more straightforward recognition of what the situation was would have been helpful. Has TSB always co-operated? Bailey says yes, they are working very hard, I do not want to call into question their hard work. They are in a hole and they are trying to get out of it. That is not the issue. The issue is how did you get in and how do you get out of it and protect the interests of customers. Bailey is asked about the suggestion that TSB chief executive Paul Pester had some information including slides from IBM which he did not share with the previous hearing. Bailey says IBM were brought in on the Wednesday, by the following Sunday they had produced slides of the issues. We saw those on Sunday, the hearing followed on Wednesday. They are not definitive but they do point to things. At the hearings, Pester said IBM believe issues are in the middleware. But it appears to be not just in the middleware, which the IBM slides show. Question: where are we in timeline for having a coherent plan for the recovery of services? Sutherland says there is a rolling fortnight forward plan for fixing faults in IT, but we haven\u2019t seen a plan for getting back to where we were before migration. Bailey says one of the reasons they brought IBM in was they didn\u2019t have that plan, IBM are helping put that plan in. Question: does TSB understand the problems, and have the root causes been found? Bailey says the understanding of the problem has evolved over time. It is still evolving, I do not regard that as particularly negligent. The rate of emerging faults is falling off, as you would expect. It would be wrong to speculate [about our investigation] but testing will be one of the key questions. How robust and rigorous was it. They have put a fix in, and something else happens elsewhere in the architecture, and messages are sent to customers which shouldn\u2019t be. So that gets back to testing. Question: when was FCA first told about the TSB problems? Bailey says the first warning that the FCA got was on the Sunday evening, we were notified at one minute to nine o\u2019clock. They were going live at 6 o\u2019clock, they first identified problems at 6.20. We heard just before 9,. we had the first call just around midnight. The FCA response was activated the next day. Morgan says FCA says they had not met standard for repaying fraud, why was that? Bailey says they were initially overwhelmed. The FCA\u2019s Sheree Howard says, they have now prioritised that. Morgan says is there a pattern of TSB trying to argue the case before refunding. The FCA says no. Nicky Morgan, chair of the Treasury committee, says one in ten fraud-related calls being answered is not up to FCA standards, and the FCA agrees. TSB set up a dedicated fraud line, with the idea that customers would be able to get through more quickly. People can use either line. Sutherland said the fraud problem didn\u2019t come up in the first ten days. Bailey is asked about fraud but says he will be circumspect. He says there have been around 10,600 incidents, which have resulted in a level of payout. The FSA\u2019s John Sutherland is talking about TSB being alerted to the prospect of fraud, which could lead to customers\u2019 accounts been locked. These are still on an upward trend, as TSB is not resourcing themselves. There is a huge variability between one in ten calls answered to practically all, depending on time of time. This has led to customers complaining about how long they have been waiting. The TSB session has begun, with the Financial Conduct Authority underway. Chief executive Andrew Bailey says they have had a full time presence at TSB for some time but they have scaled that back a little now. A reminder. The parliamentary session on the TSB problems can be seen live here, due to start in less than ten minutes. First up is the Financial Conduct Authority\u2019s chief executive Andrew Bailey and two of his colleagues. The FCA has issued a strong criticism of the performance of TSB and its chief executive Paul Pester over the IT fiasco. Meanwhile Pester and his team will be quizzed separately once the Treasury Committee is finished with the FCA. TSB\u2019s troubles shine a spotlight on the problems facing much of the banking sector, says professor Pinar Ozcan of Warwick Business School, that is, outdated technology: Many established banks\u2019 complicated and siloed IT infrastructures, which were built in the 1970s, make it difficult for them to form a platform that would make sense of the data that is currently stored in a disorganised and non-standard way in separate databases. Banks typically have vertically integrated pillars, which are all for different products and which don\u2019t really talk to one another. That\u2019s why, when you call your bank for something, they sometimes tell you, we\u2019ve got great rates for a mortgage, and you say, \u2018but I actually have a mortgage with you\u2019! The recent troubles at TSB provide a great example of a nightmare scenario that can arise as banks update their legacy IT systems. And this is a chicken and egg problem in that in order to avoid security breaches like in the case of TSB, banks have been avoiding major overhauls of their systems, but of course, the more they stay in avoidance mode, the less they will be able to provide digital platforms that make sense of data and offer competitive services. The parliamentary session on TSB\u2019s IT problems kicks off off in 30 minutes, so here\u2019s a quick reminder/preamble. The Treasury committee is holding its second hearing into the TSB IT meltdown. MPs will demand answers about the problems that prevented millions of TSB customers from accessing their accounts in recent weeks - and which still aren\u2019t fully fixed. MPs will hear from CEO Paul Pester at 3.30pm. Pester has been accused of complacency last month for not grasping the full extent of the disruption. The Financial Conduct Authority has put more pressure on Pester. The FCA has told MPs suggesting that he was too optimistic about the situation and didn\u2019t give MPs a proper account four weeks ago. The FCA\u2019s chief executive, Andrew Bailey, will give his assessment of the situation at 2.30pm Treasury committee chair Nicky Morgan has said she\u2019s very concerned about the communication failures at TSB. Labour shadow City minister Jonathan Reynolds has accused the bank of serious failings. Some TSB customers continue to report problems accessing services, and some are struggling to getting through to the bank to report problems..... After widespread condemnation, the boss of Qatar Airways has apologised for saying only a man could do his job because it\u2019s such a tricky job. Akbar Al Baker has now backtracked, claiming he is committed to gender equality and blaming the media for \u2018sensationalising\u2019 his comments. Frankly I\u2019m not sure they needed sensationalising. If you missed the story, Al Baker declared that: \u201cOf course, it [Qatar Airways] has to be led by a man, because it is a very challenging position.\u201d More here. Peter Praet has also hit eurozone bonds. Bond prices are down, sending yields (interest rates up), following Praet\u2019s hint that the European Central Bank could decide to stop its asset-purchase programme soon. Praet\u2019s comments suggest the ECB isn\u2019t panicking about the new populist government in Italy. Kit Juckes of Societe Generale says: Everyone in Europe seems to be in a terrific rush at the moment. Italian political developments continue at a rapid pace as the new Government flexes muscles and outlines it strategy. The ECB, widely assumed to be in ait-and-see mode, reluctant to rush towards policy normalisation until the BTP [Italian bond] market, at least, calms down, is also in too much of a hurry for such niceties. Back in the markets, the euro is rallying after a senior policymaker hinted that the European Central Bank could wind down its bond-buying stimulus programme soon. ECB chief economist Peter Praet told a conference in Berlin this morning that the governing council will debate whether to gradually unwind bond purchases at its meeting next week. Praet cited the (long-awaited) recovery in Europe\u2019s labour market; the Eurozone unemployment rate fell to 8.5 percent in April, a 10-year low. That should push inflationary pressures higher, and give the ECB confidence to rein in its money-printing scheme. The ECB\u2019s is currently committed to buying \u20ac30bn of eurozone government bonds each month with newly created money, until at least September. Praet\u2019s comments suggest that the ECB will discuss ending QE in three months, although a final decision might not come until July\u2019s meeting. The euro has jumped by half a cent against the US dollar to $1.177, a two-week high. The Labour party have added their voice to the chorus of criticism of TSB. Jonathan Reynolds MP, Labour\u2019s Shadow City Minister, says: \u201cIt is deeply worrying that one month on from these issues, some TSB customers are still having difficulties. Labour echo the concerns of the FCA that communications have simply not been good enough. \u201cThere has plainly been a serious failure here, both in contingency preparations for a meltdown and in assuring an adequate level of customer communication.\u201d TSB\u2019s problems worsened last week when the bank sent letters of apology to the wrong customers. Some of the letters included other people\u2019s names, addresses and customer reference numbers. That means they could breach Britain\u2019s new data privacy laws, the General Data Protection Regulation. Andy Barratt, UK managing director of cyber security consultancy Coalfire, thinks TSB could be fined by the Information Commissioner for the breach. The ICO was also concerned that hundreds of TSB customers saw the wrong account details in the hours after April\u2019s migration. Barratt explains: \u201cThe apology letter glitch is the latest development in this ongoing TSB saga. MPs are clearly taking this issue seriously but, crucially, we\u2019re yet to see the ICO weigh in following its own investigations. The regulator will be particularly concerned that \u2018data breaches\u2019 of this magnitude have now happened more than once \u2013 both immediately before and then again after the implementation of GDPR. \u201cThe power to hand out major fines that GDPR affords the regulator means that the price of poor data protection is about to become far easier to quantify. TSB customers are still reporting problems accessing their accounts to the bank\u2019s social media unit, six weeks after the IT problems began. Many are saying they can\u2019t get through to TSB\u2019s telephone helplines.... Others report that they can\u2019t see their accounts online, or make certain payments. The Financial Conduct Authority appears to have put Paul Pester in a real spot, by accusing him of being too optimistic about the state of TSB\u2019s tech problems. If the Treasury committee feel Pester wasn\u2019t straight with them last month, they could put him under serious pressure. Pester has already given up one bonus - for completing the IT migration. Could his job be at risk? The Times\u2019s banking editor, Katherine Griffiths, suggests TSB may needed to be rebranded as Sabadell (the Spanish company which bought TSB in 2015). But Pester might not oversee such a change, if he finds himself \u201cup against the wall\u201d over his handling of the crisis, she adds. The BBC\u2019s Kevin Peachey agrees that the FCA\u2019s public criticism of a serving bank boss is pretty rare: MoneySavingExpert have put together a few questions for Paul Pester to answer at today\u2019s hearing: The number of customers that have been affected by the online and mobile banking problems and the number that are still facing problems. The number of customers that have lost money to fraudsters, whether TSB feels that after this event its account security processes are still sufficient, and the steps that are being taken to improve this. The number of customers that have switched away from the bank, and how many have reported problems - for example, being unable to switch or cancelled direct debits after switching. The minimum amount of money affected TSB customers can expect to be paid as compensation for their loss and inconvenience \u2013 this needs to be more specific than \u2018on a case-by-case basis\u2019. How will it let people proactively know what they are due? The number of complaints the bank has received from customers, the number that have now been resolved, and the average wait time these customers have experienced, both when ringing the phone lines and overall before their complaint is resolved. When TSB expects the IT problems to be fully fixed \u2013 if a date cannot be given, why not? The Treasury committee\u2019s first hearing into the TSB crisis, last month, was a very bruising experience. MPs lost patience with the bank as Paul Pester repeatedly argued that much of the IT migration had gone well (even if customers couldn\u2019t actually access their accounts). Nicky Morgan eventually let rip, telling Pester he was a \u201cstaggering example of a chief executive who seems unwilling to acknowledge the scale of the problem\u201d. Here\u2019s a clip from the May 2nd hearing: TSB is still suffering problems, more than six weeks after the ill-fated migration from its former owner Lloyds to its current owned Sabadell. The bank\u2019s service status page warns that some customers are still having issues logging into internet banking, or having difficulties making payments. Also, some Direct Debit payments weren\u2019t taken for TSB credit card customers this month. TSB also admits that some customers calling Telephone Banking are experiencing long wait times, and that its branches are busier than usual too. Nicky Morgan MP, the chair of the Treasury Committee, has piled more pressure on Paul Pester ahead of this afternoon\u2019s interrogation. Morgan says she is \u201cdeeply concerned by TSB\u2019s poor communications\u201d over its IT problems. Last week, the Financial Conduct Authority told the Committee it is \u2018dissatisfied\u2019 with TSB\u2019s communications with its customers. For example, FCA chief Andrew Bailey says that TSB claimed that \u201cthe vast majority\u201d of customers could access their online account, when in reality only 50% could successfully log in the first time they tried. That\u2019s one reason Bailey is accusing Pester of giving an \u201coptimistic\u201d view of the situation when he faced MPs last month, rather than a \u201cmore rounded view\u201d of the problems suffered by customers. Morgan says this isn\u2019t acceptable: \u201cThe regulator does not make such criticisms lightly. I am deeply concerned by TSB\u2019s poor communications about the scale and nature of the problems it has faced; by its response to customer fraud; and by the quality and accuracy of the oral and written evidence provided by Dr Pester to the Committee. \u201cThe Committee will discuss Mr Bailey\u2019s letter, and the ongoing problems faced by TSB customers, when it sees Dr Pester and other TSB Board members, as well as the FCA, on Wednesday.\u201d Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. The beleaguered boss of UK bank TSB is being hauled back to parliament today to face fresh questioning over the IT meltdown that left millions locked out of their accounts. Paul Pester is in the firing line over his handling of the crisis, and can expect plenty of criticism and tough questions from MPs on the Treasury Committee. Last month, the committee accused Pester of being \u2018extraordinary complacent\u2019 over the botched migration to a new technology platform, so today\u2019s session could intensify the pressure. TSB\u2019s IT crisis is one of the worst to have hit a bank ever - customers found they couldn\u2019t log on via their computer or mobile phones, small businesses were unable to pay staff, and some householders found their mortgages had disappeared. Cybercriminals have been taking advantage too, with reports that some TSB customers are falling victim to fraud. Overnight, the Financial Conduct Authority - the City\u2019s watchdog - has confirmed it is investigating the issue. Andrew Bailey, chief executive of the FCA, says: \u201cWe do not normally make this information public, but, given the level of public interest, I want to be clear that we will be conducting this work.\u201d The FCA has also put Pester in the firing line, accusing him of failing to come clean about TSB\u2019s problems. My colleague Angela Monaghan explains: The City regulator has launched a stinging attack on the chief executive of TSB over the bank\u2019s failure to be open and transparent with customers when an IT upgrade went badly wrong, locking as many as 1.9 million customers out of their accounts. The Financial Conduct Authority accused Paul Pester of \u201cportraying an optimistic view\u201d of services after the botched operation in April that is still causing disruption for customers more than a month on. \u201cThe FCA has been dissatisfied with TSB\u2019s communications with its customers and we have had concerns that TSB was not being open and transparent about the issues experienced,\u201d Andrew Bailey, the FCA\u2019s chief executive, said in a letter to the Commons Treasury committee. In particular, the FCA think that Pester could have given MPs more information about the crisis when he initially testified on May 2nd. They believe he may have had useful information from the tech experts at IBM who have been trying to fix the problems. The session kicks off at 2.30pm, when the Treasury committee will hear from the FCA. They\u2019ll then question Pester, along with TSB chairman Richard Meddings and Miguel Montes of parent company Sabadell Group. Also coming up today More European stock markets are rising in early trading, after America\u2019s tech-focused Nasdaq index hit a record high last night. Jasper Lawler of London Capital Group explains: Tech stock were once again responsible for any excitement on Wall Street. Netflix and Amazon jumping 1.9% and 1.1% respectively boosted the Nasdaq to close at a record high at 7637. This is the second straight session where tech stocks have been under the spotlight and we are seeing a lot of positive news surrounding the sector, Microsoft buying GitHub, Apple pushing new software and Amazon sales flying, when everything else in the market is looking a little drab.

In 1953, still owned by the Fraser family, the group extended its geographic reach across Scotland and into north-east England and Carlisle with the purchase of the Binns chain, which had its origins in an early 19th century Sunderland drapery business. Harrods, the luxury London department store, and Dickins &amp; Jones, became part of the House of Fraser group in the late 1950s.</p>\n    <p>Growth continued in the 1970s, with the addition of well-known names such as Rackhams, the Army &amp; Navy stores and Dingles.</p>\n    <p>Change came in 1985 when the House of Fraser group was bought by the Al Fayed family for \u00a3615m and a new business strategy was announced, with plans to replace smaller branches with larger stores.</p>\n    <p>In 1994 House of Fraser was floated on the London Stock Exchange at a market value of \u00a3484m, with Harrods split off and kept under private ownership by Al Fayed.</p>\n    <p>A takeover bid from Scottish retail entrepreneur Tom Hunter was rejected in 2003 and some branches in Scotland were sold or closed.</p>\n    <p>However, two years later the group was in expansion mode again, buying 16 stores under the Jenners and Beatties brands became part of the group in 2005. Large new store openings followed in 2008 at locations including Belfast, Bristol and the Westfield shopping centre in west London.</p>\n    <p>In 2013, House of Fraser opened its first store overseas, in Abu Dhabi\u2019s World Trade Center shopping mall.<br></p>\n    <p>House of Fraser was bought by China\u2019s Nanjing Xinjiekou Department Store Co \u2013 also known as Nanjing Cenbest \u2013 in 2014. <b>Angela Monaghan</b></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Alex Williamson, House of Fraser\u2019s chief executive, said that without the proposed store closures the business was likely to collapse.</p> \n<p>\u201cA decision to close this number of stores is not done lightly.

House of Fraser unveiled a plan designed to stave off collapse which will mean the closure of 31 of its 59 department stores including its Oxford Street flagship in London and its shops in cities including Birmingham, Cardiff and Edinburgh. As many as 6,000 jobs could be lost - 2,000 direct HoF employees and 4,000 who work for in-store concessions. The move by the 169-year-old company is part of a rescue plan that will also lead to House of Fraser moving out of its head offices in London and Glasgow and closing a distribution centre in Milton Keynes where more than 400 more jobs are under threat. Up to 5,000 more jobs are at risk at the 355-store Poundworld chain which on Thursday gave notice that it intends to appoint administrators.

The two chains\u2019 difficulties come after a string of retailers and restaurant groups, including Mothercare, Carpetright, New Look, Prezzo and Jamie\u2019s Italian, have announced plans to close hundreds of outlets putting more than 35,000 jobs on the block so far this year. DIY chain Homebase is also expected to close about 60 stores after a \u00a31 rescue takeover by restructuring specialist Hilco which will be completed this month. Alex Williamson, House of Fraser\u2019s chief executive, said that without the proposed store closures the business was likely to collapse. \u201cA decision to close this number of stores is not done lightly.

The restructuring and closures are a condition of a deal that will give control of House of Fraser to the Chinese C.banner business, which also owns Hamleys. C.banner is buying a 51% stake in the parent company of the ailing department store group for \u00a3140m, leaving the current owner, Nanjing Cenbest, part of China\u2019s Sanpower conglomerate, with a minority stake. It is feared House of Fraser could struggle to complete the CVA, as landlords and lenders have expressed concerns about a lack of consultation and fears that C.banner will not be able to inject sufficient cash into the business to turn it around. Williamson said management had been forced to take brave decisions, including closing some of its most high-profile stores, to try to ensure the business had a future. \u201cThere are too many case studies of CVAs that have not worked, and this is not going to be one of them,\u201d he said. C.banner has committed to putting \u00a370m into House of Fraser after the restructure which Williamson said would help turn it around. The company has also put another \u00a31m into its pension fund after discussions with trustees, who expressed concerns about protection for savers in the restructure. On Thursday, landlords called for an urgent government review of the rising use of CVAs, which they say risks undermining the UK\u2019s reputation and deters investment in town centres. The British Property Federation said it believed the process was being misused. Melanie Leech, the chief executive of the landlords\u2019 group, said: \u201cThe CVA process is intended to be part of a comprehensive business recovery plan. \u201cProperty owners, looking after savers\u2019 and pensioners\u2019 money, will support businesses who demonstrate this commitment, but must protect those pensioners against unfair action that penalises their interests.\u201d",

The broader reaction to our recent results announcement has, though, demonstrated to Gavin and me that there is a need for a change of leadership to deliver this strategy.\u201d</p> <p>The announcement comes after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/jun/04/bt-chief-executive-gavin-patterson-faces-shareholder-backlash\">a backlash from shareholders</a> over BT\u2019s recent results and concerns that Patterson was not the right person to lead the company through an ambitious restructuring plan.</p> <p>Investors welcomed the news, with BT shares initially rising 2.5% to 208p. When Patterson was appointed chief executive in September 2013, the shares were trading at about 340p, before hitting a high of almost 500p in early 2016.</p> <p>Neil Wilson, the chief analyst at markets.com, said investors had \u201cfinally lost patience and driven him out\u201d.</p> <p>He added: \u201cThere\u2019s been more wrong than right for BT since he took over five year ago. It\u2019s been a disappointing time for BT and for its shareholders.\u201d</p> <p>The restructuring strategy includes 13,000 job cuts and a move out of BT\u2019s central London headquarters after almost 150 years as it attempts to slash costs amid growing competition and falling revenues. BT missed profit and revenue targets in the year to the end of March, sending shares in the company to a six-year low.<br></p> <p>Days after the news of the job cuts, BT revealed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2018/may/24/bt-paid-chief-23m-shortly-after-revealing-13000-job-cuts\">Patterson was paid about \u00a32.3m last year</a>, including a \u00a31.3m bonus on top of his basic salary of \u00a3997,000.</p> <p>At the time of the strategy update last month, Du Plessis publicly endorsed Patterson as the person to steer the company through the changes but the position changed after the BT chair held a series of conversations with shareholders.<br></p> <p>Patterson said he was disappointed the market had not responded as positively as he would have liked to the planned changes. He said he felt the broad message from investors was \u201cwe like the strategy, it\u2019s going to take a while to see the benefits, come back to us when you\u2019ve got results\u201d.</p> <p>Patterson, who has been at BT for more than 14 years, will remain CEO until a replacement is found.</p> <p>Reflecting on his time in the role, Patterson said: \u201cI\u2019m not somebody who has regrets \u2013 I try to look forward. There hasn\u2019t been any falling out. I\u2019m an adult, I\u2019ve seen this movie before.\u201d</p> <p>Patterson will continue to be paid his usual monthly salary until his successor is appointed, after which point he will be entitled to up to 12 monthly payments covering his basic salary, benefits and bonus. </p> <p>Based on current projections, that means he could walk away with about \u00a32.3m, in line with his salary and bonus last year.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Guardian business email sign-up\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/3887\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for\u00a0Business\u00a0Today\" data-form-description=\"Get the headlines and editors' picks every weekday morning.\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk</figcaption> </figure>  <p>Under Patterson\u2019s leadership, the business has transformed and become more complex, with a big push into sports broadcasting through BT Sport and the \u00a312.5bn purchase of EE, the British mobile phone network, which got the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jan/15/bt-ee-takeover-green-light-cma\">final go-ahead</a> in January 2016 and which Patterson said was one of the highlights of his stint.<br></p> <p>But he has led the FTSE 100 firm through a troubled 18 months, including <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/jan/24/bt-loses-7bn-in-value-as-italian-accounting-scandal-deepens\">an accounting scandal in Italy</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/mar/27/bt-fined-42m-over-delays-to-high-speed-cable-installation\">a record \u00a342m fine from Ofcom</a>.</p> <p>George Salmon, an equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said the first half of Patterson\u2019s tenure as chief executive had been positive, with the rise of BT Sport bringing some good times for investors.</p> <p>\u201cHowever, it\u2019s been a different story over the last two years. Since 2016, BT\u2019s share price graph resembles something of a black run: pretty much always on a downward trend and with a few nasty cliffs here and there. </p> <p>\u201cUltimately, this is what\u2019s behind the change. Shareholder confidence has followed the share price down and with BT embarking on a crucial restructure, the board has decided it\u2019s time for a change.\u201d</p> <p> </p> <h2><strong>Five issues for BT under Patterson\u2019s tenure</strong></h2> <h2><strong>1. Italian accounting scandal</strong></h2> <p>Almost \u00a38bn was wiped of BT\u2019s stock market value after it admitted <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/jan/24/bt-loses-7bn-in-value-as-italian-accounting-scandal-deepens\">an accounting scandal at its Italian division</a> was much worse than originally thought. The company said \u201cinappropriate management behaviour\u201d and \u201cimproper accounting practices\u201d in Italy would cost BT \u00a3530m.<br></p> <h2><strong>2. Openreach deal took too long</strong></h2> <p> BT spent two years at loggerheads with the communications regulator over Openreach, which controls the UK\u2019s broadband network. Ofcom wanted to strengthen the independence of Openreach and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/mar/10/bt-ofcom-openreach-telecoms-broadband\">BT ultimately agreed a deal</a> to legally separate the business. But it was a lengthy battle, and Patterson admitted on Friday he wished he had concluded negotiations a lot sooner.</p> <h2><strong>3.

                "bodyText":"The BT chief executive, Gavin Patterson, is to leave the telecoms giant this year after investors made it clear they had lost confidence in his ability to lead the company through an ambitious turnaround plan. In a surprise move, the company said it had started the process of looking for his successor and expected to appoint a new chief executive in the second half of the year. Jan du Plessis, the chair of BT, thanked Patterson for his contribution over the past 14 years but said the company needed a change in leadership, despite having publicly backed him a month ago. Du Plessis said on Friday: \u201cThe board is fully supportive of the strategy recently set out by Gavin and his team. The broader reaction to our recent results announcement has, though, demonstrated to Gavin and me that there is a need for a change of leadership to deliver this strategy.\u201d The announcement comes after a backlash from shareholders over BT\u2019s recent results and concerns that Patterson was not the right person to lead the company through an ambitious restructuring plan. Investors welcomed the news, with BT shares initially rising 2.5% to 208p. When Patterson was appointed chief executive in September 2013, the shares were trading at about 340p, before hitting a high of almost 500p in early 2016. Neil Wilson, the chief analyst at markets.com, said investors had \u201cfinally lost patience and driven him out\u201d. He added: \u201cThere\u2019s been more wrong than right for BT since he took over five year ago. It\u2019s been a disappointing time for BT and for its shareholders.\u201d The restructuring strategy includes 13,000 job cuts and a move out of BT\u2019s central London headquarters after almost 150 years as it attempts to slash costs amid growing competition and falling revenues. BT missed profit and revenue targets in the year to the end of March, sending shares in the company to a six-year low. Days after the news of the job cuts, BT revealed Patterson was paid about \u00a32.3m last year, including a \u00a31.3m bonus on top of his basic salary of \u00a3997,000. At the time of the strategy update last month, Du Plessis publicly endorsed Patterson as the person to steer the company through the changes but the position changed after the BT chair held a series of conversations with shareholders. Patterson said he was disappointed the market had not responded as positively as he would have liked to the planned changes. He said he felt the broad message from investors was \u201cwe like the strategy, it\u2019s going to take a while to see the benefits, come back to us when you\u2019ve got results\u201d. Patterson, who has been at BT for more than 14 years, will remain CEO until a replacement is found. Reflecting on his time in the role, Patterson said: \u201cI\u2019m not somebody who has regrets \u2013 I try to look forward. There hasn\u2019t been any falling out. I\u2019m an adult, I\u2019ve seen this movie before.\u201d Patterson will continue to be paid his usual monthly salary until his successor is appointed, after which point he will be entitled to up to 12 monthly payments covering his basic salary, benefits and bonus. Based on current projections, that means he could walk away with about \u00a32.3m, in line with his salary and bonus last year. Under Patterson\u2019s leadership, the business has transformed and become more complex, with a big push into sports broadcasting through BT Sport and the \u00a312.5bn purchase of EE, the British mobile phone network, which got the final go-ahead in January 2016 and which Patterson said was one of the highlights of his stint. But he has led the FTSE 100 firm through a troubled 18 months, including an accounting scandal in Italy and a record \u00a342m fine from Ofcom. George Salmon, an equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said the first half of Patterson\u2019s tenure as chief executive had been positive, with the rise of BT Sport bringing some good times for investors. \u201cHowever, it\u2019s been a different story over the last two years. Since 2016, BT\u2019s share price graph resembles something of a black run: pretty much always on a downward trend and with a few nasty cliffs here and there. \u201cUltimately, this is what\u2019s behind the change. Shareholder confidence has followed the share price down and with BT embarking on a crucial restructure, the board has decided it\u2019s time for a change.\u201d Five issues for BT under Patterson\u2019s tenure 1. Italian accounting scandal Almost \u00a38bn was wiped of BT\u2019s stock market value after it admitted an accounting scandal at its Italian division was much worse than originally thought. The company said \u201cinappropriate management behaviour\u201d and \u201cimproper accounting practices\u201d in Italy would cost BT \u00a3530m. 2. Openreach deal took too long BT spent two years at loggerheads with the communications regulator over Openreach, which controls the UK\u2019s broadband network. Ofcom wanted to strengthen the independence of Openreach and BT ultimately agreed a deal to legally separate the business. But it was a lengthy battle, and Patterson admitted on Friday he wished he had concluded negotiations a lot sooner. 3. Falling revenues and complexity BT reported a 1% fall in revenue to \u00a323bn for the year to 31 March 2018 and warned that it was expecting a similar performance in the year ahead. BT became a more complex business under Patterson, increasingly diverse and with multiple offices in some cities, and the outgoing chief executive has admitted it needs to modernise. 4. Record fine for BT BT was fined \u00a342m \u2013 the largest penalty imposed by Ofcom on a telecoms company \u2013 for a \u201cserious breach\u201d of rules. The regulator found that BT broke regulations put in place to stop Openreach abusing its \u201csignificant market power\u201d by cutting compensation payments to rivals and blaming installation delays on factors beyond its control when this was not the case. BT also said it would pay \u00a3300m in compensation to rivals including Sky, Vodafone and TalkTalk. 5. A costly move into sports broadcasting BT Sport transformed the telecoms company into a major sports broadcaster. But the question remains whether it was the right move to diversify into a sector in which Sky, Netflix and Amazon are its rivals. Deep pockets are required to pay for the rising cost of sports rights, and analysts have warned that sports-TV packages are the kind of thing that struggling households get rid of first.",

                "bodyText":"Debenhams is considering selling its assets, including a chain of Danish shops, to shore up its finances after brutal trading conditions triggered a third profit warning in six months. The department store group\u2019s chief executive, Sergio Bucher, blamed falling numbers of shoppers and heavy discounting elsewhere on the high street for the fresh collapse in profits. \u201cThese are exceptionally difficult times in UK retail and our trading performance reflects that,\u201d he said. \u201cWe don\u2019t see these conditions changing in the near future.\u201d Debenhams now expects annual profits to be between \u00a335m and \u00a340m, well below City forecasts of \u00a350.3m. That compares with more than \u00a3150m five years ago. Debenhams\u2019 first profit-warning came in January after a disappointing Christmas, and Bucher said trading in May and early June had also fallen short of expectations as women cut back on clothes and make-up. Debenhams shares closed down nearly 11% at 17.50p. They have lost half their value since the start of the year, when they were changing hands at 35p. The retailer has already embarked on a \u00a320m cost-cutting drive but has now upped the ante to other areas. It will spend no more than \u00a390m on capital expenditure in 2019, down sharply from this year\u2019s \u00a3140m. It is also considering selling off assets, including the profitable Danish department store chain Magasin du Nord and printing firm Magenta, to bolster its finances. There was also evidence that shoppers in their teens and 20s were having to be more circumspect with their cash. Shares in Aim-listed sportswear chain Footasylum slumped, closing down more than 52% at 80p after it said trading had suffered as a result of weak consumer confidence. The latest knocks to high street confidence come after House of Fraser announced it was shutting more than half its UK stores, including its flagship on London\u2019s Oxford Street, putting 11,000 jobs at risk. It is one of a string of retailers that are using a company voluntary arrangement, a form of insolvency, to close outlets. Others, such as Toys R Us and Maplin, have collapsed into administration in recent months, hurt by weak consumer spending and a shift towards online shopping. Bucher said Debenhams, which in April reported an 85% fall in first-half profits to \u00a313.5m, was seeking to negotiate rent reductions with landlords on 25 stores that are up for lease renewal in the next five years. He reiterated plans to close up to 10 loss-making stores and to cut the size of 30 outlets, by handing over space to restaurants and other food businesses. The chain has 241 stores, 165 of them in the UK. Bucher highlighted the tough trading conditions, with some rivals offering discounting for 10 out of the past 15 weeks, while some fashion chains were offering 50%-60% price cuts. Debenhams has also cut prices, but to a lesser extent. Like-for-like sales fell 1.7% in the 15 weeks to 16 June, while digital sales rose 16%. Clothing sales have struggled while beauty declined due to lower make-up sales, though skincare did better. Bucher, a former Amazon executive who took the reins at Debenhams two years ago, vowed to push cost savings further and to focus on its online business. The group has modernised some stores and hopes designer collaborations will help turn sales around, such as Preen \u2013 a brand worn by the Duchess of Cambridge \u2013 and Richard Quinn. On Friday, House of Fraser\u2019s landlords will vote on a plan that could result in the closure of 31 of its 59 department stores, including its Oxford Street flagship and major city stores such as Birmingham, Cardiff and Edinburgh. The two chains overlap in 18 locations with Debenhams expected to benefit from the retreat of a competitor.",

                "bodyText":"The grocery industry watchdog is hoping to win new powers to oversee Amazon and Boots after receiving numerous complaints about their treatment of suppliers. Christine Tacon, the Grocery Code Adjudicator (GCA), already oversees 10 retailers including the big four supermarkets \u2013 Tesco, Sainsbury\u2019s, Asda and Morrisons \u2013 and has the power to issue multi-million pound fines if suppliers are treated poorly. The competition watchdog is currently assessing a group of up to four additional retailers that could come under Tacon\u2019s remit from August, if it finds their grocery sales amount to \u00a31bn or more. Amazon\u2019s shift into groceries, after buying Wholefoods Market and teaming up with Morrisons for its Amazon Fresh food home deliveries, is thought to have potentially put it within the GCA\u2019s sights, while Boots\u2019s sale of sandwiches and drinks as well as shampoo, toothpaste and suncream, may also put the health and beauty chain in the frame. Tacon said she was particularly keen to include those retailers that were treating suppliers poorly while competing directly with the 10 companies she currently oversees. She said Boots and Amazon were two of the chains mentioned by suppliers. Complaints relating to Amazon had been about not paying in full. Complaints relating to Boots had been about retrospective payments and variation to agreements. After this article was published, Boots said that there was nothing untoward in such practices, which were standard in the industry. \u201cPayments are always agreed in advance with suppliers and are used for promotional activity to the benefit of consumers,\u201d the company said in a letter to the Guardian. Tacon said she could not be certain the two retailers will come under her remit as there was \u201cno cast-iron definition\u201d of groceries, and it was difficult to assess the amount of relevant goods they sold. She said retailers might argue that products such as toothpaste, for example, should not be included, which might take their overall grocery turnover below the \u00a31bn cut-off point. The potential extension of GCA\u2019s powers comes as Tacon named Asda as the worst of the UK\u2019s big four supermarkets in its treatment of suppliers for the second year in a row. The Walmart-owned chain did better than the Co-op, which is currently under investigation by the watchdog, and Iceland, which once again hit the bottom of the pile, but sits well behind its major rivals, according to CGA\u2019s survey of 1,000 suppliers. About 7% of Asda\u2019s suppliers said it rarely stuck to the legally binding industry code which covers trade terms and 1% said it never did so. That compares to just 3% of Tesco suppliers who say it rarely sticks to the code while none said it never complied. Still, Tacon said Asda had shown improvement in the past year. \u201cI am delighted to report significant improvements across all regulated retailers,\u201d she added. In one measure of her powers, Tesco, which faced a major investigation by the GCA in 2015, has overtaken Sainsbury\u2019s and Waitrose to become the major supermarket best rated by suppliers, although it still sits behind Aldi, which has come top of the annual survey. Tacon said she hoped Asda\u2019s dealings with food producers and grocery manufacturers would improve if its planned merger with Sainsbury\u2019s went ahead, because the latter had better systems in place for dealing with suppliers and had consistently scored better in the annual survey. Nevertheless, she warned that she could not prevent suppliers being squeezed by a new bigger retailer after the merger as she did not have the power to intervene when suppliers were agreeing prices with retailers. \u201cIf a company is prepared to supply something at a lower price who am I to interfere? We end up with better prices for consumers,\u201d she said. Tacon said she was open to the idea of her remit being extended in some way but warned \u201cI\u2019m not the industry fairy godmother\u201d highlighting she had only been able to improve practices at the supermarkets because her role was clearly defined and backed by strong powers.

Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at IG, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Equities are reaching for the stars once again, with healthy gains across the board. Many market watchers will remember when it was the Fed that was scared into policy changes by financial market volatility. Now the financial markets appear to be doing the same to the US president. Trade war concerns remain high on the agenda, but the White House\u2019s comments on using existing legislation rather than new rules has helped boost risk appetite.</p> <p>Having tied himself so closely to the stock market early on in his presidency, Mr Trump will be wary of anything that prompts a sustained rout in equities. Of course, he may decide that the political advantages of talking tough on trade outweigh those arising from a buoyant stock market. But for now investors will be pleased that a softer tone is being adopted.</p> <p>Also helping equity markets this afternoon is oil, which has enjoyed a stellar week. OPEC\u2019s move to raise production did not dispel concerns about a supply shortage, and those concerns have only increased thanks to US jawboning on Iranian exports, a Canadian shutdown and now a fresh drop in US crude stockpiles. So long as OPEC keeps a lid on production increases, we can expect further bullish momentum in oil. </p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5b33a33de4b0bef28bb9b17b\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-06-27T14:49:52.972Z\">3.49pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Back with John Lewis Partnership, and analyst Greg Lawless at Shore Capital was positive about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2018/jun/27/uk-house-price-growth-falls-bank-of-england-financial-stability-business-live?page=with:block-5b335358e4b02f6ecf5e89e3#block-5b335358e4b02f6ecf5e89e3\">the moves the business has outlined</a> to deal with a tricky retail environment:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>This looks a sensible path for JLP to navigate given the structural shifts across the current retail landscape. The group is playing to its own core strengths with an increased focus on differentiation, innovation and enhanced service. The work in recent years from a balance sheet perspective (slowed the investment in physical space growth, reduced the discretionary pension increases and reduced partnership bonuses) has put it in a stronger position. The stronger balance sheet allows a commitment to continue to invest \u00a3400- \u00a3500m per annum over the next three years. The group is targeting a net debt to EBITDA of 3.0x ratio over the next five years, suggesting capital discipline over the medium-term. </p> <p>JLP is now being more realistic in recognising that group profits need to be rebased as it faces into its challenges and charts its own path.

The strategic move to close a few Waitrose stores is part of a wider plan to innovate rather than expand.</p> <p>\u201cWith numerous high street retailers going into administration since Christmas, this news will surely have the John Lewis board members in crisis talks.</p> </blockquote> <p>Lane believes that Waitrose are losing out to cheaper rivals, as consumers cut back.</p> <p>John Lewis\u2019s department stores face an even bigger nemesis - the internet.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>With lack of wage growth and rising living costs it\u2019s become evident that shoppers are tightening their purse strings and saving where they can. Cheaper supermarkets like Aldi and Lidl are growing in popularity which leaves Waitrose out in the cold. John Lewis on the other hand are battling an even bigger battle - the online retail market. With the recent news House of Fraser are having to shut a large number of their stores, the worry is that John Lewis may end the same way. The partnership has its work cut out to recover from this.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5b335552e4b0bef28bb9ad7f\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-06-27T09:26:59.693Z\">10.26am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The boss of John Lewis Partnership, Paula Nickolds, is briefing reporters about the challenging retail world:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/huttleyjourno/status/1011898670017667073\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">John Lewis managing director Paula Nickolds says of high street: &#39;moderate is dead, good is no longer good enough&#39;</p>&mdash; Hannah Uttley (@huttleyjourno) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/huttleyjourno/status/1011898670017667073?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">June 27, 2018</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>Waitrose chief Rob Collins is also there:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/whatbutlersaw/status/1011898425703624704\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Waitrose boss Rob Collins says he expects online sakes to double over next five years</p>&mdash; Sarah Butler (@whatbutlersaw) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/whatbutlersaw/status/1011898425703624704?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">June 27, 2018</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/Ben_Woods01/status/1011897891579924480\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Rob Collins of Waitrose says the grocer is &quot;all about delicious health&quot;.</p>&mdash; Ben Woods (@Ben_Woods01) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Ben_Woods01/status/1011897891579924480?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">June 27, 2018</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5b335701e4b0bef28bb9ad95\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-06-27T09:22:59.484Z\">10.22am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The company is also rebranding, to emphasise <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2018/jun/27/uk-house-price-growth-falls-bank-of-england-financial-stability-business-live?page=with:block-5b335240e4b0973193b2fc30#block-5b335240e4b0973193b2fc30\">the partnership element of its business</a>:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/DeirdreHipwell/status/1011902108310925313\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">John Lewis and waitrose to be rebranded as follows...to demonstrate the contribution of its partners. <a href=\"https://t.co/bPjGWhSEku\">pic.twitter.com/bPjGWhSEku</a></p>&mdash; Deirdre Hipwell (@DeirdreHipwell) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DeirdreHipwell/status/1011902108310925313?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">June 27, 2018</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/paulsandle/status/1011898862397739009\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Big branding change coming at John Lewis - will be John Lewis &amp; Partners and Waitrose &amp; Partners from Sept</p>&mdash; Paul Sandle (@paulsandle) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/paulsandle/status/1011898862397739009?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">June 27, 2018</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5b335358e4b02f6ecf5e89e3\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-06-27T09:13:04.542Z\">10.13am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">The official statement</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>The John Lewis Partnership has now issued a statement, confirming that profits are taking a tumble this year and that several Waitrose stores are being shuttered.</strong></p> <p>The news comes in a strategic update, outlining its plans for its department stores and supermarkets. This includes \u00a3500m of fresh investment over the next few years.</p> <p>Here are some highlights (I\u2019ve bolded up the key points):</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It is widely acknowledged that the retail sector is going through <strong>a period of generational change</strong> and every retailer\u2019s response will be different. For the Partnership, the focus is on greater differentiation \u2013 not scale. We have clear plans to build on our strengths and to sharpen our points of difference in both Waitrose and John Lewis.</p> <p>These plans include <strong>further investment</strong> in and development of unique products and service, together with a greater emphasis on own brand and innovation.</p> </blockquote> <p>On current earnings:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We expect the Partnership\u2019s half year profits before exceptional items \u2013 which are always much lower and more volatile than the second half \u2013 to be <strong>close to zero</strong> this year. For the full year there are a wide range of possible outcomes, given the market uncertainty, but we are currently assuming that <strong>profits before exceptional items will be substantially lower than last year</strong>.</p> <p>The Partnership currently expects to see profit growth in Waitrose, a decline in John Lewis and significant extra costs at the Partnership level as a result of<strong> greater IT investment</strong>, which will be a big driver behind the overall profit change.</p> <p>Today the Partnership has announced that it will take steps to <strong>strengthen its balance sheet by a further \u00a3500m</strong> over three years to invest in product and service innovation. This will be achieved by rebuilding profitability at Waitrose, creating more value from the property estate, and conducting a review of the Partnership\u2019s pension scheme.</p> </blockquote> <p>And here\u2019s confirmation that five Waitrose stores will close:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Unlike many of its competitors, the John Lewis Partnership has a well balanced and well located store portfolio, with 353 Waitrose shops and 50 John Lewis. As we develop our plans to prioritise differentiation we will continue to make adjustments to our overall estate, including exit or closures, but at a rate that\u2019s in line with what we have seen over the last few years. <strong>To this end, Waitrose today announced the disposal of four convenience shops and one small supermarket</strong>.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5b335240e4b0973193b2fc30\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-06-27T09:04:34.028Z\">10.04am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Today\u2019s announcement is clearly bad news for John Lewis\u2019s 85,000 staff, who effectively own the Partnership.</strong></p> <p>Each employee is a partner, who receives a percentage of their annual salary in a profit-related bonus each year.</p> <p>In 2017-18 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/mar/08/john-lewis-cuts-staff-bonuses-as-profits-dive-77-percent-weaker-pound-waitrose\">the partners only got a 5% bonus</a>, the lowest in over 60 years, after profits slumped by 77%.

                "bodyText":"Global stock markets have been pushed around by the trade tensions between the US and, notably, China, and signs of a softer tone from the Trump administration has given them a lift today. David Madden, market analyst at CMC Markets, said: Equity markets are higher now that it seems the US is taking a more relaxed position regarding investment from China. The Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) will access international investment in the US. Traders are viewing this less aggressive way to monitor overseas investment in the US as a boost for international relations. Traders welcomed the initiative as the government now appears to have a body that will deal with the issue, and it should lead to less confusion about which investment is allowed and which isn\u2019t. Recently, different members of the Trump administration seemed to be on different wavelengths from one another, and that added to the uncertain economic environment. Dealers are now happy to enter the market and pick up relatively cheap equities. The trade dispute is still ongoing, so investors\u2019 optimistic mood may not last too long. Rising oil prices have also helped push shares higher, particularly in the commodity sector. The final scores in Europe showed: The FTSE 100 finished 83.77 points or 1.11% higher at 7621.69 Germany\u2019s Dax added 0.93% to 12,348.61 France\u2019s Cac closed up 0.87% at 5327.20 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB rose 0.65% to 21,557.91 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended 0.22% higher at 9658.6 On Wall Street the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently Elsewhere John Lewis Partnership warned this year\u2019s profits would be well below last year\u2019s figures, and said it was getting rid of five Waitrose stores. Our full story is here: On that note, it\u2019s time to close for the day. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. Over in the US, and President Trump is back tweeting about Harley-Davidson (which said it would move some production out of the US due to his tariff plans) and not, perhaps surprisingly, about China (there is still plenty of time for that, of course). Markets continue to recover after the signs that the Trump administration may be taking a more conciliatory tone with China. Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at IG, said: Equities are reaching for the stars once again, with healthy gains across the board. Many market watchers will remember when it was the Fed that was scared into policy changes by financial market volatility. Now the financial markets appear to be doing the same to the US president. Trade war concerns remain high on the agenda, but the White House\u2019s comments on using existing legislation rather than new rules has helped boost risk appetite. Having tied himself so closely to the stock market early on in his presidency, Mr Trump will be wary of anything that prompts a sustained rout in equities. Of course, he may decide that the political advantages of talking tough on trade outweigh those arising from a buoyant stock market. But for now investors will be pleased that a softer tone is being adopted. Also helping equity markets this afternoon is oil, which has enjoyed a stellar week. OPEC\u2019s move to raise production did not dispel concerns about a supply shortage, and those concerns have only increased thanks to US jawboning on Iranian exports, a Canadian shutdown and now a fresh drop in US crude stockpiles. So long as OPEC keeps a lid on production increases, we can expect further bullish momentum in oil. Back with John Lewis Partnership, and analyst Greg Lawless at Shore Capital was positive about the moves the business has outlined to deal with a tricky retail environment: This looks a sensible path for JLP to navigate given the structural shifts across the current retail landscape. The group is playing to its own core strengths with an increased focus on differentiation, innovation and enhanced service. The work in recent years from a balance sheet perspective (slowed the investment in physical space growth, reduced the discretionary pension increases and reduced partnership bonuses) has put it in a stronger position. The stronger balance sheet allows a commitment to continue to invest \u00a3400- \u00a3500m per annum over the next three years. The group is targeting a net debt to EBITDA of 3.0x ratio over the next five years, suggesting capital discipline over the medium-term. JLP is now being more realistic in recognising that group profits need to be rebased as it faces into its challenges and charts its own path. The expectation is that there will be no let-up in the headwinds and it is right that the group is being more realistic in its appraisal of the sector. Perhaps other retailers might also want to consider the wider sector implications of JLP acknowledging the current retail environment. Crude prices have been rising in recent days, giving a boost to commodity stocks and markets such as the FTSE 100 where mining and oil companies are well represented. Despite Opec agreeing to increase production, the price was supported on Tuesday by Donald Trump calling for buyers to cut their purchases from Iran, Opec\u2019s third largest producer. Now a bigger than expected drop in US crude stocks has suggested growing demand, and pushed prices higher. Crude stocks dropped by 9.89m barrels last week, compared to expectations of a 2.6m decline. Gasoline stocks grew by 1.16m but this was less than the forecast 1.3m increase. Brent crude is now up 2% at $77.82 a barrel, while West Texas Intermediate - the US benchmark - has added 2.7% to $72.5. US treasury secretary Steve Mnuchin is predicting strong growth for the country\u2019s economy in the second quarter. He told CNBC he was expecting a \u201cbig number\u201d . And although he made it clear he had no advance sight of the figures, the comments have helped push Wall Street even higher. Signs that the Trump administration may been trying to ease tensions with China have given US markets a lift at the open. As reported earlier the US is moving away from a blanket ban on Chinese firms investing in US businesses, and instead is talking about using a strengthened security review process to deal with the issue. The news has helped push the Dow Jones Industrial Average up 108 points or 0.46%, while the S&amp;P 500 opened 0.2% higher and the Nasdaq Composite 0.33% better. There are also some new US figures showing an improvement in the goods trade balance to -$64.85bn in May, down $2.5bn. Exports for May were up $2.9bn to $143.6bn, while imports edged up $0.4bn to $208.4bn. Still with the US, and new orders for capital goods fell unexpectedly in May, although April\u2019s figure was revised sharply higher. The commerce department said that orders for non-defence goods excluding aircraft slipped by 0.2% compared to forecasts of a 0.5% increase. But the April figure is now reported as a 2.3% rise, much better than the original estimate of a 1% gain. Analysts trying to work out how this might affect US interest rate policy might have a difficult time, says David Morrison, senior market strategist at GKFX: Over the past few years investors have got used to equities rallying on the back of data releases, irrespective of the numbers surprising to the upside or downside. Strong data has reinforced the view that the US economy is powering ahead, at least when compared to other developed countries. But at the same time, disappointing numbers have led to the belief that the US Federal Reserve would decelerate monetary tightening. After all, that\u2019s what we\u2019ve seen repeatedly from both Janet Yellen and her predecessor as Fed Chair, Ben Bernanke. However, there\u2019s a growing perception that the current chair, Jerome Powell, is doing things differently and that under his lead the Fed is prepared to tighten unless there\u2019s a significant market disruption. Consequently, data disappointments are unlikely to receive the positive reaction that they once did. This shift in sentiment is something to be aware of as we approach the second half of this year. Newsflash: Donald Trump may have backed away from escalating the trade dispute between America and China. US officials have revealed that the Trump administration is moving away from plans for a blanket ban on Chinese firms buying stakes in US companies. Instead, the US government is pushing Congress to strengthen a panel called the Committee on Foreign Investment (CFIUS), to protect US intellectual property rights. That\u2019s a less confrontational approach, which will calm fears that the row between Washington and Beijing was escalating ever higher. Earlier this week, there were reports that the US would use national emergency laws to prevent Chinese companies from investing in the US - and possibly other countries too. But now, the White House seems to have backed away from such an inflammatory step. One official told CNBC that: \u201cWe considered a number of different mechanisms for addressing the concerns articulated regarding the acquisitions of sensitive technologies that may threaten U.S. national security, national interests. In the end the president and his advisers settled on the idea that we have a strong and effective mechanism through the CFIUS process ... and that is a mechanism that can be used in the flexible and aggressive way to combat the practices that are troubling to the president.\u201d Investors have welcomed the news, sending shares higher. In London the FTSE 100 index is now up 55 points, or 0.7%, and Wall Street futures are recovering too. Back in London, the governor of the Bank of England has defended the huge cost of flying policymakers around the globe. Mark Carney was questioned about the revelation that two members of the Financial Policy Committee spent \u00a3390,000 on flights between them in the last couple of years. In response, Carney told reporters that it was absolutely right to question the Bank\u2019s expenses - before explaining that its officials are jet-setting around the world to attend important international meetings. Carney says he personally went on 52 trips in the last year, at a cost of \u00a3312,000. Some of that cost is covered by Carney\u2019s other jobs (he also chairs committees for the Bank of International Settlements), getting the average price down to \u00a33,000. As Carney says: That\u2019s still a lot of money, but it\u2019s a consequence of having to go to these various meetings. The governor points out, a little defensively, that he was slaving away last weekend while luckier souls were watching England overcome Panama, sunbathing, or wrestling with a barbeque. As Carney puts it: I spent what was a glorious weekend here, I hear, in Basel, chairing a group of global governors dealing with issues around Brexit, emerging market risks, the future of financial reforms... And I was very pleased to be able to get back on Sunday night so I could come into work on Monday morning. If you\u2019re just tuning in, here\u2019s our news story on John Lewis: The John Lewis Partnership has said it will make no profit in the first six months of this year and is to close five Waitrose stores as tough trading on the high street takes its toll. The group said its full-year profits, to be announced next March, will also be substantially lower than last year. It operates 50 John Lewis outlets and 350 Waitrose shops. JLP blamed market uncertainty and cited significant extra costs as a result of greater IT investment, which would be the main cause of the profit decline. Waitrose will shut four convenience shops and one small supermarket, affecting aabout 200 staff. The four convenience stores are being sold to the Co-Op. Sir Charlie Mayfield, the JLP chair, said: \u201cIt is very important that we feel the jeopardy of what is happening right now. This isn\u2019t a blip, it is a major shift and it has a while to run.\u201d Waitrose is expected to see profit growth, but that will be offset by a decline at John Lewis. The group said: \u201cIt is widely acknowledged that the retail sector is going through a period of generational change and every retailer\u2019s response will be different. For the partnership, the focus is on greater differentiation, not scale.\u201d... More here: Newsflash: The Waitrose store on Camden high street will become an Aldi. The discount chain has exchanged contracts to acquire the Camden store - one of the five being shut by John Lewis. It intends to reopen the site in Spring 2019. While Waitrose is firmly upmarket (although it does run a popular Essentials range too), Aldi has grown its market share strongly by focusing more on price. Graham Hetherington, Aldi regional managing director, says North London shoppers will appreciate the difference: \u201cThe Camden store is an opportunity to reach customers in a busy London borough, many of whom may not have experienced Aldi\u2019s award-winning, quality products at unbeatable prices before. \u201cWe expect details of the agreement to be finalised in autumn and work will then begin to refit the store with a view to opening in spring next year.\u201d Newsflash: The Co-op has swooped in to buy the four small Waitrose stores being axed today, saving them from closure. The Co-op has exchanged contracts to take over the Little Waitrose convenience stores in Manchester (on the approach to Piccadilly railway, and in the financial centre of Spinningfields). It will also take over the store on Colmore Row in Birmingham City Centre, and Portman Square in central London. Stuart Hookins, Co-op Director of Property Portfolio and Development, says: \u201cWe are pleased to have worked with Waitrose to agree the purchase of four of its convenience stores. Our acquisition and refit programme forms a fundamental part of our food strategy. Our aim is for stores to be at the heart of local life, creating stronger communities and offering great quality products conveniently, when and where our members and customers need them.\u201d This should also avoid job losses. Waitrose Partners at those shops being acquired by the Co-op will transfer to the Co-op under TUPE (Transfer of Undertakings, Protection of Employment regulations). Waitrose has also promised to find opportunities for staff wh want to say with them. The slide in John Lewis\u2019s profits this year highlights the wider crisis in British retail, says Richard Lim, chief executive of consultancy group Retail Economics, \u201cEven the mighty John Lewis has not been able to escape intensifying pressures building on UK high streets. The impact of rising sourcing costs, higher operating costs and the turbulent consumer environment has flatlined profits. \u201cThere\u2019s a growing sense of panic for the retail sector as the intergenerational shift in behavioural trends is fragmenting the market. The emergence of the sharing economy, mass personalisation at scale and the \u2018me\u2019 economy has put the emphasis on retailers to differentiate themselves from their competitors. But the pace of change is accelerating and the race is on to pivot business models in a move to become fit-for-purpose in today\u2019s digital age.\u201d John Lewis\u2019s profits are being eaten by Amazon, and Brexit uncertainty, says Bloomberg: The operator of department stores and Waitrose supermarkets said it\u2019s unable to give a precise annual profit forecast because of economic uncertainty, some of it linked to the pending departure from the European Union. With Brexit less than a year away, consumer confidence will suffer further in the second half, Chief Financial Officer Patrick Lewis said. The announcement from John Lewis, at a strategy day Wednesday, continues a run of bad news from U.K. store chains. Brexit is squeezing their costs and prompting consumers to keep closer tabs on budgets, compounding the damage from the rise of online shopping. Newsflash: The Bank of England has issued a warning that Europe needs to do more to prepare for Brexit. In its new financial stability report, the BoE says that progress has been made in protecting UK households and businesses against Brexit disruption but \u201cmaterial risks remain\u201d. It is particularly concerned that the EU hasn\u2019t created a temporary permission regime to allow financial firms to continue trading across Europe after next March. Without such a regime, trillions of pound worth of derivative contracts are at risk, plus millions of insurance contracts. The Bank says: Progress has been made, but material risks remain. The biggest remaining risks of disruption are where action is needed by both UK and EU authorities, such as ensuring the continuity of existing derivatives contracts. \u201cAs yet the EU has not indicated a solution analogous to a temporary permissions regime.\u201d BoE governor Mark Carney is speaking to reporters in London now, warning that the rise of protectionism could hurt the global economy. We\u2019ll have more details shortly... Here are the five Waitrose stores that are closing as part of the strategy announced this morning: Spinningfields, Manchester Manchester Piccadilly Colmore Row, Birmingham Portman Square, London Camden, London The first four are convenience stores, while the Camden store is a small supermarket. John Lewis\u2019s chairman has now weighed in on Brexit, saying it is \u2018unthinkable\u2019 that Britain leaves the EU without a deal. He made the comments at this morning\u2019s media briefing, as he outlines the company\u2019s plans to shut five Waitrose stores and boost investment. Reuters has the details: Britain is unprepared to leave the European Union without a deal and chaos would ensue were it to happen, the chairman of department store group John Lewis said on Wednesday. \u201cA no deal Brexit is in my view a pretty much unthinkable scenario,\u201d Charlie Mayfield told reporters. Martin Lane, managing editor of money.co.uk, is alarmed that profits across John Lewis\u2019s business have all but evaporated so far this year. He says: \u201cIt\u2019s no surprise John Lewis have seen a fall in consumer demand, but to make close to no profit is worrying to say the least. John Lewis are struggling to soak up rising costs whilst improving their own infrastructure. The strategic move to close a few Waitrose stores is part of a wider plan to innovate rather than expand. \u201cWith numerous high street retailers going into administration since Christmas, this news will surely have the John Lewis board members in crisis talks. Lane believes that Waitrose are losing out to cheaper rivals, as consumers cut back. John Lewis\u2019s department stores face an even bigger nemesis - the internet. With lack of wage growth and rising living costs it\u2019s become evident that shoppers are tightening their purse strings and saving where they can. Cheaper supermarkets like Aldi and Lidl are growing in popularity which leaves Waitrose out in the cold. John Lewis on the other hand are battling an even bigger battle - the online retail market. With the recent news House of Fraser are having to shut a large number of their stores, the worry is that John Lewis may end the same way. The partnership has its work cut out to recover from this. The boss of John Lewis Partnership, Paula Nickolds, is briefing reporters about the challenging retail world: Waitrose chief Rob Collins is also there: The company is also rebranding, to emphasise the partnership element of its business: The John Lewis Partnership has now issued a statement, confirming that profits are taking a tumble this year and that several Waitrose stores are being shuttered. The news comes in a strategic update, outlining its plans for its department stores and supermarkets. This includes \u00a3500m of fresh investment over the next few years. Here are some highlights (I\u2019ve bolded up the key points): It is widely acknowledged that the retail sector is going through a period of generational change and every retailer\u2019s response will be different. For the Partnership, the focus is on greater differentiation \u2013 not scale. We have clear plans to build on our strengths and to sharpen our points of difference in both Waitrose and John Lewis. These plans include further investment in and development of unique products and service, together with a greater emphasis on own brand and innovation. On current earnings: We expect the Partnership\u2019s half year profits before exceptional items \u2013 which are always much lower and more volatile than the second half \u2013 to be close to zero this year. For the full year there are a wide range of possible outcomes, given the market uncertainty, but we are currently assuming that profits before exceptional items will be substantially lower than last year. The Partnership currently expects to see profit growth in Waitrose, a decline in John Lewis and significant extra costs at the Partnership level as a result of greater IT investment, which will be a big driver behind the overall profit change. Today the Partnership has announced that it will take steps to strengthen its balance sheet by a further \u00a3500m over three years to invest in product and service innovation. This will be achieved by rebuilding profitability at Waitrose, creating more value from the property estate, and conducting a review of the Partnership\u2019s pension scheme. And here\u2019s confirmation that five Waitrose stores will close: Unlike many of its competitors, the John Lewis Partnership has a well balanced and well located store portfolio, with 353 Waitrose shops and 50 John Lewis. As we develop our plans to prioritise differentiation we will continue to make adjustments to our overall estate, including exit or closures, but at a rate that\u2019s in line with what we have seen over the last few years. To this end, Waitrose today announced the disposal of four convenience shops and one small supermarket. Today\u2019s announcement is clearly bad news for John Lewis\u2019s 85,000 staff, who effectively own the Partnership. Each employee is a partner, who receives a percentage of their annual salary in a profit-related bonus each year. In 2017-18 the partners only got a 5% bonus, the lowest in over 60 years, after profits slumped by 77%. This year\u2019s bonus could be even more miserly. More gloom from John Lewis Partnership chairman Charlie Mayfield: \u201cIt is very important that we feel the jeopardy of what is happening right now. John Lewis is briefing reporters about its plans now. Chairman Sir Charlie Mayfield warns that the retail slowdown isn\u2019t a \u201cblip\u201d, and could continue for some time: Newsflash: John Lewis has warned that its profits will be substantially lower than a year ago. In the latest gloomy news to hit Britain\u2019s retail sector, the John Lewis Partnership admits that profits in the first half of the financial year could be close to zero. It is also planning to close a handful of small Waitrose stores - including one in Camden, two Little Waitrose outlets in Manchester and one in Birmingham. More to follow! Worries that Donald Trump will trigger a destructive trade war are weighing on the world\u2019s stock markets again today. China\u2019s benchmark CSI 300 index slumped by 2% today to a two-year low, leaving it firmly in \u2018bear market territory\u2019 (more than 20% below its peak in January). Other Asian markets also slipped, with the Hong Kong Hang Seng index down 1.8%. It\u2019s been a bad few weeks for emerging market shares, as nervous investors pull money out. As this chart shows, the entire region is worryingly close to bear market territory: European markets are also on the back foot. Germany\u2019s DAX has dropped by 0.75% this morning, as concerns that Trump might slap tariffs on European car imports mount. France\u2019s CAC is down 0.5%. Things look better in London, though, where the FTSE 100 has lost just 10 points (-0.15%). Connor Campbell of SpreadEx says that \u201congoing trade war concerns continuing to weigh on investors\u2019 minds.\u201d Economist Howard Archer of EY Item Club has spotted that UK house prices actually flatlined in the last three months, compared to the previous quarter. This is the first time that prices haven\u2019t risen on a quarterly basis since the third quarter of 2012 - another sign that the market\u2019s cooling. Archer says people are being cautious because interest rates could rise soon - making a mortgage less affordable: Housing market activity is expected to remain lacklustre as the extended squeeze on consumer purchasing power only gradually eases, confidence is relatively fragile and appreciable caution persists over engaging in major transactions. Potential house buyers may also be concerned that they are likely to face further interest rate hikes over the coming months (we believe the Bank of England is more likely than not to raise interest rates from 0.50% to 0.75% in August \u2013 although it could be delayed until November). Furthermore, house prices are relatively expensive relative to incomes Worries over Brexit are keeping some potential housebuyers out of the market, keeping prices subdued, says Jonathan Samuels, CEO of the property lender, Octane Capital. With Brexit on the horizon, households feeling the pinch and interest rate uncertainty lingering, a lot of prospective buyers are sitting tight. \u201cNationally, we\u2019re witnessing the revenge of the regions, with the East and West Midlands in especially barnstorming form. Wales also has a significant spring in its step.\u201dLondon is in a league of its own once again, but sadly, for homeowners in the capital, it\u2019s the bottom league. North London estate agent Jeremy Leaf says sellers need to be realistic about prices, particularly in his patch: \u2018On the one hand, the squeeze on incomes and unrealistic asking prices is reducing activity and confidence to move, particularly in price-sensitive areas such as London. \u2018On the other hand, the market continues to be supported by low interest rates and overall supply shortages, although we have found recently that listings and viewings are on the rise. This will translate into more sales if buyers and sellers recognise the new market realities.\u2019 Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, reckons we\u2019ll avoid a full-blown house price crash: \u201cTight supply, a healthy labour market and a continued lengthening of mortgage terms - 30-year loans now are common - will help to prevent prices from falling outright. \u201cBut it is inevitable that house prices will grow at a slower rate than households\u2019 incomes during a period of rising mortgage rates.\u201d House prices in the North are closing the gap on their Southern cousins. Northern property prices have risen by 3.3% in the last year, a vigorous performance compared to the South\u2019s softer growth of just 0.5% (dragged down by London\u2019s 1.9% decline). But.... that only makes a small dent in Britain\u2019s housing divide. Prices in London, for example, are still more than 50% higher than in 2007 when the financial crisis stuck. In swathes of the North, though, prices are below those levels. House prices growth is slowing in most parts of the UK, Nationwide reports. The Midlands has seen the strongest house price growth recently, followed by Wales and Scotland. But while London lags behind, the average price in the capital (\u00a3469k) are still more than twice the national average (\u00a3215k). Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. House price growth in the UK has fallen to its lowest level in five years, in the latest sign that the market is cooling. Nationwide, the building society, has reported that annual house price growth slowed to 2% this month. That\u2019s the slowest rate since 2013, with the market dragged down by falling prices in the capital. London was the weakest performing region in the last quarter, Nationwide reports, with prices down 1.9% year-on-year. Robert Gardner, Nationwide\u2019s chief economist, blames weak economic growth and tight household finances, saying: Surveyors continue to report subdued levels of new buyer enquiries, while the supply of properties on the market remains more of a trickle than a torrent. \u201cLooking further ahead, much will depend on how broader economic conditions evolve, especially in the labour market, but also with respect to interest rates. \u201cSubdued economic activity and ongoing pressure on household budgets is likely to continue to exert a modest drag on housing market activity and house price growth this year, though borrowing costs are likely to remain low. More details and reaction to follow... Also coming up today The Bank of England will highlight key threats to the UK economy when it presents its latest financial stability report this morning. Governor Mark Carney is also facing questions over the Bank\u2019s conduct and culture, after it emerged yesterday that two policymakers have run up almost \u00a3400,000 in travel expenses in the last couple of years. MPs called the expense \u2018staggering\u2019, as we covered in yesterday\u2019s liveblog: The criticism is mounting this morning.... The stock markets are still edgy about the prospect of a US-China trade war. Shares have dropped again in Shanghai, but traders hope for a better day in Europe. Retailers could also be under pressure today, as Britain runs low on beer! Not great timing, with the World Cup coming to the boil. Plus, the oil price could be volatile as America puts pressure on other countries to stop buying oil from Iran. The latest oil inventory stats will show whether supplies are holding up.

The continued deterioration in the Chinese yuan highlights the influence the Chinese government has upon their exchange rate, with the 5% rise in [dollar/yuan] over the past two months shifting the trade of terms before any tariffs even start to kick in. </p> <p>Brexit concerns continue to dominate local sentiment, with sliding consumer and business confidence dragging the pound to a seven-month low against the dollar. However, much of the story is related to the growing prominence of the US dollar, with the greenback likely to continue gaining ground as the trade war continues. With the likes of the EU and China holding huge surpluses in the trade of goods with the US, Trump knows they have more to gain than to lose. The sharp deterioration in German stocks this week is a clear nod to the reliance the country has upon physical exports. Today\u2019s downward revision for first quarter GDP out of the US provided a temporary dent in the dollar resurgence story.</p> <p> However, while GDP came in at 2%, rather than the 2.2% previously expected, the pathway in US PMI surveys points towards continued upside for US growth despite this short term blip.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5b34ed90e4b08b4490eac47a\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-06-28T14:19:18.409Z\">3.19pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Wall Street falls back</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The continuing trade tensions between the US and China are on investors minds again, pushing US markets lower in early trading.

A Bank Rate rise of 25 basis points would still leave monetary conditions in the UK extraordinarily accommodative by any historical metric. And the aim in doing so is to lower the risk of needing to tighten policy less gradually in future and cause a sharper adjustment in the economy.</p> <p>Truth be told, I would have voted to raise Bank Rate at the MPC\u2019s May meeting had data on the economy held firm. What we saw ahead of that meeting was a string of weak data suggesting consumer spending might be faltering. I believed there was option value in waiting to see if these data signalled the start of a lasting retrenchment by households, or were instead a temporary snow or statistical blip. With only a modest policy tightening needed over a number of years to return inflation to target, there was \u201cno rush\u201d. </p> <p>In the event, data on the consumer since the May MPC meeting has, virtually without exception, bounced back strongly. That includes measures of retail spending, consumer confidence and consumer credit. The underlying picture now appears to be one of gently rising household spending. This is being supported by highly accommodative credit conditions and now-positive growth in inflation-adjusted wages. </p> </blockquote> <p>And he added (saying he did not want to tempt fate even as he was doing so):</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>And then, of course, there is the World Cup. Without wishing to tempt fate, England\u2019s recent sporting success on the football field (and cricket pitch) has probably added to that feel-good factor among England-supporting consumers. The \u201csmile count\u201d on my recent visits to Wales and Scotland was also as high as I can remember, although I suspect that may have been the weather rather than the football. </p> </blockquote> <p>More from Reuters:</p> <blockquote> <p>Haldane said there would always be some data that disappoints.</p> <p>\u201cBut waiting for something to turn up is not a prudent strategy in life. And waiting for everything to turn up is certainly not a prudent strategy for monetary policy,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Most of Haldane\u2019s speech focused on fixing Britain\u2019s abysmal record of productivity growth over the last 10 years.</p> <p>He said Britain\u2019s institutions should focus more on how to \u201ctrickle-down\u201d new technology to the swathes of the economy that have shown only weak growth in productivity.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5b34ddf7e4b02f6ecf5e9819\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-06-28T13:13:36.472Z\">2.13pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Stock markets continue to be volatile, with the worries about a potential trade war between the US and China continuing to dominate sentiment.</p> <p>The FTSE 100 is down 0.35%, Germany\u2019s Dax is down 1.44% and France\u2019s Cac has fallen 0.83%.

                "bodyText":"Despite Wall Street making a partial recovery by the time European markets closed, this did little to help them. Trade war tensions continued to dominate sentiment, especially in Germany which is heavily dependent on exports. In the UK a weakening pound on doubts about interest rate rises helped the FTSE 100 outperform its peers, given the index is full of overseas earners which benefit from lower sterling. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished virtually unchanged, down just 6.06 points or 0.08% at 7615.63 Germany\u2019s Dax dropped 1.39% to 12,177.23 France\u2019s Cac closed 0.97% lower at 5275.64 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB fell 0.58% to 21,432.34 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended down 0.72% at 9589.0 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 11 points or 0.05%. On that note, it\u2019s time to close for the day. Thanks for all your comments and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. Despite other distractions, the current trade tensions between the US and China - and elsewhere for that matter - continue to dominate market sentiment. David Madden, market analyst at CMC Markets UK, said: Stocks have sold off as trade woes continue. Investors are cashing in on yesterday\u2019s gains, as trade tensions remain alive and well. Investors will want to see progress being made regarding trade negotiations before they hold on to stocks for several days at a time. As a result, markets are finding it difficult to hold on to a rally, which underlines the weak sentiment. Wall Street has regained much of its early losses but European markets continue to struggle. Joshua Mahony, market analyst at IG, said: European markets have led the way lower, with the threat of a breakdown in trade disproportionately hurting stocks in countries which enjoy a sizeable trade surplus with the US. The continued deterioration in the Chinese yuan highlights the influence the Chinese government has upon their exchange rate, with the 5% rise in [dollar/yuan] over the past two months shifting the trade of terms before any tariffs even start to kick in. Brexit concerns continue to dominate local sentiment, with sliding consumer and business confidence dragging the pound to a seven-month low against the dollar. However, much of the story is related to the growing prominence of the US dollar, with the greenback likely to continue gaining ground as the trade war continues. With the likes of the EU and China holding huge surpluses in the trade of goods with the US, Trump knows they have more to gain than to lose. The sharp deterioration in German stocks this week is a clear nod to the reliance the country has upon physical exports. Today\u2019s downward revision for first quarter GDP out of the US provided a temporary dent in the dollar resurgence story. However, while GDP came in at 2%, rather than the 2.2% previously expected, the pathway in US PMI surveys points towards continued upside for US growth despite this short term blip. The continuing trade tensions between the US and China are on investors minds again, pushing US markets lower in early trading. News that Amazon is buying US online pharmacy group PillPack has hit shares in rival drugs companies, adding to the pressure on markets. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 85 points or 0.35% while the S&amp;P 500 opened down 0.03% and the Nasdaq Composite dipped by 0.09%. Haldane also appeared to take issue with the Labour party\u2019s proposal to give the Bank of England a mandate to boost productivity. In his speech Haldane said: It is ... well-known, including from historical experience, that productivity depends importantly on a number of structural features of the economy, including levels of education and skills in the workforce, the quality and quantity of infrastructure and innovation and the scale of financing to companies. Price and financial stability are necessary conditions for rising productivity. But they are far from being sufficient ones. When it comes to those structural features of the economy, central banks do not have the tools to affect lasting change. Central bank tools are cyclical, rather than structural, because their impact on the economy is temporary, not permanent. We do not build schools, colleges, houses, roads, railways or banks. Nor do we finance them. Those tools, rightly, are in the hands either of governments or private companies. So too is the financing of them. Here\u2019s the chief economist of Pantheon Macroeconomics on Haldane\u2019s comments: Bank of England chief economist Andy Haldane caught many observers off guard last week when he voted for an interest rate rise for the first time. But in a speech in London on the UK\u2019s productivity problem, he said the decision should not have been seen as \u201csurprising or radical.\u201d He said: Voting for a 25 basis point rate rise, a full decade after monetary policy was first placed on an emergency setting, is hardly either surprising or radical. A Bank Rate rise of 25 basis points would still leave monetary conditions in the UK extraordinarily accommodative by any historical metric. And the aim in doing so is to lower the risk of needing to tighten policy less gradually in future and cause a sharper adjustment in the economy. Truth be told, I would have voted to raise Bank Rate at the MPC\u2019s May meeting had data on the economy held firm. What we saw ahead of that meeting was a string of weak data suggesting consumer spending might be faltering. I believed there was option value in waiting to see if these data signalled the start of a lasting retrenchment by households, or were instead a temporary snow or statistical blip. With only a modest policy tightening needed over a number of years to return inflation to target, there was \u201cno rush\u201d. In the event, data on the consumer since the May MPC meeting has, virtually without exception, bounced back strongly. That includes measures of retail spending, consumer confidence and consumer credit. The underlying picture now appears to be one of gently rising household spending. This is being supported by highly accommodative credit conditions and now-positive growth in inflation-adjusted wages. And he added (saying he did not want to tempt fate even as he was doing so): And then, of course, there is the World Cup. Without wishing to tempt fate, England\u2019s recent sporting success on the football field (and cricket pitch) has probably added to that feel-good factor among England-supporting consumers. The \u201csmile count\u201d on my recent visits to Wales and Scotland was also as high as I can remember, although I suspect that may have been the weather rather than the football. More from Reuters: Haldane said there would always be some data that disappoints. \u201cBut waiting for something to turn up is not a prudent strategy in life. And waiting for everything to turn up is certainly not a prudent strategy for monetary policy,\u201d he said. Most of Haldane\u2019s speech focused on fixing Britain\u2019s abysmal record of productivity growth over the last 10 years. He said Britain\u2019s institutions should focus more on how to \u201ctrickle-down\u201d new technology to the swathes of the economy that have shown only weak growth in productivity. Stock markets continue to be volatile, with the worries about a potential trade war between the US and China continuing to dominate sentiment. The FTSE 100 is down 0.35%, Germany\u2019s Dax is down 1.44% and France\u2019s Cac has fallen 0.83%. The UK market is outperforming peers due to further weakness in the pound. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said: The FTSE avoided the losses seen over in the Eurozone, largely because of sterling\u2019s ongoing crisis. Concerns about a more pessimistic Brexit outlook from the country\u2019s businesses, a lack of faith in Theresa May heading into Thursday\u2019s EU summit, and disappointment at a dovish message from MPC member Jon Cunliffe left the pound in a sorry state. Against the dollar it was at a sub-$1.31, 7 month nadir after falling 0.3%, while against the euro it hit a 7 and a half week low of \u20ac1.1305 following a half a percent plunge. Meanwhile on Wall Street, the futures market is suggesting a fall of more than 100 points on the Dow Jones Industrial Average. Back in the UK, and bad news for one DIY chain. Sarah Butler and Zoe Wood report: Homebase is cutting 300 jobs at its Milton Keynes head office amid speculation that up to 80 stores will close after its takeover by the restructuring specialist Hilco. The loss-making DIY chain was bought by the owner of HMV for \u00a31 in a deal agreed in May after its previous Australian owner, Wesfarmers, pulled the plug on a \u201cdisastrous\u201d venture into the UK. Wesfarmers, which bought the business for \u00a3340m two years ago, offloaded the entire 250-store Homebase chain, which has a workforce of just over 11,000 people, ditching a plan to convert them to its Bunnings brand. The full story is here: Newsflash: E-commerce giant Amazon has bought US online pharmacy chain PillPack, giving its rivals quite a headache: NEWSFLASH: America\u2019s economy suffered an even sharper slowdown than previously thought at the start of this year. New figures show that US GDP rose by 0.5% in the first quarter of 2018, or an \u2018annualised rate\u2019 of 2.0%. That\u2019s down from a previous estimate of 2.2%, and much slower than the 2.9% annualised rate recorded in October-December. It\u2019s still faster than Britain, where GDP only rose by 0.1% during the quarter (or 0.4% on an annualised basis). The slowdown won\u2019t worry US policymakers too much, though. Economists think US growth roared back in the current quarter, as Donald Trump\u2019s tax cuts boosted demand. An annualised growth rate of 4.5% would pretty punchy -- although not unprecedented, as the president\u2019s son was reminded on Twitter last night.... In other news, oil giant BP has swooped on Britain\u2019s biggest network of electric car-charging points in a \u00a3130m deal. That\u2019s an intriguing move for BP, a company more known for extracting and refining crude than for renewable energy (despite trying to move \u2018beyond petroleum\u2019 at the start of the millennium). My colleague Adam Vaughan explains: The acquisition of Chargemaster, which has more than 6,500 charging points across the country, will begin to result in the deployment of fast chargers at BP\u2019s 1,200 forecourts over the next year. The deal is understood to be worth \u00a3130m and was lauded as a significant milestone towards cleaner motoring in the UK. There are more than 140,000 electric vehicles on the UK\u2019s roads, most of which are plug-in hybrid vehicles that can run for a short distance on battery power before switching to petrol or diesel.

It\u2019s been a busy morning for the Bank of England. Deputy governor Sam Woods has written to the chief executives of Britain\u2019s banks and insurers, urging them to be cautious about getting involved with cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin. Woods warned that digital currencies are new, volatile, and prone to use by organised criminals, saying: The range of products and market participants related to crypto-assets has grown quickly. In their short history, crypto-assets have exhibited high price volatility and relative illiquidity. Crypto-assets also raise concerns related to misconduct and market integrity \u2013 many appear vulnerable to fraud and manipulation, as well as money-laundering and terrorist financing risks. Entering into activity related to crypto-assets may give also rise to reputational risks. Woods wants banks to make a named, senior manager responsible for signing off any crypto-related ventures, and to avoid undue risk-taking. The letter is online here. Anyone who \u2018invested\u2019 in Bitcoin late last year won\u2019t need reminding that digital currencies are volatile. Bitcoin is trading at $6,100 this morning, down from around $20,000 in mid-December. At the risk of putting more pressure on Gareth Southgate, UK businesses are pinning their hopes on a World Cup sales boost. The Bank of England\u2019s regional agents report that sales of \u201celectronics and alcoholic drinks\u201d are expected to rise, as fans pile into the local pub or splash out on a new TV to admire Harry Kane\u2019s latest screamer. Brexit isn\u2019t bad news for all UK companies, of course. It\u2019s proving jolly lucrative for lawyers. The Bank of England explains: Business services turnover had been growing relatively solidly and more strongly than most other sectors. This was despite some hesitancy around client investment decisions that contacts reported had been driven by political uncertainty For professional services firms, Mergers and Acquisition (M&amp;A) activity from overseas buyers, Brexit preparations, and insolvency and restructuring activity had driven fee growth. The new GDPR rules on data have also bene a windfall for legal experts, the BoE adds, as companies have tried to understand how the regulations affect them. The growing pessimism about Brexit among British firms bolsters the case for a second referendum on EU membership, argues Labour MP Virendra Sharma. Sharma (a member of the Best for Britain campaign) points out that UK businesses are becoming more vocal about their concerns: \u201cThis report highlights the damage Brexit is doing to business. That means jobs are on the line. \u201cA number of big employers have come out against Brexit recently. From Airbus to BMW to Jaguar Land Rover, jobs are being cut and livelihoods put at stake - all because Theresa May is running scared of the ideological extremists in her party. \u201cBrexit means fewer jobs. The case for a people\u2019s vote with the option to stay in the EU becomes clearer by the day.\u201d Donald Trump\u2019s threats against America\u2019s trading partners is also causing jitters in the UK, the Bank of England\u2019s regional agents report: Brexit was causing exporters and clients to examine their supply chains due to potential tariff and non-tariff barriers, and there were growing concerns about global trade protectionism. Here\u2019s an example of why UK firms are worried about Brexit: Today\u2019s Regional Agents report also shows that Britain\u2019s consumers are cutting back, particularly when it comes to big-ticket items. Growth in demand for consumer goods had not recovered sufficiently to make up for sales lost due to the adverse weather in Q1, however, and there was ongoing weak demand for new cars, white goods and homewares. Contacts attributed more cautious consumer sentiment to squeezed real incomes, higher pensions auto\u2011enrolment contributions and political uncertainty. Third-sector contacts suggested that delays in benefit payments and benefits sanctions were increasing the pressure on low-income households. Worryingly, this means some consumer-focused firms are now planning to axe jobs: Brexit is also making it harder for UK firms to find workers. The Bank of England\u2019s regional agents say that a drop in EU migration into the UK is hurting farms, restaurants and distributions firms: Recruitment difficulties remained elevated and were widespread across sectors and job roles. There were a growing number of reports of vacancies taking longer to fill and, in a small number of cases, labour shortages were constraining headcount growth. This was particularly the case where skill shortages were most acute, eg construction trades, drivers, specialist engineering and IT. A continued slowing in the inward flow of EU migrants for lower skilled and/or seasonal work was reported to be acting as a constraint in sectors such agriculture and food, hospitality and warehousing. Big UK firms, and those with an overseas focus, are particularly anxious about Brexit. The Bank of England\u2019s regional agents say the uncertainty is forcing them to cut back on investment: Brexit uncertainty was weighing down discretionary or expansionary investment for some medium to larger-sized businesses, or those with a greater international focus. SMEs and domestic-facing businesses were more likely to maintain a business as usual approach to investment as potential Brexit effects remained unclear. Newsflash: UK firms have become gloomier about the impact of Brexit on their sales in recent months. The latest report from the Bank of England\u2019s regional agents, just released, shows an increase in the number of companies expecting a negative impact from Britain\u2019s exit from the EU. The number of companies expecting a Brexit boost has also dropped a little, compared to three months ago. As you can see, rather more companies expect Brexit to be a negative experience. Overall, UK businesses expect around 3% to be wiped off their sales, the Bank says: The average eventual change in sales was negative and stood at around -3%. Using the same methodology would suggest that the most pessimistic 10% of businesses expected a reduction in sales of more than 10% due to Brexit, while the most optimistic 10% of respondents expected a boost of 1% or more. The Regional Agents also flag up a rise in debt defaults, as struggling UK companies fall into administration: Suppliers to consumer-facing businesses had reported an increased incidence of bad debts, and contacts expected continued retail and restaurant company voluntary arrangements (CVAs) and administrations as rising costs and over\u2011supply put pressure on balance sheets. Sterling has hit a new seven-month low this morning, as traders digest Jon Cunliffe\u2019s warning about household debt levels. The pound extended its recent slide and hit $1.3076, down almost half a cent, its lowest point since November 2017. City traders are also concerned about the state of play with Brexit; overnight, Irish PM Irish leader Leo Varadkar said the lack of progress was \u201cdisappointing\u201d. Connor Campbell of SpreadEx says the pound\u2019s \u201cmisery\u201d seems to know no end. With the Bank of England concerned about household debt, and investors doubtful about the smooth progress of Brexit despite Theresa May\u2019s attempts at reassurance ahead of the day\u2019s key EU summit, sterling fell 0.4% against the dollar, taking cable under $1.31 for the first time since early November last year. Against the euro, meanwhile, it dipped 0.3%, teasing a fresh month and a half low. Some lenders are already more reluctant to lend to consumers - perhaps anticipating the sort of financial downturn that is worrying the Bank of England. The Bank\u2019s latest survey shows a very sharp decline in the availability of consumer credit - even bigger than during the last financial crisis. The BoE explained yesterday that the boom in buying cars on credit deals seems to have faded: The slowdown in consumer credit growth is consistent with a reduction in demand as well as some tightening in supply. Slower car finance growth may be driven by the wider weakness in the car market, reflected in falls in new car registrations since end-2016. In addition, the structural shift increasing the share of cars purchased with some form of car finance may also have come to an end. More generally, the reduction in credit demand may be linked to slightly lower consumer confidence Jon Cunliffe also rejected the chance to throw his hat into the ring to replace his boss, Mark Carney. Asked if he\u2019ll be in the running to become governor when Carney leaves next summer, Cunliffe replied: \u201cI\u2019ve got a really challenging and difficult job and I\u2019m just focusing on doing it the best I can. When he\u2019s not being distracted by the World Cup, anyway..... Jon Cunliffe also played down the prospect of interest rates rising sharply soon. Cunliffe is one of the more dovish members of the Monetary Policy Committee - one of the six who voted to leave rates unchanged at just 0.5% last week. Asked whether borrowing costs could hit 2.5% in a few years, Cunliffe pointed out that the City only expects them to rise modestly: \u201cFinancial markets are assuming that interest rates go up by another three-quarters of a percentage point over the next couple of years.\u201d \u201cWe do our forecasting on the basis of where the financial markets have those interest rates and we think we have inflation at target at those sorts of levels. This chart (from yesterday\u2019s Financial Stability Report) shows why the Bank is fretting about household debt levels: Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. One of the Bank of England\u2019s top policymakers has warned that indebted households could be in peril if Britain falls into recession. Deputy governor Jon Cunliffe told BBC radio this morning that he\u2019s concerned about families with high debt levels. Cunliffe warned that some households have run up worrying levels of debts, which could drag them into a crisis if the economy sours, saying: \u201c(Household debt is) quite high by historical standards but (households have) worked hard to put those debt levels down. But within that there are areas that you do worry about. \u201cYou worry about households that have high debt (and) could be badly affected in a recession.\u201d UK household debt now totals \u00a31.8 trillion. Around 75% of that is mortgage debt, which will become more expensive to repay if interest rates go up. The rest is mostly in consumer credit. Yesterday, the Bank\u2019s latest financial stability report shows how household debt is creeping up again, when compared to the nation\u2019s income. We\u2019re not at 2008 levels yet, but policymakers seem concerned about the direction of travel. Cunliffe\u2019s comments come a day after high street bellwether John Lewis revealed its profits had collapsed to almost nothing so far this year. Also coming up today One of Cunliffe\u2019s colleagues, chief economist Andy Haldane, gives a speech this afternoon. He may elaborate on why he voted to raise interest rates last week. European stock markets rallied yesterday after America backed away from imposing new curbs on Chinese investment in the UK. But they may fall back today, after a late wobble on Wall Street yesterday. Jasper Lawler of London Capital Group says: Despite an early burst higher for the Dow following Trump\u2019s turnaround on Chinese restrictions, the index surrendered its biggest daily gain in 4 months to close 165 points in the red. A selloff in tech stocks &amp; financials overshadowing a rally in the energy sector. Asian markets took their cues from the US, heading southwards overnight. China, which technically entered bear market territory in the previous session after dropping 20% from its January peak, continued to grind lower, as trade war concerns and a slowing of momentum in the economy have sent investors running. It\u2019s a relatively busy day on the economic front, with eurozone confidence figures, German inflation data, and an updated estimate of US growth in the last quarter. Traders will also be watching events in Brussels tonight, where EU leaders gather for a summit dominated by migration and Brexit. The agenda: 10am BST: Eurozone consumer and economic confidence figures for June 1pm BST: German inflation figures for June 1.30pm BST: US GDP figures for January-March (third estimate) 2.30pm BST: BoE chief economist Andy Haldane speaks",

Bruce predicts that by 2025, a quarter of new cars will be electric or hybrid, and diesels\u2019 market share will have halved to 15%. \u201cPeople used to drive round dealerships, do test drives and haggle over part-exchange, but all that happens online now,\u201d says Bruce. \u201cThe average number of visits per sale is down from four or five to 1.5.\u201d By next year, shoppers will be able to buy a car from Lookers\u2019 website and have it dropped to their door without setting foot in a showroom, but Bruce believes most customers will still want some old-fashioned service between factory gate and driveway. He insists there is no prospect of car dealerships becoming extinct. \u201cYou can\u2019t buy a car from Amazon. If one of the car manufacturers did decide to go through Amazon, they would be taking a huge risk. It would fly in the face of what consumers want.\u201d But then travel agents, record shops, insurance brokers, mattress retailers, fashion boutiques and even banks used to think exactly that.",
