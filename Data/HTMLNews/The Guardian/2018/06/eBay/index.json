The closures are another blow for troubled high streets around the country, which are facing an almost unprecedented retreat by household names struggling to adapt to changing consumer habits and the economic slowdown. A squeeze on shoppers\u2019 budgets, resulting from inflation on basic necessities including food and travel at a time of low wage growth, has combined with a switch to buying online and purchasing experiences rather than physical items, to make life tough for traditional shopkeepers.
