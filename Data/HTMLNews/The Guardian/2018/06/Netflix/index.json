The commitment by Fox to let go of Sky News always looked like it be sufficient to assuage the media plurality concerns. For Comcast there were never any media plurality worries as it\u2019s got little European presence. </p> <p> A bidding war looms of course. The bid on the table from Comcast is an all-cash offer worth \u00a312.50 per share, so an increased offer is priced in already. But the fact that the shares are not roaring higher suggests investors are displaying some hesitation about whether Murdoch will significantly increase his offer. He may not have to - the option for Fox is to switch from the current Scheme of Arrangement to a Takeover Offer, which would allow it to use its 39% of shares in the vote. </p> <p> Then it\u2019s up to Comcast and we\u2019ll see just deep the pockets are - how badly does it want to diversify from the US and get exposure to Sky\u2019s attractive recurring revenues in Europe? The fact it thinks the deal would be accretive to free cash per share from year one suggests it can. And all this is muddied by the fact that Comcast has admitted it is in advanced stages of preparing an offer for the businesses that Fox has agreed to sell to Disney. </p> <p> A bidding war seems on the cards but we just don\u2019t know how far either side will push this. Comcast shares are down a touch and are around 25% lower from their highs this year, indicative of investor fears about it paying over the odds. Disney shares were also a shade lower and are around 10% off their 2018 highs. Either way it\u2019s shaping up to be a battle royale between Comcast and Disney this summer and Sky shareholders will be winners now the deals have been cleared by the government.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5b16a0e0e4b069235b5d1f7f\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-06-05T14:44:32.875Z\">3.44pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Ben Bird, media sector specialist at management consultancy Vendigital, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The culture secretary\u2019s decision to allow the 21<sup>st</sup> Century Fox bid to go ahead, subject to a request that Sky News is divested, is essentially good news for the consumer as the consolidation is all about safeguarding content.</p> <p>It will be especially heartening for others in the media sector that the CMA is not intending to block the bid.

                "bodyText":"In a busy day for corporate news, two events dominated. This morning the UK government sold a 7.7% stake in the bailed out Royal Bank of Scotland, raising \u00a32.5bn but crystallising a \u00a32.1bn loss on the price originally paid to rescue the bank. The final cost of the bailout could be \u00a330bn... or perhaps even more. The government defended the timing of the sale but some analysts suggested it was done to get it out of the way before the Brexit vote next week. Critics said it was a wasted opportunity to help reform the banking sector. The other big development was culture minister Matt Hancock\u2019s decision on the bids for Sky. He gave the go-ahead to the Comcast offer, and also the bid from 21st Century Fox, provided the Murdoch-controlled business agreed to sell Sky News to Disney or another buyer. Sky welcomed the news, which is likely to prompt a full takeover battle for the business while 21st Century Fox said it had already submitted plans to sell Sky News to Disney. But Labour expressed concerns about the sale of Sky News, saying its independence must be protected. Elsewhere the latest snapshot of the UK services sector showed stronger than expected growth which lifted the pound - on the basis it puts an interest rate rise back on the agenda - and sent the FTSE 100 0.7% lower. On that note, it\u2019s time to close for the day. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. Here is a handy run-through of the possible timetable for the Sky bids, courtesy of Jefferies analyst Jerry Dellis: Comcast\u2019s Rule 2.7 announcement of 25 Apr outlined its intention to make a Takeover Offer for Sky subject to pre-conditions being met. Competition clearance from the EU is now the final pre-condition. A decision will be made by 15 June according to the EC Competition website. Comcast has said that it will issue an Offer Document within 28 days all pre-conditions being met (implicitly by 13 July). Within 60 days of this, Sky must convene the shareholder meeting at which the Comcast proposal is to be voted on (by 11 Sep). Assuming it is not blocked by the Culture Secretary, Fox would announce a firm offer around 19 June. High Court approval would then be sought and the Scheme of Arrangement document would be posted out within 28 days of the offer announcement (around 17 July). Sky\u2019s shareholder meeting would need to take place within 21 days (7 Aug) with court approval after that. In reality, Sky\u2019s board will need to manage timetables such that shareholders are able to give adequate consideration to both offers. Sky shares have edged up 0.29% to \u00a313.54 after the US government cleared the Comcast and Fox bids for the company, albeit the latter was given the go-ahead on the condition that Sky News was sold. Meanwhile Royal Bank of Scotland has closed down 5.3% at 266p, compared to the 271p a share the government received in the sale of the latest tranche of its shares. Overall the FTSE 100 finished down 0.7% at 7686.8, undermined by a rise in sterling after better than expected service sector figures put a possible interest rate rise back on the agenda. Elsewhere the US tech boom continues: A bidding war for Sky is now on the cards but it is hard to judge how much higher the offers will go, says Neil Wilson, chief market analyst for Markets.com: Sky shares traded up about half a per cent [on the day] at \u00a313.55 as the Fox and Comcast bids were effectively waved through by culture secretary Matt Hancock. The commitment by Fox to let go of Sky News always looked like it be sufficient to assuage the media plurality concerns. For Comcast there were never any media plurality worries as it\u2019s got little European presence. A bidding war looms of course. The bid on the table from Comcast is an all-cash offer worth \u00a312.50 per share, so an increased offer is priced in already. But the fact that the shares are not roaring higher suggests investors are displaying some hesitation about whether Murdoch will significantly increase his offer. He may not have to - the option for Fox is to switch from the current Scheme of Arrangement to a Takeover Offer, which would allow it to use its 39% of shares in the vote. Then it\u2019s up to Comcast and we\u2019ll see just deep the pockets are - how badly does it want to diversify from the US and get exposure to Sky\u2019s attractive recurring revenues in Europe? The fact it thinks the deal would be accretive to free cash per share from year one suggests it can. And all this is muddied by the fact that Comcast has admitted it is in advanced stages of preparing an offer for the businesses that Fox has agreed to sell to Disney. A bidding war seems on the cards but we just don\u2019t know how far either side will push this. Comcast shares are down a touch and are around 25% lower from their highs this year, indicative of investor fears about it paying over the odds. Disney shares were also a shade lower and are around 10% off their 2018 highs. Either way it\u2019s shaping up to be a battle royale between Comcast and Disney this summer and Sky shareholders will be winners now the deals have been cleared by the government. Ben Bird, media sector specialist at management consultancy Vendigital, said: The culture secretary\u2019s decision to allow the 21st Century Fox bid to go ahead, subject to a request that Sky News is divested, is essentially good news for the consumer as the consolidation is all about safeguarding content. It will be especially heartening for others in the media sector that the CMA is not intending to block the bid. This could be a sign that the organisation has recognised that there is a real need for medium and large-scale companies in the sector to leverage their scale. Sky is not immune to the disruption facing the industry, with the rise of agile competitors such as Amazon and Netflix. Attracting the attention of consumers has become more difficult and the business needs to reduce costs where it can, whilst continuing to produce quality content. Other media companies will be willing the bid to complete successfully \u2013 particularly with the outcome of the CMA\u2019s investigation into Trinity Mirror\u2019s proposed takeover of Northern &amp; Shell still pending. More from the CMA: The full CMA report is available here. From the 414 page Competitions and Markets Authority report on the possible Sky bids, here is its view on the timetable for a Sky News sale: Sky shares have done little since Hancock unveiled his decision on both the Comcast and 21st Century Fox bids. They stood at \u00a313.53 when Hancock stood up, and are now almost imperceptibly higher at \u00a313.56. That compares with the \u00a310.75 a share on offer from Fox, and the better offer from Comcast of \u00a312.50 a share. Here\u2019s a link to the full statement from Matt Hancock on both bids for Sky: Here\u2019s the key section from Matt Hancock\u2019s statement -- outlining why 21 Century Fox must sell off Sky News in return for the government approving its takeover for Sky. I agree with the CMA that divesting Sky News to Disney, as proposed by Fox, or to an alternative suitable buyer, with an agreement to ensure it is funded for at least ten years, is likely to be the most proportionate and effective remedy for the public interest concerns that have been identified. The CMA report sets out some draft terms for such a divestment, and Fox has written to me to offer undertakings on effectively the same terms. The proposals include significant commitments from Fox. But there are some important issues on the draft undertakings which still need to be addressed. I need to be confident that the final undertakings ensure that Sky News: remains financially viable over the long-term; is able to operate as a major UK-based news provider; and is able to take its editorial decisions independently, free from any potential outside influence. As a result, I have asked my officials to begin immediate discussions with the parties to finalise the details with a view to agreeing an acceptable form of the remedy, so we can all be confident Sky News can be divested in a way that works for the long term. Under the legislation, I am required to consult formally for 15 days on the undertakings. Subject to the willingness of the parties to agree the details, I aim to publish this consultation within a fortnight. I am optimistic that we can achieve this goal, not least given the willingness 21st Century Fox has shown in developing these credible proposals. However, if we can\u2019t agree terms at this point, then I agree with the CMA that the only effective remedy now would be to block the merger altogether. This is not my preferred approach. Here\u2019s a clip of Chris Bryant suggesting that Kay Burley will drive Matt Hancock out of parliament if Sky News hits the buffers. Anything Martin Bell can do, Kay can do too..... Liberal Democrat MP Christine Jardine says her party has concerns about Fox\u2019s proposed takeover of Sky. She welcomes the plan for Sky News to be divested... but wonders if rival bidder Comcast will give similar reassurances about media independence if it wins the battle for Sky. Matt Hancock replies that Comcast has given undertakings and assurances. By law, he looked at its bid for Sky because of its material size. He concluded that Comcast\u2019s bid did not raise public interest concerns, so the government will not issue an intervention notice. Hancock adds that he hopes the Sky takeover battle will reach a conclusion that \u201cdemonstrates with confidence\u201d that Sky News will be independent and viable, so parliament can be content with the state of media plurality in future. Back in parliament, Labour MP Chris Bryant has criticised the proposal for Sky News to be sold off if 21st Century Fox wins the takeover battle for Sky. He warns that Sky News could be starved of money by whoever buys it (either Disney or another owner). So, in a few years they\u2019ll come back to the government and ask to be subsumed back into Fox. To laughter, Bryant suggests that Matt Hancock could even find himself facing a TV news veteran at the polling booth. Kay Burley will be out of a job, and she\u2019ll stand in West Sussex and defeat him, because most people in this country would prefer a diversity of ownership of media and we want to keep Sky as independence as possible. Hancock replies that he relishes the prospect of a contest in West Sussex with anyone (!) but doesn\u2019t accept that Sky News will be starved of funds in the future. Here\u2019s a clip of Tom Watson telling parliament that Labour has serious concerns about the proposed sale of Sky News, and that the channel\u2019s \u2018independent and rigorous\u2019 independence must be protected. Here\u2019s our media editor, Jim Waterson, on today\u2019s announcement: The UK government has approved a bid from US media giant Comcast to take over Sky, while indicating it is minded to approve a rival bid from Rupert Murdoch\u2019s 21st Century Fox providing it sells Sky News to another organisation. The decisions are likely to set up a multibillion-pound bidding war for the British broadcaster. Fox is attempting to buy the 61% of Sky that it does not already own, in a deal valuing the company at \u00a318.5bn, but the bid has been complicated by concerns that it would leave Murdoch with too much control over the UK media. Comcast, which owns US TV network NBC and Universal Studios, made a rival bid earlier this year that valued Sky at \u00a322bn. The culture secretary, Matt Hancock, approved the Comcast deal in a statement in the House of Commons, while indicating he will also approve the Murdoch deal if Sky News is offloaded to an appropriate buyer in order to avoid excessive influence by the the mogul\u2019s family over the UK news business. Here\u2019s his full story: Rupert Murdoch\u2019s 21st Century Fox has also welcomed the government\u2019s decision. In a statement to shareholders, 21CF says it has already submitted plans to sell Sky News to Disney (to address those concerns about media plurality). Here\u2019s its statement: 21st Century Fox (\u201c21CF\u201d) welcomes today\u2019s announcement by the Secretary of State for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport that he has cleared 21CF\u2019s proposed acquisition of the remaining shares in Sky on broadcasting standards, as recommended by the Competition and Markets Authority (\u201cCMA\u201d). Regarding the effects on media plurality we note that the CMA recommended to the Secretary of State that divestiture is \u201cthe most effective and proportionate remedy\u201d. 21CF has already submitted proposed undertakings to achieve the divestiture of Sky News to Disney. We note that the Secretary of State agrees with this solution and has instructed officials from the Department for Culture, Media and Sport (\u201cDCMS\u201d) to agree final undertakings that he would be prepared to accept and consult on within the two-week timeframe. We now look forward to engaging with DCMS and we are confident that we will reach a final decision clearing our transaction. Sky says it welcomes Matt Hancock\u2019s announcements (not a surprise, as it paves the way for a full-blooded takeover battle for the company). It adds: In respect of 21CF\u2019s proposed acquisition of Sky, Sky notes that the Secretary of State considers that the undertakings provided by 21CF have provided a good starting point to overcome the adverse public interest effects of the proposed merger that he has identified, and that DCMS Officials have now been instructed to seek to agree final undertakings with 21CF. The Secretary of State has stated that, dependent on the outcome of these discussions, he would hope to be in a position to consult on any agreed final undertakings within the next two weeks. Shadow culture secretary Tom Watson is responding to Hancock now. He warns that selling Sky News to Disney could backfire, if the planned takeover of 21 CF by Disney should collapse. This could leave Sky News vulnerable. The CMA\u2019s and Hancock have concluded that that the takeover would not threaten broadcasting standards. Watson, though, queries this view. He suggests that upcoming court cases brought against The Sun could show maladministration by Fox, which might make the minister change his view. Now onto 21 Century Fox\u2019s takeover bid for Sky. Matt Hancock tells MPs that the Competition and Markets Authority has concluded that 21CN\u2019s bid could operate against the public interest, for two reasons: potential erosion of Sky News\u2019s editorial independence. Increased influence of Murdoch family trust on public opinion and the UK\u2019s political agenda. Hancock says various remedies have been proposed. He says that the idea of divesting Sky News to Disney [which is hoping to take over 21st Century Fox] or to an alternative provider with funding for at least 10 years, is the most proportionate and effective remedy to address these concerns. Hancock is saying he will approve 21 Century Fox\u2019s bid for Sky can proceed - if he is satisfied that Sky News\u2019 independence is guaranteed. Hancock says he has asked officials to begin immediate discussions with 21 CF to draw up a final proposal for Sky News to be divested in a satisfactory way. Culture minister Matt Hancock says he has considered Comcast and 21 Century Fox\u2019s bids for Sky separately. Comcast first.... Hancock rules that the deal does not does not raise public interest concerns. So, he will not be issuing an intervention notice. That\u2019s a green light for Comcast! Heathrow questions are finally over. Matt Hancock has descended from his holding pattern and is giving his statement on the Sky takeover now. Matt Hancock will give his decision on the Sky takeover once transport secretary Chris Grayling finishes answering questions from MPs about Heathrow Airport. The government has decided to back plans to build a third runway at Heathrow, after years of prevarication. Plenty of MPs want their say. Some support the plan -- as do unions and business groups. But other MPs (especially with constituencies in or near West London) are very worried about the environmental impact. It\u2019s also ironic that London is getting another runway while the railways network in the North of England suffers severe disruption after decades of under-investment. Our Politics Live blog has the details: The Financial Times predicts that both Sky takeover offers will get the green light from the government today. The FT\u2019s Matthew Garrahan explains: The fate of competing bids for Sky by 21st Century Fox and Comcast will become clear today when culture secretary Matt Hancock delivers the UK government\u2019s verdict on whether to block or clear each offer. Fox, which is controlled by Rupert Murdoch, has been embroiled in regulatory scrutiny for 18 months with its bid to take full control of Sky, offering \u00a310.75 a share, valuing the company \u2014 which was founded by Mr Murdoch \u2014 at about \u00a318.5bn. Comcast made a competing offer earlier this at \u00a312.50 a share, which valued Sky at about \u00a322bn. Mr Hancock is expected to clear both bids \u2014 possibly with some conditions attached \u2014 setting the scene for a bidding war for Sky. Separately, Fox and Comcast are embroiled in another takeover tussle: Walt Disney is attempting to buy Fox\u2019s entertainment assets \u2014 including its 39 per cent stake in Sky \u2014 in a deal worth $66bn including debt. More here. Breaking away from the RBS share sale, the UK government is about to rule whether either Rupert Murdoch or US conglomerate Comcast - or both - should be allowed to take full control of broadcaster Sky. Culture minister Matt Hancock will make a statement on the situation in parliament shortly. Murdoch\u2019s 21 Century Fox (21CF) currently owns 39% of Sky, and launched a full takeover bid in December 2016. However, the bid has been held up by concerns that it will give Murdoch too much control on the UK media landscape. In January, the Competition and Markets Authority said 21st Century Fox\u2019s bid was not in the public interest due to concerns about media plurality. Fox has since offered some concessions, such as making Sky News a legally separative business. Comcast launched its own bid for Sky in April. It could potentially derail Murdoch\u2019s plan to sell most of 21CF to Disney in a $66bn (\u00a347bn) deal. So Hancock\u2019s decision could be extremely significant for Sky\u2019s future, and the wider media landscape.... If you\u2019re just tuning in, here\u2019s our economics editor Larry Elliott on today\u2019s RBS share sale: Philip Hammond has been forced to defend the government\u2019s decision to sell part of its stake in RBS after an overnight sale of shares left taxpayers nursing a \u00a32bn loss. The chancellor said the offloading of almost 8% of the company\u2019s shares for \u00a32.5bn was a significant step in returning the high street bank \u2013 bailed out by Labour during the depths of the 2008 financial crisis \u2013 to the private sector. But the sale of 925m shares at 271p each was at a price significantly lower than the 502p at which the Treasury bought its stake a decade ago and led to criticism that ministers had sold at the wrong time. Hammond said: \u201cThis sale represents a significant step in returning RBS to full private ownership and putting the financial crisis behind us. The government should not be in the business of owning banks. The proceeds of this sale will go towards reducing our national debt. This is the right thing to do for taxpayers as we build an economy that is fit for the future.\u201d John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, said: \u201cThere is no economic justification for this sell-off of RBS shares. There should be no sales of RBS shares, full stop. But particularly with such a large loss to the taxpayers who bailed out the bank. Prem Sikka, emeritus professor of accounting at the University of Essex, said: \u201cWhy sell? Taxpayers bailed out the bank and when there is a glimpse of recovery and profits, the government sells it at a loss to ensure that profits are collected by its friends in the City.\u201d Shares in RBS have not traded above the price the government bought them at since 2010 and never once hit the 625p-a-share break-even price calculated by the National Audit Office (NAO) to take into account the cost of finance. More here: Hammond forced to defend RBS shares sale after \u00a32bn loss to taxpayers Laith Khalaf, Senior Analyst, Hargreaves Lansdown, reminds us JUST HOW BIG Royal Bank of Scotland had become after years of dealmaking under the leadership of Fred Goodwin. \u2018It\u2019s now clear the losses sustained by the taxpayer on the RBS bailout are going to be substantial, though this really reflects the price paid for financial stability in the depths of the global banking crisis. In essence the RBS bailout cushioned the blow of the financial crisis, and spread the pain across many years, a decision which is now beginning to become more measurable. We will never know what the outcome would have been if RBS had been allowed to fail, though it\u2019s important to recognise the scale of RBS at the time. The bank may have its roots in the cobbled streets of Edinburgh, but it became one of the world\u2019s biggest banks, with a \u00a32.4 trillion balance sheet at the height of its power. To put that number in context, it\u2019s bigger than the annual output of the whole UK economy and compares with the $639 balance sheet of Lehman\u2019s Brothers just before it filed for bankruptcy. It\u2019s just possible therefore that the collapse of RBS could have taken all the other dominos with it. Clearly the losses that are now being sustained on the government shareholding are deeply unwelcome, but the alternative to a bailout might have been far worse.\u2019 My colleague Richard Partington has been crunching the numbers... The Unite union have blasted the government over today\u2019s share sale. Rob MacGregor, Unite national officer, says Philip Hammond and colleagues should use their power as majority shareholders to improve the bank, not sell out at a loss: \u201cThe government is attempting to wash its hands with Royal Bank of Scotland at the expense of the taxpayer. This bargain basement sale of over seven per cent of the bank\u2019s shares is a betrayal of public finances and represents a total loss of over \u00a33 billion for taxpayers since the original bail-out in 2008. Staff are clear that the government should be focusing its attentions on keeping RBS bank branches open and improving the corporate governance of this institution. \u201cThe catalogue of failures across the bank ranging from thousands of staff cuts, closing hundreds of bank branches and also the sale of financial products which resulted in the $4.9 billion US fine demonstrates the systematic failures by the management to effectively run this organisation. Staff across the business are continuing to pay for the mistakes at the top whilst the government merely looks the other way.\u201d Labour\u2019s shadow City minister, Jonathan Reynolds, argues that the government is selling up at precisely the wrong moment: He\u2019s referring to the $4.9bn (\u00a33.6bn) penalty which the US Department of Justice hit RBS with last month, for misselling toxic securities in the run-up to the financial crisis. That fine was smaller than expected, so one of the biggest clouds over RBS has finally lifted. That should give the bank\u2019s shares a lift in the coming months. Then again.... there\u2019s still the risk that the UK economy falls into recession, especially if Brexit turns out badly. Jane Sydenham, Investment Director at City firm Rathbones, argues that Philip Hammond is wise to sell some shares while he can: With the economy in relatively good shape and interest rates likely to rise in the not-too-distant future, it\u2019s a good time for the government to start selling the RBS stock. Although the sale of stocks is still loss-making for the tax payer, it\u2019s important that the government gets as much back as possible while they can, instead of waiting too long and potentially seeing the economy move into trouble again. With this risk in mind, there is no point waiting even if it does mean accepting a loss. I\u2019ve just realised that the true break-even price of the RBS bailout is even higher than I thought. The 625p break-even point was set by the National Audit Office last summer, when it assessed the government\u2019s first sale of RBS shares in 2015. It is based on the cost of the government borrowing \u00a345bn to fund the RBS bailout (the NAO estimated that UK bonds were being sold at 3.7% per year at the time.) So, that figure includes the financial cost of the rescue. But, it doesn\u2019t cover the additional cost of repaying the debt since 2015. As this NAO chart shows, the true cost of the bailout keeps rising the longer the taxpayer holds onto its shares. So the break-even price could already be closer to \u00a37.... In City jargon, the government sold part of its stake in RBS through an \u201caccelerated bookbuilding process to institutional investors\u201d In practice, that means 925m shares were sold to banks, hedge funds, pension funds, insurance companies, and other organisations who manage our money. Citigroup, Goldman Sachs and J.P. Morgan all acted as \u2018bookrunners\u2019 for the placing, which means they persuaded the institutional investors to take part (readers can speculate why it takes THREE investment banks to handle this sort of thing.....). Economics journalist Dharshini David points out that the buyers will probably make a profit (once RBS\u2019s shares rise above 271p). Some critics say the government is wasting a great opportunity by simply selling their stake in Royal Bank of Scotland. Labour MP Gareth Thomas argues that the Treasury could turn the bank into a building society with a remit to help the UK economy: Positive Money, a group which campaigns for a fairer banking system, argues that RBS should be broken up. Fran Boait, executive director of Positive Money, says today\u2019s share selloff is a \u2018colossal wasted opportunity\u2019. As well as losing the taxpayer billions of pounds, the government is also losing the ability to reshape Britain\u2019s banking system. \u201cInstead of selling off its majority stake, the government should use its position to break up RBS into smaller, regional banks, with alternative business models that emphasise lending to SMEs and productive industry. \u201cSuch innovation is needed to direct lending to the real economy, which has been been starved of investment in recent years.\u201d Graham Spooner, investment research analyst at The Share Centre, recommends that RBS investors hold onto their shares. Spooner argues that the bank\u2019s financial performance is improving, so it should resume paying dividends to investors soon. Spooner says: \u201cInstitutional shareholders paid more or less the market price [in today\u2019s sale] so they must have some confidence in the banks longer-term recovery. As well as this, the bank could be a step nearer to paying a dividend. \u201cThe negative is that the government still have a large holding of 62.4% which is set to overhang the market for some time; the government cannot sell any more for 90 days. \u201cWhile shares are up slightly from a year ago off the back of improved performance and improved confidence leading to a change in our recommendation from a \u2018sell\u2019 to a \u2018hold\u2019, shares in early trading this morning have fallen by 3.4%. We maintain our \u2018hold\u2019 recommendation due to the increased likelihood of a dividend payment and the CEO\u2019s restructuring plans.\u201d Nearly 10 year ago, there were suspicions that taxpayers would never recover the tens of billions of pounds that were injected into Britain\u2019s banks as the world\u2019s financial system was shaking at its foundations. The Labour government announced the bailout of RBS, Lloyds and HBOS on 13 October 2008 - one of many dramatic days during the crisis. Prime minister Gordon Brown declared that taking stakes in the banks would create a \u2018rock of stability\u2019 to help Britain through the unfolding crisis. But George Osborne, then the shadow chancellor, warned that the financial consequences would be severe, telling parliament: But, of course, the scale of what the taxpayer is on the hook for is only just starting to dawn on the British people: this is the biggest bail out in the world so far, paid for by the biggest increase in debt by any peacetime Government and funded by the \u00a311,000 of extra borrowing that will now be heaped on every family in the country. Chancellor Alastair Darling insisted that the government would sell its shares \u2018in due course\u2019: In relation to ordinary shares, we will get a dividend when dividends are payable, and when we sell our shares the money will come back to the taxpayer. There was no suggestion then that Britain would still be a majority shareholder in RBS a decade later.... Prem Sikka, Emeritus Professor of Accounting at the University of Essex, argues that today\u2019s sale is a mistake: Fiona Cincotta, senior market analyst at City Index, fears the UK government will suffer further losses on its RBS shareholding: Even with carefully timed sales the government may not be able to regain the full sum it put into keeping the bank afloat. RBS is currently working through a turnaround plan designed to build it back up to its pre-financial crisis strength. Reuters\u2019 columnist Jamie McGeever agrees: Economist Shaun Richards pins the blame on the former Labour chancellor, Alastair Darling for bailing out RBS in 2008: The BBC\u2019s Joe Lynam flags up that RBS\u2019s shares have fallen this morning, as the government\u2019s stake hits the market. Newsflash: The British economy is showing signs of having come through the worst of its recent slowdown triggered by bad weather, as the dominant services sector grew more quickly than expected. The reading on the Markit/CIPS UK Services PMI rose to 54.0 in May from 52.8 a month earlier. Economists had forecast 53.0 on a scale where anything above 50 indicates expansion. The pound has jumped by half a percent against the US dollar to $1.337, on expectations that the Bank of England might raise interest rates in August. But growth at eurozone companies has slowed to its lowest rate in one-and-a-half years, Markit reports. More on this later.... Unless Royal Bank of Scotland\u2019s share price rallies in the next few years, Britain\u2019s taxpayers are going to suffer a massive loss on the 2008 bailout. The government still owns around 7.5 billion RBS shares. If they were all sold at today\u2019s price of 271p, it would create an additional loss of \u00a317bn compared to the 502p purchase price. If you include today\u2019s sale, and the one in 2015, and the total loss would be around \u00a320bn. But using the NAO\u2019s break-even price of 625p, the loss on our remaining RBS shares would actually be \u00a326.5bn. That\u2019s on top of the \u00a33bn loss crystallised today, and the \u00a31.9bn loss on the 2015 share sale - taking the potential loss over \u00a330bn. These are immense sums of money -- not far short of England\u2019s entire schools budget of \u00a339bn. But we need to consider the counter-factual -- what would have happened if the government had allowed RBS to fail in 2008? Alastair Darling, the then-chancellor, later revealed that RBS was about to run out of money unless he stepped in, thanks to its disastrous takeover of Dutch rival ABN Amro, and huge losses thanks to the US subprime crisis. Darling and Brown\u2019s \u00a345bn bailout may have helped avoid a major economic disaster, as Michael Hewson of CMC Markets explains: If the rest of the government stake is sold at a similar price then the total loss comes to something in the region of \u00a321bn, a sizeable loss indeed from the original \u00a345bn, but nonetheless probably needs to be measured against what the economic cost might have been if the bank had been allowed to fail. Ultimately taxpayers and politicians of whatever persuasion need to ask themselves if a \u00a32-3bn loss on this particular stake is a price worth paying for a smaller safer bank, as well as banking system, with the upside that the billions of pound it unlocks can be better used for things like the NHS, and other public services. \u2022 This block was amended on 6 June 2018 because an earlier version referred to England\u2019s school budget as that for the UK. Gordon Brown\u2019s government invested \u00a345bn into Royal Bank of Scotland to maintain financial stability following the collapse of Lehman Brothers, not in search of a quick profit. But there\u2019s no argument that RBS has proved a disappointing investment. The bank\u2019s shares haven\u2019t traded above the 502p (the taxpayers\u2019 purchase price) since 2010. And they\u2019ve never hit the NAO\u2019s 625p break-even price since the bailout was finalised at the end of 2008. Back in 2015, the government sold its first tranche of RBS shares at 330p each (creating a loss of \u00a31.9bn according to the National Audit Office). The NAO also concluded that the 2015 sale achieved value for money - and indeed, it looks like a steal compared to today\u2019s share price..... Philip Hammond is \u201cmoving to cash in his chips\u201d by selling some Royal Bank of Scotland shares before the Brexit negotiations reach their climax, says analyst Neil Wilson of Markets.com. Wilson also points out that RBS looks to be in \u2018decent shape\u2019, compared to a few years ago. Crucially, it has also settled its long-running legal problems in America (over misconduct in the run-up to the financial crisis. He explains: RBS has come a long way in recent years. From racking up c\u00a350bn in losses in ten years due in large part to mega restructuring charges and impairment charges, the bank has turned a corner. As noted a month ago, the settling of the DoJ case was key, removing the last big overhang and paving the way for the government to sell off its stock and for dividends to return. Attributable profits in the last quarter tripled to \u00a3792m, versus \u00a3259m in the same period in 2017, whilst the pre-tax operating profit was up 70% at \u00a31.2bn. The government\u2019s critics will look at these figures, and conclude that we\u2019re selling up at the wrong time. Shares in Royal Bank of Scotland have fallen by 3.3% in early trading to 271p -- matching the price which the government sold its shares this morning. The UK government is defending its decision to sell part of its RBS stake for around half the price they paid for it. Treasury Economic Secretary John Glen says it is \u2018unrealistic\u2019 to think that Britain should hold onto all its RBS shares until taxpayers can recoup their full investment in the bank. Glen told Radio 4\u2019s Today Programme that: I would love it if we could sell the shares at a much higher price, obviously, that is what everyone would like to do, but we need to be realistic and look at the market conditions. Glen argues that RBS is in a \u201cmuch healthier position\u201d than a decade ago, and that this is the right time to recover some money for taxpayers. Ross McEwan, the chief executive of RBS, is pleased that his largest shareholder has cut its stake: McEwan says: \u201cI am pleased that the government has decided the time is now right to re-start the share sale process This is an important moment for RBS and an important step in returning the bank to private ownership. It also reflects the progress we have made in building a much simpler, safer bank that is focussed on delivering for its customers and its shareholders.\u201d Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Nearly 10 years after the worst financial crisis in decades, Britain has managed to reduce its stake in Royal Bank of Scotland - but at a hefty loss. The UK government has sold 925 million RBS shares this morning, at 271p each. This lowers the taxpayers\u2019 stake in the bank from 70.1% to 62.4%, raising \u00a32.5bn for the public coffers. Chancellor Phillip Hammond has hailed the move, saying: This sale represents a significant step in returning RBS to full private ownership and putting the financial crisis behind us. The government should not be in the business of owning banks. The proceeds of this sale will go towards reducing our national debt - this is the right thing to do for taxpayers as we build an economy that is fit for the future. However, the move also crystallises a hefty loss for taxpayers. Gordon Brown\u2019s government bought its majority stake in RBS for around 502p in autumn 2008, to protect the bank from collapsing (and possibly taking the UK economy with it). So, Hammond\u2019s sale price of 271p means the UK has lost just over \u00a32bn on these shares. And the damage is arguably even worse. Last year, the National Audit Office estimated that the break-even price for an RBS share sale was 625p -- once you factor in the financing costs of acquiring the shares. By the NAO\u2019s logic, that means a loss of nearly \u00a33.3bn today! Opposition MPs are lining up to criticise today\u2019s share sale. John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, said: \u201cThere is no economic justification for this sell-off of RBS shares. There should be no sales of RBS shares, full stop. But particularly with such a large loss to the taxpayers who bailed out the bank.\u201d We\u2019ll be tracking reaction to the sale this morning.... Also coming up today: Data firm Markit is releasing its regular healthcheck on the world\u2019s services companies across the globe. Economists predict that the UK services PMI will come in at 53.4, slightly higher than April\u2019s 53.2, indicating growth accelerated a little. We also get the latest UK car registration figures - analysts predict a small rise, for the second month running.

                "bodyText":"TSB bosses faced another bruising session in front of the Treasury select committee as they were quizzed about the continuing IT meltdown which hit 1.9m of its customers. Chief executive Paul Pester said 2,200 customers had suffered fraudulent attempts to access their accounts since the IT problems first surfaced. Of these 1,300 had received compensation. Earlier FCA boss Andrew Bailey mentioned a figure of 10,600 incidents, but Pester clarified that the figure referred to alerts sent to accounts when suspicious activity was detected by the bank\u2019s systems. Pester said the bank had set up a dedicated fraud line to deal with the overwhelming number of enquiries, and waiting times were only a few minutes. But committee chair Nicky Morgan said she had received reports during the meeting of people holding on for nearly 30 minutes before hanging up. MP John Mann expressed amazement when Pester and TSB chair Richard Meddings professed ignorance of a case when someone had received a letter giving details of someone else\u2019s bank account. He also slammed the level of compensation - \u00a3100 - awarded to a constituent for their ruined wedding. With Pester profusely apologising several times during the course of the meeting, Mann said the level of compensation amounted to \u201c\u00a31 per apology\u201d. Morgan described the level of compensation as \u201cabsolutely inadequate.\u201d Overall Pester said the bank had spent \u00a370m on compensation and additional resources to cope with fixing the problems so far. He was also forced to deny he had deliberately misled the committee at its previous hearing. Mann asks if heads will roll, but Meddings says that will depend on the outcome of an investigation by Slaughter and May into the causes of the fiasco. Pester says he will not fall on his sword since he wants to fix the problems, while on the thorny question of possible golden parachutes, Meddings says if people are found to be grossly negligent that will be taken into account in the terms of their departure. The meeting ended with Nicky Morgan saying she expected the TSB executives to be called back again to update the committee on the progress in fixing the problems. On that note, it\u2019s time to close for the day. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. In her closing remarks Morgan says unfortunately the saga goes on. The FCA letter says ... TSB has not been open and transparent. The committee cannot remember such a letter from the FCA. She says, you have confirmed the IT migration has lead to people being fraudulently deprive of their money, life experiences such as weddings and house purchases ruined, the compensation is absolutely inadequate and the problems continue. This cannot be something you want, ultimately it is not only damaging to TSB but also to other banks in the sector and to online banking. Unfortunately, although we are grateful to you for your time... it did take an hour and half for you to thank your staff. I suspect we will ask you to come back again, because we will be keeping a very close eye on what is going on to put all of this right. Question: will it look at culpability of individuals and the role of the Spanish bank? Meddings says it will look at the relationship with the platform supplier. Question: what is the scope of the instructions to Slaughter and May? Medding says we can provide the terms of reference. The reason it\u2019s a law firm is that part of the terms is about the governance around the decision made to migrate. Question: how many people have switched to TSB? Pester says we have not been attracting many new customers to our current accounts. Morgan asks how much overtime are staff having to do in branches? Pester says he can\u2019t give figures. Branch transactions are taking longer than we would like. Branches are not operating normally. Morgan says some of the fraud is done with sim cards so is TSB in contact with the mobile companies? Pester says yes they have been. Morgan says there are people trying to call the fraud line and have waited 15 minutes and 27 minutes and given up. She asks when the Slaughter and May report will be published. Meddings says there is no date but they have started work. He says he hopes it\u2019s several weeks, not longer than that. But not before the summer holidays. They haven\u2019t given me a deadline date. Montes is asked if Sabadell should be paid by TSB for this failure? He says, we are quite conscious about the damage to TSB customers. We know most of it came from bad functioning of the system after migration. We have committed resources to work to a solution. There have not been any kind of discussions about payments,. There won\u2019t be until the solution is finished. Question: who was really in charge here during this process? Pester: The responsibility and decision was with the TSB board. Question: Was the timing, decision making, risk management controlled by TSB? Pester: Ultimately yes although we used a range of suppliers to opine whether we were in a position to migrate. Question: clerks here found a forum with customers complaining of receiving letters for other people. Why are you not prepared to make sure your customers are not being defrauded? Pester says he has acknowledged TSB has sent multiple letters in the same envelope. Again he apologises. Question: how many customers have left the bank? Pester: 12,500 customers have switched away, but I do not know causes. Question: how many staff have you recruited? Pester: 2,200 Question: are you paying them full overtime? Pester: yes, we are paying twice normal rate for overtime. Question: so why weren\u2019t they adequately resourced in the first place? Pester: we did increase resource before migration, but we didn\u2019t expect this level of problems. We would never have done the migration if we had known we would have these issues. Question: Payments to Sabadell for migration were delayed until completion. Why? Pester: To account for any cost overruns. Question: will the payments be made? Pester: it will depend on the report into what happened. On compensation, Pester says if people are not happy they can come back to us. He says it is easy to register a complaint. But Pester is accused of not taking on board how serious some of these problems (eg the ruined wedding) are. Question: can you give a guarantee on a minimum amount? Pester says he will write to the committee with the figures. Pester is asked about TSB\u2019s profits which he says are around \u00a3200m. He says money should not be an object for resources. Question: and should not be an object for compensation? Pester says of course not. Question: how much have you employed for resources and compensation? Pester says we have no set amount. Meddings says we will set an appropriate compensation framework. To date bank has cancelled charges worth \u00a329m. Have compensated people for fraud of \u00a311.2m, and backlog means it is probably \u00a320m year to date. Incremental resources, overtime and people, IBM etc, about another \u00a320m. Montes says the figures are consolidated into Sabadell accounts. Question. You have dealt with 24,094 complaints out of 95,063. This is not a significant number. Should you be adding more resources to address this problem? Pester says we have added 466 extra complaints handlers, over the last week. We dealt with the 24,000 before this, our aspiration is to close this down as quickly as possible. Every complaint we attempt to deal with within eight weeks of receiving it. Question: are you prepared to put in extra staff? Meddings says absolutely yes. We are adding resource as fast as it is possible to do. We have taken more people into branches and call centres, they have to be trained so we are bringing on resources and will continue to do so. Question: the compensation figures are extraordinarily small. Will anyone who is forced out get golden parachutes? Meddings says we will look at conclusions, take necessary action. It will depend on outcome and nature of the fault. If they are found to have been grossly negligent that will be taken into account in the terms of their departure. Question about the letters written by TSB to direct debit companies when customers wanted to switch, saying customers had died. Pester says there were 370 people affected and caused by an error in the software. Pester says they are speaking to the customers\u2019 new banks to contact customers and offer them compensation. Pester says they are correcting the error with the direct debit companies. Morgan says you talk about things being resolved but they may not be resolved to the satisfaction of the customers. Mann says you are in breach of data protection law, you are paying pitiful levels of compensation which I find deeply disturbing, you pay yourselves massive amounts of money. Can we be certain some heads are going to roll? Meddings says it would be wrong to prejudge. But depending on what investigation we will take action. Mann asks them - especially Pester - if they will fall on their swords before they are pushed. Pester says his focus is on fixing this for customers, I am passionate about TSB, I don\u2019t think anyone else will be as committed as me, when we get to end of this procedure we will see. Mann says where is the leadership? Meddings says senior seats carry responsibility and we have chosen these seats. It\u2019s important to establish what went wrong and where there is culpability we will act on it. Mann asks how many heads will roll? Meddings says it is important not to prejudge. Slaughter and May are conducting an independent review, we will publish it and take action on the basis of its findings. If I am found to be culpable then the actions will attach to me. John Mann asks how could one of his constituents receive someone else\u2019s details. Pester says he apologies. I don\u2019t know how it happened, I don\u2019t know the circumstances. It\u2019s not something we do intentionally. Mann asks Meddings the same question. Meddings says I can\u2019t answer without knowing details. Mann asks if this an ongong problem. Pester said he is not aware of it. Mann says his constituent wrote to TSB and heard nothing back. You\u2019re saying you\u2019re not aware and that\u2019s astonishing. I\u2019m struggling that you\u2019re even aware of the problem. Mann asks about a constituent whose wedding was ruined and how much she received. Meddings says she has been compensated but can\u2019t say how much. But it would compensate for distress. Mann says it\u2019s \u00a3100. [Silence] Medding says he apologises. Mann says its \u00a31 per apology in this session. Mann now asks why Sabadell chief operating officer Miguel Montes is still in his job. Montes also apologies, and admits not all problems have been solved. Mann asks how embarrassed is he that his bank\u2019s reputation has been sullied by people who don\u2019t know how people received other people\u2019s details. Montes says, we are very embarrassed. Mann: How embarrassed are you about the level of compensation for someone who\u2019s wedding has been ruined? Montes: I have no competence to answer this question. Mann: Do you have confidence in working with people who don\u2019t bother compensating someone when it\u2019s raised in parliamentary committee. Is that good for your brand reputation. Montes: our brand reputation has been damaged. We have worked night and day, we have progress but not enough. Paul and his team have been clear we will do whatever it takes to compensate customers. Mann says Meddings reputation is on the line as well. How long will this take? Meddings says, we are working vigilantly. We are digging ourselves out of a hole. We have challenges with the call lines, and occasionally in the branches. Mann says the branches are bailing you out, and you have put the call centre staff in a difficult situation. Meddings thanks the bank\u2019s staff for having to deal with the situation. Question: The FCA has never written such a letter. Do you accept you should take more personal responsibility. Pester says, I am taking complete and utter responsibility.. All I can do is focus on fixing the situation. Question: Many on the committee believe you have misled the committee. Pesters says, I\u2019m sorry if you feel that, I have given the best information I had. Morgan says in a letter on 25 April you wrote everything it running smoothly for vast majority of customers. FCA said this was an example of poor communication. Do you regret that phrase? Pester apologies if he misled anyone. The use of that phrase was to show credit card, debit payments [etc] key parts were working well but we had serious problems with customer access. He says we have tried to communicate as well as we can. Question about whether Pester made confusing statement about IBM\u2019s role. Are IBM doing a full review or are they there just to help the situation? Pestere says they are there to help us fix problems, then perform a review to help us understand how this could have occurred. I apologise for my loose use of wording. Question: this is not the only loose use of wording. You said it was middlewear but it was more than this and you seem to know this from the IBM slides. Pester said the IBM findings are early findings and observations and say most of the problems are related to the applications, middleware and network ather than the underlying infrastructure. I tried to explain this in the first session. [Pester is asked to hand over the slides and does so.] Question: The FCA reminded TSB that communications should be fair and not misleading. Do you accept you misled customers and the committee. Pester says he does not accept he misled committee. The FCA did ask TSB to change and improve communications on 25 April. We did that a day later, and then the FCA said our communications were excellent. Question: Bailey wrote on 30 May and said the TSB\u2019s use of figures risked giving too positive a view. Do you accept he feels you have not been frank? Pester says Bailey also said there is no reason to believe TSB has made misleading statements and I apologise if you think. Question: This is your MO, you\u2019re saying its not that bad. This infuriates everyone, people feel they are being misled. Pester says this is not my intent. I\u2019m apologetic if you feel I\u2019m trying to spin the information. Question: Bailey says your quoting of averages is misleading. Pester says he\u2019s sorry if he appears to be unhelpful but he is telling the facts as he sees them. Question: In how many cases since the migration, when there has been an investi of the customer being liable, has there been a delay in compensation. Pester says we said we are not challenging or investigating customers as we created the uncertainty. To the best of my knowledge the answer is zero. MPs are giving more examples of customers suffering problems. Pester apologises if he gave the impression he was downplaying the seriousness of the problems facing the bank. He also says he is sorry if the committee thinks he is not keeping his customers up to date. Question: Either you knew about the scale of the issues with the fraud line [at the time of the previous committee session] and you didn\u2019t tell us or you didn\u2019t know there was a serious problem with fraud line. Pester says I told you the information I had at the time. Question: Banks should refund by the end of the following day when there is fraud. Has TSB done that? Pester admits TSB has not done that. Morgan talks about a self employed printer who wanted to access his money. He talks to TSB, gets another call from a mobile, is advised to talk to the person on the mobile. Then he thinks he\u2019s been defrauded, finds \u00a324,550 been taken from his account and TSB say he does not know how long it will be to get his money back. He has problems contacting TSB, finally gets his money back, changes account. Then he gets a letter, saying TSB is not at fault, and it offered \u00a3192. Is that a fair outcome. Pester says the details are distressing and I apologise. We will of course look at this case, and address them. He was caught up in that attack, I would like to take his case further. Chairman Richard Meddings also apologies, says its difficult to comment on whether the payments are sufficient. They don\u2019t necessarily seem to be a correct calculation, but we are attempting to set a framework of compensations taking into account stress and consequential loss. Morgan says the more important point, and where TSB is tone deaf, where the letter suggests customer has to prove the point. Meddings says, I get your point. When fraudsters raid accounts, banks can says customers are negligent but we are trying to compensate in full without asking about liability. Morgan says during last hearing, the TSB twitter account said fraud lines were experiencing higher than usual levels. If twitter knew that why didn\u2019t you? Pester apologies (again!) and says the number he gave in good faith was the number he had at the time. Morgan says does TSB deserve nickname of Terribly Shambolic Bank? Pester says this whole situation has been a terrible situation for TSB customers. All I can do is work hard to fix this situation. Morgan says Pester had said in a letter yesterday that between 23 April to 31 May, some 2,200 TSB customers had experienced attempts to access their accounts and 1300 suffered financial loss. But the FCA mentioned 10,000 incidents. For some customers this is not happening once but several times. Isn\u2019t it typical that every time TSB is asked, you try to be clever with the numbers. Pester says he\u2019s sorry if that seems to be the case. The FCA number refers to alerts on accounts, pointing out unusual transaction patterns, which trigger text messages to see if they are genuine. If we don\u2019t hear we block the accounts until we are able to speak to the customer. The 2,200 number is number of customers who had attempts to defraud. Morgan says how many fraud incidents where people had money taken out of their accounts were there? Pester says 1300 had money taken out of their account by fraudsters, and we have refunded them. Morgan points out Pester said at the last hearing that people were waiting only three minutes on the fraud line. Pester says at the last meeting we had not been subject to fraud attacks at that level, it started on the first bank holiday in May, peaked on 15 May, then came under control since. At first meeting we were not subject to those levels of attack. That was the true statement of the situation at the time. I am sorry if I appear to have been unforthright in evidence. Pester says the system tracking fraud still blocks accounts if it detects unusual patterns etc, so there are other ways than just customer reporting fraud. Morgan says fraud system hasn\u2019t been working properly though. Pester says the volume of attacks were 70 times the normal level of attacks. That overwhelmed TSB. So we put in a dedicated line. Fraud is a terrible experience. That fraud line has a two to three minute wait time. I apologise profusely to those customers who have suffered fraud. Pester says it is still the same team, but we recruited more partners so we could respond more quickly. Morgan asks how long people have waited over recent weeks. Pester says it is a priority line so it is a matter of minutes. We have tightened up our fraud defences, and now volume is two or three times normal level. Morgan says people are talking about waiting for hours. Pester says that was before the new line. He apologises again and says it was unacceptable. The level of fraud was unprecedented. But Morgan says in your planning you anticipated an increase in fraudulent activity, so it wasn\u2019t unprecedented. Pester says sadly yes, we had our teams on high intensity when we migrated but it was higher than expected. I have been shocked to read of customers waiting five, seven, nine hours. When I saw that I said we had to fix this. Putting a new line in was very important. Now TSB are up and Nicky Morgan begins with the issue of fraud. Question: Have conditions create a spate of fraudulent activity? Pester says he regrets but the situation gave an opportunity for fraudsters to target customers. Morgan says they have to phone a dedicated fraud line, and is the route to get compensation. Pester agrees but they says customers can report fraud to branches or online, but there is a dedicated line. Ultimately though it all ends up with fraud team. The FCA session ends on that note. John Mann ask who should be held to account? Bailey says that\u2019s the purpose of the investigation. But at the moment the most important thing is to dig out of hole. Mann says will you use the full range of your powers? Bailey says we will use the powers. Question: The last IT meltdown was Co-op. How many other banks are at similar risks with antiquated IT systems? Bailey says there are major IT changes going on most weekends in the banking systems. This year in particular there has been ringfencing. In this case it was a complete replatforming, from the Lloyds sytems to a new one. Most institutions are operating on systems which have evolved over years. [In terms of risk for other banks] Bailey says he hopes not but you never know. There is a lot still to learn about this one, he says. What would it take for us to observe this in a way TSB management did not, what level of intrusion would be needed? We were involved in the Visa incident, that was a hardware failure. We seek to learn but can\u2019t give an assurance these things will never happen again. Question: Will you set out what minimum compensation should be? Bailey says we will want to see how they set it up and calibrate it. There should be a minimum standard below which compensation applies. Services have not been affected evenly, this is one of the problems. Bailey is told the FCA should set down the law otherwise people will not have confidence, especially given the problems small businesses have faced with banks, especially GRG. Bailey says he hopes they appreciate how much the FCA has been involved with TSB. He says the FCA put a team on site very quickly. Question: TSB have appointed Deloitte to look at compensation, how is it going? Bailey says we are pleased they have brought in outside resources, they have been overwhelmed. They are taking it seriously but we want to see it up and running. Howard says they are recruiting staff to deal with compensation. They have started to resolve and settle complaints. Bailey says this should happen quite quickly, it is not very complex. The timeline is short in terms of when things went wrong. Question: In some cases when customers asked to switch, bank has written to some of their direct debit accounts saying they had died, are you aware of this? Bailey says that is another example of putting in a fix in to solve a problem and another part sends out a letter. Don\u2019t think they did that intentionally. Question: Does it undermine the system if people see this happening and are reluctant to switch. Bailey says longer term we will have to see the level of switching and if it is happening effectively. Question: are you confident no other banks do this? Bailey says I think we would know that. Sutherland says it\u2019s a TSB issue. Question: Who controlled the timing of migration of IT systems {TSB or parent company?] Bailey says that will be a major part of the investigation. It was utilising [parent company] Sabadell\u2019s platform but the responsibility rests with TSB managment... But this can\u2019t descend into finger pointing [between TSB and Sabadell] On the question of accountability, Bailey says in this case there is a relationship with an outsourcer (in this case part of the parent company). You can\u2019t outsource responsibility, and it rests with the management of the TSB. Question: have TSB now got it right? Bailey says they have improved considerably. The days of the rather generalised and rosy statements, we haven\u2019t seen them so often. But it is still important, there are a lot of things going wrong in branches, quite basis and important things. These things still need fixing and it will take time. Question: were your expectations on communications reflected in Pester\u2019s testimony. Bailey says it should have been a more thorough and balances communications situation. My bias would be tell it as it is and communicate extensively. Question: have you ever issued a letter quite like this before, including saying Pester was too optimistic and statements to the public were poor? Bailey says we don\u2019t have these situations too often. Some parts of the bank\u2019s service are functioning, and it\u2019s fair enough to point that out but there is a danger of overemphasis of that which gets away from the fact there are parts that are troubled. Sutherland says they have a torrid time with the branch systems, leading to very busy branches. It\u2019s quite clear those systems problems still exist. It\u2019s the bits that are not working we are not hearing so much about. Here\u2019s what FCA chief Andrew Bailey told MPs about the fraud attempts on TSB customers (at 2.40pm) I\u201dm going to be a little bit circumspect about what we say about fraud\u2026as we don\u2019t want to give information that fraudsters could use against the firm. We think there\u2019s been just over 10,000, 10,600, incidents, and that has resulted in a level of payout. FCA special advisor John Sutherland then explained how the number of \u2018alerts\u2019 of possible fraud are still rising. These alerts lead to customer accounts being blocked or stopped while the situation is investigated - but TSB is struggling to cope. Sutherland said: \u201cTSB is resourcing up to clear those alerts as soon as they can, but they are still on an upward trend. That doesn\u2019t indicate so much that there is an increasing amount of fraud, it\u2019s just that they not resourcing themselves yet to clear them fast enough. Sutherland then talked about the \u201chuge variability\u201d in TSB\u2019s ability to handle calls from customers who may have been defrauded, with just one in 10 getting through at the busiest times. Clearly that\u2019s not acceptable. Question: Do you feel TSB has adhered to the requirements on communcating the situation. Bailey says we have had some frank conversations about communications, and we said in our letter we were not satisfied. There is an onus of overcommunication, to tell customers what is happening. There is uncertainty at the start about what the situation is. Looking at the daily service levels, they were very volatile. Looking at averages doesn\u2019t give the entire picture. There should have been more communication and it needed to be more reflective of the fact it was a volatile and uncertain situation. Its not easy to communicate volatile. But otherwise you see a lot of criticism from customers. A more straightforward recognition of what the situation was would have been helpful. Has TSB always co-operated? Bailey says yes, they are working very hard, I do not want to call into question their hard work. They are in a hole and they are trying to get out of it. That is not the issue. The issue is how did you get in and how do you get out of it and protect the interests of customers. Bailey is asked about the suggestion that TSB chief executive Paul Pester had some information including slides from IBM which he did not share with the previous hearing. Bailey says IBM were brought in on the Wednesday, by the following Sunday they had produced slides of the issues. We saw those on Sunday, the hearing followed on Wednesday. They are not definitive but they do point to things. At the hearings, Pester said IBM believe issues are in the middleware. But it appears to be not just in the middleware, which the IBM slides show. Question: where are we in timeline for having a coherent plan for the recovery of services? Sutherland says there is a rolling fortnight forward plan for fixing faults in IT, but we haven\u2019t seen a plan for getting back to where we were before migration. Bailey says one of the reasons they brought IBM in was they didn\u2019t have that plan, IBM are helping put that plan in. Question: does TSB understand the problems, and have the root causes been found? Bailey says the understanding of the problem has evolved over time. It is still evolving, I do not regard that as particularly negligent. The rate of emerging faults is falling off, as you would expect. It would be wrong to speculate [about our investigation] but testing will be one of the key questions. How robust and rigorous was it. They have put a fix in, and something else happens elsewhere in the architecture, and messages are sent to customers which shouldn\u2019t be. So that gets back to testing. Question: when was FCA first told about the TSB problems? Bailey says the first warning that the FCA got was on the Sunday evening, we were notified at one minute to nine o\u2019clock. They were going live at 6 o\u2019clock, they first identified problems at 6.20. We heard just before 9,. we had the first call just around midnight. The FCA response was activated the next day. Morgan says FCA says they had not met standard for repaying fraud, why was that? Bailey says they were initially overwhelmed. The FCA\u2019s Sheree Howard says, they have now prioritised that. Morgan says is there a pattern of TSB trying to argue the case before refunding. The FCA says no. Nicky Morgan, chair of the Treasury committee, says one in ten fraud-related calls being answered is not up to FCA standards, and the FCA agrees. TSB set up a dedicated fraud line, with the idea that customers would be able to get through more quickly. People can use either line. Sutherland said the fraud problem didn\u2019t come up in the first ten days. Bailey is asked about fraud but says he will be circumspect. He says there have been around 10,600 incidents, which have resulted in a level of payout. The FSA\u2019s John Sutherland is talking about TSB being alerted to the prospect of fraud, which could lead to customers\u2019 accounts been locked. These are still on an upward trend, as TSB is not resourcing themselves. There is a huge variability between one in ten calls answered to practically all, depending on time of time. This has led to customers complaining about how long they have been waiting. The TSB session has begun, with the Financial Conduct Authority underway. Chief executive Andrew Bailey says they have had a full time presence at TSB for some time but they have scaled that back a little now. A reminder. The parliamentary session on the TSB problems can be seen live here, due to start in less than ten minutes. First up is the Financial Conduct Authority\u2019s chief executive Andrew Bailey and two of his colleagues. The FCA has issued a strong criticism of the performance of TSB and its chief executive Paul Pester over the IT fiasco. Meanwhile Pester and his team will be quizzed separately once the Treasury Committee is finished with the FCA. TSB\u2019s troubles shine a spotlight on the problems facing much of the banking sector, says professor Pinar Ozcan of Warwick Business School, that is, outdated technology: Many established banks\u2019 complicated and siloed IT infrastructures, which were built in the 1970s, make it difficult for them to form a platform that would make sense of the data that is currently stored in a disorganised and non-standard way in separate databases. Banks typically have vertically integrated pillars, which are all for different products and which don\u2019t really talk to one another. That\u2019s why, when you call your bank for something, they sometimes tell you, we\u2019ve got great rates for a mortgage, and you say, \u2018but I actually have a mortgage with you\u2019! The recent troubles at TSB provide a great example of a nightmare scenario that can arise as banks update their legacy IT systems. And this is a chicken and egg problem in that in order to avoid security breaches like in the case of TSB, banks have been avoiding major overhauls of their systems, but of course, the more they stay in avoidance mode, the less they will be able to provide digital platforms that make sense of data and offer competitive services. The parliamentary session on TSB\u2019s IT problems kicks off off in 30 minutes, so here\u2019s a quick reminder/preamble. The Treasury committee is holding its second hearing into the TSB IT meltdown. MPs will demand answers about the problems that prevented millions of TSB customers from accessing their accounts in recent weeks - and which still aren\u2019t fully fixed. MPs will hear from CEO Paul Pester at 3.30pm. Pester has been accused of complacency last month for not grasping the full extent of the disruption. The Financial Conduct Authority has put more pressure on Pester. The FCA has told MPs suggesting that he was too optimistic about the situation and didn\u2019t give MPs a proper account four weeks ago. The FCA\u2019s chief executive, Andrew Bailey, will give his assessment of the situation at 2.30pm Treasury committee chair Nicky Morgan has said she\u2019s very concerned about the communication failures at TSB. Labour shadow City minister Jonathan Reynolds has accused the bank of serious failings. Some TSB customers continue to report problems accessing services, and some are struggling to getting through to the bank to report problems..... After widespread condemnation, the boss of Qatar Airways has apologised for saying only a man could do his job because it\u2019s such a tricky job. Akbar Al Baker has now backtracked, claiming he is committed to gender equality and blaming the media for \u2018sensationalising\u2019 his comments. Frankly I\u2019m not sure they needed sensationalising. If you missed the story, Al Baker declared that: \u201cOf course, it [Qatar Airways] has to be led by a man, because it is a very challenging position.\u201d More here. Peter Praet has also hit eurozone bonds. Bond prices are down, sending yields (interest rates up), following Praet\u2019s hint that the European Central Bank could decide to stop its asset-purchase programme soon. Praet\u2019s comments suggest the ECB isn\u2019t panicking about the new populist government in Italy. Kit Juckes of Societe Generale says: Everyone in Europe seems to be in a terrific rush at the moment. Italian political developments continue at a rapid pace as the new Government flexes muscles and outlines it strategy. The ECB, widely assumed to be in ait-and-see mode, reluctant to rush towards policy normalisation until the BTP [Italian bond] market, at least, calms down, is also in too much of a hurry for such niceties. Back in the markets, the euro is rallying after a senior policymaker hinted that the European Central Bank could wind down its bond-buying stimulus programme soon. ECB chief economist Peter Praet told a conference in Berlin this morning that the governing council will debate whether to gradually unwind bond purchases at its meeting next week. Praet cited the (long-awaited) recovery in Europe\u2019s labour market; the Eurozone unemployment rate fell to 8.5 percent in April, a 10-year low. That should push inflationary pressures higher, and give the ECB confidence to rein in its money-printing scheme. The ECB\u2019s is currently committed to buying \u20ac30bn of eurozone government bonds each month with newly created money, until at least September. Praet\u2019s comments suggest that the ECB will discuss ending QE in three months, although a final decision might not come until July\u2019s meeting. The euro has jumped by half a cent against the US dollar to $1.177, a two-week high. The Labour party have added their voice to the chorus of criticism of TSB. Jonathan Reynolds MP, Labour\u2019s Shadow City Minister, says: \u201cIt is deeply worrying that one month on from these issues, some TSB customers are still having difficulties. Labour echo the concerns of the FCA that communications have simply not been good enough. \u201cThere has plainly been a serious failure here, both in contingency preparations for a meltdown and in assuring an adequate level of customer communication.\u201d TSB\u2019s problems worsened last week when the bank sent letters of apology to the wrong customers. Some of the letters included other people\u2019s names, addresses and customer reference numbers. That means they could breach Britain\u2019s new data privacy laws, the General Data Protection Regulation. Andy Barratt, UK managing director of cyber security consultancy Coalfire, thinks TSB could be fined by the Information Commissioner for the breach. The ICO was also concerned that hundreds of TSB customers saw the wrong account details in the hours after April\u2019s migration. Barratt explains: \u201cThe apology letter glitch is the latest development in this ongoing TSB saga. MPs are clearly taking this issue seriously but, crucially, we\u2019re yet to see the ICO weigh in following its own investigations. The regulator will be particularly concerned that \u2018data breaches\u2019 of this magnitude have now happened more than once \u2013 both immediately before and then again after the implementation of GDPR. \u201cThe power to hand out major fines that GDPR affords the regulator means that the price of poor data protection is about to become far easier to quantify. TSB customers are still reporting problems accessing their accounts to the bank\u2019s social media unit, six weeks after the IT problems began. Many are saying they can\u2019t get through to TSB\u2019s telephone helplines.... Others report that they can\u2019t see their accounts online, or make certain payments. The Financial Conduct Authority appears to have put Paul Pester in a real spot, by accusing him of being too optimistic about the state of TSB\u2019s tech problems. If the Treasury committee feel Pester wasn\u2019t straight with them last month, they could put him under serious pressure. Pester has already given up one bonus - for completing the IT migration. Could his job be at risk? The Times\u2019s banking editor, Katherine Griffiths, suggests TSB may needed to be rebranded as Sabadell (the Spanish company which bought TSB in 2015). But Pester might not oversee such a change, if he finds himself \u201cup against the wall\u201d over his handling of the crisis, she adds. The BBC\u2019s Kevin Peachey agrees that the FCA\u2019s public criticism of a serving bank boss is pretty rare: MoneySavingExpert have put together a few questions for Paul Pester to answer at today\u2019s hearing: The number of customers that have been affected by the online and mobile banking problems and the number that are still facing problems. The number of customers that have lost money to fraudsters, whether TSB feels that after this event its account security processes are still sufficient, and the steps that are being taken to improve this. The number of customers that have switched away from the bank, and how many have reported problems - for example, being unable to switch or cancelled direct debits after switching. The minimum amount of money affected TSB customers can expect to be paid as compensation for their loss and inconvenience \u2013 this needs to be more specific than \u2018on a case-by-case basis\u2019. How will it let people proactively know what they are due? The number of complaints the bank has received from customers, the number that have now been resolved, and the average wait time these customers have experienced, both when ringing the phone lines and overall before their complaint is resolved. When TSB expects the IT problems to be fully fixed \u2013 if a date cannot be given, why not? The Treasury committee\u2019s first hearing into the TSB crisis, last month, was a very bruising experience. MPs lost patience with the bank as Paul Pester repeatedly argued that much of the IT migration had gone well (even if customers couldn\u2019t actually access their accounts). Nicky Morgan eventually let rip, telling Pester he was a \u201cstaggering example of a chief executive who seems unwilling to acknowledge the scale of the problem\u201d. Here\u2019s a clip from the May 2nd hearing: TSB is still suffering problems, more than six weeks after the ill-fated migration from its former owner Lloyds to its current owned Sabadell. The bank\u2019s service status page warns that some customers are still having issues logging into internet banking, or having difficulties making payments. Also, some Direct Debit payments weren\u2019t taken for TSB credit card customers this month. TSB also admits that some customers calling Telephone Banking are experiencing long wait times, and that its branches are busier than usual too. Nicky Morgan MP, the chair of the Treasury Committee, has piled more pressure on Paul Pester ahead of this afternoon\u2019s interrogation. Morgan says she is \u201cdeeply concerned by TSB\u2019s poor communications\u201d over its IT problems. Last week, the Financial Conduct Authority told the Committee it is \u2018dissatisfied\u2019 with TSB\u2019s communications with its customers. For example, FCA chief Andrew Bailey says that TSB claimed that \u201cthe vast majority\u201d of customers could access their online account, when in reality only 50% could successfully log in the first time they tried. That\u2019s one reason Bailey is accusing Pester of giving an \u201coptimistic\u201d view of the situation when he faced MPs last month, rather than a \u201cmore rounded view\u201d of the problems suffered by customers. Morgan says this isn\u2019t acceptable: \u201cThe regulator does not make such criticisms lightly. I am deeply concerned by TSB\u2019s poor communications about the scale and nature of the problems it has faced; by its response to customer fraud; and by the quality and accuracy of the oral and written evidence provided by Dr Pester to the Committee. \u201cThe Committee will discuss Mr Bailey\u2019s letter, and the ongoing problems faced by TSB customers, when it sees Dr Pester and other TSB Board members, as well as the FCA, on Wednesday.\u201d Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. The beleaguered boss of UK bank TSB is being hauled back to parliament today to face fresh questioning over the IT meltdown that left millions locked out of their accounts. Paul Pester is in the firing line over his handling of the crisis, and can expect plenty of criticism and tough questions from MPs on the Treasury Committee. Last month, the committee accused Pester of being \u2018extraordinary complacent\u2019 over the botched migration to a new technology platform, so today\u2019s session could intensify the pressure. TSB\u2019s IT crisis is one of the worst to have hit a bank ever - customers found they couldn\u2019t log on via their computer or mobile phones, small businesses were unable to pay staff, and some householders found their mortgages had disappeared. Cybercriminals have been taking advantage too, with reports that some TSB customers are falling victim to fraud. Overnight, the Financial Conduct Authority - the City\u2019s watchdog - has confirmed it is investigating the issue. Andrew Bailey, chief executive of the FCA, says: \u201cWe do not normally make this information public, but, given the level of public interest, I want to be clear that we will be conducting this work.\u201d The FCA has also put Pester in the firing line, accusing him of failing to come clean about TSB\u2019s problems. My colleague Angela Monaghan explains: The City regulator has launched a stinging attack on the chief executive of TSB over the bank\u2019s failure to be open and transparent with customers when an IT upgrade went badly wrong, locking as many as 1.9 million customers out of their accounts. The Financial Conduct Authority accused Paul Pester of \u201cportraying an optimistic view\u201d of services after the botched operation in April that is still causing disruption for customers more than a month on. \u201cThe FCA has been dissatisfied with TSB\u2019s communications with its customers and we have had concerns that TSB was not being open and transparent about the issues experienced,\u201d Andrew Bailey, the FCA\u2019s chief executive, said in a letter to the Commons Treasury committee. In particular, the FCA think that Pester could have given MPs more information about the crisis when he initially testified on May 2nd. They believe he may have had useful information from the tech experts at IBM who have been trying to fix the problems. The session kicks off at 2.30pm, when the Treasury committee will hear from the FCA. They\u2019ll then question Pester, along with TSB chairman Richard Meddings and Miguel Montes of parent company Sabadell Group. Also coming up today More European stock markets are rising in early trading, after America\u2019s tech-focused Nasdaq index hit a record high last night. Jasper Lawler of London Capital Group explains: Tech stock were once again responsible for any excitement on Wall Street. Netflix and Amazon jumping 1.9% and 1.1% respectively boosted the Nasdaq to close at a record high at 7637. This is the second straight session where tech stocks have been under the spotlight and we are seeing a lot of positive news surrounding the sector, Microsoft buying GitHub, Apple pushing new software and Amazon sales flying, when everything else in the market is looking a little drab. On the economics front, Australia\u2019s growth rate has picked thanks to booming demand for commodities: The agenda: 2.30pm BST: FCA testify to the Treasury committee on the TSB IT crisis 3.30pm BST: TSB bosses testify to the Treasury committee",

Meanwhile evidence of rising demand came from the weekly US figures, which saw a 5.9m barrel decline, the biggest drop since mid-January. On the other hand there was a 3.3m barrel rise in gasoline stocks compared to expectations of a 1m fall.</p> <p>Brent is currently up 0.19% at $75.22 a barrel. Joshua Mahony, market analyst at IG, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Crude oil is also in focus, with a whole raft of comments coming from OPEC member states ahead of Friday\u2019s big production decision. Despite an initial rebuttal of a production increase proposed by Russia (via Saudi Arabia), we are seeing a gradual shift in tone which will likely see some form of rise in output come Friday.</p> <p>For markets, the line in the sand seems to be the 1 million barrels a day level. Anything less than that will be seen as a compromise given the Saudi target is closer to 1.5 million barrels a day. We have seen the biggest drawdown in US crude inventories since January, but the impact has been offset by a rise in gasoline supply.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5b2a72c3e4b06f2cac880075\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-06-20T15:29:23.616Z\">4.29pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Here\u2019s our first take on the David Drumm sentencing:</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/jun/20/david-drumm-former-chief-of-anglo-irish-bank-sentenced-to-eight-years-in-jail\">David Drumm, former chief of Anglo Irish Bank, sentenced to eight years in jail</a> </p> </aside> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5b2a7115e4b06f2cac880056\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-06-20T15:22:57.727Z\">4.22pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Back with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2018/jun/20/china-trump-trade-war-fears-grow-uk-factories-business-live?page=with:block-5b2a4196e4b06f2cac87fd7e#block-5b2a4196e4b06f2cac87fd7e\">the Anglo Irish case </a> and former chief executive David Drumm has been sentenced to eight years in jail for his part in the fraud, but will serve six with mitigating circumstances taken into account. </p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5b2a64d4e4b06f2cac87ff9b\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-06-20T14:30:44.506Z\">3.30pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Investor enthusiasm appears to be waning, with markets coming off their best levels. Connor Campbell, market analyst at Spreadex, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The Dow Jones, which at one point looked like it was going to reclaim 150 points, ended up starting the US session flat, the wrong side of 24700. There was little for the index to really work with on Wednesday, beyond the ever-looming threat of a full-blown trade war between the world\u2019s two largest economies. </p> <p>The Eurozone, which started the week poorly and then went downhill from there, saw its initial tame recovery gradually chipped away at until nothing was left. That means the DAX is back struggling to keep its head above 12700, while the CAC tumbled below 5400 after switching from a 0.3% rise to a 0.2% loss. </p> <p>Only the FTSE remained in the green with any real substance, and even then its 0.6% increase was half of the growth posted at lunchtime. Though the UK index broadly just followed the direction of trading from around the Western world, sterling\u2019s reversal of its initial losses also helped erase some of the FTSE\u2019s gains. The pound rose 0.1% against the dollar and the euro \u2013 granted, not a lot in the context of its recent performance \u2013 as the government appeared to come to a compromise over the \u2018meaningful vote\u2019 issue, but couldn\u2019t gain any more momentum thanks to Thursday\u2019s impending Bank of England meeting.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5b2a6436e4b02fa070a1666e\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-06-20T14:28:15.360Z\">3.28pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>US commerce secretary Wilbur Ross has been speaking about the trade dispute with China.

This beats Comcast\u2019s $35 all-cash, $65bn bid but we must assume that Comcast is ready to come back with an even stronger offer.</p> <p>This offer from Disney is probably a little bit stronger than expected and [Disney\u2019s] Iger will be looking to kill off Comcast\u2019s bid once and for all. However, the rationale for Comcast remains the same, the question is only how much debt it can afford to carry. If it gets its way total debt would rise to $170bn according to Moody\u2019s, with just $6bn in cash on its books. Disney will also take on Fox\u2019s $14bn debts, giving this bid an enterprise value of more than $85bn. </p> <p>Debt is a concern for investors here and points to market-top behaviour. The amount of debt both companies are prepared to assume is arguably a worry, but it\u2019s a case of innovate or die in the face of competition. It\u2019s a sign of just how desperately these two legacy media groups want the assets of Fox. In their attempt to contend with cord cutters like Netflix they are risking leveraging themselves up to a degree that makes them susceptible should the current benign market conditions deteriorate. </p> <p>Sky shares are trading up 3% today at \u00a313.82 on the news but they could go higher if Comcast really goes big. Even it doesn\u2019t have the appetite for all of Fox it could settle to swoop for Sky only and bag those important European subscription revs.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5b2a5700e4b06f2cac87fea7\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-06-20T13:35:01.055Z\">2.35pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Wall Street opens higher</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>US markets have joined in the generally positive mood after the week\u2019s sell-offs as trade tensions between the US and China escalated.</p> <p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 80 points or 0.33%, while the S&amp;P 500 opened up 0.325 and the Nasdaq Composite 0.5% better.</p> <p>But General Electric shares are down after the group was pushed out of the 30 share Dow after more than a century.

                "bodyText":"The prospect of a trade war between the US and China has put markets under pressure this week, and although there was some recovery today, it was by no means convincing. As well as continuing uncertainty over the effect of the proposed tariffs, oil prices were volatile ahead of this week\u2019s Opec meeting. Meanwhile the pound edged a little higher after the UK government won a key Brexit vote. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished up 23.55 points or 0.31% at 7627.40 Germany\u2019s Dax added 0.14% to 12,695.16 France\u2019s Cac closed down 0.34% at 5372.31 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB added 0.16% to 22,120.58 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended up 0.34% to 9788.9 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down around 10 points or 0.05%. On that note, it\u2019s time to close for the day. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. It\u2019s been a pretty volatile day for stock markets, as well as crude. And the pound has not been left out. From a low of $1.3149 against the dollar it hit a high of $1.3215 after the UK government won a key Brexit vote. It is currently at $1.3206, up 0.21%. Our politics live blog has all the latest details on the government\u2019s narrow success in seeing off a potential rebellion: Oil prices are edging higher ahead of the key Opec meeting which begins on Thursday and following a bigger than expected fall in US crude stocks. The oil producers are expected to agree to increase output but the key question is by how much. Meanwhile evidence of rising demand came from the weekly US figures, which saw a 5.9m barrel decline, the biggest drop since mid-January. On the other hand there was a 3.3m barrel rise in gasoline stocks compared to expectations of a 1m fall. Brent is currently up 0.19% at $75.22 a barrel. Joshua Mahony, market analyst at IG, said: Crude oil is also in focus, with a whole raft of comments coming from OPEC member states ahead of Friday\u2019s big production decision. Despite an initial rebuttal of a production increase proposed by Russia (via Saudi Arabia), we are seeing a gradual shift in tone which will likely see some form of rise in output come Friday. For markets, the line in the sand seems to be the 1 million barrels a day level. Anything less than that will be seen as a compromise given the Saudi target is closer to 1.5 million barrels a day. We have seen the biggest drawdown in US crude inventories since January, but the impact has been offset by a rise in gasoline supply. Here\u2019s our first take on the David Drumm sentencing: Back with the Anglo Irish case and former chief executive David Drumm has been sentenced to eight years in jail for his part in the fraud, but will serve six with mitigating circumstances taken into account. Investor enthusiasm appears to be waning, with markets coming off their best levels. Connor Campbell, market analyst at Spreadex, said: The Dow Jones, which at one point looked like it was going to reclaim 150 points, ended up starting the US session flat, the wrong side of 24700. There was little for the index to really work with on Wednesday, beyond the ever-looming threat of a full-blown trade war between the world\u2019s two largest economies. The Eurozone, which started the week poorly and then went downhill from there, saw its initial tame recovery gradually chipped away at until nothing was left. That means the DAX is back struggling to keep its head above 12700, while the CAC tumbled below 5400 after switching from a 0.3% rise to a 0.2% loss. Only the FTSE remained in the green with any real substance, and even then its 0.6% increase was half of the growth posted at lunchtime. Though the UK index broadly just followed the direction of trading from around the Western world, sterling\u2019s reversal of its initial losses also helped erase some of the FTSE\u2019s gains. The pound rose 0.1% against the dollar and the euro \u2013 granted, not a lot in the context of its recent performance \u2013 as the government appeared to come to a compromise over the \u2018meaningful vote\u2019 issue, but couldn\u2019t gain any more momentum thanks to Thursday\u2019s impending Bank of England meeting. US commerce secretary Wilbur Ross has been speaking about the trade dispute with China. He says President Trump\u2019s strategy is to make it clear to China that continuing on its current path would be more painful that changing its behaviour. Back with the bids for 21st Century Fox, and Neil Wilson at Markets.com says the market is now waiting for Comcast\u2019s next move after Disney increased its offer: As was expected, cash was added to the all-share offer as a sweetener and the deal is now worth $38 a share, up from its previous $28 offer that was worth c$55bn. This beats Comcast\u2019s $35 all-cash, $65bn bid but we must assume that Comcast is ready to come back with an even stronger offer. This offer from Disney is probably a little bit stronger than expected and [Disney\u2019s] Iger will be looking to kill off Comcast\u2019s bid once and for all. However, the rationale for Comcast remains the same, the question is only how much debt it can afford to carry. If it gets its way total debt would rise to $170bn according to Moody\u2019s, with just $6bn in cash on its books. Disney will also take on Fox\u2019s $14bn debts, giving this bid an enterprise value of more than $85bn. Debt is a concern for investors here and points to market-top behaviour. The amount of debt both companies are prepared to assume is arguably a worry, but it\u2019s a case of innovate or die in the face of competition. It\u2019s a sign of just how desperately these two legacy media groups want the assets of Fox. In their attempt to contend with cord cutters like Netflix they are risking leveraging themselves up to a degree that makes them susceptible should the current benign market conditions deteriorate. Sky shares are trading up 3% today at \u00a313.82 on the news but they could go higher if Comcast really goes big. Even it doesn\u2019t have the appetite for all of Fox it could settle to swoop for Sky only and bag those important European subscription revs. US markets have joined in the generally positive mood after the week\u2019s sell-offs as trade tensions between the US and China escalated. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 80 points or 0.33%, while the S&amp;P 500 opened up 0.325 and the Nasdaq Composite 0.5% better. But General Electric shares are down after the group was pushed out of the 30 share Dow after more than a century. GE, one of the original members of the Dow, will be replaced by Walgreens Boots Alliance. Back with trade disputes, and the European Union has confirmed it will begin charging import duties of 25% on a range of US products on Friday. The move is in retaliation to the US tariffs imposed on EU steel and aluminium. The EU tariffs will be placed on \u20ac2.8bn worth of goods, from Harley Davidson motor bikes to bourbon and peanuts. Over in the US, and the country\u2019s current account deficit widened in the first quarter, but by less than forecast. Reuters reports: The Commerce Department said the current account deficit, which measures the flow of goods, services and investments into and out of the country, widened by $8.0 billion to $124.1 billion, or 2.5 percent of national economic output, in the first three months of the year. Analysts polled by Reuters had expected the current account deficit to widen to $129.0 billion from the previously reported $128.2 billion in the fourth quarter. The figures also showed that US companies brought back cash from overseas after a December 2017 tax change. Companies paid out dividends of around $305bn from foreign receipts. Newsflash: The takeover battle over Rupert Murdoch\u2019s 21st Century Fox group has taken another twist. Disney has raised its offer for most of 21CF to $38bn per share, up from a previous offer of $28 per share. That takes the value of the offer up to around $70bn, from $52bn previously. Disney has also tweaked its offer to include a cash component - previously it was only offering shares. It beats Comcast\u2019s rival all-cash offer of $35 per share, and seemingly puts Disney back in poll position. Over in Dublin, one of Ireland\u2019s fallen bank bosses is being sentenced over his role in the financial crisis. David Drumm, the former CEO of Anglo Irish bank, faces a prison term after being found guilty of conspiracy to defraud and false accounting earlier this year. The case relating to banking transactions he was involved in at the height of 2008 financial crisis. By circulating deposits between Anglo and Irish Life &amp; Permanent (IL&amp;P), the bank created the impression that its deposits were \u20ac7.2bn larger than was actually the case. Tom Lyons, deputy editor of The Sunday Business Post, is tweeting from the court room. He reports that Drumm\u2019s team is defending his actions, while also recognising that a custodial sentence is on the cards.... Lukman Otunuga, research analyst at FXTM, says investors should be cautious about joining today\u2019s rally. He points out that the trade spat between China and the US could escalates again soon. Asian and European stocks rose today as markets attempted to shrug off trade war threats. While the improved risk appetite could elevate stock markets higher, the sustainability should be questioned as fears over trade tensions remain a key market theme. Global equity bears could transform the current rebound into a classical dead cat bounce if trade tensions between the United States and China continue to escalate. The US stock market is expected to rise when trading begins in a couple of hours, ending several days of losses. Yesterday the Dow lost 287 points, or 1.1%, wiping out its 2018 gains. The Bank of England could face a major shake-up if Labour wins the next election. Labour\u2019s shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, is unveiling a swathe of proposed reforms to Britain\u2019s central bank today. The headline-grabbing elements include opening an office in Birmingham, a shift away from its base at London\u2019s Threadneedle Street. The most intriguing element - setting the Bank a productivity target, alongside its current mandate to control inflation. These ideas aren\u2019t Labour policy yet, but they could be considered for its next manifesto: Chris Giles of the FT suggests the Bank could have some issues with a productivity target: Good news: UK factory orders have risen, helping manufacturers to boost their output. The CBI\u2019s latest healthcheck on the sector has found that manufacturing order books recovered in the last quarter, while the volume of output increased strongly. The CBI says: 33% of manufacturers reported total order books to be above normal, and 20% said they were below normal, giving a balance of +13% 20% of firms said their export order books were above normal, and 11% said they were below normal, giving a balance of +9% 43% of businesses said the volume of output over the past three months was up, and 13% said it was down, giving a rounded balance of +29% Anna Leach, CBI Head of Economic Intelligence, believes Britain\u2019s industrial sector may be picking up pace after a recent lull. \u201cThe recovery in orders and a return to bumper growth in production suggests the lull in manufacturing activity may be over. While risks to demand persist from Brexit and escalating global trade tensions, firms can work with the Government to nurture a pro-enterprise environment that helps UK growth to shift up a gear. UK housebuilder Berkeley has called the top of the London housing market. After some bumper years, Berkeley told shareholders that profits will drop by 30% in the 2018/19 financial year, as the sector returns to \u201cmore normal\u201d times. Chairman Tony Pidgley says that new housing starts in London have dropped by a third in the last two years (or since the EU referendum, basically). Pidgley blames Brexit uncertainty for the drop in activity: It is telling that some funders and builders are choosing to exit the market when faced with the degree of risk and regulation that now confronts development in the capital where macro and political uncertainty, including Brexit, are leading to this caution. This is a great shame as London is a fantastic world-class city with unique attributes that will last long beyond the current hiatus which is only exacerbating the well documented under-supply. Stocks are recovering because investors are snaffling up bargains after Tuesday\u2019s rout, says Ken Odeluga of City Index. He believes the People Bank of China\u2019s intervention overnight is reassuring the markets: European stocks are posting solid gains with similar demand building in Dow, S&amp;P and Nasdaq contracts. This follows chunks of buying interest in Asia-Pacific shares. It looked very much like bargain-motivated flows juiced by a window of benign currency conditions, particularly in Japan, Hong Kong, S. Korea and Australia where benchmarks all added around 1%. Chinese equities also enjoyed a bounce, though to a lesser extent, with precarious sentiment capping Shanghai and Shenzhen gains as investors read the PBoC stepping in as corroborating a sense of crisis. The central bank recommended a reserve ratio requirement cut\u2014essentially looser policy\u2014after fresh tariff threats. Elsewhere in the markets, cryptocurrency prices are falling after another digital coin exchange was hacked. The South Korean cryptocurrency exchange Bithumb says it lost 35bn won ($31.5m) worth of virtual coins to hackers. It\u2019s the second such breach in a week, highlighting the risks of investing in crypto (as coins are virtually anonymous, they can be almost impossible to recover). Here\u2019s the damage: Two hours into the trading day, and European markets are all comfortably higher. Shares are up across the board, as traders shake off some of their fears about a devastating trade war. Analysts at FXPro say: Markets are taking a breath right now and retracing some of the moves over the past number of sessions. Whether this turns into a broader rally or the selloff is resumed remains to be seen. Stock markets are higher after support was found in the European session yesterday and US and Asian traders built on the foundations of that support. Sterling has hit a new seven-month low this morning, as the UK government faces another crunch vote over Brexit. Parliament will vote on the EU withdrawal bill, the government\u2019s flagship piece of Brexit legislation, later today. And one group of MPs are refusing to drop their demand for a \u2018meaningful\u2019 vote in the scenario in which Britain can\u2019t agree a Brexit deal. Former attorney general Dominic Grieve insists that parliament must have a chance to protect the UK economy, in the event of a no-deal. Grieve\u2019s amendment has been been sent back to the Commons by the House of Lords, amid claims that Theresa May \u2018double-crossed\u2019 Grieve last week by promising to address his concerns, then pulling a u-turn. The vote could be close, if Grieve\u2019s band of backbench Conservative MPs hold firm. Some pro-Brexit Labour MPs could vote with the government, though, which would be a headache for opposition leader Jeremy Corbyn..... This uncertainty has knocked the pound down by 0.2% to $1.315, the lowest since November 2017. Those calming words from the People\u2019s Bank of China are helping markets recover from yesterday\u2019s rout. In London the FTSE 100 has jumped by 80 points, or 1%, to 7683 (partly helped by a weaker pound). Other European markets are also higher, with Germany up 0.4% and Spain gaining 1% following the rally in Asia overnight. Mike van Dulken of Accendo Markets reckons investors are \u201ccalming their fears about the current US-China trade tariff dispute\u201d. That\u2019s partly because neither side has actually imposed tariffs yet -- just made lots of threats. Elsa Lignos of Royal Bank of Canada explains why things might calm down: On the trade front, we\u2019re likely to see a two month \u2018hibernation\u2019 as the US works through the legal process for the next $200bn of tariffs and China awaits the US\u2019 formal response. The boss of Wall Street giant Goldman Sachs has predicted that China and the US still step back from a devastating trade wars. Lloyd Blankfein says that Trump\u2019s threat to add tariffs on $200bn of Chinese imports are a negotiating tactic: That\u2019s what you would do if it was a negotiating position, and you wanted to remind your counterparty just how much fire power you had to bring to the negotiation.\u201d Blankfein is hopeful that Washington and Beijing won\u2019t mutually destroy their economies. \u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019re in a suicide pact on this...\u201cI suspect we\u2019re not going to cause the economies to collapse with Smoot-Hawley on steroids. The protectionist Smoot\u2013Hawley Tariff Act of 1930 imposed tariffs on more than 20,000 imported goods. It was meant to protect US workers after the Wall Street crash of 1929, but actually appears to have hurt economic growth and didn\u2019t prevent the Great Depression. China\u2019s stock market isn\u2019t the only one flirting with a bear market. After days of losses, the Philippines PSI index has fallen almost 20% from its recent peak. Donald Trump\u2019s threat to impose more tariffs on China is dominating the newspapers across Asia today. The China Daily newspaper \u2013 often a good window into Beijing\u2019s thinking \u2013 has accuse the US of trying to hurt the Chinese economy. It says: \u201cFaced with this heightened intimidation from the U.S., China has no choice but to fight back with targeted and direct measures aimed at persuading the U.S. to back off, since it appears that any concessions it makes will not appease the Trump administration, which wants to suck the lifeblood from the Chinese economy.\u201d \u201cBeijing will have to ensure that Washington is aware that there will be heavy price to pay every action it strikes against China if it is to avoid being a victim of the Trump administration\u2019s growing blood lust.\u201d The Global Times also put the boot in, saying Donald Trump\u2019s administration was the world\u2019s biggest destabilising factor. A raging fever of nationalism rising in the world\u2019s sole super power sends an alarming signal. Nationalism is a challenge to globalization. Rising nationalism and protectionism could hinder the process of globalization and jeopardize the world order. The US often points an accusing finger at alleged economic nationalism of other countries including China, but now, the reality is that Trump\u2019s truculent nationalism is posing the biggest threat. And in Hong Kong, the Apple Daily newspaper produced quite a front page... Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Could Donald Trump really trigger a trade war with China? With neither side backing down, the markets getting nervous after yesterday\u2019s selloff hit shares and commodities across the globe. Trump\u2019s threat to impose new tariffs on $200bn of Chinese exports has investors worried, with Beijing already vowing to retaliate. Overnight, China\u2019s top central banker urged people to remain strong and calm. People\u2019s Bank of China governor Yi Gang told the Shanghai Securities Journal that China\u2019s economy remained solid, and that there was no reason to panic. \u201cChina still has good economic fundamentals and resilient growth. The yuan is one of a few currencies that have appreciated against the US dollar this year. \u201cI\u2019m fully confident about the health of China\u2019s capital market based on the fundamentals.\u201d Yi also pledged that the PBOC would act to \u201cfend off systemic financial risks\u201d, and prepare for the danger of \u201cpotential external shocks\u201d and \u201cfend off systemic financial risks\u201d. Yi Gang\u2019s comments helped to stem another day of losses in China, where shares are on the brink of a bear market (down 20% from their peak). Other Asian equity markets also recovered a little, with Japan\u2019s Topix up 0.5% and Australia\u2019s S&amp;P 500 gaining 1.1%. European traders might also recover their poise today, after Tuesday\u2019s selloff. Fiona Cincotta, senior market analyst at City Index, says investors fear the consequences of a trade war: Global GDP could stand to be hit by 2% - 3% should the trade war continue and spread, to put this into context the Great Recession wiped out 6% of the global GDP, so this trade spat is by no means insignificant. For weeks the market has been relatively complacent that Trump\u2019s tough protectionist rhetoric were merely a negotiating tool; however, the realisation that the US President is willing to go ahead with his threats has sent a shiver through the markets. Trump\u2019s strategy appears to be to raise the stakes until China is forced to capitulate, by opening up its markets to American goods and addressing intellectual property theft concerns. But if that doesn\u2019t happen, the world economy could find itself on a rocky road. Also coming up today.... Top central bankers are gathered in Sintra, Portugal, for a conference organised by the European Central Bank. Federal Reserve chair Jay Powell, Bank of Japan chief Haruhiko Kuroda, and ECB president Mario Draghi will all speak. Plue, we get a new healthcheck on Britain\u2019s factories and the latest oil inventory figures from America The agenda: From 9am BST: European Central Bank conference in Sintra, Portugal 11am BST: CBI industrial trends survey of UK factories 3.30pm BST: US weekly oil inventory figures",

Or at least that seems to be the general view. The International Monetary Fund (IMF), the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), and the majority of investment banks and thinktanks do worry about the latest round of niggly tit-for-tat tariff battles. They have condemned them, and some \u2013 including the IMF\u2019s boss, Christine Lagarde \u2013 have rounded on the main protagonist: President Donald Trump. But have they begun to panic?

But in 2002 it worked and Bush backed down.</p> <p>It was humiliating, yet not as bad as angering dozens of Republican senators from swing states that rely on donations from bourbon makers and the votes of peanut farmers. Worse, Bush\u2019s brother Jeb, then governor of Florida, was feeling the squeeze from EU tariffs on oranges.</p> <p>However, Trump\u2019s target is not only Europe: it\u2019s China as well. And in two weeks, the US will start taxing $34bn of Chinese goods. Beijing has vowed to immediately retaliate with its own tariffs on American soybeans and other farm products.</p> <p>An escalation of tariffs between the world\u2019s two largest economies should not be downplayed. A civilised argument with the EU is one thing: a determined effort to punish China for a long list of trade-related misdemeanours is another.</p> <p>The battle seemingly has no end and the fallout might not just cost consumers money: it might also destabilise decades-old global trading arrangements.</p> <p>Trump\u2019s comment that <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-autos-germany/german-carmakers-hit-by-report-trump-threatens-to-drive-them-off-us-streets-idUSKCN1IW0LP\">he wanted to banish the sight of Mercedes cars</a> in New York followed his administration opening a trade investigation into vehicle imports, which he tweeted on Friday would result in 20% tariff on cars unless action was taken by the EU. \u201cBuild them here,\u201d he told carmakers, even though many do boast large or expanding plants in the US.</p> <p>A 20% tariff, up from 2.5%, on the cost of a foreign car could lower eurozone GDP by 0.3% at least, says Bank of America Merrill Lynch.

                "bodyText":"They are just five companies but they are together worth more than the huge international businesses that make up the entire FTSE 100, more than the companies that comprise Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng index, and more than Germany\u2019s Dax and France\u2019s Cac 40 put together. They are the US technology giants collectively known as Faangs \u2013 Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix and Google (owned by Alphabet these days) \u2013 and their stellar stock market performances of the past few years has continued in the first six months of 2018 despite a number of serious headwinds. Technology companies in general have been buffeted by Donald Trump\u2019s trade battles, in particular the idea of restricting Chinese investment in US companies and limit American technology exports to China. There have also been individual difficulties \u2013 sometimes of their own making \u2013 for the top companies to confront, but their share price has continued to march on. Facebook saw its shares slide in March when it was revealed it had suffered a massive data breach associated with data firm Cambridge Analytica, but its market value has still climbed 11% since January to value the business at $568bn (\u00a3431m). Google shares have lagged behind the other five on worries about privacy issues and possible increased regulation, but parent company Alphabet still reported an 84% rise in quarterly profits in April. It is now worth $778bn, up 7% on the year. Apple has faced concerns about slowing iPhone sales, especially for its top-of-the-range $1,000 iPhone X, although its latest results seemed to ease those fears. With the boost of an increased investment in the company in May by Warren Buffett, who normally shies away from tech companies, Apple shares have climbed nearly 10% so far this year to value it at $912bn. It is well on track to become the world\u2019s first $1tn company. Meanwhile, Amazon marches on in its own bid for world domination. Its last quarter showed profits had more than doubled to $1.6bn, helped by strong sales in its core business and by its purchase of Whole Foods Markets. It continues to move into new areas, including challenging Sky and BT for premier league football coverage. On Thursday it announced a new march into the pharmacy business with the purchase of Pillpack, a start-up online drugs distribution business \u2013 battering the share prices of huge established players such as CVS and Walgreens Boots Alliance. Despite a series of attacks by Trump, Amazon\u2019s shares have jumped by 45% in the past six months, giving it a market value of $825bn. But out of all the Faangs, the standout success this year has been Netflix. Its market value has more than doubled to $172bn \u2013 making it bigger than Disney. The company has found success with the likes of Stranger Things and Queer Eye, and has signed up Barack and Michelle Obama for their own series. It is perhaps the only one of the five which can still be described as a disruptor, rather than a fully established business. In total, the Faangs are now worth $3.25tn compared with the current valuation of Britain\u2019s top 100 companies of \u00a32.1tn. Their surge since January compares with a flat performance from the FTSE 100, a 2% fall on the Dow Jones Industrial Average and a 1.6% rise on the S&amp;P 500. These soaring valuations mean that the top slots in the Bloomberg Billionaires list is dominated by tech entrepreneurs, with Amazon\u2019s Jeff Bezos leading the way with a net worth of $141bn. Can the boom continue? Apart from the continuing uncertainties about Trump\u2019s trade outbursts, there are concerns about tech companies\u2019 current sky high valuations, which rekindle memories of the dotcom boom of the late 1990s, when loss-making businesses dominated the stock market before coming crashing down to earth.
