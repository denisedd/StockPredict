                "bodyText":"A chemical compound commonly used to boost crop yields could be the answer to helping the world increase its consumption of renewable energy. In a world first, Siemens is opening a \u00a31.5m pilot project in Oxfordshire employing ammonia as a new form of energy storage. The German industrial firm hopes to prove that ammonia can be as useful as more established storage technologies, such as lithium-ion batteries, when it comes to managing the variable output of wind and solar power. The proof-of-concept facility at Harwell will turn electricity, water and air into ammonia without releasing carbon emissions. The ammonia is stored in a tank and later either burned to generate electricity, sold as a fuel for vehicles or for industrial purposes, such as refrigeration. Dr Ian Wilkinson, programme manager for Siemens\u2019 green ammonia demonstrator, said: \u201cStorage is recognised as the enabler for intermittent renewable power. \u201cThis is where we\u2019re different from usual storage, we\u2019re not just looking at power.
