                "bodyText":"Sir Martin Sorrell\u2019s iron grip as chief executive of WPP is under threat after the advertising group hired a law firm to investigate an allegation of personal misconduct. Sorrell is one of Britain\u2019s best-known and most highly paid business leaders. He is also the longest-serving FTSE-100 chief executive and has run the sprawling WPP empire since starting the business in 1985. In the last five years alone Sorrell has been paid well over \u00a3200m for running the world\u2019s largest advertising group thanks to lucrative and highly controversial reward schemes. His \u00a370m payout in 2015 was one of the biggest in UK corporate history. The investigation will increase pressure on Sorrell, who is already feeling the strain as WPP\u2019s share price has tumbled almost 40% in the last year to its lowest point since 2013. The price slump has wiped \u00a39bn off the value of the business, which owns 406 separate advertising and marketing firms in more than 100 countries, including top-flight brands such as Ogilvy &amp; Mather and J Walter Thompson. It has 134,000 staff. WPP recently reported its worst performance since the advertising recession in 2009, which Sorrell described as \u201cnot a pretty year\u201d. The 73-year-old \u201cunreservedly\u201d denied the misconduct allegation, which involves the improper use of company funds and allegations of improper personal behaviour. \u201cThe board of WPP has appointed independent counsel to conduct an investigation in response to an allegation of personal misconduct against Sir Martin Sorrell, chief executive officer of WPP,\u201d the company said. \u201cThe investigation is ongoing. The allegations do not involve amounts which are material to WPP.\u201d Sorrell, who is on a rare holiday, said he rejected the allegation but understood that the company had to investigate the matter. \u201cWPP is investigating an allegation of financial impropriety by me, specifically as to the use of company funds,\u201d Sorrell said. \u201cThis allegation is being investigated by a law firm. I reject the allegation unreservedly but recognise that the company has to investigate it. I understand that this process will be completed shortly. Obviously, I shall play no part in the management of the investigation under way.\u201d WPP has called in two top law firms, Allen &amp; Overy and Slaughter and May, to advise on the investigation. The trouble at the top has once again put a spotlight on the issue of succession at WPP amid accusations of a \u201cSorrellcentricity\u201d \u2013 the view that Sorrell runs the giant business autocratically as a personal fiefdom, dominating decision-making. The question of who will succeed Sorrell is raised every year at the company\u2019s shareholder meeting. Sorrell has never given any indication that he may be ready to step back. Roberto Quarta, a US businessman hired as WPP\u2019s chairman two years ago, has said that succession planning has intensified, becoming \u201ceven more focused and detailed\u201d. He said there was an \u201cexceptional team of potential candidates\u201d from WPP\u2019s top management, as well as a \u201cconstantly refined list of external candidates\u201d. There is understood to be tension about Sorrell\u2019s future among members of WPP\u2019s 12-strong board, which has been heightened by the recent performance slump. At least one director is known to be agitating to oust him. \u201cIf Sorrell were to leave the company for any reason, WPP has a relatively deep bench of talent who could pick up any slack on a near-term basis,\u201d said Brian Wieser, an analyst at Pivotal. \u201cA more significant issue relates to who would lead the company next and what strategic direction the company would pursue.\u201d WPP shares fell a further 2% in trading on Wednesday in response to the investigation. Sorrell has denied the group\u2019s poor recent performance was a result of his agencies being cut out of deals between advertisers and Google and Facebook. He said WPP spent more than $6bn (\u00a34.4bn) of its clients\u2019 advertising and marketing money with Google, its biggest single investment, last year, a 10% rise. Facebook received about $2.1bn of its ad spend last year, a 30% rise. Sorrell and his family trust owns a stake of about 1.8% in WPP, worth about \u00a3250m. \u201cAs a significant share-owner, my commitment to the company, which I founded over 30 years ago, remains absolute \u2013 to our people, our clients, our shareholders and all of our many stakeholders,\u201d Sorrell said.",

                "body":"<p>Russian oligarchs, the rouble and the Moscow stock market <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/apr/09/russian-firms-and-rouble-hit-heavily-by-trump-sanctions\">all felt the pain of US sanctions last week</a>. The share price slumps at Oleg Deripaska\u2019s En+ and Rusal companies, the steepest daily fall in the national currency for three years, and a double-digit hit to the dollar-denominated RTS index all showed that it is possible to punish Vladimir Putin and his associates.</p> <p>But the international community needs to be vigilant. At the same time that US sanctions were wiping billions of pounds off the value of Russian companies, Russia\u2019s president was preparing a consolatory gift to sugar the pill. The Kremlin has, according to multiple reports, drawn up plans for two new domestic tax havens aimed at Russian millionaires and billionaires who may be considering whether to repatriate their wealth and take shelter from tit-for-tat sanctions.</p> <p>Amid this manoeuvring, the big question for Theresa May, as the UK considers its own toolkit of measures, is whether sanctions will cause genuine discomfort to the Kremlin. Some informed observers say knocking a few billion off the personal wealth off an oligarch class that few ordinary Russians have any love for will not play too badly for Putin, even if it is ordinary workers who end up losing their jobs.</p> <p>It is also unclear why some oligarchs are deemed to be worthy of sanctions by virtue of their closeness to the Kremlin, but others are not. Why target the owner of an aluminium giant, which competes with US industry, but not the owner of a football club, which does not?</p> <p>London\u2019s position as a playground for Russia\u2019s elite means the opportunities available to May are more subtle. The so-called <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/mar/17/russian-elite-must-reveal-how-they-paid-for-uk-property-say-mps\">Magnitsky measures</a>, named after the anti-corruption whistleblower who met his death in a Russian jail, could be used to bar suspect figures from entering the UK.</p> <p>Some politicians, notably the Liberal Democrat leader and former business minister Vince Cable, have suggested deploying new unexplained wealth orders, introduced in February. These could be used to force people suspected of using dirty money to buy stately homes and Kensington townhouses to explain where they got the cash.</p> <p>Russian figures with ties to the Putin regime own British properties worth nearly \u00a31.1bn, according to recent estimates, most of it in London. The true value is likely to be far greater because buyers can take advantage of offshore secrecy loopholes left open under May.</p> <p>That\u2019s one reason why Labour has asked for British overseas territories to be forced to disclose the ownership of offshore companies more quickly than the current deadline of 2021. Any or all of these measures would hurt individuals with at least some influence in various corners of Russia\u2019s labyrinthine political corridors.</p> <p>But the big question mark hanging over the path ahead is whether the City of London\u2019s lobbying heft will ultimately prove telling. Russian oligarchs\u2019 business is highly lucrative for lawyers and investment bankers. One major bank in the City is said to have a team of more than 20 people dedicated to managing $1bn on behalf of a well-known oligarch. Britain\u2019s oil giant BP derives a huge slice of its income from its stake in Moscow-based Rosneft.</p> <p>The economic uncertainty of Brexit has raised fears that the capital\u2019s standing as a financial centre could be on the wane. With the government keen to prevent the feared decline \u2013 and the concomitant impact on tax revenue \u2013 the City\u2019s bargaining power is substantial.</p> <p>The financial industry can argue that being seen to reject Russian cash would simply see the money diverted elsewhere and spook other foreign investors, who fear the murkiest corners of their wealth may no longer be safe in London. That is a practical approach but not a moral one. Money will always follow the path of least resistance and it is not clear that the UK has the stomach to offer any at all.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4afdc808edcff360c796fcfce4768a629d5c5408\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4afdc808edcff360c796fcfce4768a629d5c5408/0_60_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Spotify\u2019s debut on the New York stock exchange.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Spotify\u2019s debut on the New York stock exchange.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: UPI / Barcroft Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Streaming puts song in heart of music biz</h2> <p>With UK record labels enjoying the biggest growth surge in revenues in more than two decades, the music industry has finally put the once-looming threat of a piracy apocalypse behind it.</p> <p>Digital formats have moved from being the industry\u2019s bete noire to its saviour: royalties from subscriptions to streaming services underpinned record growth last year. A 10.6% rise in record-label earnings, to \u00a3839m, came thanks to a 45% increase to \u00a3347m in income from services such as Spotify, Apple Music and Amazon Music. Income from CD sales, formerly the cornerstone of the music money-making machine, remained almost flat at \u00a3246m.</p> <p>The digital revolution has fuelled a democratisation of the industry, opening up the opportunity for fans to discover more of the \u201clong tail\u201d of artists \u2013 those beyond the traditional radio-dominating stars such as Taylor Swift, Adele and the ubiquitous Ed Sheeran.</p> <p>While more artists are sharing in the new digital bonanza, they are all having to get used to the idea that it is much harder to make money out of music than it used to be.

                "bodyText":"Russian oligarchs, the rouble and the Moscow stock market all felt the pain of US sanctions last week. The share price slumps at Oleg Deripaska\u2019s En+ and Rusal companies, the steepest daily fall in the national currency for three years, and a double-digit hit to the dollar-denominated RTS index all showed that it is possible to punish Vladimir Putin and his associates. But the international community needs to be vigilant. At the same time that US sanctions were wiping billions of pounds off the value of Russian companies, Russia\u2019s president was preparing a consolatory gift to sugar the pill. The Kremlin has, according to multiple reports, drawn up plans for two new domestic tax havens aimed at Russian millionaires and billionaires who may be considering whether to repatriate their wealth and take shelter from tit-for-tat sanctions. Amid this manoeuvring, the big question for Theresa May, as the UK considers its own toolkit of measures, is whether sanctions will cause genuine discomfort to the Kremlin. Some informed observers say knocking a few billion off the personal wealth off an oligarch class that few ordinary Russians have any love for will not play too badly for Putin, even if it is ordinary workers who end up losing their jobs. It is also unclear why some oligarchs are deemed to be worthy of sanctions by virtue of their closeness to the Kremlin, but others are not. Why target the owner of an aluminium giant, which competes with US industry, but not the owner of a football club, which does not? London\u2019s position as a playground for Russia\u2019s elite means the opportunities available to May are more subtle. The so-called Magnitsky measures, named after the anti-corruption whistleblower who met his death in a Russian jail, could be used to bar suspect figures from entering the UK. Some politicians, notably the Liberal Democrat leader and former business minister Vince Cable, have suggested deploying new unexplained wealth orders, introduced in February. These could be used to force people suspected of using dirty money to buy stately homes and Kensington townhouses to explain where they got the cash. Russian figures with ties to the Putin regime own British properties worth nearly \u00a31.1bn, according to recent estimates, most of it in London. The true value is likely to be far greater because buyers can take advantage of offshore secrecy loopholes left open under May. That\u2019s one reason why Labour has asked for British overseas territories to be forced to disclose the ownership of offshore companies more quickly than the current deadline of 2021. Any or all of these measures would hurt individuals with at least some influence in various corners of Russia\u2019s labyrinthine political corridors. But the big question mark hanging over the path ahead is whether the City of London\u2019s lobbying heft will ultimately prove telling. Russian oligarchs\u2019 business is highly lucrative for lawyers and investment bankers. One major bank in the City is said to have a team of more than 20 people dedicated to managing $1bn on behalf of a well-known oligarch. Britain\u2019s oil giant BP derives a huge slice of its income from its stake in Moscow-based Rosneft. The economic uncertainty of Brexit has raised fears that the capital\u2019s standing as a financial centre could be on the wane. With the government keen to prevent the feared decline \u2013 and the concomitant impact on tax revenue \u2013 the City\u2019s bargaining power is substantial. The financial industry can argue that being seen to reject Russian cash would simply see the money diverted elsewhere and spook other foreign investors, who fear the murkiest corners of their wealth may no longer be safe in London. That is a practical approach but not a moral one. Money will always follow the path of least resistance and it is not clear that the UK has the stomach to offer any at all. Streaming puts song in heart of music biz With UK record labels enjoying the biggest growth surge in revenues in more than two decades, the music industry has finally put the once-looming threat of a piracy apocalypse behind it. Digital formats have moved from being the industry\u2019s bete noire to its saviour: royalties from subscriptions to streaming services underpinned record growth last year. A 10.6% rise in record-label earnings, to \u00a3839m, came thanks to a 45% increase to \u00a3347m in income from services such as Spotify, Apple Music and Amazon Music. Income from CD sales, formerly the cornerstone of the music money-making machine, remained almost flat at \u00a3246m. The digital revolution has fuelled a democratisation of the industry, opening up the opportunity for fans to discover more of the \u201clong tail\u201d of artists \u2013 those beyond the traditional radio-dominating stars such as Taylor Swift, Adele and the ubiquitous Ed Sheeran. While more artists are sharing in the new digital bonanza, they are all having to get used to the idea that it is much harder to make money out of music than it used to be. The industry may be recovering, but it is still only worth two-thirds of what it was in 2001, the days of peak CD. Profit margins on CDs were a licence to print money: digital streaming royalties per track, not so much. And that is without starting on the music industry\u2019s unhappiness with YouTube paying a pittance for the hundreds of millions of music videos viewed on its site each year. The few million vinyl records sold provide more royalty income to artists than YouTube does. The profits of live music have never changed, hence the resurgence in popularity of touring to top up artists\u2019 bank accounts. Yet with Spotify\u2019s well-received $30bn stock-market listing, and Amazon reigniting the popularity of streaming music at home with its Echo smart speakers, digital income looks set to remain top of the pops. Uber\u2019s bikes are not a sign of back-pedalling Uber\u2019s acquisition of US bike-hire firm Jump looks rather pedestrian by the standards of its own vaulting ambition, at least at first glance. Compared to moonshot ideas such as cars that can fly \u2013 or the more tangible advance of driverless taxis \u2013 Jump\u2019s electric \u201cpedal-assisted\u201d bikes might as well be Victorian-era penny-farthings. But the deal should not be seen in isolation. Uber does not need electric bikes to become the commuter\u2019s carriage of choice for the acquisition to make sense. Rather, it envisages a world in which most City-dwellers will have no need to own their own car, with an alternative available for any given journey. The Uber user of 2038 might hop into a driverless taxi to get to work, whizz round the corner for lunch on an electric bike, then impress their date by whisking them off for dinner in a flying limousine. Fanciful as that might be, the goal for Uber is not to hit every imaginable futuristic milestone. Instead, it is to have a foot in the door of whatever technological advances gain the most traction. This attitude is born of a mindset akin to that of the San Francisco firm\u2019s near neighbours in Silicon Valley, even if Uber\u2019s bread and butter is a rather less glamorous mobile-phone-based taxi service. Unlike longstanding industries that have developed amid fierce competition and political opposition to monopolies, the likes of Facebook and Google emerged so quickly that, for them, world domination seems almost the natural order of things. That isn\u2019t to say that Uber, which is no stranger to regulatory resistance, will be allowed to lock competitors out of a sector as vast as transport. But it is already ubiquitous in much of the world, its name synonymous with what it does, much like Hoover in the UK or Xerox in the US. Coupled with its speculative investment in multiple modes of transport, that gives it a huge head start in the race towards the future.",

US stock futures are also up, pointing to a higher open on Wall Street later.</p> \n  <p>Asian markets were mixed. The Nikkei in Tokyo closed 0.26% higher while Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng was 1.7% lower.</p> \n  <p><strong>There is relief that western missile strikes on Syria on Friday did not prompt a response from Russia, Syria\u2019s main ally, although traders will be watching cautiously for any signs of escalation of the conflict.</strong></p> \n  <p>Oil prices are slipping, with Brent crude in London down 1% to $71.83 a barrel while US crude is 0.9% lower at $66.79 a barrel.</p> \n  <p>Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK, says:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>One of the main concerns last week was around the extent of the response by the US backed coalition on president Assad of Syria\u2019s forces and any Russian reaction to it. The firing of over 100 cruise missiles over the weekend on various targets, with little in the way of casualties, appears to be tempered with relief that while it may reduce the risk of an escalation in the short term, it in no way means that we might not get a counter response further down the line. As such markets here in Europe look set to open cautiously higher this morning after shares traded slightly firmer in Asia.</p> \n   <p>The US also appears to be complementing its military approach by focusing on the additional sanctions route, after UN ambassador Nikki Haley announced that further sanctions were being discussed on Russian companies who have dealings with Assad and the use of chemical weapons, with details likely to be announced by US Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin later today.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Geopolitical developments and corporate earnings remain the main focus, in the absence of major economic news apart from US retail sales data for March, out at 13:30 BST. </p> \n  <p>In the UK, we will get the latest labour market stats tomorrow, followed by inflation on Wednesday and retail sales on Thursday, but today the calendar is barren.

                "bodyText":"Wall Street has opened higher, as fears of an escalating conflict in Syria faded. Dow Jones up 0.5% S&amp;P 500 up 0.5% Nasdaq up 0.66% However, European stock markets have slipped after starting the day in positive territory. The FTSE 100 index in London has fallen more, dragged down again by the stronger pound. Sterling is trading 0.57% higher at $1.4323, the highest since 25 January, and the second-highest level since the Brexit vote. UK\u2019s FTSE 100 index down 0.8% Germany\u2019s Dax down 0.15% France\u2019s CAC down 0.09% Italy\u2019s FTSE MiB down 0.05% Spain\u2019s Ibex down 0.03% Oil prices are falling today. Brent crude in London has lost 1.3% to $71.64 a barrel while US crude is down 1.4% at $66.43 a barrel. With this, we are closing the blog. Thank you for reading and for your great comments. We will be back tomorrow. Since Trump became president in January 2017, the dollar has weakened substantially against most major currencies, including China\u2019s yuan and, until the US sanctions against Russia in the last few weeks, the rouble. Against the yuan, the dollar has fallen 8.6% since 20 January 2017, Reuters data show. It has risen 4.5% against the rouble, although it was down 4% against the Russian currency until new US sanctions on seven Russian oligarchs were announced 1 1/2 weeks ago. The US dollar index which measures its value against a basket of major trading partner currencies has lost 11.2% since Trump took office. Back to currencies. US president Donald Trump has tweeted In Greece, the central government ran up a primary budget surplus of \u20ac2.3bn in the first three months of the year, beating its target, Reuters reports. According to finance ministry data, the surplus was boosted by higher tax revenues. The government was targeting a primary budget surplus, which excludes debt servicing costs, of \u20ac1.09bn. The central government surplus excludes the budgets of social security organisations and local administration. It is not the measure monitored by Greece\u2019s EU and IMF lenders but is a good health indicator of the country\u2019s finances. While the pound is still up nearly half a percent against the dollar, Russia\u2019s rouble has stabilised following a steep drop earlier in the day. The dollar now buys 62.33 units of the Russian currency, compared with 63.15 in early London trading. Last week, the rouble weakened beyond 65 against the dollar for the first time since late 2016 after new US sanctions against a number of Russian oligarchs and officials. More sanctions are looming today, in retaliation for Russia\u2019s support for the Syrian regime which is thought to be bhind the chemical weapons attack in Ghouta two weeks ago. Over in the US, retail sales bounced back in March after three months of falling sales, with households buying cars and other big-ticket items. The Commerce Department said retail sales rose 0.6% last month from the previous month, following declines of 0.1% and 0.2% in February and January respectively. Sales were up 4.5% from a year earlier. Excluding cars, petrol, building materials and food services, which can be volatile, retail sales rose 0.4% compared with an unchanged reading in February. Economists have blamed the weakness in consumer spending at the start of the year on delays in processing tax refunds, which have held back households\u2019 spending power. Bookmaker Betway has suspended betting on the next governor of the Bank of England after a flurry of bets on Andrew Bailey. The next governor, who will succeed Mark Carney in June 2019, is expected to be announced towards the end of the year. Bailey, the chief executive of the Financial Conduct Authority had been relatively unfancied at 9/1, but the online bookie received a sudden influx of bets on him succeeding Carney and has suspended betting as a result. Bailey had been tipped by City economists as the most likely candidate to succeed Carney. Betway\u2019s Alan Alger said: There had been some speculation that Andrew Bailey was a leading candidate to replace Mark Carney as the new Governor of the Bank of England and in the last few days we\u2019ve seen huge support for him taking the role. The current Chief Executive of the Financial Conduct Authority was available at 9/1, but as a result of the weight of support towards him, we\u2019ve had no choice but to suspend the market. China\u2019s president Xi Jinping has said rising protectionism adds risks and uncertainty to the world economy, according to state media. His comments were made to Klaus Schwab, founder and executive chairman of the World Economic Forum. Xi also said it was necessary for both sides to strengthen cooperation and work together to find new driving forces for global economic growth. Sterling has climbed above $1.43 for the first time since 25 January, and only the second time since the Brexit vote in June 2016. The pound climbed as high as $1.4318, up 0.54%, as technical meetings between UK and EU negotiators got under way in Brussels, followed by talks over the Irish border issue on Wednesday. Brian Martin, head of global economics at ANZ, said there is \u201cstrong vested interest on both sides to agree on a workable trade deal\u201d. However, Jane Foley, senior currencies strategist at Rabobank, cautioned that hopes that a trade deal can be hammered out by October 2018 may be too ambitious, with the north Ireland border remaining a particular area of concern. Markets also have their eyes on key UK labour market, inflation and retail sales data in coming days. The Bank of England is widely expected to raise interest rates next month but if there are further signs of an economic slowdown, a \u201cdovish\u201d rate hike would put pressure on sterling, analysts say. Octavio Marenzi, CEO of capital markets management at consultancy Opimas, has sent us his thoughts on Bank of America\u2019s first-quarter results. We are seeing a very favorable environment for banking currently and Bank of America\u2019s earnings reflect this. Overall, BofA\u2019s results are good, and pushed RoE [return on equity] above 10%, even if they are not as strong as arch-rival JPMorgan\u2019s. Consumer Banking and Wealth Management registered solid, sustainable growth in revenues. However, investment banking fees pulled Global Banking into slightly negative territory. BofA\u2019s results in fixed-income trading were not as strong as we expected and declined compared to Q1 last year, but handily beat the last quarter of 2017. EU foreign ministers have threatened to impose new economic sanctions on Syria over the recent chemical attack on civilians in Ghouta near Damascus, but held off from joining anticipated new US sanctions against Russia. The 28 foreign ministers said in a joint statement after talks in Luxembourg: The European Union will continue to consider further restrictive measures against Syria as long as the repression continues. In the US, the bank earnings season continues. Bank of America has reported a 34% rise in first-quarter profit after the lender benefited from higher interest rates. The second-biggest US bank by assets said net income rose to a record $6.5bn in the three months to March from $4.5bn a year earlier. Earnings per share climbed to 62 cents from 45 cents. Wall Street analysts had expected 59 cents per share. Total revenues rose 4% to $23.3bn. Consumer banking, Bank of America\u2019s biggest business, posted 9% growth in revenues to $9bn. It relies heavily on higher interest rates to maximise profits because it has a large amount of deposits and rate-sensitive mortgage securities. Chief executive Brian Moynihan said: Strong client activity, coupled with a growing global economy and solid US consumer activity, led to record quarterly earnings. America\u2019s biggest bank JPMorgan Chase and Citi also reported strong earnings on Friday. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, has looked at the Footsie. The FTSE was dealing with duel pressures this Monday, both in its commodity sector losses and the success of sterling. While the rest of the markets held strong, the FTSE dropped 35 points to send it towards a one week low. Part of that decline is being informed by the chunky drop suffered by BP and Shell, which slipped 1.5% and 0.8% respectively. That\u2019s because Brent Crude itself fell 1.2%, the black stuff in retreat in response following the contrast between the actually military engagement seen in Syria over the weekend and the supply-worrying rhetoric used by Trump last week. But that\u2019s not the only thing upsetting the FTSE \u2013 the index also had to deal with the pound\u2019s latest increase. Against the dollar sterling shot up half a percent, sending cable above $1.43 to its highest price in almost a year and a half. The currency was less robust against the euro, and even then it lifted it towards a fresh 11 month peak. Turning to this afternoon and the US open may inject a bit more positivity into a fairly stagnant session. The Dow Jones is expected to surge 150 points after the bell, a move that would lift the index back above 24500. As for data, the focus will be on retail sales, with analysts expecting a rise from -0.1% to 0.4% month-on-month. Stock markets have got off to a (cautiously) positive start to the week despite air strikes carried out by the US, UK and France in Syria over the weekend, in response to a chemical weapons attack a couple of weeks ago. The missile strikes had been well-flagged and Russia did not retaliate. UK\u2019s FTSE 100 index down 0.41% at 7234.83 Germany\u2019s Dax up 0.18% at 12,465.78 France\u2019s CAC flat at 5315.57 Italy\u2019s FTSE MiB up 0.22% at 23,382.52 Spain\u2019s Ibex up 0.16% at 9782.50 Oil prices are falling. Brent crude in London has lost nearly $1 to $71.63 while US crude is down 86 cents at $66.53 a barrel. Spot gold has steadied at 1,344.38 an ounce, down 0.1%, after hitting an earlier peak of $1,348.69. The dollar continues to weaken, while sterling is strengthening ahead of key economic data this week. Russian stocks are falling ahead of likely new US sanctions. The rouble-dominated RTS index has slipped 0.4% while the rouble-based MOEX index is down 0.6%. The US is due to announce new economic sanctions against Russia today aimed at companies that are believed to be involved in equipment linked to chemical weapons, according to Nikki Haley, the US ambassador to the United Nations. The EU has already imposed a range of economic sanctions on the Assad regime, cutting off most diplomatic and economic sanctions, but with very limited impact. Russia is Europe\u2019s biggest energy supplier. While the EU imposed sanctions against Moscow over the crisis in Ukraine, it is cautious about new punitive measures. It appears unlikely that the European Union will join the US in imposing new sanctions on Russia or Syria over the chemical weapons attack that prompted the first co-ordinated western air strikes in Syria at the weekend. EU foreign ministers are putting the emphasis on diplomacy at a meeting in Luxembourg. Dutch foreign minister Stef Blok, who met his Russian counterpart Sergei Lavrov in Moscow on Friday, told reporters as he arrived at the meeting today: We have to keep pushing to get a ceasefire and humanitarian aid through the [UN] Security Council and eventually a peace process. The only solution is a peace process through the Security Council. British foreign secretary Boris Johnson told reporters: It is very important to stress [the strikes are] not an attempt to change the tide of the war in Syria or to have a regime change. I\u2019m afraid the Syrian war will go on its horrible, miserable way. But it was the world saying that we\u2019ve had enough of the use of chemical weapons. Sterling has touched an intra-day high of $1.4304 against the dollar, up 0.5%, the highest level since 25 January. Stock market futures are still suggesting a higher open on Wall Street, with the Dow and the S&amp;P 500 seen opening 0.6% while the Nasdaq is expected to rise 0.7%. The EU has called on Russia and Iran to use their influence on the Syrian government to prevent it from using chemical weapons again. The EU said in comments released to a meeting of the global chemical weapons watchdog, seen by Reuters: The EU calls upon all countries, notably Russia and Iran, to use their influence to prevent any further use of chemical weapons, notably by the Syrian regime. And here is our story on Wetherspoon closing all its social media accounts, a move that has been met with scepticism. Matthew Weaver writes: The pub chain\u2019s decision was reportedly in response to the trolling of some MPs, but many commentators suspected it was a publicity stunt by the chairman, Tim Martin. Commercial real estate agency and consultancy Colliers International says 15 major UK retailers or restaurant groups have gone into CVA (company voluntary arrangement) or administration in the past 12 months. Colliers has calculated that around 12,000 jobs have been lost or are on the line. The most recent business failure was Conviviality, the company behind Bargain Booze and Wine Rack. We wonder how many more retailers are going to get into trouble or people lose their jobs before someone decides to tackle the problem properly. John Webb, head of business rates at Colliers, says: These figures are as bad, if not worse than the crash of 2008/9 when 16 companies went into administration- 12 in 2008 and 4 in 2009- and we are only in April now. Data from Visa card released overnight shows a steep fall in consumers on Britain\u2019s high streets in March. The number of people visiting UK shops dropped 6% compared with the same month last year, the biggest fall in shopper numbers since the end of 2010. UK pub chain JD Wetherspoon is shutting all its social media accounts in protest against the mis-use of personal data and the failure to tackle online bullying. Wetherspoon said it was closing Twitter, Facebook and Instagram accounts for its head office and almost 900 pubs in Britain and Ireland. Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s Facebook is under huge pressure after it emerged that the personal information of millions of users was gathered by Cambridge Analytica, the data analytics firm that worked with Donald Trump\u2019s election team and the winning Brexit campaign. Zuckerberg has admitted that the data breach included his own Facebook profile. Social media platforms have also been criticised for doing too little to crack down on bullying and hate speech. Wetherspoon\u2019s chairman and founder Tim Martin said: It\u2019s becoming increasingly obvious that people spend too much time on Twitter, Instagram and Facebook, and struggle to control the compulsion. I don\u2019t believe that closing these accounts will affect our business whatsoever, and this is the overwhelming view of our pub managers. Martin has also been vocal in his support of Brexit. Last year Wetherspoon was forced to issue a denial after a spoof Twitter account falsely claimed the company did not allow staff to wear poppies at work to commemorate fallen service men and women. Sterling has fared better than the dollar. The pound is up 0.28% to $1.4276, continuing a two-week rally against the dollar that saw it push towards a new post-Brexit referendum high on Friday. Against the euro, sterling has slipped 0.1% to 86.49p but remains at its highest level since late May 2017. Key economic data on British unemployment, wages, inflation and retail sales are due this week. Markets expect the Bank of England to hike interest rates by a quarter point next month. Marc Ostwald, global strategist at ADM Investor Services International in London, said: With markets almost fully discounting a BOE rate hike, this week\u2019s run of monthly indicators are anticipated to give the hike a green light. Japan and China agree that a trade war will have serious consequences for the world economy, Japan\u2019s foreign minister Taro Kono has said today following high-level talks between the two countries. Kono told reporters after the first such dialogue in nearly eight years, according to Reuters: We have shared understanding that a trade war, no matter which country has brought it about, would have a very large impact on the prosperity of the international economy. There are fears that a trade row between China and the US could escalate, with the two nations threatening each other with higher tariffs. On currency markets, the dollar is struggling. It is flat against a broad basket of major currencies but has weakened 0.3% so far this month, and lost 2.5% since the start of the year. The euro is steady, trading at around $1.23. Manuel Oliveri, currency strategist at Cr\u00e9dit Agricole, told Reuters: The military strikes were well telegraphed and we are seeing a continuation in the broad market theme from lat week of a weaker dollar and favourable conditions for risk taking. European stock markets have given up some of their earlier gains. FTSE 100 index down 0.14% at 7254.60 Germany\u2019s Dax up 0.12% at 12,457.13 France\u2019s CAC up 0.03% at 5316.83 Italy\u2019s FTSE MiB up 0.17% at 23,369.72 Spain\u2019s Ibex up 0.19% at 9785.50 The rouble and Russian stocks are heading lower, dragged down by the threat of new US sanctions and falling oil prices. Washington said on Sunday it would impose further sanctions against Russia on Monday over Moscow\u2019s support for Syrian president Bashar al-Assad. Details are expected later today. The rouble has lost 0.3% against the dollar to 62.24 and 0.4% against the euro to 76.85 Russia\u2019s dollar-denominated RTS index has fallen 0.66% while the rouble-based MOEX Russian index is down 0.35%. Oil prices have extended their losses, with Brent crude in London down more than $1 a barrel at $71.51, a 1.5% fall. Shire\u2019s sale of its oncology business includes leukaemia therapy Oncaspar, the rights to pancreatic cancer treatment Onyvyde outside the US and other drugs in development. Jefferies analysts Peter Welford, David Steinberg and Lucy Codrington believe the deal will boost Shire\u2019s negotiating position in any talks with Japan\u2019s biggest drugmaker Takeda, which has disclosed that it is considering a bid. We see the possible strategic fit given the company\u2019s focus therapeutic areas of oncology, gastrointestinal and neuroscience, with Shire bolstering the latter two franchises. Furthermore, Shire\u2019s leading global position in rare diseases would likely be attractive for most large pharma/biotech, particularly given the long duration assets in immunoglobulin and enzyme replacement therapy Takeda\u2019s current market value is around $37bn, down 6% since disclosing its interest in Shire, against the London-listed company\u2019s $47bn. The Jefferies analysts say: Hence, we presume Takeda would need a significant equity raise to acquire Shire, suggesting a \u201cmerger\u201d is perhaps better terminology, which may raise hurdles to the successful completion of any future deal. Analysts are cautious about whether WPP will be broken up, now that Sorrell is gone. Citi analysts Thomas Singlehurst and Catherine O\u2019Neill reckon the main question is whether a new WPP chief executive goes for a \u201cquick fix\u201d or sticks with the existing \u201cslow fix\u201d. In the last year, WPP has been seen by many to be losing its way. Against the backdrop of an improving macro environment, organic growth has been slowing. In practice this slowdown has been happening for years and has a multitude of explanatory factors. Anyone coming in to take over the CEO role at WPP will be entirely focused on turning this round. The debate is now whether a new CEO goes for a Quick Fix vs. (the existing) Slow Fix. Paul Richards, media analyst at Numis, says Sorrell will be hard to replace with one person. The succession has led to questions over the size and scope of WPP and we can see a change of management accelerating the current process of reducing overlap and increasing flexibility. Richards views Sorrell\u2019s resignation as \u201ctragic end to a remarkable career which saw the creation of WPP as a global leader in marcoms [marketing communications]\u201d. WPP has bought other holding companies (Y&amp;R, Grey, Cordiant) as well as agencies and accordingly has grown to employ over 200,000 people in 400 businesses across 3,000 offices in 112 countries. In response to industry pressures including clients in-sourcing activity, pressure on CPG and structural challenges from the duopoly of Facebook &amp; Google, WPP was already working to simplify its business and increase flexibility. We expect a new CEO to continue and accelerate this process and a strategic review could lead to the group slimming its operations by a quarter to a third in our view. WPP is due to report first-quarter results on 30 April. Sorrell is free to start a new advertising venture because he has never had a non-compete agreement, the Financial Times reports. In a farewell note to staff, Sir Martin underscored the role WPP had played in his career, saying the company was \u201cnot just a matter of life or death, it was, is and will be more important than that\u201d. He also hinted at his next step when he signed off saying: \u201cBack to the future.\u201d WPP shares dropped as much as 5% in early trading and are now down 1.7% at \u00a311.67, with investors worried that Sorrell\u2019s departure leaves the world\u2019s biggest advertising group rudderless at a time when it might be broken up. European stock markets have opened higher, apart from the London stock market which has slipped slightly. UK\u2019s FTSE 100 index down 0.12% Germany\u2019s Dax up 0.27% France\u2019s CAC flat Italy\u2019s FTSE MiB up 0.13% Spain\u2019s Ibex up 0.08% Shares in Whitbread have surged nearly 8%, replacing Shire as the top riser on the FTSE 100 index in early trading. Whitbread is under mounting pressure from hedge funds to break up its business by spinning off the Costa Coffee chain, after activist investor Elliott Advisors built up a stake of more than 6%. Shares in Shire have opened 2.6% on the news, making it the biggest riser on the FTSE 100. Shares in WPP have dropped 5% after the departure of chief executive Sir Martin Sorrell. London-listed drugmaker Shire, which specialises in rare diseases, is selling its oncology business to French drugmaker Servier for $2.4bn. The division generated revenues of $262m last year. Shire, which is a potential bid target for Japan\u2019s biggest drugmaker Takeda, said it would consider returning the proceeds of the sale to shareholders through a share buyback. Shire\u2019s chief executive Flemming Ornskov hailed the sale as a key milestone for the company. While the oncology business has delivered high growth and profitability, we have concluded that it is not core to Shire\u2019s longer-term strategy. We will continue to evaluate our portfolio for opportunities to unlock further value and sharpen our focus on rare disease leadership with selective disposals of non-strategic assets. The proceeds from the transaction increase optionality and Shire\u2019s Board will consider returning the proceeds of the sale to shareholders through a shareholder-approved share buyback after the current offer period regarding Takeda\u2019s possible offer for Shire concludes. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Following another week of gains last week, with Germany\u2019s Dax and the UK\u2019s FTSE 100 index hitting six-week highs on Friday, European stock markets are set to open higher today. US stock futures are also up, pointing to a higher open on Wall Street later. Asian markets were mixed. The Nikkei in Tokyo closed 0.26% higher while Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng was 1.7% lower. There is relief that western missile strikes on Syria on Friday did not prompt a response from Russia, Syria\u2019s main ally, although traders will be watching cautiously for any signs of escalation of the conflict. Oil prices are slipping, with Brent crude in London down 1% to $71.83 a barrel while US crude is 0.9% lower at $66.79 a barrel. Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK, says: One of the main concerns last week was around the extent of the response by the US backed coalition on president Assad of Syria\u2019s forces and any Russian reaction to it. The firing of over 100 cruise missiles over the weekend on various targets, with little in the way of casualties, appears to be tempered with relief that while it may reduce the risk of an escalation in the short term, it in no way means that we might not get a counter response further down the line. As such markets here in Europe look set to open cautiously higher this morning after shares traded slightly firmer in Asia. The US also appears to be complementing its military approach by focusing on the additional sanctions route, after UN ambassador Nikki Haley announced that further sanctions were being discussed on Russian companies who have dealings with Assad and the use of chemical weapons, with details likely to be announced by US Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin later today. Geopolitical developments and corporate earnings remain the main focus, in the absence of major economic news apart from US retail sales data for March, out at 13:30 BST. In the UK, we will get the latest labour market stats tomorrow, followed by inflation on Wednesday and retail sales on Thursday, but today the calendar is barren. The International Monetary Fund holds its spring meetings of central bankers and finance ministers in Washington this week. The main corporate news at the weekend was the resignation of WPP boss Sir Martin Sorrell. He is leaving the advertising group he founded more than three decades ago ahead of the findings of an investigation into alleged personal misconduct. He is in line for almost \u00a320m in payouts. His departure is seen as paving the way for a breakup of WPP. Here\u2019s a round-up of today\u2019s front pages.",

                "bodyText":"Sir Martin Sorrell\u2019s resignation has raised the question of whether his successor will be able to stop a breakup of the world\u2019s largest advertising group. A number of names have emerged as potential runners and riders, including the Informa chief executive Stephen Carter, who has worked at Ofcom, cable firm NTL and at WPP\u2019s ad agency JWT; Adam Crozier, whose pedigree includes running ITV, Royal Mail, the Football Association and Saatchi &amp; Saatchi; the Sky chief executive, Jeremy Darroch; and Andrew Robertson, the chief executive of WPP rival Omnicom\u2019s global BBDO ad network. Some analysts believe that there is more value in breaking up the sprawling empire \u2013 WPP employs more than 200,000 staff in 400 separate ad businesses in more than 3,000 offices in 112 countries \u2013 particularly as its stock market value has plummeted more than a third in the past year. A breakup of WPP could net shareholders more than \u00a322bn, about \u00a317 a share, much more than its current value of \u00a311.50 a share or \u00a315bn market cap, according to analysts. WPP reports its operations in four main business groupings: 1. Advertising and media buying (estimated sale value: \u00a311bn-plus) The largest is advertising and media investment management \u2013 essentially the agencies that make ads and those that buy the ad space they appear in \u2013 which is the jewel in Sorrell\u2019s crown. AMIM made \u00a31.1bn in profit last year (almost 50% of WPP\u2019s total of \u00a32.3bn), accounts for 46% of revenues and boasts the best margin of 19%. Global advertising networks J Walter Thompson: The world\u2019s oldest advertising agency group with clients including Shell, Debenhams and Kit Kat. Ogilvy &amp; Mather: Clients include Unilever\u2019s Dove, as well as Boots. Young &amp; Rubicam: Its most noticeable campaigns of recent times have included Virgin and the BBC. Grey Global: Clients include Marks &amp; Spencer, Lucozade and Birds Eye. Global media agency networks MediaCom: Employs almost 6,000 staff globally with clients including Sky, Gillette and Mars. Mindshare: Has clients including HSBC and Marmite owner Unilever. It is in charge of allocating $35bn (\u00a324.4bn) worth of advertising spend a year. Wavemaker: Formed from the recent merger of MEC and Maxus, employs 8,500 staff with clients including L\u2019Or\u00e9al, Vodafone, Compare the Market and Morrisons. Essence: Clients include BT, Google, Financial Times, Target and Visa. 2. Public relations and public affairs (estimated sale value: \u00a31.4bn) The least profitable of WPP\u2019s units, accounting for just 8% (\u00a3183m) of the total operating profit and 7.7% of revenues. Companies within this division include Cohn &amp; Wolfe and Burson Marsteller (which are merging globally), Hill &amp; Knowlton, Finsbury, Buchanan, Clarion and Ogilvy PR. 3. Market research (estimated sale value: \u00a33.5bn) The second-smallest profit centre for WPP, which officially calls this division data investment management, contributes 15% of total profits (\u00a3350m) and 18.5% of revenues for the group. WPP is already mulling a potential sale of the division. 4. Branding, healthcare and specialist (estimated sale value: \u00a38bn to \u00a310bn) The division has some attractive assets due to the profitability of areas such as healthcare. It is also home to a number of WPP\u2019s valuable digital and interactive businesses. It accounts for 27.5% of profits (\u00a3625m) and 28% of total revenues. Digital advertising businesses include Wunderman, VML and AKQA, which has clients including Nike and Volvo. Branding agencies include Fitch and Coley Porter Bell. Healthcare communications agencies include GCI, Sudler &amp; Hennessey and Common Health. Clients include AstraZeneca, Sanofi, Colgate, GlaxoSmithKline and Kimberley Clark. Other investments (estimated sale value: \u00a36bn) WPP also has what anlaysts have called a \u201chidden treasure trove\u201d of assets that are not part of its core business lines but could be worth as much as \u00a36bn. These include stakes in the Vice media group and Nasdaq-listed software group Globant. WPP lists these investments, which also include tech and digital businesses, on its books at a value of \u00a32.2bn. However, analysts point out that the true market value could be three times higher, at more than \u00a36bn.",

Since the scandal erupted, carmakers have rushed towards production of \u201ccleaner\u201d electric cars.</p> <p>The sector is fighting on several fronts \u2013 financial, environmental and regulatory. But experts believe even tougher times may be lurking around the corner. Professor Karel Williams at Manchester University believes Britain could end up a net loser in this game-changing shift from fossil fuels to cleaner exhausts.</p> <p>He also identified three potential big winners: \u201cFirst are the platform guys, like Google and Uber [which are developing self-driving cars] who will reduce car manufacturers to the status of white-goods producers,\u201d he said. \u201cSecond, and the most likely winner, is China. Soon, the electric car, like your mobile phone, will come from China.</p> <p>\u201cThird are the existing big guns of the industry \u2013 the likes of Volkswagen, Nissan and Toyota \u2013 because they have the production capability and financial clout to pull through.</p> <p>\u201cThe worrying thing for Britain is that we have no real strong connection to any of those in pole position for this future inheritance.

                "bodyText":"Plummeting sales of diesel cars have driven Britain\u2019s auto industry to the brink of a crisis, with the axe falling on thousands of manufacturing jobs, and dealerships threatened with savage restructuring. Vauxhall, which was bought by Peugeot\u2019s parent company PSA last year, last week revealed plans to slash UK dealerships from 326 to about 200 as part of the French owner\u2019s drive to return the loss-making Vauxhall and Opel marques to profitability. Also this week, it emerged that Nissan is preparing to cut hundreds of jobs at its Sunderland plant, the largest car factory in the UK, amid falling diesel demand. Elsewhere in the industry, it was revealed this month that Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) is cutting 1,000 jobs in the Midlands factory that builds Range Rovers and the Land Rover Discovery, as it seeks to offset falling sales of its diesel vehicles. At Vauxhall\u2019s Astra plant in Ellesmere Port, 650 jobs \u2013 a third of the workforce \u2013 have gone since the PSA takeover. Diesel is a dirty word among car buyers following the so-called dieselgate scandal in 2015, when it emerged that Volkswagen had cheated regulators and misled customers by using software to suppress emissions of nitrogen oxide during vehicle tests. Since the scandal erupted, carmakers have rushed towards production of \u201ccleaner\u201d electric cars. The sector is fighting on several fronts \u2013 financial, environmental and regulatory. But experts believe even tougher times may be lurking around the corner. Professor Karel Williams at Manchester University believes Britain could end up a net loser in this game-changing shift from fossil fuels to cleaner exhausts. He also identified three potential big winners: \u201cFirst are the platform guys, like Google and Uber [which are developing self-driving cars] who will reduce car manufacturers to the status of white-goods producers,\u201d he said. \u201cSecond, and the most likely winner, is China. Soon, the electric car, like your mobile phone, will come from China. \u201cThird are the existing big guns of the industry \u2013 the likes of Volkswagen, Nissan and Toyota \u2013 because they have the production capability and financial clout to pull through. \u201cThe worrying thing for Britain is that we have no real strong connection to any of those in pole position for this future inheritance. Nissan in Sunderland is the exception, because all the rest [of the UK-based car manufacturers] are piddling in volume terms. We are basically a market.\u201d Williams believes this dire prognosis for Britain\u2019s car industry means there are sure to be further job cuts: \u201cThe industry is set up to adjust to cyclical downturns \u2013 they all have substantial amounts of agency workers.\u201d Des Quinn, the Unite union\u2019s national officer for JLR, said the cuts at the carmaker \u201cshould be a wake-up call for ministers and have alarm bells ringing in the highest levels of government\u201d. He blamed \u201cconfusion over diesel cars prompted by badly thought-through ministerial announcements\u201d for the crisis of confidence in diesel vehicles. Williams agrees that politicians had not helped this \u201cdemonisation\u201d of diesel vehicles. There is little doubt that the consumer and political backlash against diesel has been devastating. Demand for new diesel cars in Britain nosedived by more than a third in March \u2013 generally the top selling month of the year \u2013 pushing down total registrations by 15.7%. Registrations fell to 474,069 vehicles in the month, according to the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT). Vauxhall has seen a whopping 18.28% fall in sales so far this year, with 54,535 cars registered by March, according to SMMT data.

The US had just suffered its deepest post-war recession, <a href=\"https://data.bls.gov/timeseries/LNS14000000\" title=\"\">unemployment was heading for 10%</a> and Washington had been forced to bail out the banks.</p> <p>But in June of that year, the world\u2019s second-biggest economy turned the corner.

At the end of this month, the US will have enjoyed its second-longest period of economic expansion in history, beating the upswing under John F Kennedy and Lyndon Johnson between 1961 and 1968.</p> <p>By next summer, if nothing untoward happens, Donald Trump will be able to boast that the US has beaten the record 10-year period of growth between the end of the Gulf war in 1991 and the 2001 dotcom bust. Expect a flurry of self-congratulatory tweets from the White House.</p> <p>The reasons for America\u2019s recovery are simple. Interest rates were cut quickly and aggressively by the country\u2019s central bank, the Federal Reserve, and kept at rock-bottom levels for seven years. The Fed also pumped trillions of dollars into the economy through the process known as quantitative easing \u2013 buying bonds to expand the money supply.</p> <p>Swift action was taken to clean up the financial system so that the banks could start lending again.

Traditionally, the US has recovered sharply from downturns and had several years of fast growth. In the 1960s, for example, the US economy grew by 4.9% a year on average while in the 1990s it expanded by 3.6% a year on average. The average during the current expansion is 2.2% and it is the first business cycle since the second world war in which there has not been a single year of growth above 3%.</p> <p>At 1.4% a year, employment growth has also been modest. America\u2019s hire-and-fire culture has meant workers can be laid off in large numbers during recessions and then taken on again during the subsequent recoveries. In the 1980s upswing, for instance, jobs growth averaged 2.8% a year.</p> <p>Nor has the recovery followed Kennedy\u2019s dictum that a rising tide should lift all boats. Half of the growth during Obama\u2019s presidency went to the top 1% of US households, with the lack of real income growth for middle America helping to explain both the muted nature of the upswing and the discontent that propelled Trump to the presidency.</p> <p>Dario Perkins, managing director of global macroeconomics at the research company TS Lombard, says the US is not alone in having experienced a long period of growth. \u201cAmong the developed economies, Australia, Sweden, Germany and Canada all have expansions that match or surpass the US achievement.

Perkins says that there are only scattered signs of the trends that normally develop in the late stages of an economic cycle \u2013 firms running up against capacity constraints, rising inflation and excessive investment. More likely, he thinks, the end will come \u2013 as it did in both 2001 and 2007 \u2013 with the popping of an asset-price bubble. \u201cRecent history suggests any problems are more likely to start in the financial sector and with central banks tightening policy and asset prices high by historical standards, this is surely the area to watch over the next 12 to 18 months.\u201d</p> <p>The 1960s upswing eventually came to an end when the economy ran into inflationary problems amplified by the cost of the war in Vietnam and Johnson\u2019s Great Society welfare programmes. Dean Baker, from the left-leaning Centre for Economic Policy Research in Washington, <a href=\"http://cepr.net/publications/op-eds-columns/the-irresponsibility-of-fiscal-responsibility\" title=\"\">says there is no real evidence that the US economy is reaching its supply limits</a> and that the concerns expressed over the impact of Trump\u2019s tax cuts for the budget deficit are overblown.</p> <p>But the Fed might see it differently. Wade says the US central bank has a tricky task in raising interest rates without triggering a sharp downturn and that its dilemma is made worse by the fading impact of the fiscal boost after 2019.</p> <p>The good news for Trump, he says, is that the record for continuous economic expansion will be broken next year. The bad news is that the \u201cfestivities in the White House might be somewhat muted as the president faces the prospect of fighting for re-election during a recession\u201d.</p> <h2>Recovery in three charts</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2018/04/inflation/giv-3902Gx06PH53u7K8/\" data-alt=\"US inflation v interest rates\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2018/04/inflation/giv-3902Gx06PH53u7K8/\">US inflation v interest rates</a> </figure>  <p><br>A dramatic cut in interest rates and a $1 trillion government rescue package prevented the US economy falling off a cliff in 2008 and kept inflation from falling below 1%.

Nevertheless, the US central bank, the Federal Reserve, has increased the cost of borrowing four times since 2015 and plans several more rises this year. White House economic advisers expect President Trump\u2019s tax cuts to push GDP growth to 3% in 2018 \u2013 but they are a one-off fiscal boost that Fed policymakers are supposed to ignore when making their plans.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/apr/2018-04-28T10:30:43/embed.html\" data-alt=\"US recoveries compared\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/apr/2018-04-28T10:30:43/embed.html\">US recoveries compared</a> </figure>  <p><br>It\u2019s clear that the US recovery since 2008 is among the most consistent and sustained, compared with its predecessors.

The rapid expansion in the early 1960s during the Kennedy and Johnson presidencies was by far the strongest, followed by the boom under Ronald Reagan, which ended in recession before the recovery credited to Bill Clinton in the 1990s.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/apr/2018-04-28T10:31:51/embed.html\" data-alt=\"Wages have remained subdued\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/apr/2018-04-28T10:31:51/embed.html\">Wages have remained subdued</a> </figure>  <p><br>US wages have waxed and waned during each of the postwar recoveries except for the most recent one, which has seen wage rises remain low for almost the entire period.

Recovery in three charts A dramatic cut in interest rates and a $1 trillion government rescue package prevented the US economy falling off a cliff in 2008 and kept inflation from falling below 1%. But efforts to boost inflation back above 2% only achieved momentary success in 2012. Nevertheless, the US central bank, the Federal Reserve, has increased the cost of borrowing four times since 2015 and plans several more rises this year. White House economic advisers expect President Trump\u2019s tax cuts to push GDP growth to 3% in 2018 \u2013 but they are a one-off fiscal boost that Fed policymakers are supposed to ignore when making their plans. It\u2019s clear that the US recovery since 2008 is among the most consistent and sustained, compared with its predecessors. But to say it is lacklustre is to underplay how weak it is, especially when the extra efforts of the government and the central bank are considered. The rapid expansion in the early 1960s during the Kennedy and Johnson presidencies was by far the strongest, followed by the boom under Ronald Reagan, which ended in recession before the recovery credited to Bill Clinton in the 1990s. US wages have waxed and waned during each of the postwar recoveries except for the most recent one, which has seen wage rises remain low for almost the entire period. It was expected that tech giants like Apple, Amazon and Google would spur a turnaround that filtered down to the rest of the economy. However, Amazon and Google, as in the UK, have played a bigger role in boosting transport for their goods and the low-grade jobs that go with the sector, than high-paying engineering jobs in the IT business. Economist Robert J Shapiro says automation in the internet age has been one of the biggest factors depressing wages. Phillip Inman",
