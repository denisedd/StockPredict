It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s still early in the US trading session however.</p> <p>The attraction of the music-streaming service probably lies in Spotify\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s strong market share and rapidly growing revenues. It may be some time before Spotify actually turns a profit though, as the company is resolutely prioritising growth over profit, and will be channelling money into investing in services and building further scale.</p> <p>Unlike its main competitors Apple and Amazon, Spotify is focused on music streaming, so it doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t benefit from the network effects of a wider ecosystem.

                "bodyText":"And finally, Spotify has closed at $149 per share. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a drop from its opening level of $165.9, but still 13% above the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcreference price\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 of $132. That values Spotify at around $26.6bn, more than some analysts had suggested before today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s listing. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our tale of the latest tech float: Goodnight! GW A recovery rally on Wall Street has helped the US stock market recover a chunk of Monday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s falls. The Dow Jones industrial average has closed 1.65% higher, up 389 points at 24,033 - having lost over 450 points yesterday. Traders were encouraged by reports that the White House was not planning action against Amazon. Spotify may have bucked the trend with its direct listing, but its ownership structure is depressingly familiar, says our financial editor Nils Pratley. Its founders are wedded to keeping vice-like control via a share structure with unequal voting rights. For unequal, read unfair: Daniel Ek and Martin Lorentzen own 38.9% of the ordinary shares but they have created \u00e2\u20ac\u0153beneficiary certificates\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd with super-charged voting rights that only they can own. Include those holdings and Ek and Lorentzen have 80.4% of the votes. As the prospectus is obliged to concede: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153If our founders act together, they will have control over the outcome of substantially all matters submitted to our shareholders for approval, including the election of directors.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Put another way, for as long as the duo stick together, they are unsackable. Laith Khalaf, senior analyst at stockbroker Hargreaves Lansdown, says Spotify has a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcgreat story\u00e2\u20ac\u2122; even so, people should be cautious when investing. He explains: \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcSpotify is floating on the stock market at a pretty inauspicious time for the tech industry, which has been rocked by the Facebook data scandal and now potentially faces greater regulation as a result. Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tweeted attacks on Amazon don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t help lift sentiment towards the sector either. Despite the downbeat mood music, Spotify shares changed hands on the market at a substantial premium to the highest price previously paid in private transactions, indicating significant investor demand for the stock. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s still early in the US trading session however. The attraction of the music-streaming service probably lies in Spotify\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s strong market share and rapidly growing revenues. It may be some time before Spotify actually turns a profit though, as the company is resolutely prioritising growth over profit, and will be channelling money into investing in services and building further scale. Unlike its main competitors Apple and Amazon, Spotify is focused on music streaming, so it doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t benefit from the network effects of a wider ecosystem. However the company has already carved out a dominant role, and has demonstrated its ability to leverage scale by renegotiating agreements with music labels, boosting its gross margin from 12% to 21% since 2015. The BBC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Danni Hewson is impressed by the streaming service\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s opening debut: Bloomberg\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Alex Webb points out that Spotify is now worth more than some established players (despite having never made a profit!) Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s some video of the moment Spotify\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shares joined the market: Spotify\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shares are bouncing around in early trading, as investors weigh up whether to buy in at today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s opening price. They\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve just slipped below $164, from the opening price of $165.9. Early days, though.... The Wall Street Journal says Spotify has hit the markets with a bang: Spotify Technology roared onto the public market Tuesday as the music-streaming giant pulled off an unusual method of going public. The stock opened at $165.90 and traded in a close range immediately after. With an opening value of $29.55 billion, Spotify is poised to become the third-largest U.S.-listed tech IPO on record, according to Dealogic. That \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcunusual method\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 involved spurning the investment banks who would have underwritten the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shares (providing a safety net for the market debut), in return for a large fee. AT LAST! Spotify is finally trading, after more than three hours of intense discussions on the Wall Street trading floor. Shares have opened for trading at $165.90, sharply higher than the $132 which had been suggested. That, by my maths, values Spotify at around $29.5bn. I imagine the company should be pretty pleased - this is a sharp jump on the value of its shares earlier this year (when they could only be traded privately between shareholders). On a lighter note, the New York Stock Exchange has confirmed that it accidentally flew a Swiss flag to mark Spotify\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s listing -- which is unfortunate as it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s actually a Swedish company. More here: Spotify\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s likely market valuation is pushing closer to $30bn, as its unconventional \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcdirect listing\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 continues to play out on the trading floor There are 178.1 million Spotify shares in existence (although the company is only offering around a third to New York investors today). So if today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s listing hits $170, as seems possible, the company could be worth several billion dollars more than forecast. Market makers on Wall Street are continuing to haggle over Spotify\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s valuation, pushing its likely share price value even higher: After a edgy day, European stock markets have closed mostly in the red. The escalation of tensions between China and the US over tariffs hit sentiment in the City, and beyond, as traders returned to their desks after the Easter break. Anxiety over the tech sector also weighed on shares, despite the interest in Spotify\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s listing in New York, and Tesla\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s upbeat statement. The slowdown in eurozone factory growth last month also didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t provide traders with any fresh optimism. So, the FTSE 100 finished 26 points lower, or 0.4%, at 7,030. Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s DAX shed almost 0.7%, but France was calmer and Italy actually rallied a little. Jasper Lawler, head of research at London Capital Group, thinks Europe could be a safe-haven from some of the turbulence in America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s markets. It was a rough start to the second quarter for European equities. Still, next to the losses seen on Wall Street on Monday, the damage in Europe was contained. Europe is out of the firing line for Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tariffs for now and has a lower weighting in technology companies compared to the US. Both factors make Europe a relative haven from the current negative news flow. Higher still and higher.... Spotify\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shares are now seen opening at $150-$160 - indicating that its stock market listing is going well. Wall Street is pushing higher in volatile trading. The Dow is now up 256 points, or 1% -- which would recover around half of Monday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s selloff. Connor Campbell of SpreadEx says that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153investors continue to process the latest chess-moves in the nascent trade war between China and the US,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, so this bounce-back might be fragile. The tech-heavy Nasdaq is 0.2% higher, partly thanks to Tesla which is rallying after sticking to its pledge to more than double production of its Model 3 by the end of June. Those early prices suggest that Spotify could be worth around $27bn, I think. Not too shabby, given the company hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t made a profit out of its 157 million customers. Ooooh - Spotify is being priced at between $145 and $155 per share. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s more than the $132 which had been pencilled in. This delay is because the company decided not to use investment banks to underwrite its offering -- saving it millions of dollars in fees. So, if today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s listing goes smoothly, other companies might consider taking the same track. Donald Trump is refusing to back down in his fight against Amazon, and just fired off a new tweet: Spotify\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock market listing is underway...but we don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know what price its shares are trading at yet. Wall Street has opened a little higher, as traders hope to recovery from Monday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s selloff. The Dow has gained 0.5% in early trading, up 123 points at 23,767 Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s some early reaction to Tesla\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new production numbers: Just in: Electric carmaker Tesla has just released its latest eagerly-awaited production figures, which confirm rumours that it has missed some of its own targets. Tesla says it produced 34,494 vehicles in the last three months, 40% more than the final quarter of 2017. This makes January-March \u00e2\u20ac\u0153by far the most productive quarter in Tesla history\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, it says. This includes 9,766 Model 3s (Tesla\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new model), and 24,728 were Model S and Model X vehicles. Tesla also reveals that it has ramped up production recently -- amid reports that founder Elon Musk has taken personal control of car output in recent days (and even been sleeping at the factory). The company says: In the past seven days, Tesla produced 2,020 Model 3 vehicles. In the next seven days, we expect to produce 2,000 Model S and X vehicles and 2,000 Model 3 vehicles. It is a testament to the ability of the Tesla production team that Model 3 volume now exceeds Model S and Model X combined. What took our team five years for S/X, took only nine months for Model 3. However, Musk had previously aimed to produce 2,500 Tesla 3 cars each week by now. So Tesla hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t hit that goal yet. But crucially, it says it still aims to get production of the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dc3\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 model up to 5,000 per week in \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcabout\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 three months. Shares are rallying in pre-market trading - up around 6% Spotify logos have sprung up at Wall Street, ahead of today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s listing: New York\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock market may claw back some of yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s losses when trading resumes in under an hour\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time. The Dow Jones index is expected to rise by 0.6%, or around 140 points, judging by the futures markets. That would take a small bite out of Monday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rout, when it lost over 450 points (and was down 730 points at one stage). Craig Erlam of City firm OANDA says the markets are still nervous, though: The second quarter got off to a rough start on Monday, with trade war fears and declining tech stocks taking their toll on investor sentiment, but we are seeing a small rebound ahead of the open on Wall Street. US futures are up to half a percentage point higher on Tuesday, but this pales in comparison to the losses recorded on Monday and reflects ongoing weakness in stocks. Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s attacks on Amazon over the weekend put the spotlight back on the tech sector, as it tries to recover from the Facebook data scandal that threatens more regulation. Pressure on the sector doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t appear to be going away in the near-term which will continue to act as a drag on indices. Traders might need their tin hats this spring... In less than 90 minutes, music streaming site Spotify will join the US stock exchange. You can get up to speed quickly with our explainer, which outlines why the popular service (which has never turned a profit) could be worth up to $25bn - and why today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s listing could be particularly lively.... Joe Weisenthal of Bloomberg is questioning whether Donald Trump has really hurt Amazon\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s share price (as suggested earlier). He points out that other tech companies have suffered similar falls, even though they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve been spared a digital roasting from the president: However, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d suggest that Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s attack on Amazon\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tax affairs (and its implications for the digital companies) are one of several factors weighing on markets. And sometimes, investors like to have an excuse to sell -- especially if they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re getting jittery. Bad news: another 97 workers at the collapsed UK construction and outsourcing group Carillion have lost their jobs. That take the total redundancies at the company to 1,802, since it was liquidated in January in one of the biggest UK corporate failures in years. Some 9,946 jobs have been saved (because other companies have taken on the contracts they work on). Sky is bucking today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s selloff, after a cunning scheme to help Rupert Murdoch take full control of the broadcaster emerged. Disney has \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcexpressed interest\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 in buying Sky News, a move that might clear the way for Murdoch\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 21st Century Fox company take control of the 61% of Sky\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shares it doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t already own. 21CF\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bid has been hit by media plurality concerns - given Murdoch\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s strong position in UK media (including owning the Times and Sun newspapers). But those worries might abate, if Sky News wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t part of the package. Jolly decent of Disney to offer to help, eh? Not exactly. The US giant has its own motive - namely to take over Fox (including all of Sky) in a $66bn (\u00c2\u00a347bn) deal. That takeover risks being derailed because Comcast recently launched its own takeover offer for Sky. Sky shares have risen to the top of the FTSE 100 leaderboard, up 1.5% at \u00c2\u00a313.15. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s higher than either Comcast\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s offer (\u00c2\u00a312.50) or Fox\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s (\u00c2\u00a310.75), suggesting traders expect a higher bid. City firm Liberum expects Fox to strike back: We think the news and today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s comments from Sky point to a revised bid from Fox/Disney to trump Comcast\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 1250p bid. More here: Two and a half-hours into the new trading quarter, and Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock market is still down. The FTSE 100 is currently 46 points lower or 0.6%, at 7010. Industrial stocks, utilities and telecoms firms are leading the selloff. Neil Wilson of ETX Capital blames the double-whammy of trade tensions following China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tariffs, and the tech selloff in America: On tech\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s impact on the market, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a case of the star performers suffering and this has a big psychological effect on sentiment. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not just that they have been behind the bulk of the gains in recent years and therefore exert an outsized effect on indices when they sell off; there is also a kind of network effect on other stocks. On trade, there is hope that China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s response to US sanctions is sufficiently moderate and contained to prevent further escalation. However we await to see where this goes and whatever happens from here, there is no \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcgood news\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 in the sense that the direction of travel is either one-way or going no further \u00e2\u20ac\u201c we are not about to see a freeing up of global trade (reversal of tariffs), which would be risk-positive. Even if there is no further escalation, the background music is risk-off. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hardly unusual for Donald Trump to lash out on Twitter -- as Hillary Clinton, CNN, the FBI, several senators and the Mexican government can all testify. But still, his trenchant criticism of Amazon in recent days has caused a real stir in the markets for several reasons, helping to fuel this week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s market selloff. Partly, because Trump is taking the side of the old-economy - tweeting that America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u0153fully tax paying retailers\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd are being forced to shut stores because (he claims) Amazon is getting an unfairly good deal. Politifact, a US website, has debunked Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s claim that the US Postal Service is losing money thanks to Amazon. It says: Amazon isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t causing the United States Postal Service to lose a fortune. In fact, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s contributing to its biggest growth sector, package delivery. Deals like the one with Amazon brought in $7 billion in fiscal year 2017. But still, the US president\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s comments suggest that other tech disruptors could also come under fire -- especially if changes are made to the US tax system to help traditional retailers. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not the only concern. Some industry figures are concerned that Amazon (whose shares fell 5% yesterday) is being hammered because its founder, Jeff Bezos, also owns the Washington Post. Vanity Fair\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Gabriel Sherman is reporting that Trump is firmly focused on Bezos, thanks to the Post\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s criticism of his presidency: Sherman says: He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s off the hook on this. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s war,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd one source told me. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153He gets obsessed with something, and now he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s obsessed with Bezos,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said another source. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Trump is like, how can I fuck with him?\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd That sort of behaviour will unnerve Wall Street, as investors try to judge where to place their money. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also unusual to see politicians try to settle scores so publicly. Paul Donovan, UBS\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chief global economist, fears that such \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcrandom\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 attacks could undermine faith in the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcrule of law\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. Just in: Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s manufacturing has just posted its slowest quarter growth in a year. But it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not all bad -- growth in March picked up a little, pushing the manufacturing Purchasing Managers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Index up to 55.1 from 55.0 in February. Factory bosses reported that output growth picked up last month, but increases in new orders and employment slowed. Data firm Markit says: The average reading over the opening quarter as a whole (55.1) was the weakest in a year, suggesting that the underlying pace of expansion has been generally slower since the start of 2018. Growth across Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s factory sector has hit an eight-month low, as the recent \u00e2\u20ac\u02dceuro boom\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 falters. The eurozone manufacturing PMI, which tracks activity across the sector, dropped to 56.6 in March, down from 58.6 in February. This is the third monthly drop in a row, but it still signals solid growth (50 points would show stagnation). Factory bosses reported that output, new orders and new exports grew at a slower rate last month. They also reported problems getting hold of the raw materials and parts they needed, as supply chains struggled to cope. Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit, is concerned that business confidence also dipped last month. The fact that business optimism about the coming year has slipped to a 15-month low suggests there are other factors that are now hitting factory order books. Export growth has more than halved since late last year, linked in part to the appreciation of the euro, and in some cases demand is being stymied by higher prices. Hopes that the markets might calm down after their volatile start to 2018 have been dashed this morning. Rebecca O\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Keeffe, head of investment at interactive investor, says investors need to decide whether we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re heading into a bear market, or just a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcrevaluation\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 of asset prices. The major fear for markets is that the imposition of retaliatory import tariffs by China could just be the tip of the iceberg and will cause a chain reaction that drags more sectors and countries into the dispute. In a world where China is not willing to turn the other cheek and where President Trump likes to get the last word, the situation is set for further turmoil and the danger for investors is that this will escalate into a broader battle, which could leave few sectors immune to trouble. Each of the major tech companies appears to have its own particular set of problems to deal with. Facebook - data security. Intel - Apple chips. Tesla - missed targets compounding fears of excessive leverage. Amazon - President Trump. However, the one thing these companies do have in common is that these stocks are held by most of the big popular global funds. This means that many investors may have substantial exposure, even if they are not direct shareholders, which makes the tech troubles a wider problem. Monday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s selloff was actually Wall Street\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s worst start to an April since 1929 -- a date etched in market memory thanks to the crash later that year. Now, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s just one day\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trading, but its not a great open for the second quarter either... Yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s selloff means America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s S&amp;P 500 has now shed 3.4% since the start of the year, while the Dow is down almost 5%. That follows a remarkable 2017, which saw the US stock market surge by around 25%. European markets have fallen down across the board in nervous trading, as traders rush to catch up with events after the Easter break. Jasper Lawler of CMC Markets says fears of a trade war are refusing to go away: On Monday China announced that it has implemented afforementioned tariffs on 128 types of US goods. Implementing the tariffs makes China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s response to Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s steel and aluminium tariffs official. China has to show it is serious. We still expect a settlement in trade negotiations between the two nations. Sentiment will be fragile until the result of trade negotiations become clear. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock market has fallen sharply at the start of trading. The FTSE 100 shed 54 points, or 0,7%, to 7001 points, as traders take their cue from yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s slide on Wall Street. The US president appears to have unnerved the markets, with his trade war rhetoric and attacks on Amazon. Hussein Sayed, chief market strategist at FXTM, explains: The fall in tech stocks and escalating trade tensions continued to rattle markets after the Easter break. This time, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tariffs and tech stocks driving the selloff, and I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think the U.S. President is doing himself any favors before the midterm elections. Beijing\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s response hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t been aggressive, by imposing levies on $3 billion worth of imports from the U.S.; the question now is - what\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s next? A tariff \u00e2\u20ac\u02dctit for tat\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 is a lose-lose scenario. So, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s likely that after this war of nerves, the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s two largest economies will find a middle ground. Markets should get used to Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s negotiating style - kicking off with something dramatic, and then scaling down through negotiation. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Fresh worries over a global trade war are rippling through the markets today, after China hit back against America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tariffs on steel and aluminium by targeting imports of food, wine, steel and even ginseng. The news that Beijing is imposing its own tariffs of up to 25% on more than 120 US products sparked a selloff on Wall Street last night, sending the S&amp;P into correction territory. The Dow plunged by over 700 points at one stage, before ending the day 458 points lower. With Donald Trump expected to announce new curbs on China soon, traders are worried that this tit-for-tat action could escalate. As David Madden of CMC Markets explains: Beijing decided to impose levies on approximately $3 billion worth of goods from the US. In the grand scheme of things, China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s response hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t been too aggressive, but dealers fear we could be starting a long trade war. The ball is now in Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s in court, and traders are waiting for the US President to make the next move. European markets were closed yesterday for Easter Monday, so we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re expecting losses of almost 1% on the main indices this morning. Trump has also put the technology sector into a spin, after sending a series of tweets criticising Amazon for avoiding taxes and not paying the US Post Office a fair rate. Amazon\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s share price tanked by over 5% on Monday, on concerns that the e-commerce giant is firmly in Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s firing line. Music streaming site Spotify will hope to ride out the market choppiness, when it lists its shares on the New York stock exchange for the first time. Spotify has taken the refreshing decision not to employ investment banks to underwrite its listing, so the launch could be more volatile than usual.

BT-owned EE, Vodafone, O2 and Three have paid close to double what many City analysts had expected Ofcom\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s auction to raise, as the mobile operators seek to open up a world of internet-connected world of driverless cars, smart home appliances, delivery drones and superfast video on the go. City analysts had a wide range of predictions on what the auction would net the government \u00e2\u20ac\u201c spanning \u00c2\u00a3630m to \u00c2\u00a31bn \u00e2\u20ac\u201c with the attractiveness of 5G services to consumers and mobile operators proving much more valuable. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Mobile network operators are willing to dig deep to acquire 5G spectrum \u00e2\u20ac\u201c evidently seeing it as a strategic necessity,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Dhananjay Mirchandani, a telecoms analyst at Bernstein. The big four operators have secured broadly the same amount of 5G spectrum to use after the auction. Vodafone won 50MHz of spectrum in the 3.4GHz frequency band auctioned paying \u00c2\u00a3378m, BT-owned EE won 40Mhz paying \u00c2\u00a3303m, Telef\u00c3\u00b3nica-owned O2 picked up 40MHz for \u00c2\u00a3318m, and Hutchison-owned Three spent \u00c2\u00a3151m on 20Mhz. Three UK had already secured a 40Mhz of 5G spectrum prior to the auction. 5G is set to be rolled out in the UK in the next decade and the mass connectivity it allows will help expand the so-called internet of things (IoT), in which appliances and devices wirelessly connect to the internet and each other.

It will also allow companies to prepare for 5G mobile, paving the way for a range of smart, connected devices.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Ofcom\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s auction also saw O2 win 40MHz of 4G spectrum (2.3Ghz) that was made available paying \u00c2\u00a3206m. The win was considered essential by analysts as O2 had the smallest share of the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s usable mobile spectrum. Parent company Telef\u00c3\u00b3nica\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s plans for a \u00c2\u00a310bn stock market flotation of O2 have been hampered over the last two years because of Brexit vote and market uncertainty. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The outcome for O2 UK is of particular importance given the potential IPO of this business after the auction,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Mirchandani. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153O2 went into the auction with the smallest spectrum portfolio.

A 10.6% rise in record-label earnings, to \u00c2\u00a3839m, came thanks to a 45% increase to \u00c2\u00a3347m in income from services such as Spotify, Apple Music and Amazon Music. Income from CD sales, formerly the cornerstone of the music money-making machine, remained almost flat at \u00c2\u00a3246m.</p> <p>The digital revolution has fuelled a democratisation of the industry, opening up the opportunity for fans to discover more of the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153long tail\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd of artists \u00e2\u20ac\u201c those beyond the traditional radio-dominating stars such as Taylor Swift, Adele and the ubiquitous Ed Sheeran.</p> <p>While more artists are sharing in the new digital bonanza, they are all having to get used to the idea that it is much harder to make money out of music than it used to be. The industry may be recovering, but it is still only worth two-thirds of what it was in 2001, the days of peak CD. Profit margins on CDs were a licence to print money: digital streaming royalties per track, not so much.</p> <p>And that is without starting on the music industry\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s unhappiness with YouTube paying a pittance for the hundreds of millions of music videos viewed on its site each year. The few million vinyl records sold provide more royalty income to artists than YouTube does.</p> <p>The profits of live music have never changed, hence the resurgence in popularity of touring to top up artists\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 bank accounts.</p> <p>Yet with Spotify\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s well-received $30bn stock-market listing, and Amazon reigniting the popularity of streaming music at home with its Echo smart speakers, digital income looks set to remain top of the pops.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"969f187862181102cc6d9bebec3661d93478a42c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/969f187862181102cc6d9bebec3661d93478a42c/0_300_4500_2700/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Uber and Jump: a pedestrian get-together?\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Uber and Jump: a pedestrian get-together?</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Brendan Smialowski/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Uber\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bikes are not a sign of back-pedalling<br></h2> <p>Uber\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s acquisition of US bike-hire firm Jump looks rather pedestrian by the standards of its own vaulting ambition, at least at first glance.</p> <p>Compared to moonshot ideas such as cars that can fly \u00e2\u20ac\u201c or the more tangible advance of driverless taxis \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Jump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s electric \u00e2\u20ac\u0153pedal-assisted\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd bikes might as well be Victorian-era penny-farthings. But the deal should not be seen in isolation. Uber does not need electric bikes to become the commuter\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s carriage of choice for the acquisition to make sense.</p> <p>Rather, it envisages a world in which most City-dwellers will have no need to own their own car, with an alternative available for any given journey. The Uber user of 2038 might hop into a driverless taxi to get to work, whizz round the corner for lunch on an electric bike, then impress their date by whisking them off for dinner in a flying limousine.</p> <p>Fanciful as that might be, the goal for Uber is not to hit every imaginable futuristic milestone. Instead, it is to have a foot in the door of whatever technological advances gain the most traction.</p> <p>This attitude is born of a mindset akin to that of the San Francisco firm\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s near neighbours in Silicon Valley, even if Uber\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bread and butter is a rather less glamorous mobile-phone-based taxi service.</p> <p>Unlike longstanding industries that have developed amid fierce competition and political opposition to monopolies, the likes of Facebook and Google emerged so quickly that, for them, world domination seems almost the natural order of things.</p> <p>That isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t to say that Uber, which is no stranger to regulatory resistance, will be allowed to lock competitors out of a sector as vast as transport. But it is already ubiquitous in much of the world, its name synonymous with what it does, much like Hoover in the UK or Xerox in the US.</p> <p>Coupled with its speculative investment in multiple modes of transport, that gives it a huge head start in the race towards the future.</p>",

The digital revolution has fuelled a democratisation of the industry, opening up the opportunity for fans to discover more of the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153long tail\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd of artists \u00e2\u20ac\u201c those beyond the traditional radio-dominating stars such as Taylor Swift, Adele and the ubiquitous Ed Sheeran. While more artists are sharing in the new digital bonanza, they are all having to get used to the idea that it is much harder to make money out of music than it used to be. The industry may be recovering, but it is still only worth two-thirds of what it was in 2001, the days of peak CD. Profit margins on CDs were a licence to print money: digital streaming royalties per track, not so much. And that is without starting on the music industry\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s unhappiness with YouTube paying a pittance for the hundreds of millions of music videos viewed on its site each year. The few million vinyl records sold provide more royalty income to artists than YouTube does. The profits of live music have never changed, hence the resurgence in popularity of touring to top up artists\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 bank accounts. Yet with Spotify\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s well-received $30bn stock-market listing, and Amazon reigniting the popularity of streaming music at home with its Echo smart speakers, digital income looks set to remain top of the pops. Uber\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bikes are not a sign of back-pedalling Uber\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s acquisition of US bike-hire firm Jump looks rather pedestrian by the standards of its own vaulting ambition, at least at first glance. Compared to moonshot ideas such as cars that can fly \u00e2\u20ac\u201c or the more tangible advance of driverless taxis \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Jump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s electric \u00e2\u20ac\u0153pedal-assisted\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd bikes might as well be Victorian-era penny-farthings. But the deal should not be seen in isolation. Uber does not need electric bikes to become the commuter\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s carriage of choice for the acquisition to make sense. Rather, it envisages a world in which most City-dwellers will have no need to own their own car, with an alternative available for any given journey. The Uber user of 2038 might hop into a driverless taxi to get to work, whizz round the corner for lunch on an electric bike, then impress their date by whisking them off for dinner in a flying limousine. Fanciful as that might be, the goal for Uber is not to hit every imaginable futuristic milestone. Instead, it is to have a foot in the door of whatever technological advances gain the most traction. This attitude is born of a mindset akin to that of the San Francisco firm\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s near neighbours in Silicon Valley, even if Uber\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bread and butter is a rather less glamorous mobile-phone-based taxi service. Unlike longstanding industries that have developed amid fierce competition and political opposition to monopolies, the likes of Facebook and Google emerged so quickly that, for them, world domination seems almost the natural order of things. That isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t to say that Uber, which is no stranger to regulatory resistance, will be allowed to lock competitors out of a sector as vast as transport. But it is already ubiquitous in much of the world, its name synonymous with what it does, much like Hoover in the UK or Xerox in the US. Coupled with its speculative investment in multiple modes of transport, that gives it a huge head start in the race towards the future.",

Primark, one suspects, wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be the same conquering force without AB Foods\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 willingness to experiment slowly, a quality that may flow from the 54.5% ownership by Wittington Investments, itself controlled by the charitable Garfield Weston Foundation. These days, Primark contributes just over half the group\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s operating profits: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/apr/17/primark-life-in-uk-high-street-yet\">\u00c2\u00a3341m out of \u00c2\u00a3648m at the half-year stage</a>.</p> \n<p>Primark\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s astonishing run hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t stopped the City fretting on two fronts. First, there is the worry that the chain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s refusal to sell online is a historic mistake. Second, is expansion into the US, graveyard of British retailers, a step too far? Amid the general gloominess about retailers, AB Foods\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 share price had fallen by a fifth in six months before Tuesday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 4% bounce.</p> \n<p>The US concern won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be answered quickly since some of the nine stores in the north-east have been open for less than a year. The company admits it is still tweaking ranges to improve sales densities. But the news that Primark is already looking to open a store in Florida suggests something is going right in the US.</p> \n<p>As for the supposed threat from online rivals, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hard to spot. Like-for-like for sales fell 1.5%, not helped by cold European weather, but the UK was up 3%. Between sermons on the effect on sugar prices from the end of EU quotas, management offered a persuasive argument that pinging promotional videos across Instagram is a smarter way to drive Primark sales than shouldering the distribution costs of an online shop.</p> \n<p>The store-only logic probably only applies at the cut-price end of the clothing market and, eventually, even Primark may have to rethink. But there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s currently no reason to mess with a formula that, even in a soft half-year, produced a profit margin of almost 10%. Most of the online-only brigade would love that.</p> \n<h2>Intu takeover: time to call it off?</h2> \n<p>Sadly for Intu, the shopping centre group, there aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t more Primarks. If there were, the owner of Lakeside and Trafford Centre wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have felt obliged to make an extended plea that everything in the world of malls is lovely, despite the rise of Amazon and the troubles of the likes of New Look, Toys R Us and Prezzo.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"3cec04db-2f8c-447b-a543-928aff466773\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p><strong>Retailers that have gone bust 2017-18</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><b>Toys R Us:</b> 180 stores employing 3,000 staff, collapsed 28 February.

That cause isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t completely hopeless since Hammerson chairman David Tyler would happily seal the deal if he had a free hand. He shares the view that good shopping centres have a decent future.</p> \n<p>The trouble is, Tyler and Hammerson\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s board must know their adventure is in deep trouble.

                "bodyText":"If Associated British Foods didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have a controlling shareholder, an uppity US hedge fund would probably have demanded the company be split into pieces years ago. Whitbread is somehow deemed offensively diverse because it owns Costa Coffee and Premier Inn, but take a look at AB Foods\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 portfolio: it runs from sugar production around the globe, takes in grocery brands such as Twinings, Ovaltine and Kingsmill, and has spawned discount clothing chain Primark. Outside shareholders should give thanks for the refusal to bend to the demand for focus. Primark, one suspects, wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be the same conquering force without AB Foods\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 willingness to experiment slowly, a quality that may flow from the 54.5% ownership by Wittington Investments, itself controlled by the charitable Garfield Weston Foundation. These days, Primark contributes just over half the group\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s operating profits: \u00c2\u00a3341m out of \u00c2\u00a3648m at the half-year stage. Primark\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s astonishing run hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t stopped the City fretting on two fronts. First, there is the worry that the chain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s refusal to sell online is a historic mistake. Second, is expansion into the US, graveyard of British retailers, a step too far? Amid the general gloominess about retailers, AB Foods\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 share price had fallen by a fifth in six months before Tuesday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 4% bounce. The US concern won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be answered quickly since some of the nine stores in the north-east have been open for less than a year. The company admits it is still tweaking ranges to improve sales densities. But the news that Primark is already looking to open a store in Florida suggests something is going right in the US. As for the supposed threat from online rivals, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hard to spot. Like-for-like for sales fell 1.5%, not helped by cold European weather, but the UK was up 3%. Between sermons on the effect on sugar prices from the end of EU quotas, management offered a persuasive argument that pinging promotional videos across Instagram is a smarter way to drive Primark sales than shouldering the distribution costs of an online shop. The store-only logic probably only applies at the cut-price end of the clothing market and, eventually, even Primark may have to rethink. But there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s currently no reason to mess with a formula that, even in a soft half-year, produced a profit margin of almost 10%. Most of the online-only brigade would love that. Intu takeover: time to call it off? Sadly for Intu, the shopping centre group, there aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t more Primarks. If there were, the owner of Lakeside and Trafford Centre wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have felt obliged to make an extended plea that everything in the world of malls is lovely, despite the rise of Amazon and the troubles of the likes of New Look, Toys R Us and Prezzo. The point of the breathless release about \u00e2\u20ac\u0153record retail demand\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and \u00e2\u20ac\u0153increased rents\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in its centres, one assumes, was to try to convince Hammerson not to walk away from its \u00c2\u00a33.4bn bid for Intu. That cause isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t completely hopeless since Hammerson chairman David Tyler would happily seal the deal if he had a free hand. He shares the view that good shopping centres have a decent future. The trouble is, Tyler and Hammerson\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s board must know their adventure is in deep trouble. Dutch pension fund group APG, the second-biggest shareholder in Hammerson with a 7% stake, is opposed to the Intu purchase and it won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be alone. Put simply, many Hammerson investors think their own company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s assets, including Brent Cross and Birmingham Bullring, are superior to Intu\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s estate with its rump of smaller centres.

If Intu won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t renegotiate terms, call the whole thing off. Time for a new broom at WPP?

                "bodyText":"The head of the International Monetary Fund, Christine Lagarde, has expressed concern about the market power wielded by the US technology giants and called for more competition to protect economies and individuals. Speaking at a press conference to mark the start of the IMF\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s spring meeting in Washington, Lagarde said breaking up companies was not the solution, but added that her organisation was monitoring their impact on prosperity, financial stability and the workplace. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Competition is needed. From competition you get productivity growth and innovation. Too much concentration, too much market power in the hands of the few is not helpful to the economy or to the wellbeing of individuals.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Pressure has been building in the US for antitrust laws to be used to break up some of the biggest companies, with Google, Facebook and Amazon all targeted by critics. Lagarde said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I am not sure breaking up some of the tech titans in this country [the US] or in other countries will be the right answer. It used to be the right answer, but when most of the assets are intangible, how do you break them up? How do you facilitate access and allow market disruptors to operate? I think that is where a lot of new thinking has to be done.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The IMF is carefully monitoring new digital currencies such as Bitcoin, which it says are prone to fraud and can be used for money laundering. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We have seen a flourishing of cryptocurrencies. There are now more than 100. That has stability implications eventually. We do not think it is systemic at this point in time but regulators and supervisors have to be watchful.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Lagarde expressed concern at the growing threat of a trade war between the US and China, saying that protectionism posed a threat to the upswing in the global economy and to an international system that had served countries well. She said the actual impact of the proposed US and Chinese tariffs would be small. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It is more difficult to measure the erosion of confidence.

Before entering the second world war, the richest 1% in the US held just under 20% of the national income. After the war, this fell steadily, reaching 10% by 1980. Since then, however, it has risen to be above 20%. A <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/grogonomics/2017/jul/25/bill-shortens-inequality-pitch-has-rustled-the-jimmies-of-conservatives\">similar, though less stark</a>, pattern has occurred in Australia as well. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Graph\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/0nKhj/1/\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>Stiglitz believes the post-second world war social contract began to erode in the US in the early 80s, and those who wanted to return to an older kind of capitalism marked by a high level of inequality stepped forward.</p> <p>Recent times have seen what he describes as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the weakening of unions, the weakening of the worker bargaining power and an assault on public education\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, he says. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been a whole set of things that has been a manifestation of the breakdown of the social contract.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd</p> <p>And then there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the rise of globalisation.</p> <p>Stiglitz, who has recently updated his 2002 work, Globalisation and its Discontents, to consider the impact of the Trump presidency, might be viewed as a critic of globalisation given his long-standing <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jan/10/in-2016-better-trade-agreements-trans-pacific-partnership\">criticism of the Trans Pacific Partnership</a>. However, he says there is no \u00e2\u20ac\u0153inconsistency between equality and globalisation, but it does mean that you have to manage globalisation in the right way\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd.</p> <p>For many countries, globalisation is not about free trade. Instead he sees it as an attack on workers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 bargaining rights. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Corporations were more interested in getting cheap labour \u00e2\u20ac\u201c they actually wanted the workers to suffer. They won when workers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 bargaining power was weaker, because that meant not only could they get cheaper labour abroad, they could get cheaper labour at home.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd</p> <p>He holds up Sweden as a better alternative for governments to follow. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153[Sweden] structured globalisation in such a way as to make sure that everybody was a winner. They made sure that they help people move from lost jobs to new jobs.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd</p> <p>Government revenue in Sweden is equivalent to about 50% of GDP, compared with total government revenue in Australia which is about 34%, and 31% in the US. </p> <p>Stiglitz recalls a former Swedish finance minister telling him the reason the country was successful was because it has a high tax rate. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not to say people were attracted by the higher tax rate. Instead, Stiglitz says, it means: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153If you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re going to have a roughly balanced budget and you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re going to provide the kind of environment that is attractive to business, you have to have a high tax rate to finance the technology, infrastructure and the education system that makes the society work.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>You feel the fear [the business community] have, the fear to criticise him unless they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll unleash a wave of tweets</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Stiglitz compared Sweden with the US rust belt states, such as Pennsylvania, West Virginia, Ohio, Michigan and Wisconsin, that have seen <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/mar/06/opioid-crisis-overdoses-increased-by-a-third-across-us-in-14-months-says-cdc\">a growing opioid crisis</a>, high alcoholism, poor education, and poor infrastructure, and are consequently unattractive locations for firms. He argues this because governments have consistently voted down taxes which impacted on the labour force. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Beneath the tip of the iceberg [of the drug overdoses] is a dispirited labour force,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he says.</p> <p>Rather than being the fault of globalisation, he says this is part of the outcome that the US Republican party has been working for \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a small government (but not necessarily small budget deficit) and a labour force with poor bargaining rights.</p> <p>Instead, he argues, it shows the need to acknowledge there are losers out of trade and that advanced countries such as Australia need to have policies that help those who are being disadvantaged by globalisation. This should include decent education and health policies.</p> <p>\u00e2\u20ac\u0153You need to ensure that people have the skills that make it easier to move from job to job,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he says, with \u00e2\u20ac\u0153some kind of social protection\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd.</p> <p>His comments on wage negotiation sit well with the latest ACTU <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/mar/21/sally-mcmanus-says-enterprise-bargaining-is-smothering-wage-growth\">proposals</a> to move away from a pure enterprise bargaining framework. </p> <p>In a speech last month at the National Press Club, the Australian Council of Trade Unions\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 secretary, Sally McManus,argued that enterprise bargaining, which was introduced by the Keating government in 1993, was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153so restrictive, excessively regulated\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd that it was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153smothering wage growth\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/mar/28/malcolm-turnbull-defiantly-sticks-to-business-tax-cut\">Malcolm Turnbull defiantly sticks to business tax cut</a> </p> </aside>  <p>This echoes the suggestions put forward recently by Tim Lyons, a former assistant secretary of the ACTU, who told Guardian Australia: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m increasingly of the view that we need to describe firm-level enterprise bargaining as a failure.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd</p> <p>Stiglitz agrees, saying that when the bargaining framework changes, like eliminating sectoral bargaining and implementing plant bargaining as occurred in Australia in the 1990s, unions can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t deliver.</p> <p>The answer is to band together. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153When groups of individuals realise that the only way they are going to better themselves is through collective action, I think it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s going to be more likely to occur.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd</p> <p>There is also room for the more interventionist industrial relations approach put forward by the ALP: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d like to believe that firms would be responsible and treat workers decently and pay them extra if they worked overtime, but I think the reality is that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s just not the case.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd </p> <p>Instead there needs to be strong government policies to protect workers.</p> <p>Recently Labor signalled it <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/jan/31/labor-signalling-much-more-aggressive-approach-to-raising-the-minimum-wage\">may push to raise the minimum wage</a>. This would be a good move, says Stiglitz, adding arguments against it in favour of the economy were weak. </p> <p>\u00e2\u20ac\u0153The overwhelming evidence is that moderate increases in the minimum wage do not have a negative effect on employment,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he says. For instance, in the US \u00e2\u20ac\u0153places such as Seattle have doubled the minimum wage from $7.25 to $15, <a href=\"http://irle.berkeley.edu/files/2017/Seattles-Minimum-Wage-Experiences-2015-16.pdf\">with no adverse effect</a>\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd.</p> <p>The Trump presidency is more likely to have an adverse effect on the American economy, he says.</p> <p>It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not a trade war with China, brought on by Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s recent tariff increases, that should be a concern, he says, mostly because the Chinese government chose to respond in a measured way.</p> <p>Instead the US economy could be threatened by Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s erratic behaviour and his willingness to attack individual firms.

                "bodyText":"Ask Nobel prize-winning economist Joseph Stiglitz for his thoughts on the Turnbull government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s arguments that cutting the company tax will lead to strong investment and higher wages, and he doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t mince words: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s any validity in it. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Firms locate in countries because of the quality of the infrastructure, the quality of the educated labour force, a whole set of aspects of the society and economy, and the tax rate is well down the list of concerns.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Rather than focus on company tax cuts, Stiglitz argues governments should seek to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153increase the wellbeing of the majority of people in the country with growth that is sustainable inclusive and democratic\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Stiglitz was speaking from his New York office on the eve of the announcement that he will receive this year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Sydney Peace prize. Each year the Sydney Peace Foundation honours a nominee who has promoted \u00e2\u20ac\u0153peace with justice\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, human rights and non-violence. The Columbia University professor and former chief economist at the World Bank joins past recipients such as the activist movement Black Lives Matter, the journalist Naomi Klein, Prof Noam Chomsky, and the former Irish president, Mary Robinson. Sign up to receive the top stories in Australia every day at noon Stiglitz is well-known for his criticism of trickle-down economics as well as his work on bridging the inequality gap. He says the argument in favour of cutting company tax to increase wages is a spurious one. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153In terms of economic analysis, there is very little evidence that [a company tax rate cut] actually even spurs investment,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he says. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Most investment at the margin is financed by debt, and the debt interest repayments are tax deductible. So while the tax rate affects the return, it also affects the cost of capital in exactly a symmetric way. And so at the margin there is essentially no effect on investment.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd In 2010 Stiglitz praised the stimulus measures put in place by the Rudd government during the GFC, describing it as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the best designed stimulus package of any ... advanced industrial countries\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Now he points to the response by companies in the United States after its recent company tax rate cut as evidence of the lack of impact on wages: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Corporations want people to believe that by cutting it that somehow workers are going to be better off.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd He calls the highly publicised wage rises that have followed the tax cuts in the US \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and which have been lauded by the treasurer, Scott Morrison, as evidence that such cuts lead to higher wages \u00e2\u20ac\u201c \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a big joke\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Earlier this year Morrison argued that companies would increase wages after a company tax cut, saying in an ABC interview: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve already got businesses saying that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s what their behaviour would be.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Stiglitz says companies pretended the tax cuts were a way to increase wages, but the reality was often very different. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153You had a company like Walmart that said now we have enough money, we can raise the wage by a dollar an hour. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Walmart were sitting on a lot of money. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not as though they could not afford it [before the tax cut]. They were using this in a very political way to persuade workers that the workers were the big beneficiaries of the tax cut.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u0153But the data since last year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tax cut shows that most of that money went to share buy-backs, some went to investment and very little went to workers.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd A survey by Just Capital which tracked 1,000 firms found 57% of the benefits of the tax cuts were going to shareholders, 27% towards investment and possible job creation and just 6% on higher wages. For Stiglitz, that such tax cuts continue to be propagated both in the US and in nations such as Australia is evidence of an economic system which is designed to help companies rather than increase the wellbeing of the majority of people in the country \u00e2\u20ac\u201c with growth that is sustainable, inclusive and democratic. He argues that the strand of economic policy of smaller government and lower taxes that took root in the early 1980s displayed a breakdown in the social contract that had existed since the end of the second world war. This certainly accords with studies on inequality such as those by Thomas Piketty and the OECD. Before entering the second world war, the richest 1% in the US held just under 20% of the national income. After the war, this fell steadily, reaching 10% by 1980. Since then, however, it has risen to be above 20%. A similar, though less stark, pattern has occurred in Australia as well. Stiglitz believes the post-second world war social contract began to erode in the US in the early 80s, and those who wanted to return to an older kind of capitalism marked by a high level of inequality stepped forward. Recent times have seen what he describes as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the weakening of unions, the weakening of the worker bargaining power and an assault on public education\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, he says. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been a whole set of things that has been a manifestation of the breakdown of the social contract.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd And then there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the rise of globalisation. Stiglitz, who has recently updated his 2002 work, Globalisation and its Discontents, to consider the impact of the Trump presidency, might be viewed as a critic of globalisation given his long-standing criticism of the Trans Pacific Partnership. However, he says there is no \u00e2\u20ac\u0153inconsistency between equality and globalisation, but it does mean that you have to manage globalisation in the right way\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. For many countries, globalisation is not about free trade. Instead he sees it as an attack on workers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 bargaining rights. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Corporations were more interested in getting cheap labour \u00e2\u20ac\u201c they actually wanted the workers to suffer. They won when workers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 bargaining power was weaker, because that meant not only could they get cheaper labour abroad, they could get cheaper labour at home.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd He holds up Sweden as a better alternative for governments to follow. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153[Sweden] structured globalisation in such a way as to make sure that everybody was a winner. They made sure that they help people move from lost jobs to new jobs.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Government revenue in Sweden is equivalent to about 50% of GDP, compared with total government revenue in Australia which is about 34%, and 31% in the US. Stiglitz recalls a former Swedish finance minister telling him the reason the country was successful was because it has a high tax rate. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not to say people were attracted by the higher tax rate. Instead, Stiglitz says, it means: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153If you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re going to have a roughly balanced budget and you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re going to provide the kind of environment that is attractive to business, you have to have a high tax rate to finance the technology, infrastructure and the education system that makes the society work.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Stiglitz compared Sweden with the US rust belt states, such as Pennsylvania, West Virginia, Ohio, Michigan and Wisconsin, that have seen a growing opioid crisis, high alcoholism, poor education, and poor infrastructure, and are consequently unattractive locations for firms. He argues this because governments have consistently voted down taxes which impacted on the labour force. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Beneath the tip of the iceberg [of the drug overdoses] is a dispirited labour force,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he says. Rather than being the fault of globalisation, he says this is part of the outcome that the US Republican party has been working for \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a small government (but not necessarily small budget deficit) and a labour force with poor bargaining rights. Instead, he argues, it shows the need to acknowledge there are losers out of trade and that advanced countries such as Australia need to have policies that help those who are being disadvantaged by globalisation. This should include decent education and health policies. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153You need to ensure that people have the skills that make it easier to move from job to job,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he says, with \u00e2\u20ac\u0153some kind of social protection\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. His comments on wage negotiation sit well with the latest ACTU proposals to move away from a pure enterprise bargaining framework. In a speech last month at the National Press Club, the Australian Council of Trade Unions\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 secretary, Sally McManus,argued that enterprise bargaining, which was introduced by the Keating government in 1993, was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153so restrictive, excessively regulated\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd that it was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153smothering wage growth\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. This echoes the suggestions put forward recently by Tim Lyons, a former assistant secretary of the ACTU, who told Guardian Australia: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m increasingly of the view that we need to describe firm-level enterprise bargaining as a failure.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Stiglitz agrees, saying that when the bargaining framework changes, like eliminating sectoral bargaining and implementing plant bargaining as occurred in Australia in the 1990s, unions can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t deliver. The answer is to band together. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153When groups of individuals realise that the only way they are going to better themselves is through collective action, I think it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s going to be more likely to occur.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd There is also room for the more interventionist industrial relations approach put forward by the ALP: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d like to believe that firms would be responsible and treat workers decently and pay them extra if they worked overtime, but I think the reality is that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s just not the case.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Instead there needs to be strong government policies to protect workers. Recently Labor signalled it may push to raise the minimum wage. This would be a good move, says Stiglitz, adding arguments against it in favour of the economy were weak. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The overwhelming evidence is that moderate increases in the minimum wage do not have a negative effect on employment,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he says. For instance, in the US \u00e2\u20ac\u0153places such as Seattle have doubled the minimum wage from $7.25 to $15, with no adverse effect\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. The Trump presidency is more likely to have an adverse effect on the American economy, he says. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not a trade war with China, brought on by Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s recent tariff increases, that should be a concern, he says, mostly because the Chinese government chose to respond in a measured way. Instead the US economy could be threatened by Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s erratic behaviour and his willingness to attack individual firms. One of his recent targets for example has been Amazon, along with its chief executive, Jeff Bezos, who is also the owner of the Washington Post. Stiglitz describes Trump as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153acting like a fascist\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s so dangerous having so much power in the hands of somebody who is so erratic and so unrestrained,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he says. He says the American business community is living in fear: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153You feel the fear they have, the fear to criticise him unless they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll unleash a wave of tweets. He has instilled a level of fear that I have never seen in this country.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Joseph Stiglitz will speak at events for the Sydney Peace Foundation in November.",

                "body":"<p>The sleek intercity train connecting Amsterdam to Rotterdam zips between the two cities in just 40 minutes and, with a walk-up price of just \u00e2\u201a\u00ac15.40 (\u00c2\u00a313.50), puts our fares to shame. The Dutch railways are still nationally owned, operated by Nederlandse Spoorwegen (NS), and the route between the two cities claims a 100% punctuality record. But the Dutch have been in uproar over what might be another record: one of the most shameful tax deals in Europe, and one that throws the spotlight once again on Ireland\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s dubious corporate tax policy.</p> <p>In recent years, the Dutch have been horrified to discover that while they buy their train tickets from a state-owned company, a significant chunk of the money has been funnelled through Ireland. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s because NS Financial Services, 100% owned by NS, bought the trains, then leased them back to NS, while being incorporated in Ireland. In doing so, its profits have come under Ireland\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 12.5% company tax rate, rather than the 25% prevailing in the Netherlands.</p> <p>The result? A state-owned Dutch company has, since 1998, paid around \u00e2\u201a\u00ac177.2m in tax to Ireland rather than to the Dutch ministry of finance, even though the ministry is the 100% shareholder of NS and the trains were operating entirely in the Netherlands. A further \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1bn in accumulated profits is understood to be held in Ireland. Furious Dutch MPs have roundly condemned the Dublin structure as unfair tax planning and tax avoidance.</p> <p>Anger over this deal has bubbled away for years, and NS has now caved into political pressure. In February it said <a href=\"https://www.nrc.nl/nieuws/2018/02/25/lease-ns-treinen-via-fiscaal-gunstige-ierse-route-beeindigd-a1593601\" title=\"\">all train leases had been moved back</a> to a subsidiary in the Netherlands.</p> <p>British train passengers (and NS owns Abellio, the operator for East Anglia) may be interested to learn that just along from NS\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s office at 10 Lower Mount Street, Dublin, lies the office of Eversholt Investment, at number 22 Lower Mount Street. What is Eversholt? One of the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s major train leasing companies, which boasts that it has \u00e2\u20ac\u0153<a href=\"https://www.eversholtrail.co.uk/fleet-portfolio\" title=\"\">approximately one quarter of the UK passenger rolling stock leasing market\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd</a>.</p> <p>Eversholt UK Rails Ltd made a profit of \u00c2\u00a343m and had net assets of \u00c2\u00a3764m in 2016. Its Dublin subsidiary Eversholt Investment is one of three companies Eversholt has incorporated in the republic. In 2015 the subsidiary paid \u00c2\u00a320.7m in dividends, and another \u00c2\u00a314.7m in 2016. Asked why it has businesses incorporated in Ireland, Eversholt said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Since December 2015 all leasing income of the group has been subject to UK corporation tax. The Irish structure was put in place by previous owners and the legacy structure is being unwound as part of an ongoing corporate simplification.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd</p> <p>One can only conclude from this that the British public has also, until relatively recently, been denied tax revenues, with the money diverted instead to the Irish exchequer.</p> <p>These tax structures based around Ireland\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ultra-low tax rate are entirely legal, but morally ambiguous, to put it mildly. Last week the International Monetary Fund identified that fully a quarter of Ireland\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s super-soaraway 7.8% GDP growth in 2017 was down to a bit of paper-shuffling whereby Apple books the intellectual property of its iPhones, made in Korea and Taiwan, through an Irish subsidiary. The real economic impact and real jobs generated are negligible.</p> <p>But the practice does mean that Ireland picks up tax revenues from Apple and other multinationals which by any moral measure should be paid elsewhere at a higher rate. Ireland\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s corporation tax haul soared from \u00c2\u00a33.5bn in 2011 to \u00c2\u00a38.2bn last year. And now that the UK is departing the EU, Ireland has lost a friend in Europe.</p> <p>Dublin may regard its 12.5% rate as a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153red line\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in negotiations, but without London\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s resistance, it can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be long before a Franco-German alliance demands harmonisation of corporation tax across the EU. The days of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153leprechaun economics\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd are surely numbered.</p> <h2>Act now to save the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s high streets, Mr Hammond</h2> <p>There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a new trend sweeping the high street this spring but it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not the lilac blazers and cowboy boots predicted by the fashion press: it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shrinking stores.</p> <p>It is particularly in vogue in the struggling department store sector, where Debenhams wants to prune at least 30 stores and House of Fraser wants to slash its high street footprint by a third.</p> <p>The death of the department store has long been predicted as shopping habits change, and after a year in which pre-tax profits tumbled 85%, Debenhams didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t look too lively when it updated investors last week.</p> <p>After a series of missteps, boss <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/may/26/debenhams-hires-amazons-sergio-bucher-as-new-chief-executive\" title=\"\">Sergio Bucher</a>, hired 18 months ago to lead a turnaround, is under growing pressure to show he can dig the retailer out of a hole that has also seen the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s value crash from more than \u00c2\u00a31bn to just short of \u00c2\u00a3300m in three years.</p> <p>His grand plan is to turn its dowdy department stores into places for a day out, with space for restaurants, gyms and hair salons, to give them more oomph in a digital age.

                "bodyText":"The sleek intercity train connecting Amsterdam to Rotterdam zips between the two cities in just 40 minutes and, with a walk-up price of just \u00e2\u201a\u00ac15.40 (\u00c2\u00a313.50), puts our fares to shame. The Dutch railways are still nationally owned, operated by Nederlandse Spoorwegen (NS), and the route between the two cities claims a 100% punctuality record. But the Dutch have been in uproar over what might be another record: one of the most shameful tax deals in Europe, and one that throws the spotlight once again on Ireland\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s dubious corporate tax policy. In recent years, the Dutch have been horrified to discover that while they buy their train tickets from a state-owned company, a significant chunk of the money has been funnelled through Ireland. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s because NS Financial Services, 100% owned by NS, bought the trains, then leased them back to NS, while being incorporated in Ireland. In doing so, its profits have come under Ireland\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 12.5% company tax rate, rather than the 25% prevailing in the Netherlands. The result? A state-owned Dutch company has, since 1998, paid around \u00e2\u201a\u00ac177.2m in tax to Ireland rather than to the Dutch ministry of finance, even though the ministry is the 100% shareholder of NS and the trains were operating entirely in the Netherlands. A further \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1bn in accumulated profits is understood to be held in Ireland. Furious Dutch MPs have roundly condemned the Dublin structure as unfair tax planning and tax avoidance. Anger over this deal has bubbled away for years, and NS has now caved into political pressure. In February it said all train leases had been moved back to a subsidiary in the Netherlands. British train passengers (and NS owns Abellio, the operator for East Anglia) may be interested to learn that just along from NS\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s office at 10 Lower Mount Street, Dublin, lies the office of Eversholt Investment, at number 22 Lower Mount Street. What is Eversholt? One of the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s major train leasing companies, which boasts that it has \u00e2\u20ac\u0153approximately one quarter of the UK passenger rolling stock leasing market\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Eversholt UK Rails Ltd made a profit of \u00c2\u00a343m and had net assets of \u00c2\u00a3764m in 2016. Its Dublin subsidiary Eversholt Investment is one of three companies Eversholt has incorporated in the republic. In 2015 the subsidiary paid \u00c2\u00a320.7m in dividends, and another \u00c2\u00a314.7m in 2016. Asked why it has businesses incorporated in Ireland, Eversholt said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Since December 2015 all leasing income of the group has been subject to UK corporation tax. The Irish structure was put in place by previous owners and the legacy structure is being unwound as part of an ongoing corporate simplification.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd One can only conclude from this that the British public has also, until relatively recently, been denied tax revenues, with the money diverted instead to the Irish exchequer. These tax structures based around Ireland\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ultra-low tax rate are entirely legal, but morally ambiguous, to put it mildly. Last week the International Monetary Fund identified that fully a quarter of Ireland\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s super-soaraway 7.8% GDP growth in 2017 was down to a bit of paper-shuffling whereby Apple books the intellectual property of its iPhones, made in Korea and Taiwan, through an Irish subsidiary. The real economic impact and real jobs generated are negligible. But the practice does mean that Ireland picks up tax revenues from Apple and other multinationals which by any moral measure should be paid elsewhere at a higher rate. Ireland\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s corporation tax haul soared from \u00c2\u00a33.5bn in 2011 to \u00c2\u00a38.2bn last year. And now that the UK is departing the EU, Ireland has lost a friend in Europe. Dublin may regard its 12.5% rate as a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153red line\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in negotiations, but without London\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s resistance, it can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be long before a Franco-German alliance demands harmonisation of corporation tax across the EU. The days of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153leprechaun economics\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd are surely numbered. Act now to save the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s high streets, Mr Hammond There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a new trend sweeping the high street this spring but it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not the lilac blazers and cowboy boots predicted by the fashion press: it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shrinking stores. It is particularly in vogue in the struggling department store sector, where Debenhams wants to prune at least 30 stores and House of Fraser wants to slash its high street footprint by a third. The death of the department store has long been predicted as shopping habits change, and after a year in which pre-tax profits tumbled 85%, Debenhams didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t look too lively when it updated investors last week. After a series of missteps, boss Sergio Bucher, hired 18 months ago to lead a turnaround, is under growing pressure to show he can dig the retailer out of a hole that has also seen the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s value crash from more than \u00c2\u00a31bn to just short of \u00c2\u00a3300m in three years. His grand plan is to turn its dowdy department stores into places for a day out, with space for restaurants, gyms and hair salons, to give them more oomph in a digital age. But the current retail backdrop is increasingly unforgiving, as spending falters at a time when the cost of running shops is rising. Bucher \u00e2\u20ac\u201c who joined Debenhams from Amazon \u00e2\u20ac\u201c railed against a business-rates regime that gives internet rivals a leg up. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The government is responsible to make sure we have an even playing field,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Right now, business rates give an unfair advantage to online pure-play competitors.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The numbers are big. In April, the struggling retail sector was hit with a \u00c2\u00a3226m increase in rates, according to advisory firm Altus Group. Debenhams pays \u00c2\u00a380m a year. Last year the chancellor Philip Hammond promised to look at how digital players are taxed, but since then there has been a deafening silence. What will it take to get the government to act? Interest rate rise won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be blown off the agenda by bad weather After basking in temperatures warmer than parts of California in recent days, the freezing conditions and heavy snows of last month might seem a distant memory. But over at Threadneedle Street, the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153beast from the east\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd has policymakers at the Bank of England fretting over the health of the economy. GDP growth is forecast to have fallen by half as diggers and cranes fell idle and shoppers stayed at home. Inflation dropped further than expected and retail sales figures were particularly weak. Mark Carney, the Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s governor, hinted rates could remain on hold at 0.5% as a consequence. But one of the other nine members of the monetary policy committee set to make a call on 10 May, Michael Saunders, reckons the fears are overblown. He says the British economy could withstand rates as high as 2% in the coming years. But the Bank needs to be careful.

The big supermarkets have recently cut thousands of back-office and shopfloor jobs in a drive to cut costs.

                "bodyText":"Sainsbury\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s and Asda are in talks over a \u00c2\u00a310bn merger that would send shockwaves through the high street by creating a retailer more powerful than the current market leader, Tesco. A tie-up between the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s second- and third-largest supermarket chains would create a new group with huge share of the market in food, clothing, household goods and toy retailing. Sainsbury\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s already owns Argos while Asda\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s George clothing brand vies with Marks &amp; Spencer and Primark to sell the most clothing in volume terms. The enlarged supermarket group would have nearly 3,000 stores and annual sales of more than \u00c2\u00a350bn. Any proposed deal is likely to be closely scrutinised by the competition watchdog over concerns it would tighten the grip the four major supermarket chains \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Tesco, Sainsbury\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s, Asda and Morrisons \u00e2\u20ac\u201c have on the UK grocery market. Analysts also suggest the combination could lead to thousands of job losses as the two chains cut out duplication. The big supermarkets have recently cut thousands of back-office and shopfloor jobs in a drive to cut costs. They are trying to rebuild their profits, which have collapsed as the fast-growing German discounters Aldi and Lidl have stolen shoppers, while online players led by Amazon have sucked sales out of the high street. Mike Coupe, the chief executive of London-based Sainsbury\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s, is said to be in the driving seat, making the future of Asda\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Leeds head office look uncertain. A combination of the two groups would be expected to strip out costs by consolidating back-office operations. Asda is run by a former Sainsbury\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s executive, Roger Burnley, who quit the group for a more senior role at the rival in 2015. Sainsbury\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s confirmed it was in talks with the US retail giant Walmart, which has owned Asda since 1999. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Sainsbury\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s confirms that it and Walmart Inc are in advanced discussions regarding a combination of the Sainsbury\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s and Asda businesses,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd the company said in statement rushed out on Saturday afternoon after Sky News and the newswire Bloomberg both reported the story. Sainsbury\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s promised to provide more details to the stock exchange on Monday morning. It has previously been unthinkable that there would be consolidation among the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s big four supermarkets because of competition concerns, but the retailers are said to have been emboldened after the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) waved through the merger of Tesco and Booker, the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest retailer and grocery wholesaler respectively. The deal comes at a time of major upheaval in the retail sector as Aldi and Lidl become increasingly powerful and the cost of running high street stores increases because of higher business rates and labour costs. Sainsbury\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s is also looking for ways to shore up its market position in the wake of Tesco\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s recent takeover of Booker. That deal increased Tesco\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s buying power by creating a food group with sales of \u00c2\u00a357.5bn. Sainsbury\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s has a network of more than 1,400 supermarkets and convenience stores while Asda has around 600 stores. Sainsbury\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also has 800 Argos outlets. The most recent market share data from the grocery experts Kantar Worldpanel puts Tesco, the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s longstanding UK number one, in the lead with a 27.6%. Sainsbury\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s and Asda command shares of 15.8% and 15.6% respectively, which means the combined business would ring up more 31.4% of UK grocery sales. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hard to see this being good for consumers,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Scott Corfe, the chief economist at the Social Market Foundation thinktank. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Recent experience, with the rise of Aldi and Lidl triggering a supermarket price war, supports the case for a less concentrated groceries sector - not a more concentrated one.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd It is unclear how the deal between Sainsbury\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s and Asda might be structured. Sainsbury\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s is listed in London and it is understood US-listed Walmart intends to retain a large shareholding in the enlarged group. Further clarity is expected on Monday. The Usdaw union\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s national officer, Joanne McGuinness, said it would be seeking urgent meetings with the businesses to get more detail on what a merger would involve. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Our priorities will be to protect our members and ensure any deal between the retailers does not impact on their jobs or incomes,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd she said. If the merger happens it would be biggest shake-up in UK grocery retailing since Morrisons took over Safeway in 2004. Analysts debated the merits of the proposed deal on social media, with many convinced competition concerns would force the companies to sell off a large number of stores. Bryan Roberts, a TCC Global analyst, also questioned the logic of the deal. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t see what problems this solves. They will still be unable to be cheaper than Aldi and Lidl because they have a unique operating model. I was also expect that there would need to be a chunky disposal programme once the CMA has looked at local competition issues.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd",

                "body":"<p>It all started in the summer of 2009. Barack Obama was six months into his presidency and desperate for some good economic news. The US had just suffered its deepest post-war recession, <a href=\"https://data.bls.gov/timeseries/LNS14000000\" title=\"\">unemployment was heading for 10%</a> and Washington had been forced to bail out the banks.</p> <p>But in June of that year, the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s second-biggest economy turned the corner. A recovery began that has continued uninterrupted ever since. At the end of this month, the US will have enjoyed its second-longest period of economic expansion in history, beating the upswing under John F Kennedy and Lyndon Johnson between 1961 and 1968.</p> <p>By next summer, if nothing untoward happens, Donald Trump will be able to boast that the US has beaten the record 10-year period of growth between the end of the Gulf war in 1991 and the 2001 dotcom bust. Expect a flurry of self-congratulatory tweets from the White House.</p> <p>The reasons for America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s recovery are simple. Interest rates were cut quickly and aggressively by the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s central bank, the Federal Reserve, and kept at rock-bottom levels for seven years. The Fed also pumped trillions of dollars into the economy through the process known as quantitative easing \u00e2\u20ac\u201c buying bonds to expand the money supply.</p> <p>Swift action was taken to clean up the financial system so that the banks could start lending again. Obama announced a modest package of tax cuts and spending increases. Lessons were learned from the mistakes of the Great Depression in the 1930s, when demand was sucked out of an already weak economy and banks were allowed to fail.</p> <p>Taken together, the measures got the US slowly moving again. It helped that the authorities in Beijing were simultaneously using even more aggressive measures \u00e2\u20ac\u201c big infrastructure projects and expansion of credit \u00e2\u20ac\u201c to stimulate the Chinese economy.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9bb82956ff6ec2b8f83746486a0767a97fd7f28d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9bb82956ff6ec2b8f83746486a0767a97fd7f28d/0_0_2616_1569/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Obama passed a package of measures in 2009 to go alongside the Fed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s drastic rate cuts.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Obama passed a package of measures in 2009 to go alongside the Fed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s drastic rate cuts.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Susan Walsh/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The subsequent recovery has been long but, by American standards, weak. Traditionally, the US has recovered sharply from downturns and had several years of fast growth. In the 1960s, for example, the US economy grew by 4.9% a year on average while in the 1990s it expanded by 3.6% a year on average. The average during the current expansion is 2.2% and it is the first business cycle since the second world war in which there has not been a single year of growth above 3%.</p> <p>At 1.4% a year, employment growth has also been modest. America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hire-and-fire culture has meant workers can be laid off in large numbers during recessions and then taken on again during the subsequent recoveries.

                "bodyText":"It all started in the summer of 2009. Barack Obama was six months into his presidency and desperate for some good economic news. The US had just suffered its deepest post-war recession, unemployment was heading for 10% and Washington had been forced to bail out the banks. But in June of that year, the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s second-biggest economy turned the corner. A recovery began that has continued uninterrupted ever since. At the end of this month, the US will have enjoyed its second-longest period of economic expansion in history, beating the upswing under John F Kennedy and Lyndon Johnson between 1961 and 1968. By next summer, if nothing untoward happens, Donald Trump will be able to boast that the US has beaten the record 10-year period of growth between the end of the Gulf war in 1991 and the 2001 dotcom bust. Expect a flurry of self-congratulatory tweets from the White House. The reasons for America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s recovery are simple. Interest rates were cut quickly and aggressively by the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s central bank, the Federal Reserve, and kept at rock-bottom levels for seven years. The Fed also pumped trillions of dollars into the economy through the process known as quantitative easing \u00e2\u20ac\u201c buying bonds to expand the money supply. Swift action was taken to clean up the financial system so that the banks could start lending again. Obama announced a modest package of tax cuts and spending increases. Lessons were learned from the mistakes of the Great Depression in the 1930s, when demand was sucked out of an already weak economy and banks were allowed to fail. Taken together, the measures got the US slowly moving again. It helped that the authorities in Beijing were simultaneously using even more aggressive measures \u00e2\u20ac\u201c big infrastructure projects and expansion of credit \u00e2\u20ac\u201c to stimulate the Chinese economy. The subsequent recovery has been long but, by American standards, weak. Traditionally, the US has recovered sharply from downturns and had several years of fast growth. In the 1960s, for example, the US economy grew by 4.9% a year on average while in the 1990s it expanded by 3.6% a year on average. The average during the current expansion is 2.2% and it is the first business cycle since the second world war in which there has not been a single year of growth above 3%. At 1.4% a year, employment growth has also been modest. America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hire-and-fire culture has meant workers can be laid off in large numbers during recessions and then taken on again during the subsequent recoveries. In the 1980s upswing, for instance, jobs growth averaged 2.8% a year. Nor has the recovery followed Kennedy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s dictum that a rising tide should lift all boats. Half of the growth during Obama\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s presidency went to the top 1% of US households, with the lack of real income growth for middle America helping to explain both the muted nature of the upswing and the discontent that propelled Trump to the presidency. Dario Perkins, managing director of global macroeconomics at the research company TS Lombard, says the US is not alone in having experienced a long period of growth. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Among the developed economies, Australia, Sweden, Germany and Canada all have expansions that match or surpass the US achievement. And if we extend the analysis to the emerging economies, we find several countries with even more impressive performances.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Europe, which suffered a double-dip recession and only began a sustained pick-up in 2013, is the one part of the world where the recovery looks relatively immature, Perkins says. All upturns come to an end sooner or later and the fact that it is now almost nine years since the US emerged from recession has inevitably led to speculation about when and how the next downturn will arrive. The International Monetary Fund is worried by Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s protectionist rhetoric, with its chief economist, Maurice Obstfeld, warning at its spring meeting earlier this month that there was a risk of the global trading system being torn apart. Keith Wade, chief economist and strategist at the investment firm Schroders, believes Trump is trying to extract concessions from China before the US midterm elections this November rather than seeking to start a trade war. Nor does he think there is a high probability of the US being derailed by a hard landing for the Chinese economy caused by the collapse of its credit bubble. That leaves two remaining triggers.

Today, it looks closer than ever to being within our grasp.</p> </blockquote> <p>Haldane argued that behavioural economists could explore \u00e2\u20ac\u0153non-traditional means\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd when trying to forecast how people will behave....</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>To give one recent example, data on music downloads from Spotify has been used, in tandem with semantic search techniques applied to the words of songs, to provide an indicator of people\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sentiment. Intriguingly, the resulting index of sentiment does at least as well in tracking consumer spending as the Michigan survey of consumer confidence.</p> <p>And why stop at music? People\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tastes in books, TV and radio may also offer a window on their soul. So too might their taste in games. Indeed, I am interested in the potential for using gaming techniques, not just to extract data on people\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s preferences, but as a means of generating data on preferences and actions.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Haldane</strong> also suggests that today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s massive multiplayer online games could work as a sandbox for economists to examine behaviour -- to aid forecasting the next time there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a crisis.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>A gaming environment could be used to understand behaviour in a way which placed fewer restrictions. People\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s behaviour would be observed directly in the act of game-playing which, provided this behaviour was a reasonable reflection of true behaviour, would give us new data. Because this is a virtual rather than real world, with shocks controlled and regulated, that could make it easier to address issues of causality and identification in response to shocks, including policy shocks.</p> <p>There are already multi-person games with primitive economies attached to them, which allow goods and monies to change hands between participants. These include EVE Online and World of Warcraft. </p> </blockquote> <p><strong><a href=\"https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/-/media/boe/files/speech/2018/will-big-data-keep-its-promise-speech-by-andy-haldane.pdf?la=en&amp;hash=00A4AB2F080BDCDB1781D11DF6EC9BDA560F3D98\">The speech is online here</a></strong>.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5ae70e65e4b05b151652c6bc\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-04-30T13:38:43.802Z\">2.38pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>The Press Association have published <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2018/apr/30/sainsburys-asda-merger-biggest-supermarket-tsb-banking-business-live?page=with:block-5ae6af2ae4b0ed4091d28869#block-5ae6af2ae4b0ed4091d28869\">a Q&amp;A on the Sainsbury-Asda deal</a>.</strong></p> <p><em>Q: What will it mean for shop prices? </em></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The two supermarket giants have pledged to invest the cost efficiencies generated from the merger into lower prices.</p> <p>Sainsbury\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s expects to save \u00c2\u00a3500m from merging with Asda, and has said it will lower shop prices by 10% on everyday products.</p> <p>However, this could have more widespread implications for shop prices if discounters Aldi and Lidl decide to cut their prices even further to stay ahead of their main-market rivals.</p> <p>Laith Khalaf, senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The executives of other supermarkets will have their heads in their hands at the prospect of another price war.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd</p> </blockquote> <p><em>Q: What will it mean for stores? </em></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) will soon start its investigation of the proposed merger, raising the prospect that Sainsbury\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s and Asda will be forced to sell off stores if they directly compete in local areas. </p> <p>However, Sainsbury\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s insisted on Monday that it does not expect to shut any stores.

As of Thursday 26th April, we were able to serve c.450,000.

As of Friday 27th April this had risen to approximately 93%. This is typical of the proportion we would have seen pre-migration. </p> </blockquote> <p>Pester also confirms that more than 400 customers saw another customer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s account details - because the two accounts were linked:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>TSB, like many other banks, enable customers to nominate a third party to have access to their accounts - these are called nominee accounts. Typically this will be a parent having access to a child\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s account or a grown-up child managing an ageing parent\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s account. The ability for the third party to see the customer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s account information is usually limited to branch and telephony channels.</p> <p>However, on the evening of Sunday 22nd April access was provided via digital channels. In addition, as well as enabling the third party to see the customer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s data, the customer was able to see the third party\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s data. Therefore, in the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153parent and child\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd example, the parent could see the child\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s transaction data but the child could also see the parent\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s transaction data.</p> <p> This explains some of the comments in social media where customers expecting to be overdrawn (the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153child\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd) could see large credit balances (the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153parent\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd).

The deep-discounters have disrupted the UK supermarket sector severely, and now have a combined market share of approximately 12%. Sainsbury\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s and Asda are the second and third-largest supermarkets by market share, and should the deal go ahead, it would put them in first place.

It will also mark Walmart\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s operational exit from the UK, as part of its strategic decisions to instead work through partnerships in international markets.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Amisha Chohan, e</strong>quity research analyst at <strong>Quilter Cheviot</strong>, says the deal is a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153masterstroke\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd - as long as the CMA approve it.<br></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It would result in the company becoming the biggest grocer in the UK, ahead of Tesco. Its guided net synergies of over \u00c2\u00a3500m seem prudent and we believe it could be significantly in excess of this. Sainsbury\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s experience from the Argos acquisition should enable it to deliver ahead of the synergy guidance.</p> <p>Although this news is not ideal for Tesco, we remain positive on the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s current largest retailer due its recent takeover of Booker, and the wholesale opportunities this will bring.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Paul Mumford</strong> of <strong>Cavendish Asset Management</strong> believes Sainsbury\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s and Asda will be forced to sell some stores to get this deal \u00e2\u20ac\u0153through the hoop\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd:<br></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Store disposals could naturally be offered to others in the sector with M+S and Morrisons being the most likely tenants, but it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hardly the best climate to be a net seller of large retail space. There will of course be some management synergies too, so a proclamation of no job cuts will no doubt be reversed soon enough. </p> <p>This will obviously create a mighty force. But the big questions now are what influence will Walmart have on the group? And where does this leave other players? Sainsburys already has a big challenge to show that the Argos acquisition is bearing fruit, and now it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s faced with driving cost synergies from Asda. The indicated 10% lower prices on regularly bought products will have raised eyebrows amongst the food producers who will fear another squeeze on margins. </p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5ae6df4ae4b05b151652c4e4\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-04-30T09:26:09.192Z\">10.26am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Competition authorities: We'll take a look</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s competition watchdog have confirmed they are likely to review the Sainsbury-Asda deal.</strong></p> <p><a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/sainsburys-asda-proposed-merger\">In a statement</a>, the Competition and Markets Authority says:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>This merger is likely to be subject to review by the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA).</p> </blockquote> <p>The CMA adds that it will assess whether the merger is bad for customers.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>During a Phase 1 review, the CMA would assess whether the deal could reduce competition and choice for shoppers.</p> <p>After this first phase, the merger could be cleared or, if a potential reduction in competition is identified, it would be referred for an in-depth, Phase 2 investigation lasting up to 24 weeks - unless the merging parties offered immediate proposals to address any competition concerns identified.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5ae6dd99e4b026c402d87ca1\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-04-30T09:17:23.769Z\">10.17am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>The surge in Sainsbury\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shares this morning is a blow to speculators who have been betting against the supermarket.</strong></p> <p>Some major hedge funds have been \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcshorting\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Sainsbury\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shares recently, by selling borrowed shares and hoping to buy them back cheaper in future.

                "bodyText":"Time for a recap: Sainsbury\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s is on track to become Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest supermarket after agreeing a deal with Asda\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s owner, Walmart. Under the deal, Walmart will own 42% of the combined company, which will control around a third of supermarket revenues. The two companies have agreed that prices could fall by up to 10% on some popular items if the deal is approved. They have also pledged not to close stores or lay off store staff - however, analysts believe some stores will be sold off to rivals. My colleague Sarah Butler explains: The merger of the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s second and third largest retailers is expected to trigger a major inquiry which analysts predict will result in at least 75 stores having to be disposed of. It would be the biggest shake-up in the market since the merger of Morrison and Safeway in 2003 when dozens of stores changed hands. Sainsbury\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s takeover of Asda is not expected to complete until the second half of next year as regulators crunch the numbers on potential overlap between the two groups\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 stores. Mike Coupe, the Sainsbury\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chief executive who plans to lead the merged business, said the deal was a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153transformational opportunity to create a new force in UK retail, which will be more competitive and give customers more of what they want now and in the future\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Shares in Sainsbury\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s have surged 15% today, closing at their highest level since the summer of 2014. MPs have warned that the deal could cost jobs, hurt competition, and lead to store closures - despite Sainsbury and Asda\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s promises. Labour are calling for an full, urgent probe into the deal. Government minister Andrew Griffiths, though, has argued that the retail sector is going through tough times - and that Sainsbury and Asda are trying to get ahead of the curve. In banking, TSB customers are still struggling to access their accounts after more than a week of disruption. Lloyds Bank has also suffered from IT gremlins today, with some users unable to get its app to work. The Treasury Committee has announced that it will question TSB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chief, Paul Pester, on Wednesday. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s all for today. Thanks for reading and commenting. GW Back in the City, shares in Sainsbury have closed 15% higher, as traders welcome its proposed takeover of Asda. That adds some \u00c2\u00a3858m to Sainsbury\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s market capitalisation, pushing it up to \u00c2\u00a36.78bn. Asked again about the future of stores, minister Andrew Griffiths repeats that Sainsbury and Asda are pledging that no stores will close, and no jobs within stores will be lost. But Labour MP Justin Madders isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t convinced - he says workers will pay the price of the \u00c2\u00a3500m of efficiency savings planned under the deal. Q: Attacks on terms and conditions are inevitable; what will the minister do in two years when that has happened? Griffiths replies that his powers were laid out in the Enterprise Act 2002 -- the decision on whether to allow the deal now rests with the CMA. And that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the end of the urgent question. Jack Dromey MP, a former top official at the Unite union, tells the House that supermarkets are powerful, as employers and across their supply chains. They must not be allowed to abuse that power, Dromey tells fellow MPs. Does the minister understand the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153dismay\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd among employees about this deal, which came \u00e2\u20ac\u0153out of the blue\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd at the weekend. Dromey accuses Griffiths of \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcwaxing lyrical\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 about Sainsbury and Asda\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s promises (for example...); will he act to ensure that these are not just Day One guarantees, but can be counted on in years to come? Griffiths replies that it is \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcearly days\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, and points out that the current government brought in the Groceries Code Adjudicator to protect farmers and other suppliers. Q: How long will workers and customers face uncertainty over this deal, and what impact will this have on portfolio investment? Andrew Griffiths says that Sainsbury and Asda hope the CMA will hold a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcfast-track\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 review. If that happens, then the detailed Phase 2 investigation could be completed in six months. Labour MP Susan Elan Jones asks a straight question -- does the minister think this is a good deal or a bad deal for British farming? But she doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get a straight answer. Minister Andrew Griffiths says the deal must be considered by the shareholders of Asda and Sainsbury\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u201c so it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not appropriate for the government to pass judgement. Labour\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Chris Matheson is also worried that jobs will be lost among the distribution chain that serve Sainsbury and Asda stores today. Matheson points out that many distribution centres were sighted to replace lost manufacturing jobs; what guarantees can the government give to those \u00e2\u20ac\u0153difficult areas\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd? Andrew Griffiths says his constituency, Burton, contains some distribution jobs (it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s in the middle of the country). However, he makes two points: First of all... the number of supermarkets served will be the same if the deal goes through, so the number of lorries and goods will be the same Second, the issue of job losses is not one that the government can consider under the Enterprise Act. Philip Hollobone, Conservative MP for Kettering, says his constituency currently has a large Sainsbury\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s and a large Asda. Workers and shoppers want to know - will we still have both stores in two years time? In reply, minister Andrew Griffiths says that Kettering shoppers and workers want to know they have choice and competition, and that those jobs are protected. If they are both \u00e2\u20ac\u0153thriving supermarkets\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, either the CMA will decide there isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t a competition issue and allow the combined company to keep running both, or it will say there are competition issues, and one will be sold, Griffiths explains. Conservative MP Stephen Kerr says the concentration of supermarket power could have a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153potentially devastating effect\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd on suppliers. Will their voices be heard? Griffiths replies that suppliers will be included in the CMA\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s investigation. The CMA will consider what happens in constituencies where there currently Sainsbury and Asda stores close together, Andrew Griffiths says. If they believe it will be anti-competitive for both supermarkets to be there, they will force a sale to a competitor. Conservative MP Mark Menzies says he worked in Asda\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s head office for 11 years. He doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t believe \u00e2\u20ac\u0153that place\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd will be there in a few years, so there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no point the government trying to make promises about jobs. Menzies also criticises the government for calling the deal a merger - it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a takeover by Sainsbury\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s, he insists, so \u00e2\u20ac\u0153lets stop using false terminology\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Finally, Menzies urges the government to protect workers in distribution centres across the country; otherwise, they will be \u00e2\u20ac\u0153absolutely hammered\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd if this deal goes ahead. In response, Andrew Griffiths says it is a merger legally. There will be efficiency savings, he says, but Sainsbury and Asda have assured the government that they will continue to operate as different businesses. Labour\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Rachel Reeves says workers at Asda\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s headquarters in Leeds (in her constituency) will be \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcincredibly concerned about their future\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 given the lack of assurances about jobs. Q: The industrial strategy is about rebalancing the economy away from London - what assurances can the government give that this deal won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t rebalance jobs away from Yorkshire? Business minister Andrew Griffiths points out that many high street names have been lost in recent years, due to the changing retail climate [ie, competition from Amazon] Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s deal shows \u00e2\u20ac\u0153two businesses trying to get ahead of the curve and future-proof themselves in a vey challenging market\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he adds. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s quite an endorsement from the government bench - Sainsbury\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s and Asda must be delighted. Labour MP Hilary Benn asks whether jobs are at risk at Sainsbury\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s headquarters. Minister Andrew Griffiths says he doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t yet have any reassurances, beyond the promise that both company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s HQs will be kept open. Conservative MP Robert Halfon suggests that Sainsbury\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s could break its commitment not to eliminate store workers, once the merger has gone through. Griffiths encourages Halfon to engage with the CMA and both companies over his concerns. Conservative MP Andrew Selous says his Dunstable constituency has an Asda and a Sainsbury\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s close to each other, with a clutch of other supermarket outlets - and an Amazon fulfillment centre - close by. What might the Competition and Markets Authority think about this situation? The honourable member is spoiled for choice, minister Andrew Griffiths replies. Over in parliament, the government is facing an urgent question on the Sainsbury-Asda deal. Labour\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Rebecca Long Bailey is putting the question now, asking whether the deal will lead to job cuts. She also warns that the merger will \u00e2\u20ac\u0153radically alter the whole grocery sector\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, affecting suppliers and farmers as well as customers and staff. The government urgently needs to needs to broaden out the public interest test applied to takeover teals, Long Bailey says, to protect these people. Business minister Andrew Griffiths responds, saying he has spoken to the CEOs of Sainsbury and Asda this morning, and told them that it was important to treat suppliers fairly. Griffiths tells the House that he told the companies the important of engaging with the unions..... and that he had received assurances that both head offices will remain open. But... Griffiths also points out that the retail sector is in a period of huge flux - the way people are shopping is changing fast, so retailers must change and adapt. Griffiths also cited Sainsbury\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s claim that prices will be cut, by up to 10% for popular items. Retail analyst Mark Brumby has a few thoughts on the Sainsbury-Asda deal: You can usually rely on the Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chief economist for an eye-catching speech with a few choice quotes. And today, Andy Haldane has argued that music streaming site Spotify and online game World Of Warcraft can teach economists a few lessons on how to handle data. To be honest, Haldane actually made these comments more than a week ago, to King\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s College Business School. But the Bank of England has only just released the text, so they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re worth looking at now. Haldane\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s theme is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Big Data\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, and the way that central bankers can use the explosion of data in recent years to get a better picture of the economy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s moving parts. He says that a major breakthrough is close: In time, it is possible these sorts of data could help to create a real-time map of financial and activity flows across the economy, in much the same way as is already done for flows of traffic or information or weather. Once mapped, there would then be scope to model and, through policy, modify these flows. This is an idea I first talked about six years ago. Today, it looks closer than ever to being within our grasp. Haldane argued that behavioural economists could explore \u00e2\u20ac\u0153non-traditional means\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd when trying to forecast how people will behave.... To give one recent example, data on music downloads from Spotify has been used, in tandem with semantic search techniques applied to the words of songs, to provide an indicator of people\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sentiment. Intriguingly, the resulting index of sentiment does at least as well in tracking consumer spending as the Michigan survey of consumer confidence. And why stop at music? People\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tastes in books, TV and radio may also offer a window on their soul. So too might their taste in games. Indeed, I am interested in the potential for using gaming techniques, not just to extract data on people\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s preferences, but as a means of generating data on preferences and actions. Haldane also suggests that today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s massive multiplayer online games could work as a sandbox for economists to examine behaviour -- to aid forecasting the next time there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a crisis. A gaming environment could be used to understand behaviour in a way which placed fewer restrictions. People\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s behaviour would be observed directly in the act of game-playing which, provided this behaviour was a reasonable reflection of true behaviour, would give us new data. Because this is a virtual rather than real world, with shocks controlled and regulated, that could make it easier to address issues of causality and identification in response to shocks, including policy shocks. There are already multi-person games with primitive economies attached to them, which allow goods and monies to change hands between participants. These include EVE Online and World of Warcraft. The speech is online here. The Press Association have published a Q&amp;A on the Sainsbury-Asda deal. Q: What will it mean for shop prices? The two supermarket giants have pledged to invest the cost efficiencies generated from the merger into lower prices. Sainsbury\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s expects to save \u00c2\u00a3500m from merging with Asda, and has said it will lower shop prices by 10% on everyday products. However, this could have more widespread implications for shop prices if discounters Aldi and Lidl decide to cut their prices even further to stay ahead of their main-market rivals. Laith Khalaf, senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The executives of other supermarkets will have their heads in their hands at the prospect of another price war.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Q: What will it mean for stores? The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) will soon start its investigation of the proposed merger, raising the prospect that Sainsbury\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s and Asda will be forced to sell off stores if they directly compete in local areas. However, Sainsbury\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s insisted on Monday that it does not expect to shut any stores. The supermarket says its store footprint is more focused on the south, and Asda has more stores in the north. Q: What will happen to Argos? Sainsbury\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bought Argos in 2016 and already has more than 200 Argos outlets within its supermarkets, having rapidly expanded over the past year. It is expected that Argos will now start appearing in Asda\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stores, with Sainsbury\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chief executive Mike Coupe saying this morning that the deal \u00e2\u20ac\u0153brings scale in clothing and general merchandise\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Q: Why are the two companies joining forces now? All retailers are having to take drastic action to stay competitive during a critical time for the sector. With Amazon eyeing up the UK food market with its Amazon Fresh delivery service, food retailers will be nervous about its sprawling logistics network and buying power. Sainsbury\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s and Asda also have to fend off price competition from Aldi and Lidl. As a value supermarket, Asda has been under significant pressure as the German discounters have grown their market share. Tesco\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s recent merger with wholesaler Booker Group, which was cleared with minimal fuss by the CMA, will also have given executives at Sainsbury\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s and Asda confidence about the possibility of joining forces. TSB chief Paul Pester has warmed up for his looming parliamentary grilling by updating MPs about the bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s IT crisis. He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s written to Nicky Morgan MP, answering her questions about the technology failings. Pester says the TSB have launched a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153proactive customer redress programme\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, to meet his pledge that no customers are left out of pocket. He also claims that TSB has made significant progress in bring its internet banking and mobile app back into use, saying On Monday 23rd April we were only able to serve c.200,000 sessions via our website versus an expected level of c.450,000. As of Thursday 26th April, we were able to serve c.450,000. This is consistent with the number of sessions we would expect to serve. On Monday 23rd April approximately 72% of customers attempting to access the mobile app were successful on first attempt. As of Friday 27th April this had risen to approximately 93%. This is typical of the proportion we would have seen pre-migration. Pester also confirms that more than 400 customers saw another customer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s account details - because the two accounts were linked: TSB, like many other banks, enable customers to nominate a third party to have access to their accounts - these are called nominee accounts. Typically this will be a parent having access to a child\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s account or a grown-up child managing an ageing parent\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s account. The ability for the third party to see the customer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s account information is usually limited to branch and telephony channels. However, on the evening of Sunday 22nd April access was provided via digital channels. In addition, as well as enabling the third party to see the customer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s data, the customer was able to see the third party\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s data. Therefore, in the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153parent and child\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd example, the parent could see the child\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s transaction data but the child could also see the parent\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s transaction data. This explains some of the comments in social media where customers expecting to be overdrawn (the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153child\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd) could see large credit balances (the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153parent\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd). No personal data was visible, just account balance data. Finally, Pester also admits that customers faced an average wait of one hour if they tried to phone TSB a week ago; by Thursday, this had dropped to 30 minutes (although some customers have reported much longer waits). The full letter is online here. Get the popcorn in! Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Treasury Committee will be grilling Paul Pester, TSB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chief executive, and the bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chairman Richard Meddings, on Wednesday. The committee will demand answers about exactly how TSB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s IT systems collapsed more than a week ago, and how they will compensate affected customers. Committee chair Nicky Morgan MP says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The Treasury Committee is extremely concerned by the problems at TSB, and by the apparent miscommunication to customers about the extent and nature of these problems. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been reported that services such as online banking have been down for some TSB customers for over a week. Many individuals and businesses will have made arrangements for the planned outage, but not for the additional time that the systems have been unavailable. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We will take evidence from TSB and Sabadell representatives to find out how they got into this mess, who is responsible, and how they are putting it right.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Just in: The Labour Party are calling for an urgent investigation into the Sainsbury-Asda merger. Rebecca Long Bailey MP, Labour\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Shadow Business Secretary, says the deal has \u00e2\u20ac\u0153significant competition risks\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, and the Competition and Markets Authorities must take a proper look (ie, a phase 2 investigation) Long Bailey says the CMA must secure \u00e2\u20ac\u0153concrete assurances.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to protect workers and suppliers. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153There are risks to jobs by potential reorganisation and store closures and risks to the wider grocery industry as a Tesco/Sainsbury\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s-Asda duopoly emerges with unrivalled power to dominate, dictating choice and prices for consumers which in time may prove detrimental. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This unrivalled power also poses immense risk to suppliers with unprecedented bargaining power to drive suppliers prices and payment terms down which could cause instability and damage to the food and grocery manufacturing industry. The IT crisis at TSB Bank has dragged into its second week. Some customers are still unable to get into their accounts, 10 days after TSB tried to migrate to a new technology platform. Experts from IBM have been working at TSB since last Thursday, to try to get its Internet banking and mobile app online. But clearly the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcmeltdown\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t over, given these tweets from UK businesses and retail customers: Alarmingly, TSB isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t the only bank facing complaints today. Lloyds Bank (which spun out TSB in 2013) has suffered \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcintermittent\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 problems this morning. Its Halifax division is also caught up in the outage, as these tweets show: News of Sainsbury\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tie-up with Asda has driven Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock market to its highest level since the start of February. The FTSE 100 has gained 37 points, or 0.5%, to 7539 this morning. Sainsbury\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s is leading the way, up 17% at a four-year high right now. Advertising giant WPP is close behind, gaining 8% after reporting better-than-expected results this morning, and saying it could sell some assets. David Madden of CMC Markets says: Sainsbury\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shares are up 15% after the company announced plans to merge with Asda. The move is subject to regulatory approval, but should it go ahead it would be worth \u00c2\u00a37.3 billion. Increased competition from Aldi and Lidl is main motivation behind the proposed deal. The deep-discounters have disrupted the UK supermarket sector severely, and now have a combined market share of approximately 12%. Sainsbury\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s and Asda are the second and third-largest supermarkets by market share, and should the deal go ahead, it would put them in first place. Sainsbury\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s predict it will save \u00c2\u00a3500 million through synergies. The retailer also updated the market with its full-year figures, as underlying pre-tax profits rose by 1.4% to \u00c2\u00a3589 million, which was comfortably ahead of the \u00c2\u00a3559 million expected. WPP shares are in demand this morning after it released better-than-expected sales figures, while the advertising giant also stated a strategic review was underway. First-quarter net sales dropped by 0.1%, while analysts had expected a decline of 1%. The company also said it would take a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcfresh look\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 at business in light of Sir Martin Sorrell stepping down earlier this month. There is talk WPP could spin off assets, but nothing has been confirmed, and no timeline has been stated. Simran Jagdev, companies analyst at the Economist Intelligence Unit, says Sainsbury\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision to tie-up with Asda is a surprise, partly prompted by the threat of Amazon: The deal points to the highly competitive UK grocery market, which has long been concentrated in the hands of the top four players\u00e2\u20ac\u201d Tesco, Sainsbury, Asda, Morrisons - but is now facing an onslaught from new challengers. Sainsbury\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s seems to be continuing the offensive against online players such as Amazon and discount grocery retailers such as Aldi and Lidl that Tesco started last year with its merger with Booker. The deal will help Sainsbury fend off this new competition. It will also mark Walmart\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s operational exit from the UK, as part of its strategic decisions to instead work through partnerships in international markets. Amisha Chohan, equity research analyst at Quilter Cheviot, says the deal is a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153masterstroke\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd - as long as the CMA approve it. It would result in the company becoming the biggest grocer in the UK, ahead of Tesco. Its guided net synergies of over \u00c2\u00a3500m seem prudent and we believe it could be significantly in excess of this. Sainsbury\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s experience from the Argos acquisition should enable it to deliver ahead of the synergy guidance. Although this news is not ideal for Tesco, we remain positive on the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s current largest retailer due its recent takeover of Booker, and the wholesale opportunities this will bring.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Paul Mumford of Cavendish Asset Management believes Sainsbury\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s and Asda will be forced to sell some stores to get this deal \u00e2\u20ac\u0153through the hoop\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd: Store disposals could naturally be offered to others in the sector with M+S and Morrisons being the most likely tenants, but it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hardly the best climate to be a net seller of large retail space. There will of course be some management synergies too, so a proclamation of no job cuts will no doubt be reversed soon enough. This will obviously create a mighty force. But the big questions now are what influence will Walmart have on the group? And where does this leave other players? Sainsburys already has a big challenge to show that the Argos acquisition is bearing fruit, and now it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s faced with driving cost synergies from Asda. The indicated 10% lower prices on regularly bought products will have raised eyebrows amongst the food producers who will fear another squeeze on margins. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s competition watchdog have confirmed they are likely to review the Sainsbury-Asda deal. In a statement, the Competition and Markets Authority says: This merger is likely to be subject to review by the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA). The CMA adds that it will assess whether the merger is bad for customers. During a Phase 1 review, the CMA would assess whether the deal could reduce competition and choice for shoppers. After this first phase, the merger could be cleared or, if a potential reduction in competition is identified, it would be referred for an in-depth, Phase 2 investigation lasting up to 24 weeks - unless the merging parties offered immediate proposals to address any competition concerns identified. The surge in Sainsbury\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shares this morning is a blow to speculators who have been betting against the supermarket. Some major hedge funds have been \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcshorting\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Sainsbury\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shares recently, by selling borrowed shares and hoping to buy them back cheaper in future. That bet seems to be unravelling, as Sainsbury\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shares hit their highest level in almost four years. As The Times explained this morning: A little over a tenth of Sainsbury\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shares were being shorted going into the weekend, with investors betting on a drop in the supermarket\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s share price. Large London-based hedge funds such as Odey Asset Management, GLG and Marshall Wace have short positions in Sainsbury\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s amid investor anxiety about the future facing traditional retailers. Andy Brian, head of retail at Gordons law firm, also believes store closure are inevitable if this deal isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t blocked by the competition authorities: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153One thing is clear; despite what is being said officially, stores would have to close. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not necessarily a bad thing for the brands, although it would of course be a bad thing for those store employees. Moving forwards, one theory is that this deal could allow Sainsbury\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the freedom to compete hard against M&amp;S Food and Waitrose at the top end of the grocery market and leave Asda to compete further on price against the other mid-market players, as well as Aldi and Lidl. Research group Edison have estimated that around 70 Asda stores could be vulnerable to sale or closure, as they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re rather close to a Sainsbury\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s outlet. The Federation of Small Businesses is concerned that small suppliers will be treated roughly if Sainsbury\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s and Asda are allowed to form a new retail titan. FSB chairman Mike Cherry says regulators must demand firm commitments before green-lighting the deal, as Sainsbury is already talking about \u00c2\u00a3500m of cost savings and a boost to earnings. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153A merger of this size will concentrate a lot of power in the hands of one giant company, and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s important that power isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t misused to coerce small suppliers into accepting unfair contracts and poor payment terms. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Those at the top of Sainsbury\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s and Asda should explain how they plan to merge these two supply chains fairly, and give reassurance that cost savings won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be achieved simply by milking their small suppliers for all they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re worth. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153When investigating this proposed merger, the Competition and Markets Authority should be looking for cast-iron commitments that a positive standard will be set for working with smaller suppliers. Data firm Allies has created an interactive map, showing exactly where Sainsbury\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s and Asda\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stores are today. It also shows Argos outlets (Sainsbury\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s acquired Argos in 2016), so it gives a good idea of where there might be competition issues. Here are the vital statistics about today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s merger - showing how a combined Sainsbury\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s and Asda will leap-frog Tesco: Sainsbury\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chief executive, Mike Coupe, has been speaking to journalists. He says he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 100% confident that stores won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t need to close following the merger with Asda. However, the regulators may insist that some stores are sold off. There are scores of places where Sainsbury and Asda stores are close by, giving the combined company a dominant position. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s unions are demanding guarantees for workers at Asda. Tim Roache, general secretary of the GMB, fears that staff at the supermarket will pay the price as Sainsbury pursues the \u00c2\u00a3500m of cost savings promised this morning: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Hundreds of thousands of workers stand to be affected, and all know such announcements tend to be followed by management speak like \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcrationalisation\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 in the name of \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcefficiency\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. What that usually means is job losses or cuts to pay, terms and conditions which would be wholly unacceptable. Not least because ASDA workers have already voluntarily agreed to change their contracts to be more flexible in order to play their part and help their employer be more profitable.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It is quite right to be asking now in whose interests this proposed merger is being tabled. Is it workers and customers or the shareholders and speculators not happy with the hundreds of millions they already make in a year?\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Roache is also unhappy that the deal leaked over the weekend, leaving staff worried about their future: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Imagine turning up to your Saturday afternoon shifts only to learn this news, with no word from your employer at all - just speculation in the media. Our members are concerned for their futures and angry they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve been kept in the dark.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u0153ASDA is hugely profitable supermarket, posting hundreds of millions in profit and backed by hundreds of billions from their US parent company, Walmart. Asda\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s success has been built on the back of its workers and it is they who now need and deserve answers and reassurances about their futures - that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the least they deserve, and the very least their union will be demanding.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd This deal will lead to job cuts and a painful squeeze on suppliers, warns John Colley, professor at Warwick Business School. Colley predicts that staff will be \u00e2\u20ac\u0153rationalised\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd (ie, laid off) at Sainsbury and Asda\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s headquarters, in their regional management, and in their distribution operations. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Ultimately there has to be job losses and the suppliers will have to pay through lower prices for the larger volumes they may see. Customers will see reduced choice and the current price war is likely to persist. Colley also expects some stores will be sold off to rivals, although the largest supermarkets may not be in demand, and could close instead. He also warns that the task of completing the deal could be a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153significant distraction\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd for both companies. This will not entirely be bad news for the competitors who should make share gains as a consequence.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Richard Lim, chief executive, Retail Economics says this deal would create a powerful new competitor: The combined retail group would create significant scale. It would enable better buying terms, the integration of Argos within Asda and drive operating efficiencies expected to deliver cost-savings of at least \u00c2\u00a3500 million. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153If given the green light by the CMA [Competition and Markets Authority], it would be a game changer in the industry. The potential tie-up could deliver price reductions across a range of products, putting it in a position to challenge Tesco and the discounters head-on. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s why Sainsbury\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shares are going like a rocket this morning, while Tesco is under the cosh. Boom! J Sainsbury\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shares have jumped by 20% at the start of trading, to their highest level since 2014. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a huge move, suggesting that the City believes Sainsbury\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s is getting an excellent deal -- as long as regulators don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t block the merger with Asda, of course. Shares in rival supermarkets are falling in early trading. Morrisons, currently Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 4th largest supermarket, are down 3% at the bottom of the FTSE 100 leaderboard. Tesco is close behind, down 2.5%. Labour MP Barry Sheerman is concerned that this deal will damage competition: Graham Hiscott of the Daily Mirror says the promise of big price cuts will rock the retail sector: Neil Saunders, managing director of GlobalData Retail, reckons the deal is a win-win for Sainsbury and Walmart (which acquired Asda almost 20 years ago) City traders like the sound of this deal.... there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chatter that Sainsbury\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shares will jump once the stock market opens at 8am. Asda\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s CEO, Roger Burnley, is also dangling the promise of price cuts, once his business has been folded into Sainsbury\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The combination of Asda and Sainsbury\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s into a single retailing group will be great news for Asda customers, allowing us to deliver even lower prices in store and even greater choice. Asda will continue to be Asda, but by coming together with Sainsbury\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s, supported by Walmart, we can further accelerate our existing strategy and make our offer even more compelling and competitive. The PR war is already underway, with Sainsbury\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chairman David Tyler arguing that the deal is good for the UK: As one of the largest employers in the country, the combined business will become an even greater contributor to the British economy. The proposal will bring together two of the most experienced and talented management teams in retail at a time when the industry is undergoing rapid change. We welcome Walmart as a significant shareholder and look forward to working closely with them.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd A few more key points: The combined company will own more than 2,800 stores (Sainsbury, Asda and Argos), and several of the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s most visited retail websites Sainsbury claims the deal will \u00e2\u20ac\u0153deliver substantial value creation\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd for its shareholders. It estimates that earnings per share will grow by \u00e2\u20ac\u0153double digits\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in the second year after the deal goes through. Asda will continue to be run from Leeds with its own CEO (Roger Burnley), who will join the board of the combined business This deal will deliver cost savings of around \u00c2\u00a3500m per year, Sainsbury\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s estimates. That will fuel concerns that jobs will be lost, and suppliers will be squeezed hard. However the company claims that that there are no plans to close stores. Instead, it estimate that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153buying benefits, opening Argos in Asda stores and operational efficiencies\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd will all cut costs. Sainsbury and Asda are promising to cut prices on popular products by up to 10%, if their merger goes through. They claim the deal will: ...enable investment in areas that will benefit customers the most: price, quality, range and creating more flexible ways to shop in stores and through digital channels, across Sainsbury\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s, Asda and Argos. We expect to lower prices by around 10% on many of the products customers buy regularly. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a very bold commitment; good news for customers, but a real headache for rival retailers. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. The big news this morning is that supermarket chains Sainsbury and Asda have just agreed to merge, in the biggest shake-up of Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s retail sector in years. The deal will create Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest supermarket chain - leapfrogging Tesco - with combined revenues of around \u00c2\u00a351bn. In a statement released to the City, the two companies claim the merger will be \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a great deal\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd for customers, staff, suppliers and shareholders of both businesses. The retail sector is going through significant and rapid change, as customer shopping habits continue to evolve. This has led to increased competition across grocery, general merchandise and clothing, as customers seek ever greater value, choice and convenience. Bringing Sainsbury\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s and Asda together will result in a more competitive and more resilient business that will be better able to invest in price, quality, range and the technology to create more flexible ways for customers to shop. However...it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s likely that suppliers will be worried that they could be squeezed by such a powerful new player. Staff, too, will have a lot of questions -- both in the stores, and in the back-offices and HQs. Regulators will also have questions about whether the merger is in customers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 best interests. Although it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s billed as a merger, Sainsbury\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s is in the box seat. The deal values Asda at roughly \u00c2\u00a37.3bn, and Walmart (Asda\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s current owner) will end up owning 42% of the combined business. Walmart are also receiving \u00c2\u00a32.975bn in cash as part of the deal. More details and reaction to follow.... Also coming up today We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll keep an eye on TSB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ongoing IT problems, as some customers report that they still can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get into their online banking accounts. Advertising giant WPP is releasing its financial results, and outlining its new strategic plans following the shock departure of Sir Martin Sorrell earlier this month. Stock markets are expected to rise, a little, as optimism following the Korea summit lingers. Plus we get new cost of living data from Germany and America. And the Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chief economist, Andy Haldane, will speak at the launch of the Centre for Data Analytics for Finance and Macro at King\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s College Business School Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the agenda 10am BST: Bank of England chief economist, Andy Haldane, speaks 1pm BST: German inflation data for April 1.30pm BST: US PCE price index for March",

Linking with Asda and its giant parent Walmart would give Sainsbury\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s more buying power, to secure better deals with suppliers to compete with Amazon on price. The new Sainsbury-Asda group would also be able to benefit from Walmart\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s huge investment in digital innovations, such as a smartphone shopping app and automated parcel pick up machines for online shopping. Walmart has also been searching for a way to fight off Amazon in the US. Russ Mould, investment director at stockbroker AJ Bell, said Walmart is far from confident it can keep Amazon at bay. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It is hard to believe that a company with $500bn in annual sales has a reason to be frightened of anyone, but Walmart has its competitors too,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Amazon\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s acquisition of Whole Foods suggests it may be about to start attacking the grocery market ... Only time will tell but Walmart is not waiting to find out.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Walmart International boss Judith McKenna suggested the tie-up with Sainsbury\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s could add another weapon to Walmart\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s armoury outside the UK. Sainsbury has benefited from putting dozens of Argos outlets into its supermarkets and its fast deliveries, using a network of small stores, could be a more efficient alternative to Amazon\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s large centralised warehouses. McKenna said Walmart is now considering using Argos in the US and elsewhere help to fight off Amazon more effectively. For the owner of Asda, Amazon poses a serious threat on both sides of the Atlantic. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2This article was amended on 1 May 2018 to remove an incorrect description of Amazon Go stores",
