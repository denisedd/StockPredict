CASH: A BRIEF HISTORY These days we think of cash as a means of putting food on the table, but there was a time when currency could have been used to eat it too. Around 3,000 years ago, Chinese societies used small metal replicas of tools, such as knives and spades, as currency. As time went on and people grew tired of skewering their hands every time they reached into their pocket to settle a bill, the metal currency became round and flat \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the origin of today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s coinage. It wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t until around 600BC in Lydia, in modern-day Turkey, that the first coins were minted en masse and stamped to denote different denominations. The practice spread into Europe and today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s de facto global currency, the US dollar, has its roots in the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153thaler\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, a silver coin dating back to the mid-15th century. The name comes from the town of Joachimsthal in Bohemia, where silver mines were used to produce coins originally known as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Joachimsthaler\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. We also have China to thank for the advent of paper money, first used in the Tang dynasty, which lasted from AD618 to AD907. The bills mostly took the form of letters of credit linked to specific transactions, but were a precursor to modern paper notes. It took Europe about another 500 years to catch on, but lenders and banks eventually started issuing notes that could be taken to a branch and exchanged for silver and gold. A shift towards governments printing their own bills gathered pace with the colonisation of North America. The long transatlantic journeys meant that colonists often ran out of cash, so paper IOUs became usable as currency, issued to soldiers and then spreading through the economy. Many governments still don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t print their own money or mint their own coins, instead paying other countries and private companies \u00e2\u20ac\u201c such as Basingstoke-based De La Rue \u00e2\u20ac\u201c to do it for them. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Royal Mint produces coins on behalf of dozens of other countries\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 governments. However, it does not disclose the identities of these governments for fear that their decision to outsource money-printing will cause embarrassment back home.",

It could widen further if Britain were to leave the single market, and be unable to sell services to the EU.</p> <p>And that would send the pound sliding hard, probably driving inflation sharply higher. </p> <p>Barings, who warn that Brexit would be likely to be highly damaging to the UK economy, explain:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Practically, the mechanism through which capital flows will need to be attracted into the UK has to be through a cheaper sterling. </p> <p>There has not been an exact match for this event in the past, but previous times of stress have seen sterling depreciate by 15% to 20% on a trade-weighted basis. Research we have seen suggests that sterling could have to weaken by 25% to 30% in the event of Brexit, to continue to attract capital flows, slow imports and boost exports for the UK economy.</p> <p>However, sterling would not be alone. We would also expect the euro to decline in the uncertain aftermath of a vote in favour of Brexit, although sterling would be likely to be the weaker of the two.</p> <p>Of course, such profound currency depreciation would also have consequences for the UK economy. It would be highly inflationary. In turn, this would present the Bank of England with a particular dilemma; whether to raise interest rates to control inflation and risk slowing the UK economy, or do nothing, look through and see inflation rise by as much as 4% or 5%.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-06-13T10:16:36.675Z\">at 11.16am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-575e8109e4b064f52e5fa1fc\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-06-13T09:59:24.508Z\">10.59am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Deutsche: London shares might benefit from Brexit</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Ironically, the London stock markets is suffering less of a selloff than the rest of Europe today.</strong></p> <p>The FTSE is currently down 31 points, or 0.5%, while French stock are down a whopping 1.4%.</p> <p>And that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s because analysts believe British companies will benefit from a weaker pound.

If anyone is going to be feeling unnerved by the deal, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Salesforce. We should expect to see some sort of announcement from then in the months ahead. On that note, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time to close for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be back tomorrow. Commenting on the growing lead for Brexit, Joshua Raymond of broker XTB.com said: With the latest ICM poll showing support for a Brexit strengthening on both online and phone polls, investors continue to be concerned and are expected to downsize their positions in UK stocks and holdings in pounds sterling. The fact we are not seeing any degree of volatility in the latest polls, which all point to a healthy lead for the leave campaign is making investors risk averse. And here is the latest ICM poll, showing the Leave campaign further in the lead. Tom Clarke reports: Support for leaving the EU is strengthening, with both phone and online surveys reporting a six-point lead, according to a new pair of Guardian/ICM polls. Leave now enjoys a 53%-47% advantage once \u00e2\u20ac\u0153don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t knows\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd are excluded, according to the research conducted over the weekend compared with a 52%-48% split reported by ICM a fortnight ago. The pound is down around 0.18% at $1.4221 following the poll news. It took 14 years for LinkedIn to grow into a business worth $26bn to Microsoft, and my colleague Sean Farrell has taken a look at the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s history: The $26bn deal for Microsoft to buy LinkedIn has done little to support stock markets, which are more concerned with a global slowdown and the consequences of the UK voting to leave the European Union. With talk of the latest ICM poll showing a lead for the Leave camp, markets have slumped once again. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 fell to its lowest level since March 10, down 70.79 points or 1.16% to 6044.97 Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax dropped 1.8% to 9657.44 France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac closed 1.85% lower at 4227.02 On Wall Street the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 64 points or 0.36%. The pound, having slumped earlier and then recovered, has now slipped back again against the dollar, down marginally on the day from $1.4252 at $1.4240. Chris Beauchamp, senior market analyst at IG, said: Microsoft has clearly found another use for some of its cash, and while LinkedIn may have faded from view as the market focusses on the triumphs of Facebook and the travails of Twitter, the social network\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s database offers a tantalising way to expand Microsoft\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s reach once more. The use of debt rather than stock will reassure those that worry this is another sign of a market top, and will have the added benefit of raising the prospect of a buyer for Twitter. In an email to LinkedIn employees, chief executive Jeff Weiner says the Microsoft deal is best for the company: No matter what you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re feeling now, give yourself some time to process the news. You might feel a sense of excitement, fear, sadness, or some combination of all of those emotions. Every member of the exec team has experienced the same, but we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve had months to process. Regardless of the ups and downs, we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve come out the other side knowing beyond a shadow of a doubt, this is the best thing for our company. He continues: Some of you may be asking \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Why Microsoft?\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Long before [Microsoft boss} Satya [Nadella] and I first sat down to talk about how we could work together, I had publicly shared my thoughts on how impressive his efforts were to rapidly transition Microsoft\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s strategy and culture. After all, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s extremely rare to see a company of that scope and scale move so quickly to make fundamental changes. The Microsoft that has evolved under Satya\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s leadership is a more agile, innovative, open and purpose-driven company. It was that latter point that first had me thinking we could make this work, but it was his thoughts on how we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d do it that got me truly excited about the prospect.... Essentially, we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re both trying to do the same thing but coming at it from two different places: For LinkedIn, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the professional network, and for Microsoft, the professional cloud. [On the structure of the deal] I had no idea what Satya was going to propose, but knew how difficult acquisition integrations could be if not established the right way from the start. Long story short, Satya had me at \u00e2\u20ac\u0153independence.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd In other words, his vision was to operate LinkedIn as a fully independent entity within Microsoft, a model used with great success by companies like YouTube, Instagram and WhatsApp. Meanwhile back in the foreign exchange market, sterling has recovered all its losses ahead of the forthcoming ICM poll. Despite the excitement about the $26bn deal for Microsoft to buy LinkedIn, the overall US market has failed to move into positive territory. With worries about a global slowdown and the impact of a vote by the UK to leave the EU, the Dow Jones Industrial average has dipped 0.02%, Nasdaq is down 0.12% and the S&amp;P 500 is 0.13% lower. With Twitter shares up on speculation it could be the next to be snapped up after LinkedIn, some believe a deal could make sense. Saxo Bank head of equity Peter Garnry thinks Google could buy the business by the year end. Twitter has 350 millions users, but it has been a problem for the company to grow its user base, he said. Nevertheless Twitter has managed to increase its cash flow profitability over the last 4-5 quarters and on a cashflow basis the company is improving rapidly. He said it had been difficult for Google to create a social media space stronghold and for that reason he thought Twitter would be a good fit for Google. This deal even beats that $19bn which Facebook splashed out on WhatsApp in February 2014..... Microsoft is getting the cash for this deal though issuing new debt, rather than tapping its own cash pile. Why would it do that? Because it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s more tax efficient; Microsoft won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have to repatriate any of the cash currently held offshore back into the US (where it would face higher taxes). [Oxfam singled out Microsoft in a report condemning tax havens back in April] Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Alex Hern\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s news story on the Microsoft-LinkedIn deal: And here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a flavour: If the deal with Microsoft goes through as planned, Jeff Weiner, who joined LinkedIn in 2008 as the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s president before becoming chief executive later that year, will stay on in his current role, reporting directly to Microsoft boss Satya Nadella. In a statement, Nadella hinted at the competitive advantage he expects the network to provide for Microsoft. He said LinkedIn would pair well with the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s business-focused software such as Office and customer relationship manager Dynamics. Over on Wall Street, LinkedIn shares have jumped by 47% to $193 in early trading. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s close to the $196 per shares which Microsoft is paying, suggesting the deal is expected to pass. Microsoft\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shares have fallen by 4% \u00e2\u20ac\u201c as explained earlier, that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a typical reaction when a company announces a significant acquisition. And this really is a significant deal, as the BBC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Rory Cellan-Jones explains: Social media is buzzing with reaction to Microsoft\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s $26bn cash splurge acquisition: LinkedIn gives Microsoft a serious presence in the business social networking business, says mobile analyst Ben Wood of CCS Insight: Shares in Twitter are rallying in early trading; perhaps on speculation that it could now be snapped up. This is Satya Nadella\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest deal since he replaced Steve Ballmer as Microsoft\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s CEO in February 2014. Nadella says he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been thinking about buying LinkedIn for a while, and he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll need to persuade analysts that it really makes sense, given the huge price tag. It also dwarfs MS\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s other recent deals - buying Nokia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s mobile phone business for $7bn in 2013, and online telephony firm Skype for $8.5bn in 2011. The Nokia deal hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t been a great success, given Microsoft laid off 1,850 staff at its smartphone business last month. The Economist\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Stanley Pignal is hoping that the deluge of LinkedIn notifications might now ease... Augustin Eden at City firm Accendo Markets (who doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t sound like a great fan of LinkedIn) explains why Microsoft\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shares are likely to suffer today: Shares in professional networking/dating/narcissism website LinkedIn are called to open around 40% higher at the US open after confirmation it has welcomed a mammoth takeover approach from Microsoft constituting a nigh on 50% premium over Friday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s share price close. Shares in Microsoft were understandably suspended from trading in the lead-up to this bit of news, given that the traditional reaction to such an announcement often involves a shareholder exodus from the predator. With this deal lightening Microsoft\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s coffers to the tune of $26bn, make that an exodus of biblical proportions. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s announcement is full of cheerful quotes justifying the deal. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a selection: Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The LinkedIn team has grown a fantastic business centered on connecting the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s professionals. Together we can accelerate the growth of LinkedIn, as well as Microsoft Office 365 and Dynamics as we seek to empower every person and organization on the planet.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd LinkedIn CEO Jeff Weiner: Just as we have changed the way the world connects to opportunity, this relationship with Microsoft, and the combination of their cloud and LinkedIn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s network, now gives us a chance to also change the way the world works. LinkedIn chairman Reid Hoffmann Today is a re-founding moment for LinkedIn. I see incredible opportunity for our members and customers and look forward to supporting this new and combined business. I fully support this transaction and the Board\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision to pursue it, and will vote my shares in accordance with their recommendation on it. LinkedIn shareholders will be celebrating tonight.... Guys, there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s only one joke about this deal...and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been done. Many times.... Tech analyst Amir Mizroch explains the motivation behind the deal: Microsoft and LinkedIn have released a short video about the deal. In it, MS CEO Satya Nadella talks about his \u00e2\u20ac\u0153great admiration for LinkedIn\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd.... and explained that his vision is to combine LinkedIn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s productivity and communication tools with Microsoft\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s professional network. Cue uplifting talk about \u00e2\u20ac\u0153enhancing\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd people\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s professional lives and \u00e2\u20ac\u0153empowering\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd them to do better - either in their current job or the next one.... He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been tweeting that message too: Shares in Microsoft have slid by 5% in pre-market trading, as investors react to the news it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s paying $26bn for LinkedIn. The Wall Street Journal\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dennis Berman argues that LinkedIn has capitulated, by selling out to Microsoft. Walking away with $26bn (or \u00c2\u00a318.5bn) ) is one heck of a capitulation, though.... This deal values each of LinkedIn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 433 million users at $60 each, points out Reuters\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Peter Thal Larsen: Some users may be worth less.... Microsoft has swooped on LinkedIn four months after the company shocked Wall Street by missing its revenue forecasts. Back in February, LinkedIn revealed that its online ad revenue growth had slowed to 20% in the fourth quarter from 56% a year earlier. Financial analysts raced to downgrade LinkedIn, warning that the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s period of rapid growth was over. For example: RBC analysts said they had thought LinkedIn was on the cusp of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153fundamentally positive\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd change. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We were wrong,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd they said in a client note. That helped to send LinkedIn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shares down around 40%, and laying the ground for Microsoft to strike a deal. Some big breaking news in the tech sector - Microsoft, the software giant, is buying business social network site LinkedIn for more than $26bn. The deal, just announced, values LinkedIn at $196 per share - or almost 50% above Friday night\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s close of $131. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the announcement. The deal comes five years after LinkedIn floated at $45 per share. But they were trading at $270 in 2015. More to follow..... While we wait for ICM to deliver their poll, let\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hear a few words from George Osborne. The chancellor has just been interviewed by Bloomberg, and urged business leaders to back the Remain campaign. Osborne argues: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153People who are concerned or businesses who are concerned or investors who are concerned about the prospect of Britain leaving the EU should speak up. This is not the moment for businesses to sit it out.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Some firms have already piled into the fray. Telecoms group BT has already written to its staff, explaining why it believes Britian should stay in the EU. But Sir James Dyson, the billionaire inventor, is backing the Leave campaign, and slamming warnings that Britain would be locked out of international markets. The US stock market is expected to dip when trading begins in 90 minutes time. That follows today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s losses in Europe, and the big selloff in Asia overnight. ICM would like everyone to relax until they have finished working on their poll with, ummm, my colleague Tom Clark.... Hmmmm. No sign of that ICM Referendum poll yet. And its website has just crashed under the weight of web traffic looking for it.... City traders are bracing for fresh volatility, as polling company ICM is expected to release a new survey at 12.30pm BST. Another sign of European Brexit fears: Barings are also worried that Brussels would not cut Britain a generous deal if the public vote to leave the EU. They write: Post-Brexit concessions to the UK would send the wrong signal to other EU countries where nationalistic movements are growing. This could result in a political chain-reaction that could easily trigger a series of national referendums in numerous member countries. In terms of financial commitments, if the UK leaves the EU, it would save around \u00c2\u00a310 billion in net contributions. The government would, however, be likely to need to step in to help sectors and regions which would stop receiving European structural funds, and which could be disproportionately affected by tariffs on trade. It is also not yet known what level of payment would be required to permit the UK business sector to access the 500 million people living in the EU. How badly could the pound be hit by a victory for Brexit campaigners? Well...economists at Barings Asset Management predict this morning that sterling could slump by a fifth! They point out that Britain is running a huge current account deficit, due to importing far more than it exports. It could widen further if Britain were to leave the single market, and be unable to sell services to the EU. And that would send the pound sliding hard, probably driving inflation sharply higher. Barings, who warn that Brexit would be likely to be highly damaging to the UK economy, explain: Practically, the mechanism through which capital flows will need to be attracted into the UK has to be through a cheaper sterling. There has not been an exact match for this event in the past, but previous times of stress have seen sterling depreciate by 15% to 20% on a trade-weighted basis. Research we have seen suggests that sterling could have to weaken by 25% to 30% in the event of Brexit, to continue to attract capital flows, slow imports and boost exports for the UK economy. However, sterling would not be alone. We would also expect the euro to decline in the uncertain aftermath of a vote in favour of Brexit, although sterling would be likely to be the weaker of the two. Of course, such profound currency depreciation would also have consequences for the UK economy. It would be highly inflationary. In turn, this would present the Bank of England with a particular dilemma; whether to raise interest rates to control inflation and risk slowing the UK economy, or do nothing, look through and see inflation rise by as much as 4% or 5%. Ironically, the London stock markets is suffering less of a selloff than the rest of Europe today. The FTSE is currently down 31 points, or 0.5%, while French stock are down a whopping 1.4%. And that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s because analysts believe British companies will benefit from a weaker pound. It would make exporters more competitive, and boost earnings in foreign currencies. Pharmaceutical giant Glaxo and tobacco firms BAT and Imperial are thus among the risers today. Deutsche Bank analysts are advising buying London stocks, rather than the German equivalent. In the case of a Leave vote in the UK referendum (a scenario to which bookmakers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 odds attribute a 30% probability), we expect UK equities to outperform the European market, given the likely depreciation of the pound in such a scenario as well as the market\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s defensive sector structure. However.... UK companies won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t benefit if the Bank of England is forced to hike interest rates to prevent a sterling crisis. Brexit fears have rippled as far as Prague. The Czech Republic\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s main stock market has fallen 2% today, to its lowest level in seven years. And next week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s EU referendum is, apparently, partly to blame. Analysts at Pekao, a Polish bank, told clients that: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153High probability of Brexit (Britain leaving the European Union) remains the biggest short-term risk.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The pound is hitting fresh two-month lows, as investors react to the tightening of the EU referendum race. Sterling is now down one cent against the US dollar at $1.4137, and more than eurocent against the euro at \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.254. And with stock markets still in the red, Joshua Mahony of firm IG says investors are worrying about Brexit, China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s slowing economy and the possibility of US interest rate rises this year, Even if we manage to navigate the near term threats of a Brexit and a likely US rate hike, the continued slowdown in China will provide a remains a significant ongoing risk to global demand. It is clear that in a week which is relatively light on economic data, the focus will remain on the risk of a Brexit, which could destabilise not only the future of England, but also the European project as a whole. Reuters\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Jemima Kelly flags up the latest odds: In another sign of global anxiety, Fitch has just cut the outlook on Japan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s credit rating to negative, from stable. Fitch left Japan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rating at A (only the sixth-highest level), but warned that it is losing faith in its government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s commitment to fiscal consolidation. Tokyo has just postponed plans to raise the sales tax, and could be forced into launching another stimulus package to spur growth. City firm ETX Capital believes there is a growing chance that Britain votes to leave the EU, given the latest polling. Joe Rundle, their head of trading, explains: Momentum is behind the Vote Leave camp as polls seem to show more support for Brexit than at any point in the campaign so far. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve seen heavy selling and shortened our Brexit market price from over 80% - implying a one-in-five chance of Britain leaving the EU \u00e2\u20ac\u201c to 66%, which indicates a one-in-three chance of Brexit. Betfair, the online gambling company, also reports that more money is being wagered on Brexit. It now estimates there is a 34% chance of the Leave campaign winning, based on betting patterns. Investors have also been dizzied by the flurry of opinion polls, which have shown the vote is tight: The cost of insuring against the pound tumbling against the euro over the next month has hit a record high this morning. Reuters explains: Euro/sterling one-month implied volatility, derived from an option that covers the June 23 referendum date and its aftermath, hit 26.3% according to Reuters data, exceeding the previous record of around 25% hit during the global financial crisis in 2008. The equivalent sterling/dollar one-month implied volatility also rocketed to 28.1%, close to its 2008 peak of around 29%. UK chip-maker ARM is the biggest faller in London this morning, along with financial stocks and miners. ARM is being hit by fears that a global downturn would hurt demand for its semiconductors, helping to drag the FTSE 100 down to a three-week low. UK banks are suffering from concerns over the EU vote, as Conner Campbell of SpreadEx explains: The markets got off to a dreadful start this Monday.... A healthy dose of drag from the Brexit-fearing banking stocks (especially Barclays and Lloyds) is adding to the FTSE 100\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s losses. With the referendum growing ever closer the pound is all set for an ugly week and a half, something immediately in evidence this morning. Cable [\u00c2\u00a3/$] collapsed by another half a percent, leaving sterling at its lowest point against the dollar in 2 months, with a similar pattern occurring against the euro and a whole basket of currencies. This chart shows how the London stock market has dropped back to its recent lows: The London stock market is now at its lowest level since May 20. The FTSE 100 has lost 200 points since last Wednesday; today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s selloff, plus the heavy losses on Thursday and Friday, have wiped out the gains of the last three weeks. As feared, European markets are falling at the start of trading. London\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE 100 has already shed 43 points, or 0.7%. There are deeper losses across the channel, with the French CAC down 1% and Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s DAX losing 1.2%. Brexit is obviously a factor, as is new data showing Chinese investment growth hitting a 10-year low. Mike van Dulken of Accendo Markets says that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153risk aversion\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd is rife this morning: Investors continue to fret over global growth with China weekend data failing to inspire and the IMF sounding the alarm (again) over a Chinese corporate debt bubble. Anxiety persists about the risks of a UK vote to leave the EU (Brexiety?) and traders prepare themselves for a hat-trick of central bank updates this week - from the US Federal Reserve (Wednesday), the Bank of Japan and the Bank of England (both on Thursday). The pound is sliding against other major currencies this morning, as worries about a possible Brexit take hold. Sterling hit a two-month low against the US dollar in early trading, losing 0.5% or 0.7 of a cent to $1.4182, a drop of 0.7 of a cent. This adds to Friday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tumble, which wiped two cents off the pound. Sterling has also hit a six-week low against the euro, at \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.2592, as traders bail out of sterling. Marc Chandler, global head of currency strategy at Brown Brothers Harriman, reckons the pound may drop further this week: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Ahead of the referendum, many look for sterling to underperform and the yen and Swiss franc to outperform,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The euro and central and eastern European currencies are vulnerable, while risk assets, in general, are expected to weaken on a Brexit victory,.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Asian stock markets have already suffered chunky losses overnight, with Japan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Nikkei tumbling by 3.5%. Worries over the global economy, and Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s EU referendum, also sent China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock market down 2% and wiped almost 1% off the Australia market. Analysts at RBS Capital Markets say: The market opened in Asia in the same spirit as it closed on Friday: equity markets were under heavy pressure losing more than 2% across the board Money has poured into the Japanese yen, as investors flee shares and the pound in favour of safe-haven assets. That has hit Japan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s exporters, who are already vulnerable to a slowdown in global growth. And investors expect more swings this week. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our latest story on the markets: Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Hold onto your hats. Investors are starting the week in gloomy mood, which means we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re going to see fresh falls on the European stock markets when trading begins. The FTSE 100 index of blue-chip shares is expected to shed 1%, or 61 points, when the markets open. That adds to Friday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 116-point tumble, which wiped out around \u00c2\u00a317bn of value. With Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s EU referendum just 10 days away, traders are increasingly jump about the prospect of a Brexit. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s weighing on the pound, which is losing ground this morning as opinion polls show the race is still very close. The markets are also anxious about the state of the global economy, which looks bruised even without the shock of a Brexit. America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s central bank, the Federal Reserve, meets to set interest rates this week. Few traders expect a hike at this meeting, but they are nervous that the Fed could still raise rates too quickly. Kit Juckes, currency expert at French bank Soci\u00c3\u00a9t\u00c3\u00a9 G\u00c3\u00a9n\u00c3\u00a9rale, explains why the City is so jittery: If the global economy does not slide towards recession, the Fed will eventually raise rates (timidly). That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the best-case scenario, one in which oil-sensitive currencies can gain, but China-sensitive ones will struggle. The risk is that growth slows more sharply in China, causing capital to take fright. Pity the currencies of nations with big current account deficits then [such as the UK]. There are other dangers lurking too, like the UK referendum, the US presidential election and rising anti-European sentiment into the 2017 elections. So, lots to worry about today.....",

                "bodyText":"That was the longest and most confrontational parliamentary session I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve covered over the last decade. Sir Philip Green went into the grilling vowing to put his side of the story, and he took every opportunity to do so \u00e2\u20ac\u201c interrupting MPs, refusing to answer questions he didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t fancy, and taking criticism extremely badly. Broadly, his position is that some mistakes were made, but it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not really his fault. He doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to blame anyone else, but managed to blame pretty much everyone who had a role in this fiasco - advisers, the pension regulator and even journalists. He seemed particularly irked with City firms Olswang and Grant Thornton for representing Dominic Chappell, suggesting they provided a sheen of respectability. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a pretty poor excuse for not realising that the ex-bankrupt racing driver might not be the best person to buy BHS. Green did at least apologise, nice and early in the session, and admit he should never have sold the company to Chappell for \u00c2\u00a31. But he also claimed that recent criticism was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153wholly\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd unfair, and even blamed \u00e2\u20ac\u0153envy and jealousy\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd for the dividends which moved from BHS to his luxury base in Monaco. Green is entitled to his point of view, but perhaps he should save the lectures until the BHS pension deficit has been fixed. The committee struggled to land many punches on Green over the financial details of the BHS farrago. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s because the Arcadia chief had a two-pronged strategy; he either produced his own figures to challenge the MPs, or claimed he simply didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get involved with whatever they were asking about. For example, the sale of BHS\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ealing store to his stepson. Instead, Green preferred to focus on other wrong-doing - such as Chappell\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s apparent breach of the covenants set up to protect BHS. Green did have the excuse that his wife, Lady Christina, actually owns Arcadia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s assets. Did the committee call the wrong Green? Perhaps Tina should sail one of the family\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s yachts up the Thames and testify herself.... BHS pensioners did get one piece of good news - Green\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pledge to address the pension black hole. He said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I want to give an assurance to the 20,000 [BHS] pensioners that I am there to sort this, in the correct way.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd However, Green did not promise to ensure they would receive their full entitlement; instead, it might just be better than taking a cut in the Payment Protection Fund. Green was also rather hazy about how the scheme fell into such a mess, insisting that he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d not bled the company dry but had actually invested capital in it. Green\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s aggressive attitude seemed to stun MPs at first; he slammed one member for excessive staring, and snarled \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t deal with this\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd when asked a pretty fair question about whether he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d deliberately offloaded BHS\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pension liabilities. After a while they began to suspect that it might hold the key to the crisis. The committee may well conclude that the BHS disaster might have been averted if Arcadia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chairman had been more open to criticism. A corporate governance problem, indeed. Green also showed that he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not at the cutting edge of technology \u00e2\u20ac\u201c we got a glimpse of his antiquated Nokia mobile phone, after he failed to turn it off following a break. Some younger viewers may have been baffled by the small booklet he waved at MPs at one stage; that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s called a cheque book, kids. And Green may well have to get it out again, and write a nine-figure sum to patch up the black hole in BHS\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pension. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s all from me today. Thanks for reading and commenting. Goodnight. GW Chris Martin, chair of the BHS pension trustees, has told Sky News that he hopes Green will make an offer that means pensioners will receive more than they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d get through the Pension Protection Fund. And that means Green stumping up more than \u00c2\u00a3100m, Martin adds. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a snap of Green leaving the Houses of Parliament after being questioned by MPs today. I missed this earlier, but there was a small protest outside parliament, urging Green to save his reputation and cover the BHS pension black hole. Iain Wright and Frank Field have issued a statement, warning Green that he may have to dig deep into his pocket to satisfy public anger over the collapse of BHS. The two MPs also warn Green that he may have to answer further questions: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We thank Sir Philip for giving us six hours of evidence in Parliament today, and we were pleased to hear that he is still trying to put together a better deal for the BHS pensioners. We hope he will come up with an offer that is satisfactory to The Pension Regulator. However, he doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t only have to satisfy The Pensions Regulator, today he is before the bar of public opinion. Much of his reputation now depends on how generously he responds. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s evidence raised host of further questions and we first want to get much more detail on the structure of various companies, particularly those owned by Lady Cristina Green, the profits they have made and the tax they have paid. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We have more witnesses scheduled at the end of June and in the last few days we have received a huge amount of further evidence. We have many further questions for Sir Philip, particularly the big questions on the pension fund that he was unable to answer today.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Frank Field, head of the work and pensions committee, says that Sir Philip Green\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s credibility is now on the line. His reputation as a top business chief now hangs on his willingness to support BHS pensioners, says Field, speaking to my colleague Sarah Butler. The pension regulator has swiftly responded to Green\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s evidence. In a statement, it denies refusing to engage with Sir Philip Green. It also states that it hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t received any \u00e2\u20ac\u0153new proposals\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. And finally, as Big Ben rings 3pm, Green repeats his pledge to sit down with the pensions regulator and talk about the pension scheme. I want to get this over quicker than you do, he pledges. And he promises to do all he can to support any deal to save BHS. And that is finally the end of the meeting, after a near six-hour marathon. Q: With hindsight, do you think the offshore setup of your businesses is incompatible with the modern world? Green checks his pad for a prepared statement, and then pronounces Envy and jealousy are two incurable diseases. I have done nothing wrong. Green insists that his empire could have been structured much more aggressively to avoid tax. We have paid many, many hundreds of millions of pounds of tax. As far I am concerned I have a very clear conscience. We have paid everything due. Green suggests that he could, for example, have taken his fashion brands offshore and charged a royalty. Where we made money here, we paid tax here. Q: What lessons can we learn from the BHS failure, to help rebuild the public\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trust in the capitalist system? Green say\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s immune to criticism after the last few weeks, which have meant he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been unable to visit his stores. Q: Do you feel hounded? The criticism has been wholly unbalanced and unfair, Green says, a little mournfully. I made a bad call selling this business to RAL [Chappell\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Retail Acquisitions], Green says. But other people made mistakes too, including lawyers, and now everyone says it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s just my fault. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m a big boy, I can take a punch on the chin.... but I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t do this deliberately, he concludes. Q: Do you think your reputation has been improved by today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s session? Green declines to mark his own homework, but hopes that people understand what happened at BHS. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve had quite a few supportive emails and texts from BHS staff, he adds. Q: What would you like your legacy to be, in a year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time? Green looks baffled, saying even he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not clever enough to undo the past. Then he talks about the work that Arcadia does in the fashion industry, encouraging young talent. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153All people in BHS know I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m honest and no way I would have wanted this kind of ending.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd In other words, he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not a bad guy, honest... Q: Would you consider buying BHS back if you could get the pension issue sorted? No, Green insists. Life has moved on. Not for the 11,000 staff at BHS, the committee point out. Q: So who are the winners from the BHS story? No-one, Green says, adding. I think it was a very sad episode. Everything that could have gone wrong, did go wrong. Q: So who are the losers? That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s easy, Green says. The staff and the pensioners. Green then confirms that he attended a meeting with Mike Ashley and the administrators on 27 April, at Arcadia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s offices. He produces a letter from the administrator saying Arcadia offered to add \u00c2\u00a35m to Sports Direct\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bid for BHS and did not frustrate the deal. Q: So why did it fail? Because of one of these, says Green, producing his chequebook. And he denies that he did anything to block Mike Ashley from taking control On what possible basis would I want to stop someone buying BHS? \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Ego\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, says Iain Wright. Green looks *furious*. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s really rude,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he says, and out of order. He says Wright should apologise. Green starts to assembles his papers, muttering that he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s glad the meeting is over. But it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not over quite yet The session turns rowdy, now, as Iain Wright probes Sports Direct\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s attempts to rescue BHS. He gets Philip Green to confirm that he didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know Mike Ashley (Sports Direct\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s founder) was trying to sort out a deal. And Wright then produces a letter from Ashley, which states that the two men did have contact. Green tries to interrupt, telling Wright to stop bullying him (!) and claiming that he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s in charge of what he says. Green then explains that he didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know that Chappell held all-night talks on Thursday 21 April, until the Friday lunchtime Chappell asked Green for Ashley\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s phone number. He reveals that he then had a jokey conversation with Ashley, but insists that he has zero knowledge about the negotiations. Q: So how much contact did you have over the weekend? We may have spoken a few times, Green concedes. The committee turn to the events of April, when BHS went into administration. Green denies that he triggered it - even though he refused to accept that \u00c2\u00a360m loan from Gordon Brothers. But then Iain Wright MP reads a letter from the administrators, Duff and Phelps, showing that Green has asked him to attend a meeting. Green explains that he was told on Friday 22 April that an unknown retailer was attempting a last-ditch rescue bid, but he didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know who [I think this is Sports Direct]. But if it didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t transpire, he [Green] was concerned that staff wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be paid the next week if a deal wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t agreed. Green looks like he might mislay his rag, when asked to clarify his commitment to BHS pensioners. We covered that five and half hours ago, he says, before repeating that he will meet with the pension regulator and try to agree a deal. Green also explains that he wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t prepared to support a \u00c2\u00a360m loan from investment group Gordon Brothers which Chappell had lined up in the final days before BHS went under. It was a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153loan to own\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, says Green, as BHS would have breached it quickly.... meaning Gordon Brothers would have walked away with the business. Q: Dominic Chappell told us that he was shocked that you sold the BHS Ealing branch to your stepson, and he flipped it for a \u00c2\u00a33.5m profit. Is that true? I wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t involved in that deal, Green replies. It wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t my transaction. Q: But did you know about it? Green doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t give a particularly clear answer, but indicates he was aware the property was being sold. Q: Is it true that you initially told the regulator that you had not sold any assets to any interested parties, and then had to correct it once the Ealing sale came to light? Is which bit true, asks Green? Q: That you initially told the regulator that you had not sold any assets to any interested parties, and then had to correct it? Green says he doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know. Q: Well, could you help us check? Green says this line of questioning is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153ludicrous\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Q: Did you have regular talks to Chappell about weekly sales? No, says Green. Chappell wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know what they were. Q: And you sold him the company... Don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t remind me, Green grimaces. And he jokes: If you look Dominic Chappell up in the dictionary it says \u00e2\u20ac\u0153very optimistic\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Q: Do what did you talk to Chappell about? I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to the business to fail, Green insists, so he acted as a sounding board for Chappell\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ideas. Green also disses Chappell\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s claims to be a property expert, saying he failed to cut a better deal with landlords. Chappell was also too slow to arrange the CVA [Company Voluntary Arrangement] which trimmed BHS\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rent costs, Green adds. That stubbornness undermined the chances of turning BHS around. Green now wants the committee clerk to stop whispering to MPs during the session. It looks like Green uses an old-school Nokia handset... Suddenly, a mobile phone rings, disrupting the session....and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Sir Phil\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s! Apologies, he says, I forgot to turn it off. It\u00e2\u20ac\u02dcs the pensions regulator, jokes Iain Wright. The committee are back again for the final part of the session. Sir Philip Green seems quite chirpy still - maybe he can see the finishing line in sight. Jeremy Quin MP asks about the charges that he retained on BHS after selling it, which meant Arcadia was a preferred creditor. Green says that out of \u00c2\u00a3256m of debt, \u00c2\u00a3216m was written off when BHS was sold and a \u00c2\u00a340m charge was retained. He says that he also agreed to released a fixed charge on one property, to help the new owners raise more money Q: So you had an umbilical connection... I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m sorry, I can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t accept that, Green interrupts, showing that thin-skinned side again. OK, the committee are taking another quick break for a vote, but they will be back shortly. Green would happily have finished the session right then. Green is arguing that he didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t realise that Chappell was unreliable... Green says one of the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153lovely journalists in the room\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd contributed to BHS\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s demise, by undermining Chappell\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s credibility each weekend. Those articles made it impossible to get credit insurance for BHS, he claims. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m pretty sure he means Oliver Shah of the Sunday Times, who has swiftly responded: Onto another curious property deal, the sale of North West House (a BHS asset sold in 2015). Green says that it was sold to \u00c2\u00a332m, but only \u00c2\u00a325m showed up in the BHS accounts. Arcadia were told that remaining \u00c2\u00a37m had been transferred to the Bank of China, to help set up a \u00c2\u00a3100m loan. He says that the \u00c2\u00a37m then arrived at Chappell\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s lawyers, Olswang. But \u00c2\u00a31.2m was then paid to Olswang, \u00c2\u00a31.2m to Grant Thornton, \u00c2\u00a31.8m to Chappell himself.... This, Green declares. means that Chappell breached a covenant which Arcadia had made him sign, to not take money out of the business (as our Sarah Butler reported earlier this month) Philip Green is getting ill-tempered again, as the committee ask how he compensated Chappell for the \u00c2\u00a38.5m profit that he didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get on the Marylebone House deal. He keep trying to sweep away questions he doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t like the sound of. And Iain Wright MP has spotted a pattern - suggesting that Green\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Arcadia Group has a serious corporate governance problem. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s your opinion, Green says. If you behaves like this in a parliamentary committee, it must be hard for directors to raise concerns at an Arcadia board meeting, suggests Richard Fuller MP. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m choosing to ignore that, says Green. Green confirms that he had planned to sell Marylebone House, BHS\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s HQ, to Chappell for \u00c2\u00a335m. [This is a crucial point; Chappell had taken a \u00c2\u00a335m loan from the Dellal family of property investors, and was planning to sell it onto them for \u00c2\u00a345m]. Green suggests he didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t originally know Chappell was planning to turn a quick profit; even though \u00c2\u00a38.5m of profits from the deal appear on the BHS term sheet. Q: So why did you change your mind and sell Marylebone House to someone else? Once word spread in the property market that we were selling it, we received better offers and realised it was worth more, Green replies. But.... Marylebone House was owned by Wilton Equity, an offshore group owned by Green\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s wife Lady Tina. And it emerged last week that the property was actually sold by Wilton, to Arcadia, reportedly yielding a profit of \u00c2\u00a321m. The committee are now turning to the financial help which Sir Philip Green provided to Dominic Chappell\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Retail Acquisitions to help the BHS purchase go through. Conservative Richard Fuller says that Chappell\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s term sheet, which claimed to have \u00c2\u00a3120m of funding, actually only had \u00c2\u00a340m. So how did Green not spot the problems? Green repeats that he wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t involved in the sale until he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d been convinced that Chappell was genuine. Q: So is it a fair observation that a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153wrong \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcun\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd got through the system because you relied on advisers for all the detail? That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s your observation, Green replies. But again, he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s spreading the blame to other people...while claiming he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not blaming anyone..... Iain Wright MP then calls Green up for his refusal to say if any of his executives raised any concerns about the Chappell deal. You seem a dominant character, but also extraordinarily thin-skinned when asked quite courteous questions, Sir Philip .... This seems to prick the Arcadia boss: Wright\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s point is that some Arcadia lieutenants might have been scared to raise a red flag to the Chappell deal. Green adds that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153unfortunately, we found the wrong guy\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd when they sold BHS to Dominic Chappell. What happened subsequently is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153beyond horrible\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Iain Wright MP tries to pin Green down. Q: Was good corporate governance followed in the sale of BHS? We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re going this again, Green asks, incredulously. He says that Arcadia put good people on the sale -- they should have been able to do the right deal. Q: Are you still happy with Lord Grabiner (Arcadia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chairman, who didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t attend the meeting where BHS was sold)? Yes, Green insists. Grabiner is highly capable, and highly respected... \u00e2\u20ac\u0153was\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, chips in one MP. Grabiner\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s reputation has changed, Sir Philip.... Green concedes that he shouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have sold BHS to Chappell, but insists that advisers -- both his and Chappell\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u201c are to blame. Would I do that deal again, no. Am I sorry we did that deal, yes. Richard Graham MP calls up Green about his claim that Chappell lives in Fantasy Land... ..I never said that, claims Green, astonishingly. Yes you did, the MPs chorus. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be in the record (and the liveblog, five short minutes ago) Graham then tries to put another question about the decision to sell BHS with an unresolved pension deficit, and Green isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t happy at all. He repeats that he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s going to find a solution, and blames the pension regulator. Sir, the regulator has never called me! Do you want me to write down my mobile phone number and email so you can pass it on? Green is now dishing out fashion advice to Jeremy Quin. The committee continue to push Sir Philip Green about exactly how closely he knew Dominic Chappell, and when. Green insists that he first met Chappell on February 3rd 2015. Q: Meet often socially before then? Green makes a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153zero\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd sign with his finger and thumb. Q: So why was Chappell telling his mates in 2014 that he was going to buy BHS? Was it a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153fantasy land\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd idea? Green suggests Chappell is a permanent resident of fantasy land..... [Anyone know if Fantasy Land is a tax haven, ala Monaco?] Green may be getting more confident - he tells Richard Fuller to \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcrelax\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 and stop butting in. Q: Would you have done the BHS deal if Chappell hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t passed Goldman Sachs\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 smell test? No, Green insists. A million percent no. But Richard Fuller MP suggests that Green must have had concerns -- otherwise why vet Chappell at all? Q: So will you deal with Goldman Sachs again? Green won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t answer this question - saying he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not blaming anyone (?!). He defends choosing to sell to Chappell, as he didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to sell it to someone who would have put BHS into administration. If the business plan laid out in 2015 had been followed by the new owners, the company would have survived, he adds [Reminder: BHS\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s former finance officer also told the committee last week that BHS could have been saved, with better leadership from Chappell] Green denies that he blundered by not Googling Dominic Chappell and discovering he was a former bankrupt. I checked Google, and found that Walt Disney and HJ Heinz were made bankrupt, he says. Businessmen go bankrupt from time to time, Q: But your chief financial officer also knew he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d been involved with a convicted fraudster.... Green says he didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know the full details of the links between Chappell and Sutton. Philip Green seems to have abandoned his pledge not to blame anyone else. He tells the committee that top brass at law firm Olswang, and accountants Grant Thornton, helped to give Dominic Chappell vital credibility. I took a great deal of comfort that those two firms were representing Chappell, says Green, even though he suspect \u00e2\u20ac\u0153they didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know the guy from a hole in the wall\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd before the deal began. The committee are pushing Green about exactly how Dominic Chappell came on the scene.... Green also tries to dob Goldman Sachs in, citing a congratulatory email from top GS banker Anthony Gutman to Chappell. Q: So, how did talks with Dominic Chappell begin? Green says that he didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t meet Chappell until he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d been \u00e2\u20ac\u0153independently vetted\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd by Goldman Sachs. [Background: last week, Chappell told the committee that he learned via Paul Sutton that BHS was for sale] Green reveals that Paul Budge, Arcadia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s finance director, asked for an affidavit from Chappell stating that there was no link to Sutton. Q: Why would you do that? There was a point when we realised there was a possible connection between the men, so we wanted a pledge that they weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t linked, says Green. The Sunday Times\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Oliver Shah has an important insight on this point: Conservative MP Amanda Solloway now takes up the questioning, asking Green about how the sale of BHS unfolded. He says Robin Saunders, a top City banker, had flagged up \u00e2\u20ac\u0153en passant\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd that she knew of a well-funded individual who was interested in buying the group. He confirms that this was Paul Sutton, a convicted fraudster, who Green says he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d not met previously. Chappell didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t come onto the scene until 3 February 2015, Green insists - sinking the idea that Chappell was a leading light in Sutton\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s deal team. And Green then says that a mysterious file on Sutton landed on his desk, which prompted Arcadia to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153disengage\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd with him. Q: Robin Saunders told us that she warned you in June 2013 that Sutton was discredited....yet you still continued to deal with him. Not true, Green insists - we broke off talk as soon as the file arrived [he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s vague about when it turned up, though] Q: Did you lambast your team for not discovering problems with Sutton? Green pauses, looking suspicious, and then asks if the committee have a note saying that happened (!). It seems they do not. And we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re back... Reminder you can watch the session in the top of this blog - or on Parliament Live. Green seems in jovial mood: Jeremy Quin MP turns to the sale of BHS to ex-bankrupt Dominic Chappell. Green denies Chappell\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s claim that he was initially led to believe he could buy BHS without its pension liabilities. There was no question that was ever on the table once we began serious negotiations, Green insists. Q: But this looks like a classic bait-and-switch... Not so, Green says Q: Chappell says he wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t given access to the BHS trustees or the pension regulator. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not true, Green says, suggesting that Chappell actually met with Chris Martin, the head of the pension trustees. Q: Chris Martin has notes of a conversation with you, the day after the deal was done, in which you say he potentially jeopardised the deal by telling Chappell the annual pension contributions could rise to \u00c2\u00a330m. Green doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t really address this point. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our first news story on Sir Philip Green\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s testimony, from Graham Ruddick: That was one of the most combative, sometimes aggressive performances I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve seen from a businessman before MPs. So, where do we stand, as the participants take a quick break? Philip Green has apologised to BHS staff for the collapse of the company, saying: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153There certainly was no intent at all on my part for anything to be like this. It didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t need to be like this and I just want to apologise to all the BHS people who have been involved in this\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. He has promised to find a solution to the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pension deficit, pledging: We want to find a solution for the 20,000 pensioners. But Green has refused to take the blame for the pension black hole, saying \u00e2\u20ac\u0153stupid and idiotic\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd decisions were made. He claimed ignorance about the nitty-gritty of the finances at his empire Insisted that he invested in BHS, rather than just huge taking dividends out Defended his decision to live in a tax haven Told one MP to stop staring Described female MPs as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153your lady\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Struggled to pour a glass of water One finally final question before the break - was Green unhappy that Arcadia chairman Lord Grabiner didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t even turn up for the meeting when BHS was sold? Green declines to put the boot into Grabiner, suggesting he may have had other commitments. And now a 15 minute break - after which, we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll hear about the decision to sell BHS to Dominic Chappell.... Green also suggests that he did the right thing for BHS. I could simply have put the company into administration, he argues, and addressed the pension issue that way. And he also takes another pop at the recent press coverage: In the last four weeks, I could be a murderer for the way they write about me. Last questions before a quick break. Jeremy Quin MP asks Green whether he agrees that his failure to keep a closer eye on the BHS pension scheme was a corporate governance failure. Green doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t accept the charge, and then perks up when the House of Commons bells ring. Break time, he smiles. No Mr Green, that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the bell for prayers, Frank Field explains gently. Is that for you or for me, asks the Arcadia boss. For both of us hopefully, Field murmers. Green, who looks desperate for a break, repeats that he wants everyone to know that he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s committed to finding a soltuion to the BHS pension scheme There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s nothing I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m going to tell you that you can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t go and check up.,.... I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m not going to tell you lies. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the third time Green has promised he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not fibbing.... Richard Graham MP is pushing Green on Project Thor. He suggesting that the scheme was suspended once the regulator demanded more details about exactly what Arcadia would putting into the BHS scheme. And he produces an email from the chair of the BHS pension trustees, which says Green was unhappy that the regulator was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Trawling through bullshit from 10 years ago\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Graham points out that Green had originally proposed selling BHS to Dominic Chappell free of its pension liabilities. Is that because you thought Project Thor would have been executed first? Green won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t engage.... snarling: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m sorry, are we in the same room? I can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t deal with this\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd And he appeals to committee chair Frank Field to call Graham off, before repeating that he will solve the pension issue. Graham won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be knocked off course by Green\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s antics though, referring to Dominic Chappell\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s evidence from last week. He suggests that Green decided to sell BHS to Chappell for \u00c2\u00a31 to get the pension problem off his hands (once the regulator threw up hurdles to the Project Thor scheme). If you look out of the window, is the sky light or dark, asks Green sarcastically (and bafflingly). He also denies that he threatened to pull the sale if Chappell contacted the pension regulator (as Chappell claimed last week). Sky News\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Mark Kleinman reckons Green is making a substantial commitment to his former workers... The committee turn to Project Thor, Arcadia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s proposal to restructure the BHS pension scheme, which was suspended in 2014. Green reveals that there has been contact with the regulator in recent days, saying snidely that. The regulator made a phone call - maybe someone bought them a telephone. And Green hints that a deal is still possible to address the \u00c2\u00a3571m deficit, saying \u00e2\u20ac\u0153there does seem to be a light in the tunnel\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Green declares that he wants to give a reassurance to BHS\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 20,000 pensioners that he will sort the problem out. We want to find a solution for the 20,000 pensioners. Green argues that putting the scheme into the Pension Protection Fund (the PPF - the lifeboat for failed schemes) would not resolve the issue , as the schemes are quite complex, says Green. And he then pledges: But I believe it is resolvable, it is solvable. We will sort it, we will find a solution. Q: Does that mean that pensioners would get everything they are entitled to, asks Frank Field. Green won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t make such a commitment, but repeats that his advisers are working on a solution, and it will be presented soon. [background: there are rumours that Green could set up a separate \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Phoenix\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd fund to provide extra payments to BHS pensioners] Richard Graham MP suggests that Sir Philip Green met with pensions minister Steve Webb in 2012 about reducing BHS\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pension levy -- suggesting the issue was actually on his agenda. And then he lashes out again at Graham, demanding to know: Which bit of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t remember\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd do you find difficult? SNP MP Mhairi Black (who isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t on the committee) can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t believe what she\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hearing: Conservative MP Richard Graham leads Green through the details of BHS pension deficit. He gets him to agree that BHS was the sponsor for its pension scheme, and that the average BHS wage was \u00c2\u00a317,000, meaning a long career would deliver a pension of \u00c2\u00a38,500 per year. So the scheme went from a surplus when you bought it, to a deficit in 2005. Then you later proposed putting \u00c2\u00a310m per year into the fund to fix the deficit - how was that decision made? Green again claims it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s nothing to do with him, and tried to blame others (such as pension trustee chair Margaret Downes). I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to pass this to other people, but there has to be some accountability..... There have been some stupid, stupid, idiotic mistakes made. Karen Buck MP has a valiant attempt to pin Green down about the meetings he had with BHS\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pension trustees. You can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t expect me to remember what I did eight years, ago, he insists. He suggests Buck must have been a mind-reader in a previous life if she could remember such details, and should come to work for Arcadia. Buck points out that if she were testifying to a committee, she\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d know jolly well who she\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s met with. City analyst Louise Cooper shares the committee\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sense of disbelief: The MPs are simply not convinced that Green could have been so ignorant about the BHS pension scheme. Iain Wright MP points out that the Arcadia chief famously once intervened to change BHS\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s coat hangers, to save \u00c2\u00a3400,000 per year. Would a man who did that really ignore the pensions of 11,000 staff? Green insists that no-one brought the issue to his attention, while also claiming that he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not blaming anyone else. And he also repeats that he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not a liar... I am here, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m happy to be accountable. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m not a liar, I can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t tell you about things I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m not responsible. Someone was asleep at the wheel about the pension issue, he concludes. Do luxury yachts have wheels? Green keeps referring to female MPs on the committee as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153your lady here\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u201c which is going down as badly as you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d expect. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Sir Philip Green\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s apology to BHS staff (delivered at the start of the hearing) \u00e2\u20ac\u0153There certainly (was) no intent at all on my part for anything to be like this. It didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t need to be like this and I just want to apologise to all the BHS people who have been involved in this.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Sir Philip Green is unhappy that MPs keep interrupting him, trying to pin him down on the pension problems. He insists that he simply wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t involved until 2012 (!) But we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve been told that you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re a Napoleon of industry, explains Frank Field MP, the man in control of everything. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re struggling to acclimatise to this new image of you... Green looks hurt, saying: I haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t run away, I haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t tried to run away. He hits out at the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153outrageous and pretty rude media coverage\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in recent months, which have created quite the wrong impression. And he then issues a second apology, for the pension deficit: I\u00e2\u20ac\u02dcm happy to apologise, I should have been involved earlier. For whatever reason I wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t, but I should have been involved earlier. Onto the BHS pensions black hole.... Green says that the pension deficit should have been tackled as soon as he bought the company. But he also argues that it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not his fault, blaming \u00e2\u20ac\u0153poor communication\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd on both sides. He also reveals he only spoke to the BHS pension trustees on a handful of occasions Green also tries to spread the blame around, saying a lot of money was paid to pension advisers -- \u00c2\u00a3650,000 in the early days, rising to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153north of \u00c2\u00a31.5m\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd by 2005-06. The MPs are concerned that Green doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t seem to have been a very caring steward of the BHS pension fund. In 2000, it had a \u00c2\u00a343m surplus, before you began taking dividends out. Tht\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not very fair, Green insists. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153With due respect\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve explained that we put \u00c2\u00a3750m back into the company. I was not a trustee of the pension fund, he insists. Q: But surely you are ultimately accountable for the pension fund? Where\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s this conversation taking us, demands Green - [perhaps suspecting that his wallet is being lined up for a hit] Q: Does your wife ever share the details of the accounts of her offshore property company (which owned some BHS properties)? No, says Green, shaking his head and chewing on his spectacles. Q: Why didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t the hundreds of millions you say you put into BHS do much good? Retail is difficult, snaps Green - if it wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t, anyone could do it. And \u00e2\u20ac\u0153without being rude\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, he suggests Fuller should give it a go sometime. I know that I wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be any good at it, Fuller smiles back. Green invites MPs to visit Arcadia to see for themselves how it works.... Richard Fuller MP \u00e2\u20ac\u201c he of the piercing stare \u00e2\u20ac\u201c tells Green that he learned in business that you should look people in the eye when you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re dealing with them. Q: What\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the purpose of a company - is it to make money, to employ people, be creative? To run a business, says Green, looking a little confused. Fuller rattles through some BHS financial statements from 2000-2004, which he claims show that Green took a lot in dividends and invested little in BHS. Green queries it, saying the figures show \u00c2\u00a370m was spent on capital expenditure, and \u00c2\u00a380m on corporation tax. Plus \u00c2\u00a3380m in dividends. Q: Why is the \u00c2\u00a3380m dividend figure different than the \u00c2\u00a3423m we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve heard earlier? Green airily says he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d just reading out the numbers handed by his finance team, arguing that he doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t really get involved with the money side of things. I wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t even know who to phone to take money out of our bank. Frank Field MP says this is quite a contrast with Dominic Chappell, who was very intent on taking money out of BHS once he bought it from Green for \u00c2\u00a31. Asked about BHS\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decline under his ownership, Green says it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s very hard to find world-champion CEOs. He pins some the blame on the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153very poor property deals\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd signed before he bought it. Some were on leases of 40 or 50 years, and that gradually eroded the profitability. Q: Wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t it have been a good idea to sell in 2009? With hindsight, 2002 would have been a good time to sell it, smirks Green [ie, after Tina Green had cashed that \u00c2\u00a3400m dividend cheque] Snap summary: I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m starting to suspect Sir Philip would rather be sunning himself on his new \u00c2\u00a3100m yacht, Lionheart. He just broke off an answer to ask Richard Fuller MP to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153stop staring\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd at him, as it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s making him uncomfortable. Fuller insists he doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to make Green uncomfortable, as everyone stares at Green in disbelief. Green then declines to comment on how much money is still owed to his wife Tina, as he doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t sign off the accounts. But you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re a director of the company, points out a startled Jeremy Quin. Oops. Green now interrupts the committee so he can deliver a short speech correcting some inaccuracies delivered by previous witnesses. He says \u00c2\u00a3254m was invested in BHS in the early days. After 2009, his Arcadia empire loaned \u00c2\u00a3250m, interest free, plus another \u00c2\u00a3100m in additional capital. In total, he says, Arcadia put \u00c2\u00a3600m in -- in the years between taking \u00c2\u00a3400m dividends out and selling to Dominic Chappell. He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trying to puncture the idea that he ravaged the business like a rapacious robber baron. Green says he first thought about selling BHS in 2014, although it would have saved \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a lot of aggravation\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd if he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d sold sooner. Q: Why did your Arcadia operation take over some of BHS\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s back-office functions? Green claims it was for efficiencies, saying the service was provided below cost. And again, he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not accepting criticism.... Michelle Thomson MP points out that Green\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s property operation is based offshore, in Jersey, outside the UK tax jurisdiction. Green doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t accept the criticism, saying that 30 or 40% of the FTSE is owned by offshore companies. It is the British Home Stores, and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s owned by your wife, points out Frank Field. Thomson asks Green if he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll release all his accounts, including those of the offshore companies, to help the pensions regulator conduct its inquiries into BHS. Green says he doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have these details (even though his wife Tina is the ultimate owner). He insists that he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s never held an offshore bank account. The committee turn to the BHS properties which were sold to Green family companies (in a sale and leaseback scheme). Q: Does that mean that you avoided paying tax on \u00c2\u00a3152m rent? It doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t work like that, mutters Green, suggesting this isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t a sensible path to go down. Q: So how does it work? Green says he and his family left the country in 1998 for health reasons after a heart scare. He then returned to the UK to work, leaving his family behind. He suggests that Monaco was recommended to him as a good place to recuperate. Q: When did you first discover the tax advantages, asks Frank Field innocently (ish) I think it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s well known, Green replies - but at that stage he didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know how his career would turn out. Q: But didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t you ever think that it wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t appropriate to be based in a tax haven? Green denies that he structured his business to avoid tax -- we have paid tax on all the money raised in the UK, and paid a lot of it, he insists. Green is already looking irked as the committee try to dig into BHS\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s finances. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve already had two \u00e2\u20ac\u0153with respect\u00e2\u20ac\ufffds.... Q: What about the dividends that you took out of BHS? Green claims that he didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t operate an aggressive financial strategy at BHS. Q: But in 2000-2004 dividends were around double the profits... Green cites different figures, claiming that they show BHS made a profit of \u00c2\u00a3537m during that period [higher than the \u00c2\u00a3400m dividends his family took out] Q: But do you still think that the dividend policy was prudent? The leverage used was not excessive, Green insists. Sir Philip Green then tells the committee that his \u00e2\u20ac\u0153emotional tie\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to BHS meant he hung onto the chain too long, adding. Nothing is more sad than how this has ended. And he then apologises to staff at BHS for the chain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s collapse. And we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re off. Frank Field begins by welcoming Philip Green. And then Michelle Thomson starts the questioning, asking Green what value sums up his career as a top retailer. Green looks a bit surprised by this approach, replying that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not right to mark your own essay\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. He then explains that he began at the bottom, trudging the streets at 6.30am selling clothing. If I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve done something wrong, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll put my hands up and admit it. And I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t tell lies, he pledges. Q: So would you sum up your attribute as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153honesty and hard working\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Yes, I think so, Green replies. The eagerly anticipated session begins shortly. We are embedding a live feed at the top of this blog (you might need to refresh to see it). It is also being streamed live here, and on BBC Parliament. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Daily Mirror points out that taxpayers have effectively subsidised Green\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s retail empire over many years, through tax credits to bump up salaries. One tantalising question is whether Sir Philip Green maintains his composure once MPs probe his conduct over BHS: Chris Nuttall of the Financial Times explains: The first challenge facing the Svengali of the rag trade will be to keep his temper. Sir Philip has a short fuse and MPs will be tempted to see if they can light it. Anger is the short cut to putting his foot in it. This brings us on to Point Two: don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t swear or crack jokes. The entrepreneur uses some colourful language in private and has a sardonic sense of humour. He needs to keep it clean and straight-faced for the cameras. Thirdly the entrepreneur and part-time admiral in the Monaco Navy must sound contrite \u00e2\u20ac\u201c 11,000 people have lost their jobs. Sir Philip can be expected to avoid negotiating a settlement of liabilities for BHS\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s underfunded pension scheme on-air, not least because committee chair Frank Field MP wants \u00c2\u00a3600m, far more than is needed to cover the deficit on an ongoing basis. No sign of Sir Phil yet.... Dave Gill, national officer of the Usdaw trade union, says Philip Green must explain exactly why BHS failed. He told BBC Radio 4\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Today programme. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We should remember there are 11,000 employees that could in the next six weeks be out of jobs. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153They want to know what exactly has Philip Green been doing over the last number of years? What suddenly made him pull the plug on it? Its a very sad time and he should be held accountable for it.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Gill adds that workers deserve answers on why Green handed the business to Dominic Chappell last year: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The main thing that people find concerning is that he could just sell his company for \u00c2\u00a31 to someone who has already been bankrupt a number of times. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not as though he even tried to sell it on to someone credible who could actually try and turn the business round.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Reading between the lines it seems that his view was just to try and get rid of it as soon as possible. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve rounded up the 11 key questions which MPs must put to Green today, so lets see how many the MPs manage to ask. Why did you sell BHS to Dominic Chappell? Why were you in such a hurry to sell BHS? What profit did you and your wife make from BHS? What will you do to help the BHS pension scheme? How much did you know about Chappell\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s deal with the Dellal family? [they loaned Chappell \u00c2\u00a335m, and were planning to buy BHS\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s HQ, Marylebone House] Why did you sell Marylebone House to Arcadia when there were external buyers? Did you use \u00c2\u00a335m of debt to unduly influence BHS in the past year? Did you break a promise to arrange credit insurance for BHS? Did you block a BHS rescue deal with Sports Direct? [as Chappell claimed last week] How much did you or your companies pay to Retail Acquisitions or Dominic Chappell? Do you think your conduct has been befitting of a knight? More details here: Green had threatened to boycott today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hearing, furious with Frank Field MP for suggesting he should lose his knighthood. But yesterday, he confirmed he would show up today, saying: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This will be the first and only opportunity I have had to tell my side of the very sad BHS story, and I will do my best to answer all the questions put to me in an honest and open way.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m not sure this is exactly the first opportunity \u00e2\u20ac\u201c frankly, we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d have sent a taxi to Monaco if Green had fancied speaking out sooner. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our news story about today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s session: People are already flocking to Portcullis House ready for Green\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s appearance, in an hour\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time. Good morning. Sir Philip Green is swapping the luxury of the Monto Carlo yacht club for the relative austerity of parliament\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Portcullis House today, as MPs continue to probe the collapse of the BHS retail chain. And it should be an absolute belter of a session, perhaps one of the most exciting since these events were televised. Green, one of Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s most successful businesspeople, has been summoned to explain his part in a scandal that is costing 11,000 jobs and threatening the pensions of thousands more former employees. The Business, Innovation and Skills committee, and the Work and Pensions committee, will together quiz Green about his stewardship of BHS, and the seemingly huge sums he paid his family during that time. They must quiz Green on his fateful decision to sell the chain in 2015 for \u00c2\u00a31 to a man, Dominic Chappell, with a couple of bankruptcies on his CV but no retail experience. That includes investigating curious property deals which appeared to be designed to help make Chappell look like a credible bidder. And probably most importantly, they need to press Green hard on the BHS pension deficit (currently \u00c2\u00a3571m). Why didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t he fix this problem before the sale, rather than leaving it in Chappell\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tender clutches? And what will he do to fix the mess now? Green\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s reputation has been badly damaged by the unfolding drama around BHS already. His credibility is on the line. And so is the knighthood he received a decade ago for services to the fashion industry. The meeting is due to start at 9.15am. And it could be an epic session, as the room is booked until 2.30pm. So get the popcorn in.",

                "bodyText":"Rolls-Royce has unveiled its first driverless vehicle, a concept car that promises to help its owner announce their importance to the world. The Vision Next 100 is an autonomous vehicle aimed at \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the most discerning and powerful patrons in the world\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. It has no steering wheel and a silk \u00e2\u20ac\u0153throne\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd from which its occupants can watch the world go by. Rolls-Royce said the zero-emission model, codenamed 103EX, showed the company \u00e2\u20ac\u0153rejects the notion of anonymous, utilitarian and bland future modes of mobility\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. In a statement that was short on technical specifications but packed with florid description, Rolls-Royce promised an interior made only of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the most precious and contemporary elegance\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. The owner will be \u00e2\u20ac\u0153encircled by the most modern handcrafted fine-line Macassar wood panelling\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd as they gaze at a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153generous\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd high-definition television screen.

It is understood to have contacted many Chinese sellers, giving them until the end of the month to provide their VAT numbers.</p> <p>Recent years have seen an explosion in small, overseas firms using Amazon and other sites to sell to online shoppers in the UK. Large numbers, including many from China, are not charging VAT. As a result, they have been able to reach the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153bestseller\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd rankings, dominating some of the most popular listings on Amazon. <br></p> <p>While much attention has been paid in recent years to how Amazon, Apple, Google and other tech groups have arranged their affairs internationally so as to avoid corporation tax, the loss to the UK public purse from the hordes of overseas sellers who have found ways to sell online in the UK without charging VAT may be far greater. <br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/mar/16/amazon-ebay-liable-vat-sellers-budget-2016\">Amazon and eBay to be held liable for VAT fraud by sellers</a> </p> </aside>  <p>HMRC has described such VAT evasion as a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153<a href=\"http://data.parliament.uk/writtenevidence/committeeevidence.svc/evidencedocument/public-accounts-committee/tackling-tax-fraud-how-hmrc-responds-to-tax-evasion-the-hidden-economy-and-criminal-attack/oral/26870.html\">very big issue</a>\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, estimated to cost <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/vat-representatives-for-overseas-businesses-and-joint-and-several-liability-for-online-marketplaces/vat-representatives-for-overseas-businesses-and-joint-and-several-liability-for-online-marketplaces\">up to \u00c2\u00a31.5bn a year</a> in lost tax.

Marketplace providers have responsibilities.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd</p> <p>Amazon has rejected this, insisting widespread VAT fraud is not its concern. The company says it is not responsible for policing the VAT compliance of the hundreds of traders who sell goods in the UK via its site.<br></p> <p>Behind the scenes, however, Amazon\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/apr/27/former-asda-director-amazon-uk-doug-gurr\">new UK boss, Doug Gurr</a>, who previously led Amazon\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Chinese business, is thought to be keen to avoid a repeat of last year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s embarrassing revelations about VAT abuses among overseas sellers.</p> <p>In the run-up to Christmas, a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/nov/01/uk-losing-millions-vat-non-eu-sellers-amazon-ebay\">Guardian investigation</a> identified a wave of overseas traders, many based in China, who were using Amazon UK to warehouse and sell a wide range of goods without charging VAT. <br></p> <p>In response, George Osborne <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/mar/16/amazon-ebay-liable-vat-sellers-budget-2016\">announced new powers</a> in his March budget to help HMRC police VAT compliance in online retail \u00e2\u20ac\u201c including, in some instances, holding marketplace websites such as Amazon liable for missing tax. <br></p> <p>The chancellor said <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/vat-representatives-for-overseas-businesses-and-joint-and-several-liability-for-online-marketplaces/vat-representatives-for-overseas-businesses-and-joint-and-several-liability-for-online-marketplaces\">these measures</a> would help curb the abuse and restore \u00c2\u00a3875m in tax receipts over the next four years.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"5c9f37b2be8cee942bdd3f85d69fa12756beb0ce\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5c9f37b2be8cee942bdd3f85d69fa12756beb0ce/104_60_154_192/154.jpg\" alt=\"Doug Gurr, Amazon\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new UK boss\" width=\"154\" height=\"192\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Doug Gurr, Amazon\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new UK boss, is keen to avoid revelations about VAT abuses.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Supplied</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Gurr\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s recent review of seller compliance is not thought to signal a more collaborative approach to combating VAT fraud.

                "bodyText":"Amazon is quietly rooting out many of its Chinese traders who do not hold UK VAT numbers to try to protect itself from tax evasion inquiries later this year when new HMRC powers come into force, the Guardian has learned. The online retailer has been conducting a review of sellers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 VAT compliance in the UK. It is understood to have contacted many Chinese sellers, giving them until the end of the month to provide their VAT numbers. Recent years have seen an explosion in small, overseas firms using Amazon and other sites to sell to online shoppers in the UK. Large numbers, including many from China, are not charging VAT. As a result, they have been able to reach the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153bestseller\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd rankings, dominating some of the most popular listings on Amazon. While much attention has been paid in recent years to how Amazon, Apple, Google and other tech groups have arranged their affairs internationally so as to avoid corporation tax, the loss to the UK public purse from the hordes of overseas sellers who have found ways to sell online in the UK without charging VAT may be far greater. HMRC has described such VAT evasion as a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153very big issue\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, estimated to cost up to \u00c2\u00a31.5bn a year in lost tax. But officials have been frustrated by what is seen by some as the uncooperative approach taken by many big websites, including Amazon. In January, Lin Homer, then head of HMRC, told a parliamentary committee: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We do feel, just as with beer and alcohol, that those people who manage the supply chain should ensure enough diligence is built into it. Marketplace providers have responsibilities.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Amazon has rejected this, insisting widespread VAT fraud is not its concern. The company says it is not responsible for policing the VAT compliance of the hundreds of traders who sell goods in the UK via its site. Behind the scenes, however, Amazon\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new UK boss, Doug Gurr, who previously led Amazon\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Chinese business, is thought to be keen to avoid a repeat of last year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s embarrassing revelations about VAT abuses among overseas sellers. In the run-up to Christmas, a Guardian investigation identified a wave of overseas traders, many based in China, who were using Amazon UK to warehouse and sell a wide range of goods without charging VAT. In response, George Osborne announced new powers in his March budget to help HMRC police VAT compliance in online retail \u00e2\u20ac\u201c including, in some instances, holding marketplace websites such as Amazon liable for missing tax. The chancellor said these measures would help curb the abuse and restore \u00c2\u00a3875m in tax receipts over the next four years. Gurr\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s recent review of seller compliance is not thought to signal a more collaborative approach to combating VAT fraud. In a statement to the Guardian, a spokesperson reiterated: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Sellers are independent businesses responsible for complying with their own VAT obligations. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We do offer tools and information to assist sellers with their compliance, but we don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have the authority to review their tax affairs.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Amazon said it did nevertheless cooperate with HMRC when required by law. The company spokesperson confirmed there were no plans to require Chinese or other overseas traders to display their UK VAT numbers on Amazon\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s site. That decision remains controversial because, under the EU\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s e-commerce directive, online sellers are required to make their VAT numbers \u00e2\u20ac\u0153easily, directly and permanently accessible\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to customers. Since the Guardian\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s investigation into VAT fraud last year, HMRC has carried out a series of raids on independent warehouses in the UK used by overseas traders, seizing goods worth more than \u00c2\u00a3500,000. Officials have also held urgent meetings with top executives at Amazon and eBay to discuss the problem. Angry UK traders, who have been unable to compete with the new wave of VAT-evading overseas competitors, have called for ministers to clamp down on this widespread tax fraud. Campaign groups representing UK-based sellers, including Ravas and VATfraud.org, have called for Amazon and other sites used by overseas sellers to be held immediately liable for all lost VAT. But Osborne has declined to go that far. Instead, new rules announced in his March budget \u00e2\u20ac\u201c expected to come into force with the 2016 finance bill \u00e2\u20ac\u201c made it clear retail websites would only be held accountable if they failed to act after suspected abuses had been brought to their attention by HMRC. Guardian investigations into VAT fraud last year involved a \u00c2\u00a31,818.20 sample order placed through Amazon with small overseas seller companies. The order included VAT of \u00c2\u00a30.00. Among the 24 items ordered were high-value goods such as an Apple watch, iPad, Fitbit and Panasonic camera, as well as cheaper products including a bike light, corkscrew and mobile phone case. The items were being sold by 23 different seller companies that appeared to have minimal or no business operations in the UK. Nine gave addresses in Hong Kong, eight in China and six in the US. All had arranged for Amazon to hold their stock in the UK, pack and send parcels, and deal with payment and returns queries. When contacted by email and asked if they could provide a VAT receipt, many of the 23 sellers declined. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We are sorry that we are not VAT registered,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said one.
