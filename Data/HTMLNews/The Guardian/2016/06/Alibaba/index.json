The 5.2% increase in wealth among the world\u2019s richest individuals was driven largely by the Asia-Pacific area, which is expected to overtake western Europe as the second wealthiest region behind North America next year. The annual snapshot measures private wealth by cash, deposits and assets such as shares and bonds, but excludes property. China recorded one of the the biggest jumps in millionaire households of all countries in the BCG annual wealth report, up 27% to 2.07m.

This gross inequality is a symptom of an unjust and unfair economic system that allows the rich to get richer at the expense of the poor.\u201d The Capgemini report showed that the number of ultra-rich people \u2013 those with assets worth more than $30m \u2013 rose at a slower rate than in previous years. Their number grew by just over 4% in 2015, compared with annual increase of nearly 8% between 2010 and 2014. Their wealth grew 2.5% last year compared with an average of 6% in the previous four years, dragged down by Latin America. If current trends continue, the wealth held by the world\u2019s richest is projected to exceed $100tn by 2025 \u2013 nearly triple the amount in 2006, according to Capgemini. Despite the financial crisis, the millionaires\u2019 wealth has expanded almost fourfold over the last 20 years. Ricks called on governments to reverse cuts to public spending, privatisation, tax breaks for the wealthy and \u201cthe race to the bottom on human rights\u201d. Capgemini said an unexpected trend of the past 20 years had been the high levels of cash held by the world\u2019s richest. Despite overall strong stock market performance, millionaires have continued to hold almost a quarter of their financial wealth in cash \u2013 to fund their lavish lifestyles as well as to protect against market volatility.",
