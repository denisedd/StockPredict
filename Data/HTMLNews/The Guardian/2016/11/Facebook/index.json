Second, he needs to continue to give voice to the calmer, more gracious version of himself that was on display in his election night acceptance speech. </p> <p>No-one should expect him to repudiate everything he said in the campaign about open borders and trade deals such as the Trans Pacific Partnership Agreement. But the third test for the President-Elect will be to demonstrate that he does not plan to tear up the parts of the Washington establishment that are actually working quite well \u2013 notably, the US Federal Reserve.</p> </blockquote> <p>Flanders points out that Trump\u2019s economic plans will have major implications for the global economy:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The combination of looser fiscal policy and increased uncertainty over globalisation would be likely to mean a stronger dollar and potentially higher US inflation and higher interest rates. That is not a hugely helpful combination for the rest of the global economy, especially emerging markets. But that, too, is uncertain and could take time to materialise. In the meantime, my colleagues and I are not predicting a radically different path for the US economy following this result - or for US interest rates.</p> </blockquote> <p>And remember, Trump\u2019s success or failure won\u2019t be measured in stock prices or foreign exchange rate. Flanders says:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>This is about the kind of country that America wants to be.</p> <p>At the heart of Donald Trump\u2019s appeal was a promise to make it a nation that works better for the mass of voters who feel they have been left behind by globalisation and by the global financial crisis. For better or worse, that is the standard by which every developed country politician will increasingly be judged.

Donald Trump shifted and flip-flopped on several key issues in recent months, and often tailored his message to fit the circumstances. As president, his ability to define himself as a \u201cwinner\u201d will require a different approach, and most of his pre-election proposals will be modified.<br></li> <li><strong>The speed at which the Republicans were uniting was very apparent in the hours following the victory.</strong> There was much dissent even within the party, but a \u201cclean-sweep\u201d soothes the wounds. Republicans have a once-in-a-career chance to enact their full agenda will little opposition. If infighting spoils those odds, heads will roll.

Indeed, the markets seem to have decided that President Trump will be a relatively normal President, even if candidate Trump was a deeply unusual candidate. I\u2019m not so sure.</p> <p>To adapt a a phrase: \u201cdemagogues can stay irrational longer than you can stay solvent\u201d.</p> <p>Still, as a base case a meaningful fiscal easing seems likely. Real estate developers like building stuff after all, Republicans are pretty keen on cutting taxes and this will be a lot easier to get through Congress for a Republican President. This is what incoming Republican Presidents do \u2014 they cut taxes in a meaningful way and many supposed deficit hawks use<a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-12-04/laffer-curve-napkin-doodle-launched-supply-side-economics\">back of the napkin logic</a> to tell themselves \u201cthese tax cuts will pay for themselves\u201d. (Actually they won\u2019t).</p> </blockquote> <p>But to simply assume that America gets higher economic demand, lower unemployment, a pick-up in inflation and a return to normal interest rates misses the big pictures, Weldon says:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Implicit in that line of analysis are assumptions about the Fed\u2019s reaction functions and about productivity growth that need to be questioned. And, crucially, it misses the biggest shift that Trump\u2019s Presidency could bring about \u2014 a rejection of \u201cglobalisation\u201d/economic openness.</p> </blockquote> <p>And if productivity remains low, some economists fear that steady wage growth, solid corporate profits and moderate inflation is an \u2018impossible trinity\u2019 to achieve.</p> <p>There\u2019s lots more here:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/DuncanWeldon/status/796698770138419201\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Post: Political Economy &amp;

                "bodyText":"It\u2019s official! The Dow Jones industrial average has closed at a new alltime high, as Wall Street continues to assess the impact of Donald Trump\u2019s election victory. After another day of volatile trading in world markets, starting with big gains in Asia, the Dow ended the day up nearly 1.2% at 18,807 points. It was a rally driven by companies who, investors think, will do well under a Trump presidency. That means banks (assuming the new administration repeals the Dodd-Frank regulations), and industrial firms (who would profit from infrastructure sending). But tech firms kept falling, hit by fears that immigration curbs or protectionist trade police would hurt them. Bloomberg has a neat summary: Amazon.com Inc. fell 3.8 percent to lead the rout in technology. JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. jumped 4.6 percent and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. climbed 4.3 percent. Drugmakers advanced, led by Pfizer Inc.\u2019s 4.3 percent rally. Caterpillar Inc. added 2.5 percent. Procter &amp; Gamble Co. plunged 3.5 percent. Government bond yields ended the day higher too, pushed up by expectations of higher inflation and extra US government borrowing. The Dow is pushing higher, after Donald Trump and Barack Obama have their first meeting since the election. It\u2019s their first face-to-face meeting ever, in fact, Trump told reporters as the two men sat side by side, looking perfectly polite and rather serious. Our US politics liveblog has full details. Here\u2019s a flavour: Obama said the number one priority was to ensure a smooth transition, so Trump could be a successful president. \u201cIf he succeeds, the country succeeds,\u201d Obama said. Trump said he had \u201crespect for the president\u201d and said they talked about some wonderful things and some difficult things. Asked if he would seek the advice of the president, Trump said Obama was a \u201cvery fine man.\u201d And this latest sign of grown-up behaviour in Washington DC has pushed the Dow up by 1.05%, or 195 points, to 18,785, on track for a record close. I\u2019m taking a break now, but we\u2019ll be back with the Wall Street close... Capital Economics says investors are still in the dark about Donald Trump\u2019s plans: There is clearly still a large degree of uncertainty regarding the economic policies of the incoming Republican administration. However, investors appear to be concerned about the inflationary consequences if Mr Trump were to pursue protectionist policies alongside a sizeable fiscal expansion at a time when there is a limited degree of spare capacity in the economy. After three hours of trading, the Dow Jones industrial average is still on track to hit a record close. Pharmaceutical firms, banks and manufacturing companies are all leading the rally, on predictions that they\u2019ll benefit from Trumponomics. But technology firms are dragging the index back, due to fears that they\u2019ll suffer under the next presidency. Here\u2019s the story of how the Dow defied forecasts and spiked after Trump\u2019s victory: A new burst of volatility has driven the pound up against the US dollar, triggering a late selloff in London. Sterling is now up 1% at $1.251, as the markets continue to be buffeted as investors come to terms with Trump\u2019s success. A stronger pound will be welcomed by importers, but it makes a dent in the value of international companies who earn money abroad. So the FTSE 100 has just closed in the red, down 83 points at 6827. The smaller FTSE 250 index, which contains more UK focused companies, finished 0.4% higher though. It\u2019s been a funny day in the London stock market, even by recent standards. Bank shares have jumped, mirroring the rise in government bond yields (banks would welcome an end to ultra-low interest rates) Mining stocks are also up, following the surge in commodity prices -- America will need a lot more metal to implement Trump\u2019s new infrastructure plan. But utility stocks, tobacco firms and other defensive stocks have slid today, some by over 5%. The International Monetary Fund says it is looking forward to working with Donald Trump, and isn\u2019t prejudging him. Spokesman Gerry Rice told a press briefing in Washington that it\u2019s \u201ctoo early to speculate\u201d about whether Trump would hurt the global economy. Rice added: \u201cWe need to wait and see what the policies will actually be and we\u2019ll be making an assessment at that time.\u201d European stock markets are heading lower in late trading, as Trump-inspired volatility grips the City again. The S&amp;P tech stock index has shed 3%, and is on track for its worst day since the Brexit vote (via Reuters). Technology shares are suffering a Trump slump today, as investors calculate that Silicon Valley could suffer under the next president. Shares in Amazon, Netflix, Alphabet (Google) and Facebook have all fallen by at least 4%, and Apple and Microsoft are in the red too. Trump\u2019s criticism of companies who sent manufacturing overseas and hire large numbers of skilled workers from abroad, using the H1-B visa, could be bad news for the tech sector. He\u2019s also no fan of Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, whose Washington Post was pretty scathing of Trump during the election campaign. Investors large and small will be relieved that Wall Street hasn\u2019t crashed since Donald Trump pulled off one of the most surprising election results of the age. But obviously the market reaction plays second fiddle to the wider consequences of America\u2019s choice -- as the protests in New York, Chicago, Boston etc overnight show. Stephanie Flanders of JP Morgan says Trump needs to pass three tests, as the world watches him closely. The first will be for him to build a strong cabinet, with respected figures in key posts of Treasury Secretary and Secretary of State. Second, he needs to continue to give voice to the calmer, more gracious version of himself that was on display in his election night acceptance speech. No-one should expect him to repudiate everything he said in the campaign about open borders and trade deals such as the Trans Pacific Partnership Agreement. But the third test for the President-Elect will be to demonstrate that he does not plan to tear up the parts of the Washington establishment that are actually working quite well \u2013 notably, the US Federal Reserve. Flanders points out that Trump\u2019s economic plans will have major implications for the global economy: The combination of looser fiscal policy and increased uncertainty over globalisation would be likely to mean a stronger dollar and potentially higher US inflation and higher interest rates. That is not a hugely helpful combination for the rest of the global economy, especially emerging markets. But that, too, is uncertain and could take time to materialise. In the meantime, my colleagues and I are not predicting a radically different path for the US economy following this result - or for US interest rates. And remember, Trump\u2019s success or failure won\u2019t be measured in stock prices or foreign exchange rate. Flanders says: This is about the kind of country that America wants to be. At the heart of Donald Trump\u2019s appeal was a promise to make it a nation that works better for the mass of voters who feel they have been left behind by globalisation and by the global financial crisis. For better or worse, that is the standard by which every developed country politician will increasingly be judged. Whether Mr Trump will actually deliver with on that promise is another matter.\u201d Let\u2019s be honest, most analysts had predicted heavy losses if Trump won the presidential election. And most analysts were wrong. There are four pragmatic reasons to explain why stock markets have rallied since Trump won the presidential race, says Jim Cielinski of Columbia Threadneedle Investments. Trump \u201cthe President\u201d will not be the same thing as Trump \u201cthe candidate\u201d. Donald Trump shifted and flip-flopped on several key issues in recent months, and often tailored his message to fit the circumstances. As president, his ability to define himself as a \u201cwinner\u201d will require a different approach, and most of his pre-election proposals will be modified. The speed at which the Republicans were uniting was very apparent in the hours following the victory. There was much dissent even within the party, but a \u201cclean-sweep\u201d soothes the wounds. Republicans have a once-in-a-career chance to enact their full agenda will little opposition. If infighting spoils those odds, heads will roll. Adversaries within the party, such as Paul Ryan, recognise that their own careers will be cut short if they fail to mend the wounds and push the agenda forward. Expectations that the cabinet in a Trump presidency may hold unusual power, and that the markets must wait to assess who is appointed before jumping to conclusions. For the markets, the recognition that stimulative policy still carries with it expansionary benefits, irrespective of the presidential qualifications or likeability of the man putting the ideas forward. Banks stocks are rallying this morning, with JP Morgan up 4% and Goldman Sachs gaining 2%. They\u2019re benefitting from speculation that the Republicans could ditch Dodd-Frank, the legislation brought in to avoid a repeat of the financial crisis. Pharmaceutical stocks are up too, with Pfizer gaining 3.6%. Drug companies are boosted by Hillary Clinton\u2019s defeat, as she\u2019d promised to end price-gouging. And construction and infrastructure companies are benefitting from Trump\u2019s promise to rebuild American infrastructure. Caterpillar is up 2%. Boom! The Dow Jones industrial average has hit a new intraday record high, as the Trump bump reached New York. Shares have risen at the start of trading in Wall Street, adding to yesterday\u2019s rally, and defying predictions that markets would slump if Republicans won the race for the White House. The Dow is up 115 points, or +0.6%, at 18709. And the S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq has gained at least 0.5% too: Investors are still optimistic that Trump will deliver a growth-friendly fiscal stimulus scheme, despite the concerns flagged up earlier in this blog. Indeed, there\u2019s a remarkable u-turn underway, as Wall Street hopes that the billionaire businessman can metamorphose into a responsible president. Conner Campbell of SpreadEx says it shows how fickle investors can be: Before yesterday morning Trump was toxic yet now, following a vulgarity-free victory speech and back-peddling comments about Janet Yellen\u2019s position at the Fed, he is the biggest turn-on the market has seen in months. Never mind mere stagflation, the markets are being spooked by a new and scary-sounding beast. Trumpflation! The Financial Times has coined this term, to explain the big selloff in bond prices today. The fear is that bond investors might stampede for the exits if the new president drives up economic growth, inflation, and inflation expectations, with a debt-financed stimulus programme. Andrew Wilson, global co-head of fixed income at Goldman Sachs Asset Management, says: \u201cUnder a Trump presidency we are more likely to see fiscal expansion that drives growth and markets are reflecting that. \u201cThere was already latent inflationary pressures from the jobs market - Mr Trump\u2019s election has added fuel to that. Long term inflation expectations are rising and that explains why bond yields are rising and the yield curve is steepening.\u201d And if everyone tries to sell at once, yields could spike alarmingly and cause a bond crash. Alan Greenspan, the former head of the Federal Reserve, fears America is entering an era of stagflation -- rising prices, but little real growth. He\u2019s been speaking on CNBC: Greenspan also backed Donald Trump over one issue - the regulation of America\u2019s banking sector - saying: \u201cI\u2019d love to see Dodd-Frank disappear. Ouch! A nasty selloff is underway in the government bond market right now. The price of debt issued by countries such as the US, the UK and Germany is falling sharply, driving up the interest rates (or yield) on the debt. Investors appear to be betting that Donald Trump\u2019s economic policies will drive up inflation, should he succeed in slashing tax rates and embark on that debt-fuelled programme of rebuilding America\u2019s infrastructure. As FXTM research analyst Lukman Otunuga puts it: Pledges of massive U.S fiscal spending have heightened expectations of Trump implementing fiscal stimulus measures, including tax cuts which may bolster profit growth consequently boosting inflation. So, bond prices are a sea of electronic red ink, as investors are less keen to hold low-yielding government bonds in a world of higher inflation. Lower bond prices shows that governments must pay more to service their national debts. The UK 10-year gilt yield has jumped to 1.335%, from 1.25% last night. The US 10-year Treasury yield is up at 2.09%, from 2.06% The German 10-year bund yield has spiked to 0.29%, from 0.17% Longer-dated debt is also weakening: We should remember that bond yields have been driven down to record low levels in recent years, as central banks have hoovered them up through their quantitative easing schemes. So a return to normal levels wouldn\u2019t be a disaster. Except....a hefty bond selloff would suggest alarm in the markets, and inflict losses on those who have bought at the elevated levels recently. And that may explain why the FTSE 100 is now negative, and other European markets are lower as this morning\u2019s Trump Bump threatens to fizzle out. Investors may be taking a big risk by deciding that Donald Trump will become a new man once he crosses the seal in the Oval Office carpet. The \u2018Trump bump\u2019 has been based on a somewhat breezy assumption that the new president will successfully implement the debt-fuelled infrastructure programme that many experts support, while ignoring the chance that we actually enter an era of painful protectionism and trade wars. Duncan Weldon, head of research at Resolution Group in London, has just published a \u2018must-read\u2019 blog piece, analysing the impact of Trump. Here\u2019s a flavour: The markets seem to have decided that [aggressive deficit-financed state spending] will indeed now happen \u2014 stocks up, commodities up, bonds down. Indeed, the markets seem to have decided that President Trump will be a relatively normal President, even if candidate Trump was a deeply unusual candidate. I\u2019m not so sure. To adapt a a phrase: \u201cdemagogues can stay irrational longer than you can stay solvent\u201d. Still, as a base case a meaningful fiscal easing seems likely. Real estate developers like building stuff after all, Republicans are pretty keen on cutting taxes and this will be a lot easier to get through Congress for a Republican President. This is what incoming Republican Presidents do \u2014 they cut taxes in a meaningful way and many supposed deficit hawks useback of the napkin logic to tell themselves \u201cthese tax cuts will pay for themselves\u201d. (Actually they won\u2019t). But to simply assume that America gets higher economic demand, lower unemployment, a pick-up in inflation and a return to normal interest rates misses the big pictures, Weldon says: Implicit in that line of analysis are assumptions about the Fed\u2019s reaction functions and about productivity growth that need to be questioned. And, crucially, it misses the biggest shift that Trump\u2019s Presidency could bring about \u2014 a rejection of \u201cglobalisation\u201d/economic openness. And if productivity remains low, some economists fear that steady wage growth, solid corporate profits and moderate inflation is an \u2018impossible trinity\u2019 to achieve. There\u2019s lots more here: Hello.... the rally in European stocks is petering out. The FTSE 100 has now shed its early gains and is now down 6 points, having been up 50 points at the start. Not clear what\u2019s prompted this... Larry Summers, the former US Treasury secretary, is cautiously hopeful that the infrastructure plan proposed by Donald Trump could help the US economy. He just told Bloomberg TV that he \u201cwelcomes and applauds\u201d Trump\u2019s pledge to renew America\u2019s highways, bridges, airports schools and hospitals. It could boost job creation in the short tun, and expand the US economy\u2019s capacity for growth in the medium term, believes Summers - who has often called for more fiscal spending to fight \u2018secular stagnation\u2019. But Summers also sounds deeply concerned, saying Trump needs to propose \u201cserious and concrete plans\u201d to address America\u2019s economic concerns, and surround himself with responsible people with \u201cconsiderable experience\u201d. He says calling China a \u201ccurrency manipulator\u201d is unwise, while repealing the NAFTA trade deal would do enormous economic damage. And Summers, who served under Bill Clinton, suggets Trump cannot be as divisive in government as he was in the campaign. Unless there is a clear sense that all Americans are welcomed and part of his vision of a prosperous America, and all nations are part of his vision o f a prosperous world, I don\u2019t think he\u2019ll be successful in creating the world we all want to see, Summers concludes. Demand for gold hit a record high yesterday, which tells you a couple of things. 1) There was a massive flight to safe-haven assets as the shock election result rocked Asian and European markets. 2) People are buying gold as a hedge against inflation (the price has risen by 0.3% today). Over in America, Donald Trump is preparing to visit the White House to meet president Obama, following a night of protests against his election victory. Our main liveblog is covering all the details: Catherine Mann, the chief economist at the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, says Donald Trump needs to flesh out his economics plans, fast. Speaking on Bloomberg TV, Mann says Trump needs to set out policies to identify sources of growth in the US economy, and make sure the benefits are shared fairly between the American people. That\u2019s what got him to the White House , the fact that the gains aren\u2019t widely shared. The deputy leader of Germany\u2019s governing CDU party, Michael Fuchs, hopes that president Trump will be more responsible than nominee Trump: The copper prices has hit its highest level since July 2015, up 5% today, thanks to Trump\u2019s promise to rebuild America\u2019s infrastructure. And shares in two mining companies, Antofagasta and Vedanta, have both soared by 14% as investors anticipate a new fiscal boost next year. Ole Hansen, head of commodity strategy at Saxo Bank, says copper is the \u2018big winner\u2019 from Trump\u2019s victory (which won\u2019t be much comfort to those on the losing side). He adds: President elect Donald Trump\u2019s pledge to spend more than $500 billion on rebuilding America\u2019sroads, bridges and airports helped send construction and steel stocks sharply higher following his surprise election win. Tom Albanese, chief executive officer of Vedanta Resources, also anticipates a boost. He says (via Blooomberg): All that we see for President-elect Trump is that he will focus on building, he will focus on the infrastructure. \u201cThat is what the market is reacting to.\u201d Trump\u2019s victory is also driving up the shares of military and defence companies. BAE Systems have jumped by 6% this morning, adding to yesterday\u2019s spike following the election result. It\u2019s a sign that the City expect Trump to deliver on his promise to boost spending on the US military (which he claimed had become depleted on president Obama\u2019s watch). BAE is one of the biggest suppliers to the US department of defence, and makes armoured vehicles, ships, fighter jets and missiles. And if Trump weakens the ties between Nato members, then European countries may feel compelled to boost their own armies. Here\u2019s confirmation that inflation expectations are rising, via analyst Arne Petimezas of AFS Group: Predictions that Donald Trump\u2019s policies will drive US inflation higher are causing some dramatic moves in the financial markets today. The interest rate, or yield, on Britain\u2019s 10-year government bonds just jumped over 1.31%, up from 1.23% on Wednesday night. That\u2019s the highest level since 24th June, the aftermath of the Brexit referendum. Other European government bond yields are also rising. Investors are betting that Trump\u2019s tax cuts and debt-fuelled spending plans, if enacted, would be inflationary. So they\u2019re seeking a higher rate of return for holding government debt. The news overnight that Donald Trump doesn\u2019t want to force Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen to resign has also cheered the markets. Yellen\u2019s first term expires in 2018, but there has been speculation that she might feel pressure to step down, given the attacks from Trump during the campaign. Jim McCaughan, boss of Principal Global Investors, has told Bloomberg TV that market confidence will improve if Yellen stays, adding: If she goes, who knows, because that depends on who comes in next. China\u2019s foreign ministry spokesperson has been giving some more reaction to Trump\u2019s victory at a press conference in Beijing. Asked about Trump\u2019s vows to introduce a 45% tariff on Chinese imports, spokesperson Lu Kang noted that economic ties were blossoming with trade increasing from $2.5bn in 1970 to $560bn last year. \u201cEconomic cooperation between China and the US is what has made our bilateral relations stable and has propelled our bilateral relation forward,\u201d Lu said. \u201cI hope US is able to view our economic trade relationship in an objective and unbiased manner and work with us so that we can move forward. I believe that if the US keeps the country\u2019s interest and its people\u2019s interests in mind, they will make the right decision\u201d. Asked whether such protectionist measures would harm the US-China relationship the spokesperson said: \u201cI will not comment on speculation. As I said I believe that the US\u2019s leaders will make their decision based on the fundamental interests of their people. The Dow Jones industrial average is on track to hit a new record high, when the US stock market opens in five hours. Last night, the Dow closed near to its highest levels, and the future market is predicting a fresh spike today. The prospect of tax reforms and a government spending boost are pushing shares up, says Jeremy Cook of currency trading firm World First. He says the intial Trump slump has swiftly transformed into the Trump jump: The shortening of the timeframe between decline and rebound could be down to many things but issues around full Republican control of the Presidency and the possibility that changes in tax reform, investment and regulation will come through quicker may help. Trump has also been called \u2018an inflation time-bomb\u2019 given his pledges to increase spending so we must now look at Fed policy through a new lens. Similarly, although he was elected yesterday he does not take the reins until January 20th. Well quite: Investors are hoping that taking on the presidency might provoke a change in Donald Trump. Mike van Dulken of Accendo Markets says the market rally is based on: ...an reassessment of views about Trump and belief that a more Presidential individual is already replacing the highly divisive candidate character he merely portrayed in order to appeal to American frustration and win the populist vote. Markets are demonstrating an impressive ability to digest significant political change and move on, even quicker than we saw in the immediate aftermath of the UK\u2019s Brexit vote. Given some of Trump\u2019s conduct during the election campaign (divisive comments about Muslims, Mexicans, those awful tape-recordings about women...), a transformation by Inauguration Day would be welcome. But is it realistic? Anyone who bought European shares during Donald Trump\u2019s victory speech yesterday morning has made a decent profit. The markets have now gained 4.6% since Wednesday\u2019s opening tumble: European banks are also rallying, on speculation that the next president might unravel some of the regulations brought in since the 2008 crisis. During the campaign, Donald Trump promised to tear up Dodd-Frank -- the legislation brought in to protect consumers and prevent banks becoming too big to fail. Trump believes it is holding back the economy, and once told Fox News that: \u201cWe have to get rid of Dodd-Frank. The banks aren\u2019t loaning to people that need it. The regulators are running the banks.\u201d But it\u2019s not clear what Trump would replace Dodd-Frank with; simply ditching the law could create the conditions that caused the credit crisis in the first place. Coper-producer Antofagasta is the top riser in London, with fellow miners Glencore and Anglo American close behind. Traders are betting that Trump\u2019s programme of cutting taxes, a new debt-funded infrastructure programme, would push up inflation and raise demand for commodities. European markets are open, and shares are rising, as predictions of a Trump slump are trampled in an early wave of buying. The FTSE 100 index has jumped by 49 points, or 0.7%, to 6960 in early trading. Mining stocks and financial companies are leading the way. The French CAC, German DAX, Spanish IBEX and Italian FTSE MIB have also gained around 0.7% to 0.9%. The City analysts who predicted markets would slump if Trump pulled off a shock win have some explaining to do today. The consensus view was that Trump\u2019s sheer unpredictability, opposition to free trade, bombastic and often-shocking comments - plus the vague and uncosted nature of his proposals - would scare investors out of town. But instead, we got a knee-jerk selloff yesterday, followed very swiftly by a bounceback (which Asia just caught up with.) It\u2019s a lesson to all of us about how markets react, as Kit Juckes of Societe Generale explains: Buy the rumour, sell the news or in this case, sell the rumour and buy the news. We were all told this when we first arrived in dealing rooms and it is used to explain why academics and non-market participants are so often confused by the reaction of markets to events. I\u2019m not sure I can remember a better example of this maxim than the last week\u2019s market reaction to changing speculation about the outcome of the US Presidential election, and then to what happened. The result is plenty of egg on the face of all sorts of people. Mine included. So instead, investors quickly began reassessing the implications of a Trump presidency, and a Republican-controlled Congress. Kit says: It is widely expected that President Trump will be able to enact tax cuts, particularly for corporations, that will be positive for growth and will boost inflation. It may not be that simple for Trump to get things done -- the Tea Party wing won\u2019t like the thought of a debt-fuelled stimulus plan, for starters. Good morning from London, where bleary-eyed traders have returned to their desks. We\u2019re not expecting a repeat of the huge rally seen in Asia overnight - London had its Trump rally yesterday afternoon. But the markets are still expected to rise, as the City continues to defy expectations and take yesterday\u2019s shock election result in its stride. You might have thought that the sight of anti-Trump demonstrations at several major US cities overnight would alarm the markets. But right now, they\u2019re more interested in the next president\u2019s promise of a fiscal stimulus. Also, the graceful and mature way that Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama reacted to Trump\u2019s win has also calmed nerves -- investors like a peaceful transfer of power. A huge recovery on Asia Pacific\u2019s stock markets as the region followed the lead of the US and Europe. Plenty of commentators have doubts about whether the upbeat impact of Trump\u2019s victory can be sustained across the region but the impact is overwhelmingly positive for now. Here are the main points of the day so far: Share markets had one of their best days for years. The Nikkei rose 6.72% thanks to a weaker yen while the ASX/S&amp;P200 in Australia was up 3.34%. South Korea, Hong Kong and China all up too Europe and the US due to open up The US dollar dipped slightly from Wednesday\u2019s highs to 105.2740 Japanese yen while US bond yields spiked amid expectation of Fed rate hike in December Trump won\u2019t force Janet Yellen to quit, the WSJ reports China fixes the yuan at its lowest for six years while JP Morgan warns of possible trade shock S&amp;P affirms US AA+/A-1+ rating amid concern about Trump\u2019s \u2018inexperience\u2019 Construction commodities surge with iron ore at 30-month high and copper at 16-month high Thanks for reading \u2013 the indefatigable Graeme Wearden will take the reins from London in a moment. Oliver Holmes, our south-east Asia correspondent, has been looking at the impact of Trump\u2019s win on his business interests in the region. Oliver writes: Despite the global downturn, two companies in the Philippines and Indonesia that are linked to Trump saw their shares soar on news that he had been elected president. Shares in a Philippine firm building a 57-storey Trump Tower in Manila jumped by a massive 20%, from 1.22 to 1.47 US cents on the local stock market. The main index on the Philippine Stock Exchange fell, however, by 2.5%. In Indonesia, shares in a company controlled by Trump\u2019s local business partner, tycoon Hary Tanoesoedibjo, also surged by 23%. The Jakarta stock exchange dropped by 1.4% on Wednesday. Trump and Tanoesoedibjo plan to build a resort and a golf course in west Java, projects that many in Indonesia \u2014 the world\u2019s largest Muslim-majority nation \u2014 condemned last year when Trump called for a ban on Muslims entering the United States. A huge day for the Japanese stock market which soared 1,092.88 points to 17,344.42, a rise of 6.72%. There have been big moves in the bond markets in the past 24 hours as investors have dumped the safety of government paper in favour of equities and the dollar. Yields on US Treasury 10-year notes reversed an initial plunge to 1.716% and bolted to 2.09% overnight as the price of bonds dropped. The net rise of 21 basis points was the largest daily increase since July 2013, Reuters said. There\u2019s also an expectation that the Fed will raise rates in December, with a possible US fiscal stimulus seeing the return of inflation and more rate rises. Imre Speizer, an economist at Westpac, said: An astonishing turnaround in risk appetite pushed equities and Treasury yields higher. Markets appeared to reassess the economic outlook under Trump, towards one of higher growth and higher inflation. Futures trading suggests Europe and the US will rejoin the party when the markets open later today. Spread better IG sees the FTSE100 up 0.5% at 6940 points, while the Dax in Germany will be up 0.68% at 10,715 points. The Dow Jones on Wall Street is set to open up around 60 points. The Nikkei has gone even better than the ASX today with a rise nearly 7%, helped by a drop in the yen as the US dollar received a Trump bump as we might now have to call it. But the authorities are still worried that they might have to act to keep the yen down in future. Hiroshi Watanabe, former vice finance minister for international affairs, told Reuters that \u201cif the yen spikes by 3 yen or more, Japan should not hesitate to intervene\u201d, regardless of US concerns about such action. If Japan hesitated to intervene out of deference (to Trump), it would not be able to act for the coming four years. Japan has not intervened in currency markets since Nov. 2011. It\u2019s been a good day for investors down under \u2013 the best in fact since 2011, AAP reports. The ASX/S&amp;P200 has closed up 172.2 points, or 3.34%, at 5,328.8 points, adding $50bn to the market\u2019s value, more than making up for yesterday\u2019s losses. Mining and construction stocks led the way on hopes of a boom in the US. Surging iron ore prices also helped, soaring past the 2016 peak to $71 a tonne. Copper \u2013 a key construction material \u2013 also jumped 4% to a 16-month high, Reuters reported. There\u2019s a lot of commentary around today about Trump\u2019s trade policies and what they will mean for the global economy. We\u2019ve already heard from JP Morgan and Saul Eslake. And here\u2019s Paul Bloxham from HSBC in Australia, speaking to Australian Associated Press. For Australia, the main negative impact seems likely to be the effect that reduced global trade could have on Asian growth, given Asia\u2019s high trade reliance. Continued strengthening of Australia\u2019s economic ties to China should be a priority as it would help support local growth even in the face of rising global trade protectionism. But Standard Life, in a research note quoted by AAP, saw the possibility that Trump could moderate his campaign promises, which included putting tariffs of 45% on Chinese goods and 35% on Mexican goods, in order to avoid disruption. It is plausible that the new administration will not ramp up tariffs on Mexican and Chinese imports, content instead to bury the prospect of new trade agreements and make more use of enforcement clauses in existing agreements. Trump won\u2019t force Janet Yellen to resign as chair of the Federal Reserve, according to an adviser, despite speculation that he might try to end her term prematurely. Judy Shelton, an economist and senior fellow at the Atlas Network and adviser to Trump on monetary policy, told the Wall Street Journal that \u201che\u2019s not urging her to resign at all\u201d. However, the Journal reports that Shelton did concede that Trump was minded to replace Yellen when she completes her first term in 2018. He\u2019s saying he\u2019d want someone whose thinking is more in keeping with his own. Trump was openly critical of Yellen in one of the presidential debates in September, saying that interest rates had been kept too low and that asset bubbles created by loose monetary settings would eventually burst. JP Morgan\u2019s team in Australia have been looking at what Trump\u2019s win could mean for the global economy \u2013 and Australia\u2019s. They say that a US fiscal stimulus would have limited benefits for the rest of the world while trade barriers could mean trouble for trading partners. A US policy-induced trade shock will be negative for global growth. This leaves risks to global growth more asymmetric than was previously the case. Second, the distribution of risks to Chinese growth have shifted to the downside, given the increased probability of rising tensions in US-China trade relations and weaker Chinese export growth. A trade shock could in turn damage the US. A marked slowing in US growth might not be an issue, except that growth in the rest of the global economy doesn\u2019t look robust enough \u2013 particularly given limited scope for additional policy support \u2013 to provide much of a buffer. And even in the event that US growth slows on a trade shock, this will likely be more inflationary (via higher import prices) than would have otherwise been the case, meaning that the growth and inflation trade-off in the US becomes less favourable. And that means that interest rate cuts are back on the horizon in Australia. For the RBA, we think this underscores the risk that rates are likely to go lower in Australia. All else equal, domestic growth needs to be stronger to provide an offset to external shocks, should they occur. US billionaire Carl Icahn apparently cashed in on the stock market panic over Trump\u2019s election victory. The longtime Trump supporter told CNN Money that he left the Republican\u2019s victory party in Manhattan in the early hours of Wednesday to go home and buy \u201ca lot of stock\u201d in the plunging overnight market. I\u2019m glad I did that. I guess that\u2019s what makes me happy today too ... I personally don\u2019t believe that Trump is bad for the market necessarily. OK, the stock markets have proceeded magisterially today despite a background of major tectonic shifts in the financial landscape. Here are the main points: Asia Pacfic shares have bounced back up strongly and recovered Wednesday\u2019s losses. Japan\u2019s Nikkei is up 5.71% at 17,178.87 ASX/S&amp;P200 up 2.74% at 5,297.70, Kospi is at 1,995.75 (1.91%) Hong Kong is up 2% at 22,863.10. The US dollar has dipped against the yen at 105.3270 but still up strongly overnight. Aussie dollar is up at US76.61c S&amp;P has maintained the US on AA+ investment grade rating, warning that Trump\u2019s inexperience creates uncertainty about policy settings Yuan fix at the lowest point since 2010 Reserve Bank of New Zealand has cut rates to 1.75%, a new record low Brent crude is down 7% amid warnings about global trade More on the implications for Asia\u2019s big emerging economies \u2013 and Australia. Saul Eslake, the independent economist, has warned about the implications for Asutralia if Trump were to start a trade war with China and undermine the Fed, pushing the US dollar down. [This would create] a great deal of uncertainty in our part of the world, about the geopolitical environment by making a less wholesome commitment to longstanding US alliances with countries like South Korea and Japan ... Those things, particulary a trade war with China, would be highly negative for Australia. Like every measure in the last 24 hours, the US dollar has been topsy-turvy. The chance of a Fed rate cut dropped to 30% on Wednesday but is now more than 80%, according to IG. The dollar index against major currencies recovered from 95.885 on Wednesday to around 98.448 on Thursday. But the longer-term outlook is uncertain as Trump pushes his protectionist agenda (see below). Tim Condon, an Singapore-based economist at ING, told Reuters: We expect a Trump Treasury to elevate the importance of the bilateral trade surplus with the US in identifying currency manipulators and intensify pressure on trade partners to allow currencies to appreciate. The yuan has been fixed today at 6.7885 \u2013 its lowest point since September 2010. Bearing in mind that Trump labelled China a \u201ccurrency manipulator\u201d on his way to winning the presidency, the issue could prove to be a flashpoint between the two countries. China has pushed the value of its currency steadily downwards in the past year \u2013 very clumsily to begin with, sparking last year\u2019s mini-stock market crash \u2013 as it tries to export its way out of slowing economic growth. But everyone else has got the same idea (including Abe of course). The US dollar is holding its gains on Thursday and was sitting at 105.32 yen, up from below 102 on Wednesday. But for Trump\u2019s manufacturing recovery to work you expect that he will want it come down. The Japanese prime minister Shinzo Abe is planning to meet the US president-elect in New York on 17 November, a Japanese government official has said. Reuters reports that the pair had \u201ctalked by telephone and confirmed close cooperation between their two nations\u201d. It might be interesting to hear what they have to say to each other about trade and the economy. Like China, Japan has a lot to be worried about. Trump is an avowed opponent of the Trans Pacific Partnership trade deal which would be a huge blow for Abe\u2019s plans to boost his country\u2019s huge manufacturing sector. The commodities market is looking slightly different to stocks today. While equities are surging ahead, the price of oil has dropped amid concerns about the impact of Trump on global trade. US West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures were down 20c at $45.07 a barrel at 0131 GMT on Thursday. The more widely traded Brent was at $46.29 per barrel, down 7% from the last close. Daniel Yergin, vice-chairman of the IHS Markit think tank, told Reuters: The outcome of the U.S. election adds to the challenges for the oil exporters because it will likely lead to weaker economic growth in an already fragile global economy. And that means additional pressure on oil demand. Gold meanwhile dipped overnight $1,278.25 an ounce as risk receded in the markets. It rose nearly 5% to $1,337.40 on Wednesday before tumbling back down as US markets reacted positively to the Trump win. Reuters reports that S&amp;P, the ratings agency, has affirmed the country\u2019s investment-grade AA+/A-1+ sovereign rating on Wednesday while maintaining its stable outlook. It welcomed calls for unity from all sides of US politics in the wake of Trump\u2019s win but \u201chigh general government debt and increased uncertainty\u201d meant there it could not restore the coveted AAA rating it removed in 2011. Its analysis feels like a good summary of market sentiment: Given Mr Trump\u2019s lack of experience in public office, and his win as a political outsider without an established policy track record, there is a degree of uncertainty over policy formulation and execution. However, there is a difference between campaign rhetoric and concrete policy proposals and execution once in office. We await further information on the formation of a cabinet and policy proposals, particularly once the president-elect assumes office. Alongside Mr. Trump\u2019s victory, the Senate remains in Republican hands, as does the House of Representatives. Hence, the president-elect and the Republicans have a mandate for and ability to effect policy change more easily than with a more divided government in recent years. Trading has been underway for an hour now in Japan and Korea. Here\u2019s where the main indexes stand: Nikkei up 5.7% to 17,180 points Kospi in South Korea up 1.7% to 1,991 ASX/S&amp;P 200 in Australia up 2.88% to 5,305 points The yen, which gained so much during yesterday\u2019s turmoil, fell sharply overnight as the US dollar recovered. It\u2019s now at 105.6740, close to a four-month high. The pound and the euro are both down slightly against the greenback however, as the pattern from yesterday is reversed. Imre Speizer, an economist at Westpac in Australia, said: An astonishing turnaround in risk appetite pushed equities and Treasury yields higher. Markets appeared to reassess the economic outlook under Trump, towards one of higher growth and higher inflation. The Reserve Bank of New Zealand hasn\u2019t waited around to see what a Trump presidency might mean for US monetary policy \u2013 it cut its base rate 25 basis points to a record low of 1.75% this morning. The move was expected and is the third cut this year. It\u2019s driven partly by a need to get the NZ dollar down to help the country\u2019s huge dairy industry. Governor Graeme Wheeler said the rate-setters had met on Thursday to discuss whether the cut was still needed in the wake of Trump\u2019s win. They decided it was but pushed back on expectations of yet another reduction soon. He said: We think at this stage that we won\u2019t need another cut. The economy is doing well and you certainly wouldn\u2019t want to create excessive volatility in respect of interest rates and output in the exchange rate by surprising the market with interest rate adjustments. This is an interesting chart. Wednesday saw one of the biggest drops in volatility ever recorded as the markets quickly put their concerns behind them and went into risk-on mode. But as with Australia, it\u2019s not clear where this is going. A Trump presidency promises a more aggressive US trading position which the markets have implicitly welcomed. But not everyone can be winners here, can they? China is the obvious loser in Asia if, let\u2019s say, Trump tries to force Apple to make its iPhones in the US instead of Shenzhen and Shangahi. Here\u2019s a snippet from Larry Elliott\u2019s piece: Beijing would have two choices. It might take an emollient line, promising to increase direct investment into the US as a way of supporting Trump\u2019s attempt to rebuild the American economy. More likely, though, China would adopt an aggressive, nationalistic stance. Beijing is not without economic weapons, since it has amassed a vast stock of US Treasury bonds in recent years, the proceeds of its trade surplus with America. Beijing could meet Trump\u2019s threat with one of its own: to dump US assets. A tit-for-tat trade war, in which China puts tariffs on US exports, could not be ruled out either. But as Chris Weston from IG says in his morning note, these concerns appear for another day as markets focus on the upside: Like many I had been concerned market participants would be worried about Trump\u2019s relationship with the Federal Reserve and a number of their key trade partners (such as China and Japan), but again this concern is for another time it seems. The market in Japan has opened very strongly with the Nikkei rising more than 6%, reversing the huge losses of Wednesday. The Kospi in Seoul is also up. The Aussie dollar has risen this morning from overnight lows of below US76c as the markets yo-yoed around during US election night. The Aussie is trading at US76.50c this morning. But experts say it\u2019s hard to say where it will go from here given the mixed bag of signals out of a Trump win. Here\u2019s Greg McKenna writing at axitrader.com: I think if Trump delivers on his campaign promises then we face a more volatile global economic and geopolitical environment in the years ahead ... For the Aussie that means it benefits from the reflationary aspects of Trumponomics, but could suffer from the rise in US bonds, and likely Fed hike in December if Australian interest rate markets don\u2019t go with those moves higher. Huge lead from Australia this morning. The ASX/S&amp;P200 is up nearly 3% and resource and financial stocks have led the way. The iron ore producer Fortescue is the top riser at well over 10.6% but Macquarie and BHP have also shown big gains. My colleague Melissa Davey has just filed this report on the morning\u2019s surge. Meanwhile, Chris Weston at IG in Melbourne has this: The combination of huge gains in materials, fiscals and energy should push the ASX 200 3.4%, which if it closes at that level would be the strongest gain since 6 October 2011 Hello and welcome to the markets live blog from Sydney. Well, that didn\u2019t turn out quite how it was expected to \u2013 on a number of levels. The surprise of Trump\u2019s win looked like leading to market meltdown across the world. But it didn\u2019t, thanks in part it seems to Trump\u2019s conciliatory speech, proving that investors hate uncertainty more than anything. The promise of a smooth handover of power, a united Congress, tax cuts and a huge infrastructure spending boost was enough to turn red screens green. Here\u2019s how they finished in the US and Europe The Dow Jones up 1.4% to 18,590 points. The S&amp;P 500 up 1.1% to 21,163. The Nasdaq up 1.1% to 5,251. FTSE100 up 1% to 6,911.84 Dax up 1.56% to 10,646 In Australia the market has already taken that lead and opened up by nearly 3%. Can it be sustained? Here\u2019s one informed verdict. Michael McCarthy at CMC Markets in Sydney, said: The stunning turn in sentiment suggests there is now a consensus building that much of the policy announced during the campaign was a sales pitch rather than a commitment to act. Investors ignored the potential for damage to international trade and growth prospects and focussed on Republican control of both houses of Congress as well as the White House. This offers the prospect of reform that could stimulate the US economy. However, last night\u2019s action may be as good as it gets for markets for some time. Policy uncertainty and populist agendas rarely lead to sustainable economic growth. There\u2019s much to look at and talk about. But in the meantime start with our economics editor Larry Elliott\u2019s examination of what a Trump win might mean for the global economy.",

They say the law bans \u201cmulti packs (bulk packs), loyalty/reward card schemes, free formula, price reductions, discounts or mark downs and buy one get one free\u201d offers. A spokesperson for Tesco said: \u201cWe always strive to provide the best possible service for our customers and we understand Ms Leeks\u2019 request. However, due to UK law we cannot promote baby formula in any way, including the offering of a parking voucher.\u201d",

But we still don\u2019t expect that they will rise as fast as in the US.</p> <p>Treasury yields have risen sharply in the US since the election there on 8th November. This reflects investors\u2019 expectations of a major fiscal stimulus under President Trump, which would both increase the supply of bonds and mainly boost inflation at this stage of the US business cycle. (See our Global Markets Update, \u201cNew \u2013 even more bearish \u2013 forecasts for Treasuries\u201d, published on Friday.) Although government bond yields have also risen in Europe, the increases have been significantly smaller than in the US and we expect European government bonds to continue doing better than Treasuries in the months ahead.</p> <p>For a start, there is a far lower chance of a major fiscal loosening in Europe. Granted, we expect UK Chancellor Phillip Hammond to scale back the pace of fiscal tightening over the coming years in his Autumn Statement later this month. But this is likely to fall short of an outright fiscal stimulus. And there is even less scope for a fiscal expansion in the euro-zone.</p> <p>Second, a given amount of fiscal loosening would generate less inflationary pressure in Europe compared to the US. This is because there is a greater degree of spare capacity in the economies of Europe, particularly in the euro-zone.</p> <p>Third, following the UK\u2019s Brexit vote, Trump\u2019s victory has stoked fears of more populist revolts occurring down the line in parts of Europe, including in France, in spring\u2019s presidential election. While Bunds have arguably already benefited to some degree from the uncertainty, any increase in perceived political risk should further boost safe-haven demand, thereby helping to contain yields there. </p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5829eeece4b0eb4ebf273f88\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-11-14T17:21:36.966Z\">5.21pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">European markets edge higher</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Despite Wall Street coming off its best levels after earlier hitting a new peak, European markets have managed to end the day in positive territory. With bond markets under pressure on the basis that Donald Trump\u2019s presidency could see increased spending and a rise in inflation, equities have been a partial beneficiary. </p> <p>In the bond market, Italian 10 year yield rose 18 basis points at one time to their highest since September 2015, German 30 year yields were at their highest for six months while US 10 yields were at their highest since December. However bond prices have since regained some ground, meaning yields are off their highest levels. Joshua Mahony, market analyst at IG, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The recent resurgence of inflation expectations, coupled with a remarkably buoyant stock market, point towards a likely rate hike in December, and this has helped fuel the drive towards the dollar and away from US treasuries. </p> </blockquote> <p>In equities, the final scores in Europe showed:</p> <ul> <li><strong>The FTSE 100 finished 22.75 points or 0.34% higher at 6753.18</strong></li> <li><strong>Germany\u2019s Dax rose 0.24% to 10,693.69</strong></li> <li><strong>France\u2019s Cac closed up 0.43% at 4508.55</strong></li> <li><strong>Spain\u2019s Ibex ended up 0.22% at 8658.2</strong></li> <li><strong>But Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB fell 0.75% to 16,686.33 amid nervousness ahead of the country\u2019s forthcoming referendum</strong></li> <li><strong>In Greece, the Athens market slipped 0.47% to 579.88</strong></li> </ul> <p>On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 22 points at 18824, having earlier hit an intra-day record of 18934. </p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5829e583e4b05c05c52f4e7c\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-11-14T16:30:23.005Z\">4.30pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>US technology stocks are missing out on the market\u2019s current rally, on fears that some of Donald Trump\u2019s policies will prove unfavourable.</p> <p>Talk of the president-elect slapping tariffs on Chinese goods raised fears of retaliation which could hit the likes of Apple\u2019s expansion plans.

Next year\u2019s budget will also be discussed.

The trip, which will see the US president flying straight to Berlin after Athens, is expected to be heavy on symbolism as Obama\u2019s last state visit abroad. </p> <p>To date only the IMF has highlighted the problem of a debt load it has long called \u201cunmanageable.\u201d Greek officials now hope the US leader will bring pressure to bear on the German chancellor when he, too, highlights the issue in talks between the two on Wednesday. </p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-11-14T15:30:08.027Z\">at 3.30pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5829d6f6e4b0364c91946943\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-11-14T15:25:34.780Z\">3.25pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>The pound continues to weaken against the dollar as the US currency benefits from talk of an interest rate rise in December after all, despite the shock US election result.</strong></p> <p>Sterling has extended its falls and is now down 1.17% at $1.2450.

He has threatened China with heavy tariffs as a punitive measure for the now redundant charge of manipulating its currency, and opposes the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) trade agreement that was central to President Obama\u2019s pivot to Asia. Even now, China is busy trying to get Asia-Pacific countries to sign up to the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership, its own version of America\u2019s TPP.</p> <p>If Trump proved to be a real isolationist and walked away from open trading agreements, and imposed trade barriers, he might imagine this that would protect American workers and bring jobs home. But empirically we know this just tends to lead to retailation, higher inflation and costs, and job losses. We do have cause to worry that without America to defend and promote a liberal global trade and investment regime, economic damage and impoverishment would spread through the global economy.</p> </blockquote> <p>Magnus does believe that America would benefit from targeted infrastructure spending plan, but he\u2019s less impressed by Trump\u2019s tax cuts, as they\u2019ll mainly benefit the better off.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/SteveRattner/status/798158448072527873\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">The irony of Trump&#39;s populism: 51% of his tax cuts go to the top 1%; only 0.8% to bottom 20%.

The bipartisan and independent Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget has calculated that what little we know of Trump\u2019s programmes, including repeal of Obamacare, could put about $3-4 trillion on to the outstanding level of public debt, now standing at $14 trilion. By 2026, Federal debt would rise from 80 to over 105 per cent of GDP. increasing the US ratio of debt to GDP from about 77 per cent to at least 105 per cent. Once debt levels exceed 90-100 per cent of GDP, economic growth becomes seriously impaired.</p> <p>The major risk then is that after an initial economic boost, the US becomes mired again in rising public deficits \u2013 remember debt will be rising anyway in the 2020\u2019s because of medicare and social security spending. Since the external deficit would probably deteriorate as well, the likelihood is that economic instability, higher inflation and interest rates, a falling currency, and then an economic downturn might ensue. And if Trump is keen to push for de-regulation, including of banking and finance, that instability might be accentuated.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/georgemagnus1/status/798141658512654336\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">My take on Trump&#39;s economics.

Second, the economy is already at full employment so that stimulus applied now is more likely to stoke higher inflation and interest rates than greater real GDP growth.</p> <p>The federal deficit is already rising, growing from 2.5% of GDP in fiscal 2015 to 3.2% of GDP in fiscal 2016. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that, under current law, the national debt will grow from 77% of GDP in fiscal 2016 to 86% in fiscal 2026. </p> <p>However, in a September analysis of President-elect Trump\u2019s fiscal plans, the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget estimated that they would push the debt to 105% of GDP by 2026 if fully implemented. Most of the cost of these plans comes from large proposed tax cuts for both corporations and individuals, although increased defense spending also has a sizable impact.</p> </blockquote> <p>Kelly also points out that the recent surge in government bond yields shows that the plan would be pricy:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It does not take a brilliant mathematician to see that if long-term Treasury rates return to more normal levels, financing this debt will absorb a much greater share of federal revenues over time. In the 50 years before the financial crisis, the average interest rate paid on federal debt was 5.6% but the average debt-to-GDP ratio was just 37%. A 5.6% average interest rate on a debt equal to 105% of GDP would be ruinous. </p> <p>The truth is boosting the federal debt to these levels is fiscally reckless.</p> </blockquote> <p>And if that wasn\u2019t enough, Kelly arguses that the wider US economy doesn\u2019t need a stimulus boost right now:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The U.S. economy is, for all intents and purposes, at full employment. The overall unemployment rate is 4.9% - lower than it has been 77% of the time over the past 50 years while the short-term unemployment rate is lower than it has been 98% of the time over the past 50 years.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Trump supporters might question this rosy view of the US economy -- especially in the Rust Belt where manufacturing jobs have been lost and wage growth pegged down. </strong></p> <p>But... if Kelly\u2019s right, the fiscal stimulus might not actually regenerate America\u2019s economy at all (creating short-term construction work, but not sparking a manufacturing revival).</p> <p>He concludes:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>In this economy, a shock boost to aggregate demand through tax cuts would likely boost inflation and imports more than domestic production, since the U.S. economy is supply-side constrained. Higher inflation and bigger deficits should lead to higher interest rates \u2013 particularly if the Federal Reserve perceives inflation risks as having risen and so raises short-term interest rates.</p> <p>The American economy is more like a healthy tortoise than a sickly hare. Immigration reform designed to <em>increase</em> skilled immigrants or policies that boosted productivity growth might give the economy the ability to run faster. However, in the absence of this kind of supply-side effort, boosting aggregate demand to make the tortoise run faster would mainly result in over-heating.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b8f015883600ba84c348975d553a6ae3a2b364c0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b8f015883600ba84c348975d553a6ae3a2b364c0/0_236_4809_2886/1000.jpg\" alt=\"On your marks!\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Hare-raising fiscal outlook means Trump should perhaps resist shelling out on new highways.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Gk Hart/vikki Hart/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-11-14T13:20:51.341Z\">at 1.20pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-58299cf6e4b0364c919467eb\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-11-14T11:33:47.991Z\">11.33am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Italian bonds are also weakening today, with long-term yields hitting their highest in 16 months.</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/DeItaOne/status/798122001307209728\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">ITALIAN 30-YEAR BOND YIELDS HIT HIGHEST SINCE JULY 2015, UP AROUND 20 BASIS POINTS ON DAY AT 3.34 PERCENT</p>&mdash; *Walter Bloomberg (@DeItaOne) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DeItaOne/status/798122001307209728\">November 14, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>Italy could be the next country to suffer a political earthquake, if prime minister Matteo Renzi loses his constitutional reforms referendum next month.</p> <p>Renzi hinted this morning that he might <strong>quit</strong> if the public reject <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/06/could-italys-renzi-be-next-victim-of-an-unwanted-referendum\">the proposal to reform the Senate</a>.</p> <p>Speaking on a radio interview, Renzi declared:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>If I have to stay on in parliament and do what everyone else has done before me, that is, to scrape by and just float there, that does not suit me.\u201d</p> </blockquote> <p>Opinion polls suggest the referendum is close.</p> <p>The reforms are opposed by the right-wing ant-immigrant Northern League, and the radical eurosceptic Movement Five Star -- who both relish the prospect of inflicting defeat on Renzi (once seen as the man to lead Italy out of years of stagnation and political quicksand).</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/andreavogt/status/798092480231129088\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Can <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Renzi?src=hash\">#Renzi</a> survive amidst the right &amp;  left&#39;s referendum pincer movement? 6 mos ago u didn&#39;t see graffitti like this in <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Bologna?src=hash\">#Bologna</a>. <a href=\"https://t.co/blpOYOAHdZ\">pic.twitter.com/blpOYOAHdZ</a></p>&mdash; Andrea Vogt (@andreavogt) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/andreavogt/status/798092480231129088\">November 14, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-58299955e4b0eb4ebf273d99\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-11-14T11:13:30.804Z\">11.13am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Just in!

                "bodyText":"The prospect of increased US spending and rising interest rates has pushed the dollar index above 100 for the first time since December. Fawad Razaqzada, market analyst at Forex.com, said: The dollar index does appear to be a little bit overbought around these levels, though technically the trend looks strong as it resides inside a bullish channel and above the main moving averages. So, a short-term pullback would not come as a surprise to me, before we potentially see higher levels. That being said, the 100 level has now been tested several times since March 2015. The more a level is tested, the more likely it will break in the direction of the test...It should be noted that if the dollar were to rise further then this will be bad news for US stock. Up until now, they have been rising and falling in unison. This relationship cannot continue indefinitely as the appreciating dollar is supposed to weigh on company earnings. On that note, it\u2019s time to close for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. European bond yields are unlikely to rise as fast as those in the US following Donald Trump\u2019s shock presidential election victory, says Capital Economics Simon MacAdam: In the wake of Donald Trump\u2019s victory in the US presidential election, we are nudging up our forecasts for government bond yields in Europe. But we still don\u2019t expect that they will rise as fast as in the US. Treasury yields have risen sharply in the US since the election there on 8th November. This reflects investors\u2019 expectations of a major fiscal stimulus under President Trump, which would both increase the supply of bonds and mainly boost inflation at this stage of the US business cycle. (See our Global Markets Update, \u201cNew \u2013 even more bearish \u2013 forecasts for Treasuries\u201d, published on Friday.) Although government bond yields have also risen in Europe, the increases have been significantly smaller than in the US and we expect European government bonds to continue doing better than Treasuries in the months ahead. For a start, there is a far lower chance of a major fiscal loosening in Europe. Granted, we expect UK Chancellor Phillip Hammond to scale back the pace of fiscal tightening over the coming years in his Autumn Statement later this month. But this is likely to fall short of an outright fiscal stimulus. And there is even less scope for a fiscal expansion in the euro-zone. Second, a given amount of fiscal loosening would generate less inflationary pressure in Europe compared to the US. This is because there is a greater degree of spare capacity in the economies of Europe, particularly in the euro-zone. Third, following the UK\u2019s Brexit vote, Trump\u2019s victory has stoked fears of more populist revolts occurring down the line in parts of Europe, including in France, in spring\u2019s presidential election. While Bunds have arguably already benefited to some degree from the uncertainty, any increase in perceived political risk should further boost safe-haven demand, thereby helping to contain yields there. Despite Wall Street coming off its best levels after earlier hitting a new peak, European markets have managed to end the day in positive territory. With bond markets under pressure on the basis that Donald Trump\u2019s presidency could see increased spending and a rise in inflation, equities have been a partial beneficiary. In the bond market, Italian 10 year yield rose 18 basis points at one time to their highest since September 2015, German 30 year yields were at their highest for six months while US 10 yields were at their highest since December. However bond prices have since regained some ground, meaning yields are off their highest levels. Joshua Mahony, market analyst at IG, said: The recent resurgence of inflation expectations, coupled with a remarkably buoyant stock market, point towards a likely rate hike in December, and this has helped fuel the drive towards the dollar and away from US treasuries. In equities, the final scores in Europe showed: The FTSE 100 finished 22.75 points or 0.34% higher at 6753.18 Germany\u2019s Dax rose 0.24% to 10,693.69 France\u2019s Cac closed up 0.43% at 4508.55 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended up 0.22% at 8658.2 But Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB fell 0.75% to 16,686.33 amid nervousness ahead of the country\u2019s forthcoming referendum In Greece, the Athens market slipped 0.47% to 579.88 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 22 points at 18824, having earlier hit an intra-day record of 18934. US technology stocks are missing out on the market\u2019s current rally, on fears that some of Donald Trump\u2019s policies will prove unfavourable. Talk of the president-elect slapping tariffs on Chinese goods raised fears of retaliation which could hit the likes of Apple\u2019s expansion plans. Even the prospect of tax breaks allowing such companies to repatriate some of their cash piles has not proved to be much support for the shares. Nor are the major tech companies likely to benefit from Trump\u2019s proposed programme of infrastructure spending, said Jasper Lawler, market analyst at CMC Markets: Tech stocks like Facebook and Netflix won\u2019t get any government contracts in a rise in infrastructure spending but Chinese expansion plans are at risk by possible trade tariffs. So Apple is currently down 3.2% while Facebook has fallen 3.7%. More fallout from the strong dollar: oil prices are heading lower again. It is not just the dollar hitting crude, however. Investors had been hoping that a key Opec meeting at the end of this month would agree measures to curb output and thus support prices. But the closer the meeting gets, the more the doubts grow and put pressure on the crude price. So Brent is currently down 1.59% at $44.04 a barrel while West Texax Intermediate has slipped 1.68% to \u00a342.68. Over in Greece, government officials are preparing for a new round of talks with inspectors representing the country\u2019s foreign lenders following Barack Obama\u2019s extraordinary call for Athens to be granted \u201cmeaningful debt relief.\u201d Our correspondent Helena Smith reports: Rarely has there been such desire from a sitting government in Athens to conclude a review with auditors representing the bodies that have thrice bailed out Greece since 2010. Highlighting that sentiment, the new government spokesman Dimitris Tzanakopoulos told reporters earlier that differences between the two are \u201cvery small.\u201d The talks, which begin in earnest tomorrow, will focus on an overhaul of labour laws including annulment of collective work agreements and mass firings (a red line many in the ruling left wing Syriza party), privatisations and primary surplus targets for 2019. Next year\u2019s budget will also be discussed. The goal \u2013 one dismissed as untenable by most \u2013 is for the inspection tour to be wrapped up in a matter of days in the hope that debt relief talks can begin when euro zone finance ministers hold their last meeting of the year on December 5. If debt-serving costs are brought down, it will reduce the need for the country to achieve a 3.5% primary surplus by 2018 \u2013 a target set by lenders but almost unequivocally derided as impossible to meet. Ahead of president Barack Obama\u2019s arrival in the Greek capital on Tuesday the government has gone out of its way to play up the two-day visit with Tzanakopoulos saying today that it had not only been heartened by his intervention on the matter of Greek debt but calling the tour one of great significance. The trip, which will see the US president flying straight to Berlin after Athens, is expected to be heavy on symbolism as Obama\u2019s last state visit abroad. To date only the IMF has highlighted the problem of a debt load it has long called \u201cunmanageable.\u201d Greek officials now hope the US leader will bring pressure to bear on the German chancellor when he, too, highlights the issue in talks between the two on Wednesday. The pound continues to weaken against the dollar as the US currency benefits from talk of an interest rate rise in December after all, despite the shock US election result. Sterling has extended its falls and is now down 1.17% at $1.2450. But against the euro, the pound is holding steady, up 0.09% at \u20ac1.1622. US markets are on the rise at the open, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average reaching a new record high - just two trading days after the previous peak. The Dow is currently up around 45 points or o.24% at 18893, having reached 18,918, ahead of the previous record of 18,873 hit last Thursday, as equities continued to welcome Donald Trump\u2019s election victory, even if bond markets do not. The S&amp;P 500 opened up 0.21% while the Nasdaq composite added 0.15% initially. Time for a quick catch up. The bond market has suffered fresh losses today as investors rapidly adjust to the prospect of Donald Trump taking control of the world\u2019s largest economy. Debt prices have fallen sharply again, adding to last week\u2019s $1trn bloodbath, on the prospect that we\u2019re entering a world of higher inflation, interest rate hikes, political uncertainty and possibly trade disputes too. The selloff has hit US bond prices. The yield on 10-year Treasury bills has hit its highest level since January, rising to 2.23% from 2.1% last week. Shorter-dated two-year debt, and long-dated 30-year bonds, also hit their weakest points since the start of the year. Investors are betting that Trump\u2019s infrastructure programme, and his plan to cut taxes, will reflate the US economy. Paul Sirani, chief market analyst at Xtrade, believes the bond market selloff could intensify: \u201cThe sentiment surrounding a rate hike has been flip-flopping and that only makes bond buying, especially at around the 1% mark for two-year bills, a more appealing proposition. \u201cPresident Trump\u2019s pledge to pile resources into infrastructure to \u2018Make America Great Again\u2019 has arguably upped the risk of investing in Treasury yields. The 11-month high of 1% might not be the high water mark for 2016 as Trump\u2019s economic policy is put into action.\u201d [remember: bond yield rise when price fall] UK borrowing costs are also being driven up. The 10-year gilt yield has hit its highest level since May, at 1.45%. The dollar is strengthening, hitting an 11-month high against the euro, and against a broad basket of currencies. It\u2019s also gained one cent against the UK pound, at around $1.25. And the markets reckon that the Federal Reserve is nailed on to raise US interest rates in December: But....a string of experts are voicing concern about Trumponomics: JP Morgan\u2019s David Kelly thinks slashing taxes and driving up borrowing risks pushing the US deficit into dangerous heights, and simply isn\u2019t necessary right now. Former Treasury secretary Larry Summers thinks the infrastructure plan appears to be badly designed And George Magnus, UBS\u2019s well-respected former chief economist, fears that Trump could trigger pain through the global economy if he takes a protectionist approach. Over the weekend, Trump started to step back from some of his more extreme positions. That wall between America and Mexico might be downgraded to a mere fence, in places, for example. And investors find that sort of u-turn encouraging, says Naeem Aslam of Think Markets: Markets are showing that investors continue to believe the fiscal policy plans by Mr Trump and they want to pile their bets in equities. A risk on trade has become the famous trade amid traders and hence for the past week, since Trump\u2019s victory, we are seeing the precious metal along with other safe haven like the Japanese yen selling off sharply. Mr Trump has delivered many watered down versions of his controversial views over the weekend. This has restored further confidence that the person in charge of the biggest economy of the world, has started to think more logically. It is this certainty which investors are applauding. However... appointing the head of far-right website Breitbart as \u201cchief strategist and senior counselor\u201d doesn\u2019t suggest Trump is backing away from the view that appalled liberal critics. Donald Trump\u2019s shock win is an alarm call to moderate politicians to improve workers\u2019 conditions, argues the head of the International Labour Organisation. Guy Ryder believes that the US election result, and the Brexit vote, show that many workers feel sidelined and \u2018dispossessed\u2019 in today\u2019s economy: He tells us: \u201cThe societies we all live in are distributing the benefits of globalisation and economic processes extraordinarily unfairly and people think they are getting a raw deal. \u201cIt is the people who feel they haven\u2019t benefited from globalisation and from the EU, from the way things are organised. This is the revolt of the dispossessed in that regard.\u201d Ryder was speaking as the ILO launches a new report, showing that temporary work, agency work, precarious self-employment and other non-standard forms of employment have all spread. We now have a hat-trick of warnings about Donald Trump\u2019s economic plans. George Magnus, the former chief economist of UBS, is very concerned that the next president could kick off a trade war that harms America\u2019s economy, and the rest of the world too. In a new blogpost, Magnus writes: Trump\u2019s vehemently anti-free trade rhetoric has included the threat to rip up or change NAFTA, the North American Free Trade Association agreement, including the possibility of levying tariffs on Mexico, and this, on top of erecting the wall, or otherwise restricting immigration. He has threatened China with heavy tariffs as a punitive measure for the now redundant charge of manipulating its currency, and opposes the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) trade agreement that was central to President Obama\u2019s pivot to Asia. Even now, China is busy trying to get Asia-Pacific countries to sign up to the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership, its own version of America\u2019s TPP. If Trump proved to be a real isolationist and walked away from open trading agreements, and imposed trade barriers, he might imagine this that would protect American workers and bring jobs home. But empirically we know this just tends to lead to retailation, higher inflation and costs, and job losses. We do have cause to worry that without America to defend and promote a liberal global trade and investment regime, economic damage and impoverishment would spread through the global economy. Magnus does believe that America would benefit from targeted infrastructure spending plan, but he\u2019s less impressed by Trump\u2019s tax cuts, as they\u2019ll mainly benefit the better off. And the other BIG worry is that Trump could drives up the US national debt to alarming levels. Magnus says: The other major concern about Trumponomics is about a mishandled fiscal expansion and unfunded tax cuts that would entail a substantially wider fiscal deficit and more rapid expansion of public debt. The bipartisan and independent Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget has calculated that what little we know of Trump\u2019s programmes, including repeal of Obamacare, could put about $3-4 trillion on to the outstanding level of public debt, now standing at $14 trilion. By 2026, Federal debt would rise from 80 to over 105 per cent of GDP. increasing the US ratio of debt to GDP from about 77 per cent to at least 105 per cent. Once debt levels exceed 90-100 per cent of GDP, economic growth becomes seriously impaired. The major risk then is that after an initial economic boost, the US becomes mired again in rising public deficits \u2013 remember debt will be rising anyway in the 2020\u2019s because of medicare and social security spending. Since the external deficit would probably deteriorate as well, the likelihood is that economic instability, higher inflation and interest rates, a falling currency, and then an economic downturn might ensue. And if Trump is keen to push for de-regulation, including of banking and finance, that instability might be accentuated. The early rally in European stock markets is fading, as City traders look nervously over to America. The main indices have dipped, having jumped 1% early this morning. Bloomberg\u2019s healthcheck on the global financial markets is a pounding mass of red right now: Each column shows how an asset class has performed. So from left to right, you can see that Most emerging economy\u2019s equity markets have fallen today as investors dump shares. Most currencies have fallen against the US dollar today, including the yen, euro and Turkish lira There have been heavy losses across the government bond markets today, both in developed and emerging economies The cost of insuring those bonds against default, using a credit default swap, has risen (showing that investors see government debt as riskier) But the prices of iron ore, zinc and lead have risen Former US Treasury secretary Larry Summers shares JP Morgan\u2019s concerns about Trump\u2019s infrastructure investment plan. Writing in the Financial Times, Summers argues that the scheme won\u2019t address the parts of America that most need improving, won\u2019t get key private sector investors involved, and risks pushing borrowing to dangerous levels: Summers argues: Unfortunately, the plan presented by his advisers, Peter Navarro and Wilbur Ross, suggests an approach based on tax credits for equity investment and total private sector participation that will not cover the most important projects, not reach many of the most important investors, and involve substantial mis-targeting of public resources. Many of the highest return infrastructure investments \u2014 such as improving roads, repairing 60,000 structurally deficient bridges, upgrading schools or modernising the air traffic control system \u2014 do not generate a commercial return and so are excluded from his plan. Nor can the non-taxable pension funds, endowments and sovereign wealth funds that are the most promising sources of capital for infrastructure take advantage of the program. I am optimistic regarding the efficacy of fiscal expansion. But any responsible economist has to recognise that, past a point, it can lead to some combination of excessive foreign borrowing, inflation and even financial crisis. Here\u2019s the full piece: A badly designed US stimulus will only hurt the working class Summers, of course, has been urging Western politicians to spend more on infrastructure projects for years, so his opposition is a slight surprise.... Donald Trump\u2019s plan to boost US economic growth by rebuilding the nation\u2019s infrastructure is dangerous and unnecessary, claims JP Morgan\u2019s chief global strategist, David Kelly. In a new note to clients, Kelly argues that the US economy is not under-performing at present, and wouldn\u2019t be helped by a large debt-fuelled stimulus. Kelly is also concerned that Trump\u2019s proposed tax cut plans would send the national debt clock up to 100% of national output. First, the federal budget is already dangerously out of balance. Second, the economy is already at full employment so that stimulus applied now is more likely to stoke higher inflation and interest rates than greater real GDP growth. The federal deficit is already rising, growing from 2.5% of GDP in fiscal 2015 to 3.2% of GDP in fiscal 2016. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that, under current law, the national debt will grow from 77% of GDP in fiscal 2016 to 86% in fiscal 2026. However, in a September analysis of President-elect Trump\u2019s fiscal plans, the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget estimated that they would push the debt to 105% of GDP by 2026 if fully implemented. Most of the cost of these plans comes from large proposed tax cuts for both corporations and individuals, although increased defense spending also has a sizable impact. Kelly also points out that the recent surge in government bond yields shows that the plan would be pricy: It does not take a brilliant mathematician to see that if long-term Treasury rates return to more normal levels, financing this debt will absorb a much greater share of federal revenues over time. In the 50 years before the financial crisis, the average interest rate paid on federal debt was 5.6% but the average debt-to-GDP ratio was just 37%. A 5.6% average interest rate on a debt equal to 105% of GDP would be ruinous. The truth is boosting the federal debt to these levels is fiscally reckless. And if that wasn\u2019t enough, Kelly arguses that the wider US economy doesn\u2019t need a stimulus boost right now: The U.S. economy is, for all intents and purposes, at full employment. The overall unemployment rate is 4.9% - lower than it has been 77% of the time over the past 50 years while the short-term unemployment rate is lower than it has been 98% of the time over the past 50 years. Trump supporters might question this rosy view of the US economy -- especially in the Rust Belt where manufacturing jobs have been lost and wage growth pegged down. But... if Kelly\u2019s right, the fiscal stimulus might not actually regenerate America\u2019s economy at all (creating short-term construction work, but not sparking a manufacturing revival). He concludes: In this economy, a shock boost to aggregate demand through tax cuts would likely boost inflation and imports more than domestic production, since the U.S. economy is supply-side constrained. Higher inflation and bigger deficits should lead to higher interest rates \u2013 particularly if the Federal Reserve perceives inflation risks as having risen and so raises short-term interest rates. The American economy is more like a healthy tortoise than a sickly hare. Immigration reform designed to increase skilled immigrants or policies that boosted productivity growth might give the economy the ability to run faster. However, in the absence of this kind of supply-side effort, boosting aggregate demand to make the tortoise run faster would mainly result in over-heating. Italian bonds are also weakening today, with long-term yields hitting their highest in 16 months. Italy could be the next country to suffer a political earthquake, if prime minister Matteo Renzi loses his constitutional reforms referendum next month. Renzi hinted this morning that he might quit if the public reject the proposal to reform the Senate. Speaking on a radio interview, Renzi declared: If I have to stay on in parliament and do what everyone else has done before me, that is, to scrape by and just float there, that does not suit me.\u201d Opinion polls suggest the referendum is close. The reforms are opposed by the right-wing ant-immigrant Northern League, and the radical eurosceptic Movement Five Star -- who both relish the prospect of inflicting defeat on Renzi (once seen as the man to lead Italy out of years of stagnation and political quicksand). Just in! The interest rate on short-dated American bonds has hit its highest level since the start of the year. Two-year US treasury bills are now yielding 1% for the first time since January, as prices are dragged down by the wider bond rout today. Most Asian stock markets have fallen today. They were hit by fears that emerging markets will suffer from a stronger US dollar (luring capital back to America) or trade protectionism. Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng index shed almost 1.4%, finishing the day on (an auspicious?) 22,222.22 points. Over the weekend, US blogger and portfolio manager Matt Busigin argued that the financial markets are making a serious mistake in their analysis of the looming Trump presidency. He argues that they\u2019ve focused on the likely results of Trump\u2019s promises, without also factoring in just how much instability America could experience under their new leader. In his view -- investors should be a lot more risk-averse. [that\u2019s Nominal GDP - or the real growth rate plus the inflation rate] If Busigin\u2019s right, we could see a sharp correction if a) investors get nervous, or b) Trump\u2019s administration does indeed struggle. Many analysts think the global bond rout is only just beginning. It will take a while for investors to properly adjust their portfolios - especially if they\u2019ve gorged on low-yielding government bonds because they expected many more years of low inflation. Francesco Garzarelli, co-head of European macro research at Goldman Sachs, has predicted that the yield on America\u2019s 10-year Treasury bills will keep rising: \u201cThe prospect of US fiscal stimulus under the new government has increased our conviction that the US 10-year yield will reach 2.5 per cent in 2017, possibly faster than we earlier assumed. \u201cWhether Mr Trump\u2019s presidency brings fiscal spending or protectionism, we think either scenario would boost inflation.\u201d [reminder, the 10-year yield crunched through 2.2% this morning] The US dollar has hit an 11-month high against a basket of other currencies this morning. Fiona Cincotta of City Index says the greenback is going from \u201cstrength to strength\u201d, amid predictions that US interest rates will rise faster than previously expected. A Trump win had initially cast doubt on the probability of a rate increase in December, with the markets pricing in just a 50% chance of a hike on election night; however, this has since rebounded back. With unemployment historically low and Trump\u2019s heavy spending plans taking shape, inflation could well charge higher more quickly than initially forecast. Two rate rises had been pencilled in for next year, but if Trump decides to front load his spending then we could expect more rises through the year, resulting in the dollar pushing further northwards. Germany\u2019s long-term borrowing costs are also rising today, as the global bond market suffers from \u201cTrumpflation\u201d worries. It\u2019s another sign that investors are shifting money out of government bonds and into other assets. Reuters has a good take: German 30-year bond yields broke through 1% for the first time in more than six months on Monday, as investors dumped bonds on bets that the policies of U.S. President-elect Donald Trump will push up inflation. In a broad debt market sell-off, Italian 10-year yields broke above 2% for the first time since September 2015and U.S. 30-year yields topped 3% for the first time since January. German 10-year yields -- the euro zone benchmark -- rose to their highest since January, extending their biggest weekly rise this year after Republican Trump unexpectedly defeated Democrat rival Hillary Clinton in the U.S. presidential race. \u201cIt is a continuation of this recent trend. There are still these expectations that inflation could go up if the U.S. takes a more expansionary fiscal stance,\u201d DZ Bank strategist Daniel Lenz said. The US dollar is strengthening this morning, hitting \u20ac1.075 against the euro. That\u2019s its highest level since January. On the one hand, the dollar is benefitting from the prospect of higher American interest rates. On the other, concerns of rising populism and political crises in Europe has been undermining the euro in recent weeks. The pound has also lost ground against the dollar, dropping one cent below $1.25 (which has helped to push the FTSE 100 index up). Its shares 1, bonds 0 this morning. European shares are all rallying in early trading, led by financial stocks and mining companies. In London, the FTSE 100 has gained 82 points to 6814. House builder Taylor Wimpey is doing well, up 4% after reporting that the Brexit vote hasn\u2019t hurt trading. Barclays is up 3%. Banks should benefit if interest rates rise to calm inflation. And commodity prices are also benefitting from the prospect of a new US fiscal splurge (Trump will need a lot of copper and iron ore to rebuild America\u2019s infrastructure), so Anglo American and BHP Billiton have gained 2%. US bond prices are also falling this morning, driven by expectations that Trump\u2019s promised policies would drive up inflation. The yield on 10-year Treasury bills has jumped to 2.23%, from 2.13% on Thursday night [the market was closed on Friday for Veterans Day]. That\u2019s the highest level since January, and quite a substantial move, underlining how assets are being rapidly repriced... Government bonds are being hit hard in early trading as investors pick up where they left off last week. The prices of US and European government sovereign debt are falling sharply, following last week\u2019s selloff which wiped $1 trillion dollars off bond prices. The move is being driven by concerns that Donald Trump\u2019s plans for a debt-fuelled stimulus programme, and hefty tax cuts for richer Americans, will drive inflation up. The yield (or interest rate) on UK 10-year government debt has jumped over 1.42% this morning, up from 1.36% on Friday night. That\u2019s the highest yield since the end of May, before the Brexit vote. German bonds are also being driven down from their recent record highs. The yield on benchmark 10-year bunds hit a nine-month high this morning at 0.35% These moves mean that any investors who bought bonds before last week\u2019s selloff are facing losses. They also indicate that governments must pay a higher interest rate when they sell bonds in the market to fund their deficits (compared to a few weeks ago). Bloomberg are calling it a \u2018global bond rout\u2019, saying: A global bond rout is intensifying, sending U.S. 30-year yields above 3 percent for the first time since January, on speculation Donald Trump will increase spending to boost the world\u2019s largest economy. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. November is typically a time for investors to reflect about what went right, and wrong, that year and to ponder what might be coming next. And after the US elections last week, City experts have a lot of rethinking to do. Donald Trump\u2019s victory, so soon after the Brexit vote, has shaken many of the old certainties that have underpinned investment strategies for years. Inflation is back in town, as the president-elect plots a financial stimulus programme that could sent America\u2019s national debt spiralling (even) higher and force inflation out of its rut. And free trade is looking vulnerable too, with China threatening to hit American imports unless the next leader of the free world reins himself in: All of a sudden, putting one\u2019s clients\u2019 money into government bonds at record high prices (and thus record low returns), may not feel like such a smart move. Eric Peters, the boss of One River Management, talked about the shock of waking up in \u2018Trump world\u201d in his latest note to clients: That\u2019s why we saw bond prices slide last week, as people moved swiftly to reposition themselves. We\u2019ll probably see more significant shifts in asset prices this week. Also coming up today.... Japan has smashed expectations overnight, by reporting that its economy grew at an annualised rate of 2.2% in the last quarter. That\u2019s much better than the 0.9% which economists expected. The recovery was due to a jump in exports, so could be vulnerable if the global economy deteriorates. I\u2019ll mop up some reaction shortly. And UK housebuilder Taylor Wimpey and bookmaker William Hill are both reporting financial results, so we\u2019ll watch for any interesting angles there too.",

[<em>Brexit for a start, one would think]</em>.</p> <p>But he said the European economy had shown resilience to the global uncertainty, partly due to the ECB\u2019s actions:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The euro area recovery continues to proceed at a moderate, but steady, pace. It has shown remarkable resilience to adverse developments and uncertainties emanating from the global environment...</p> <p>Our monetary policy measures since June 2014\u00ad have been a key factor behind these positive developments. Asset purchases, targeted longer-term refinancing operations (TLTROs) and low policy rates have strongly supported the recovery...</p> <p>Supported by our monetary policy, the recovery is sustaining its momentum. We also expect headline inflation to continue rising over the coming months. At the same time, we are not seeing a consistent strengthening of underlying price dynamics. Much of the expected increase will be driven by statistical factors related to the stabilisation of oil prices. </p> <p>Moreover, the return of inflation towards our objective still relies on the continuation of the current, unprecedented level of monetary support, in spite of the gradual closing of the output gap. </p> <p>It is for this reason that we remain committed to preserving the very substantial degree of monetary accommodation necessary to secure a sustained convergence of inflation towards levels below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. </p> </blockquote> <p>But then he called for further action elsewhere:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>However... our monetary policy support has to be accompanied by decisive action from other policy areas. </p> <p>In fact, we continue to face a number of structural challenges that are holding back a more dynamic expansion of the euro area economy. So the right policies need to be designed to address existing vulnerabilities and challenges and, ultimately, secure higher sustainable growth for the euro area... </p> <p>The implementation of structural reforms needs to be substantially stepped up. This concerns, in particular, policy actions to raise productivity and improve the business environment...</p> <p>Second, fiscal policies should also support the economic recovery, while remaining in compliance with the fiscal rules of the European Union. For instance, a more growth-friendly composition of fiscal policies could boost growth. </p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-11-21T16:34:29.007Z\">at 4.34pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5833159ae4b0e0ad2d75bc65\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-11-21T15:43:12.927Z\">3.43pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The jump in the pound took the attention away from events in Europe, and also pushed the FTSE 100 lower after a bright start. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>After a morning of euro strength, following the double whammy of Merkel\u2019s announcement she will run for a fourth term as Chancellor and Francois Fillon\u2019s right-wing primary win causing potential problems for the unpleasant Marine Le Pen, out of nowhere focus shifted to the pound this afternoon. While it might be a case of scrambling around for a narrative to explain a rather sudden movement, it appears that May\u2019s (attempted) reassurances that the government is working to avoid a Brexit \u2018cliff edge\u2019 for businesses, comments that perhaps suggest a transitional deal, have caused sterling\u2019s resurgence.</p> <p>And what a resurgence it was, with the pound rocketing more than 1% higher against the dollar and 0.8% against the euro; its performance against the latter is especially remarkable given that it was nearly half a percent in the red earlier in the day. This in turn dragged the FTSE back below 6800, despite the chunky gains made in the oil and mining sectors, while also helping cement the 0.3% and 0.6% growth seen by the DAX and CAC respectively.</p> <p>The Dow Jones also benefited from the dollar\u2019s dip this Monday (the greenback maintained its 0.3% loss against the euro), with the US index rising nearly 40 points. That leaves the Dow around 20 points from a fresh all-time peak, though without much actual momentum to push it any higher. </p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-583308a4e4b0da4920d6aee3\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-11-21T15:03:52.650Z\">3.03pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Ahead of Wednesday\u2019s Autumn Statement from new UK chancellor Philip Hammond, Royal London Asset Management has called for measures to boost growth.

The government should counteract the lack of private sector investment since the financial crisis by improving transport infrastructure, housing and power generation while continuing to support research and new technology.</p> <p>Contrary to popular opinion, governments can borrow their way out of debt if interest rates are low enough - or \u2018save\u2019 their way deeper into debt if austerity causes the economy to weaken.</p> </blockquote> <p><em> <br></em></p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-583309eae4b0e0ad2d75bc45\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-11-21T14:56:02.417Z\">2.56pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">US markets head towards record highs</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>A rise in the oil price on hopes of an Opec deal next week to limit production has helped push US markets higher in early trading.

Opponents have questioned why he carried on serving as Sarkozy\u2019s prime minister if he disagreed with his approach.</p> <p>Sarkozy was disdainful of Fillon as a presidential candidate, referring to him as one of his staff.

                "bodyText":"A rising oil price, along with political developments in France and Germany, has helped push European stock markets into positive territory on the first trading day of the week. The prospect that Francois Fillon could beat Marine Le Pen in next year\u2019s French presidential election has given investors some comfort, as has Angela Merkel\u2019s announcement she was running for a fourth term as German chancellor. Meanwhile the climb in crude, based on growing hopes that Opec would reach an agreement on limiting output at its meeting next week, has lifted commodity companies, while dollar weakness has also helped. But London shares slipped back from their highs after a bounce in sterling - the leading UK index is full of exporters and overseas earners who benefit from a weak pound. The currency responded to supposed hints from UK prime minister Theresa May about a Brexit transition deal. The final scores in Europe showed: The FTSE 100 finished up just 2.19 points or 0.03% at 6777.96 Germany\u2019s Dax was 0.19% higher at 10,685.13 France\u2019s Cac closed up 0.56% at 4529.58 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB rose 0.19% to 16,297.26 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended 0.1% down at 8614.6 In Greece, the Athens market added 0.64% to 615.83 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up around 0.4%, hovering around a new peak of 18947. The S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq have also recorded new highs. On that note, it\u2019s time to close for the day. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. On the effect of the US election on the euro area economic outlook, Draghi said it is too early too now. But he said, as with the UK referendum vote, the reaction in the markets was significant to start with, but then muted. Markets have shown their resilience, helped by the actions of in the first case the Bank of England, then the ECB. But clearly these changes have a long term impact which difficult to assess and in the case of the UK, depends on the shape of negotiations and the length of time it takes to find an agreement. ECB president Mario Draghi is now responding to the comments of MEPs. He says he understands the concerns about the bank\u2019s unconventional measures, and says there are some risks. But he says they do not see an asset price bubble developing. He said the risks are for the time being contained \u201cbut we watch them closely.\u201d Low interest rates are a consequence of low growth and low inflation around the world, he said, not the creation of the ECB. Policy rates have to be low to stimulate growth. By and large, regarding the negative rate situation , the benefits outweigh the disadvantages. Our monetary policy is by and large the same as in the US, UK and Japan, says Draghi. He denies that the bank is overstepping its mandate (as was suggested by several MEPs). Here\u2019s the full Reuters report on the comments from ECB board member Beno\u00eet C\u0153ur\u00e9 on the bank not contemplating buying stocks as part of its QE programme. Away from the ECB and back to the CBI\u2019s annual conference in London, where Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has begun addressing delegates. Follow his speech on our politics live blog from here. Meanwhile, while ECB president Mario Draghi is listening to the various comments - often negative - on the bank\u2019s annual report, executive board member Beno\u00eet C\u0153ur\u00e9 has also been speaking. According to Reuters, he said that at some point the ECB would scale down its stimulus programme but not yet. And there was never any discussion about buying stocks as part of the QE programme. A number of MEPs are lining up to point out the problems in the eurozone and criticise some of the ECB\u2019s policies, while saying growth is still fragile. Draghi has begun speaking, apologising for his late arrival due to transport problems [we\u2019ve all been there...] You can follow the session here. European Central Bank president Mario Draghi has defended the bank\u2019s monetary policy actions once more, and repeated his calls for governments to step up their own reforms to boost growth. And he said the bank needed to continue its supportive policies to bring inflation close to its target. In a speech to the European Parliament relating to the ECB\u2019s annual report, he said challenges had increased since his last session there in February. [Brexit for a start, one would think]. But he said the European economy had shown resilience to the global uncertainty, partly due to the ECB\u2019s actions: The euro area recovery continues to proceed at a moderate, but steady, pace. It has shown remarkable resilience to adverse developments and uncertainties emanating from the global environment... Our monetary policy measures since June 2014 have been a key factor behind these positive developments. Asset purchases, targeted longer-term refinancing operations (TLTROs) and low policy rates have strongly supported the recovery... Supported by our monetary policy, the recovery is sustaining its momentum. We also expect headline inflation to continue rising over the coming months. At the same time, we are not seeing a consistent strengthening of underlying price dynamics. Much of the expected increase will be driven by statistical factors related to the stabilisation of oil prices. Moreover, the return of inflation towards our objective still relies on the continuation of the current, unprecedented level of monetary support, in spite of the gradual closing of the output gap. It is for this reason that we remain committed to preserving the very substantial degree of monetary accommodation necessary to secure a sustained convergence of inflation towards levels below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. But then he called for further action elsewhere: However... our monetary policy support has to be accompanied by decisive action from other policy areas. In fact, we continue to face a number of structural challenges that are holding back a more dynamic expansion of the euro area economy. So the right policies need to be designed to address existing vulnerabilities and challenges and, ultimately, secure higher sustainable growth for the euro area... The implementation of structural reforms needs to be substantially stepped up. This concerns, in particular, policy actions to raise productivity and improve the business environment... Second, fiscal policies should also support the economic recovery, while remaining in compliance with the fiscal rules of the European Union. For instance, a more growth-friendly composition of fiscal policies could boost growth. The jump in the pound took the attention away from events in Europe, and also pushed the FTSE 100 lower after a bright start. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said: After a morning of euro strength, following the double whammy of Merkel\u2019s announcement she will run for a fourth term as Chancellor and Francois Fillon\u2019s right-wing primary win causing potential problems for the unpleasant Marine Le Pen, out of nowhere focus shifted to the pound this afternoon. While it might be a case of scrambling around for a narrative to explain a rather sudden movement, it appears that May\u2019s (attempted) reassurances that the government is working to avoid a Brexit \u2018cliff edge\u2019 for businesses, comments that perhaps suggest a transitional deal, have caused sterling\u2019s resurgence. And what a resurgence it was, with the pound rocketing more than 1% higher against the dollar and 0.8% against the euro; its performance against the latter is especially remarkable given that it was nearly half a percent in the red earlier in the day. This in turn dragged the FTSE back below 6800, despite the chunky gains made in the oil and mining sectors, while also helping cement the 0.3% and 0.6% growth seen by the DAX and CAC respectively. The Dow Jones also benefited from the dollar\u2019s dip this Monday (the greenback maintained its 0.3% loss against the euro), with the US index rising nearly 40 points. That leaves the Dow around 20 points from a fresh all-time peak, though without much actual momentum to push it any higher. Ahead of Wednesday\u2019s Autumn Statement from new UK chancellor Philip Hammond, Royal London Asset Management has called for measures to boost growth. Trevor Greetham, head of multi asset at Royal London, said: Now is the time to reset fiscal policy and the focus should be on boosting nominal growth to offset Brexit uncertainty rather than trying to deliver \u2018austerity-lite\u2019. Going for growth should reduce the debt burden over time as the government can borrow money in the gilt market at a cost of 1-2 per cent per annum and invest in an economy with long term growth potential of four. The government should counteract the lack of private sector investment since the financial crisis by improving transport infrastructure, housing and power generation while continuing to support research and new technology. Contrary to popular opinion, governments can borrow their way out of debt if interest rates are low enough - or \u2018save\u2019 their way deeper into debt if austerity causes the economy to weaken. A rise in the oil price on hopes of an Opec deal next week to limit production has helped push US markets higher in early trading. The post-election rally has continued, boosted by the expectation of infrastructure spending and other measures to boost the US economy. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 51 points or 0.28%, just 15 points below its record high. Meanwhile the Nasdaq index of technology companies has already reached a new peak, up 0.56%. The pound has just jumped by over one cent against the US dollar....and it\u2019s not quite clear why! After a slow start, sterling suddenly jumped by over 1% to hit $1.25, from $1.234 this morning. It\u2019s dipping back a bit now, as traders struggle to work out what happened. One theory is that Theresa May has sparked the rally, by telling business leaders this morning that she wants to avoid a Brexit \u201ccliff edge\u201d. That has raised hopes that Britain might seek a transitional arrangement, to help businesses adjust to life outside the European Union. Reuters are calling it a \u2018mystery move\u2019, saying: Sterling jumped by a full cent in a few seconds just after 1325 GMT on Monday, with dealers at several major banks saying there had been no clear driver of the move in a currency still smarting from a so-called \u201cflash crash\u201da month ago. Influential MP Andrew Tyrie is highly unamused that the Bank of England is considering hiking the UK\u2019s deposit protection scheme back to \u00a385,000, less than 18 months after cutting it to \u00a375,000. As we explained at 11.26am, the changes are driven by sterling\u2019s volatility, with the BoE tacking and jibing to keep in line with the \u20ac100,000 limit set by European regulators. But Tyrie, who chairs parliament\u2019s Treasury committee, thinks these changes undermine public confidence in the banking system. \u201cThe announcement today of another change to the deposit protection limit \u2013 there have been about seven in the last decade \u2013 is a recipe for yet more uncertainty. \u201cEach change will have carried a cost. It\u2019s extremely valuable for the level of deposit protection to be well known for long periods. This allows savers and small businesses time to adjust. Stability is what is needed. That is what can entrench public confidence in depositor protection, the most valuable commodity of all. \u201cThese recent changes have not been the fault of the PRA. They are an EU requirement, imposed by the European Commission. The current EU rules have always been unacceptable to a country such as the UK, in the EU but outside the Eurozone. Tyrie\u2019s solution is to take back control of these rules - which kick in if a bank fails: \u201cThe absurd situation, in which the UK is left vulnerable, at the discretion of the European Commission, to frequent changes in our deposit scheme, must be brought to an end. Brexit should give the UK the opportunity to set its own level of protection. We should take it.\u201d Francois Fillon\u2019s plans to shrink the French state by cutting 500,000 jobs will surely alarm France\u2019s unions, and could be fiercely fought. Cutting unemployment benefit and raising the retirement age will also be controversial, should Fillon become the next president. But MEP Philippe Juvin argues that Fillon is what France needs, telling Bloomberg TV this morning that: The financial markets want stability and they want trust. With Fillon they would get stability and trust. This chart, from the Economists\u2019s Jeremy Cliffe, shows how Fillon won support from Republican voters across the country: From Paris, Kim Willsher reports that French politicians are swiftly rethinking their alliance following Fillon\u2019s surprise win: Nicolas Sarkozy crashed out of the primaries with only 20.6% of the vote. Shortly after his defeat he called on supporters to throw their weight behind Fillon. Among those who responded to the call were former prime minister and presidential candidate Edouard Balladur, and Sarkozy supporters Brice Hortefeux and Rachida Dati, as well as fellow first-round loser Bruno Le Maire. On the other hand, Nathalie Kosciusko-Morziet, who came fourth in the primary has announced she will support Jupp\u00e9, as have former prime minister Jean-Pierre Raffarin and former minister Val\u00e9rie P\u00e9cresse. The other first round contenders, Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Cop\u00e9, former head of the centre-right party, and Jean-Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Poisson of the Christian Democrat party, have yet to declare their second-round allegiance. Fran\u00e7ois Bayrou, the president of the centrist party MoDem, has already called for his supporters to vote for Juppe. The US stock market is expected to open calmly in 80 minutes time, as the Trump effect wears off: Francois Fillon hasn\u2019t got the Republican nomination sewn up quite yet. Having won yesterday\u2019s first round contest, he must now beat Alain Juppe in a run-off next Sunday. That shouldn\u2019t be a problem, given Fillon\u2019s strong showing in the primary: The scale of his victory has surprised many observers (perhaps because most people have been distracted by the US election!). So we\u2019ve published a profile of Fillon, ideal for anyone muttering \u2018Francois who?!\u2019 this morning. It explains how the former PM is winning support with a neoliberal, conservative stance reminiscent of Britain\u2019s Tory party in the 80s. Here\u2019s a flavour: Fran\u00e7ois Fillon, who beat his former boss Nicolas Sarkozy to join Alain Jupp\u00e9 in the second round of voting for France\u2019s rightwing Republican party\u2019s presidential candidate, is a social conservative who likes drinking tea, driving classic cars and cutting state spending. The 62-year-old Paris MP\u2019s campaign slogan to slash half a million public sector jobs over five years is inspired by his heroine, Margaret Thatcher. Of the seven Republican candidates, Fillon was the most outspoken defender of what is seen in France as the Anglo-Saxon economic model. He appears unafraid of offending the French statist tradition or fuelling a popular backlash against neoliberal economics. In his last rally before Sunday\u2019s vote, he said: \u201cI\u2019m tagged with an [economically] liberal label in the same way one would paint crosses on the doors of lepers in the middle ages. But I\u2019m just a pragmatist.\u201d Fillon served as prime minister under Sarkozy, and is remembered for defying street protests and championing a rise in the retirement age. He tried to distance himself from Sarkozy after the 2008 financial crash by describing the country as bankrupt and suggesting France needed to cut state spending further. Opponents have questioned why he carried on serving as Sarkozy\u2019s prime minister if he disagreed with his approach. Sarkozy was disdainful of Fillon as a presidential candidate, referring to him as one of his staff. But Fillon had the last laugh. By pipping him to the second round runoff next week, Fillon has all but ended Sarkozy\u2019s political career..... Europe\u2019s big three stock markets are all pushing higher as lunchtime approaches. European politics is the main issue in the City today, meaning concerns over Donald Trump can take a (temporary?) back seat. Investors seem to be welcoming the emergence of Francois Fillon as the man to lead the French right-wing Republican party to victory over Marine Le Pen of Front National next May. As explained earlier, Fillon is the favourite to become France\u2019s next president after beating fellow right-wingers Alain Juppe and Nicolas Sarkozy in last night\u2019s primary. The UK\u2019s FTSE 100 is now up 35 points at 6810, a gain of 0.5%, led by mining companies. The French and German markets have posted similar gains (although Italy is still suffering from pre-referendum worries). Traders are hoping that Europe will stick with mainstream politicians in next year\u2019s crunch elections, as Conner Campbell of SpreadEx explains: The confirmation that Angela Merkel is set to run for a fourth term as German chancellor in next year\u2019s election, combined with a Marine Le Pen-damaging victory for Francois Fillon in the first round of France\u2019s right-wing primaries, has given life to the euro this morning. The Eurozone currency finds itself up 0.2% against the dollar, just about lifting it away from last week\u2019s sub-\u20ac1.06 lows, while it has had more success against the pound, taking back nearly half a percent. The fact that this political news suggests stability in a region standing on the precipice of potential chaos has also helped out the Eurozone indices. French government debt have also strengthened in value this morning, pulling down the yield (interest rate) on its 10-year bonds. Newsflash: The Bank of England is considering raising the maximum bank deposit guaranteed in the UK to \u00a385,000, from \u00a375,000. The move is prompted by the pound\u2019s slump against the euro since June\u2019s EU referendum, from \u20ac1.30 to \u20ac1.16. Under EU law, consumers can recover up to \u20ac100,000 if they lose money when a bank collapses. And sterling\u2019s recent decline has pushed up the value of that protection in pound terms. The Bank\u2019s Prudential Regulation Authority has concluded that the pound is not going to recover anytime soon: Taking into consideration the developments in financial markets following the UK\u2019s referendum vote to leave the European Union on 23 June 2016, including with respect to the GBP/EUR exchange rate, the PRA considers that a structural shift in the exchange rate has occurred. This may be a little embarrassing for the BoE. The limit was originally \u00a385k, but the Bank\u2019s Prudential Regulatory Authority decided to lower it to \u00a375k in July 2015 (because the pound had rallied against the euro). That decision angered the high street banks, who had just trained their staff on the scheme. Tinkering with the deposit protection scheme too often risks confusing consumers... Antonio Barroso of Teneo Intelligence also thinks Francois Fillon would beat Marine Le Pen in a straight race to become French president. Barroso says Fillon\u2019s victory over Alain Juppe and Nicolas Sarkozy in Sunday\u2019s Republican primary is bad news for Le Pen: While left-wing voters would find it more difficult to support Fillon than Juppe in a second round, he is a less toxic candidate than Sarkozy; it is also likely that he would moderate his stance on economic issues between the two rounds in order not to scare off centrist voters. Fillon\u2019s biggest strength is that he would be able to limit the potential flow of traditional conservative voters towards the FN [National Front]. In sum, the former PM would probably be able to deploy the necessary ambiguity to build a coalition of voters that could defeat Le Pen. The euro has gained almost half a cent against the US dollar this morning, as European political drama overtakes Donald Trump as the main issue on the trading floors. The single currency is trading at $1.063, up from $1.0585 on Friday night. That ends 10 days of straight declines following the US election. Traders are digesting Angela Merkel\u2019s decision to run for a fourth term as German chancellor, and Francois Fillon\u2019s sudden promotion to favourite to become the next French president. Merkel has already warned that next year\u2019s election will be tough, given the rising tides of populism: Fillon has campaigned on a conservative platform of cutting 500,000 civil service jobs and ending the 35-hour week. He also favours taking a hard line over Brexit, as our Brussels correspondent Jennifer Rankin explains: Fillon\u2019s success has raised hopes that National Front leader Marine Le Pen can be kept away from the presidency. But Kit Juckes of Societe Generale says we can\u2019t be complacent: The clearest message I received over the last two weeks was that opinion polls and historical voting patterns which suggest a le Pen victory is unlikely, won\u2019t do much to ease pre-election nervousness. Market participants can see the shift in the voter mood and the sharp swing in support for M Fillon can be seen as yet another surprise for opinion pollsters. Uncertainty will weigh on the Euro for months to come. City analysts are warning that Wednesday\u2019s autumn statement will not be a game-changer, given the UK\u2019s financial problems. George Palmer from Waverton Investment Management hopes that Phillip Hammond will announce new infrastructure spending plans. George Osborne\u2019s Budgets and Autumn Statements were defined by a general intent to cut deficits, budgets and taxes on the entrepreneur. If Hammond is going to stimulate an economy that is entering a period of uncertainty it is unlikely that he will be able to cut all three. He has already abandoned the prospect of balancing the books and Wednesday 23rd will give us an idea on tax cuts. In line with Mr Trump\u2019s promises of improved infrastructure (not just walls) to provide growth and jobs, the expectation is that Mr Hammond will similarly spend the windfall of expanded deficits and unbalanced budgets on some sort of infrastructure. And arguably, there is capacity to do so \u2013 the lack of investment (excluding the Olympics) since the Financial Crisis means its share of GDP has been falling steeply (as this chart shows): But Fiona Cincotti of City Index say Phillip Hammond hasn\u2019t got much flexibility to borrow more for investment: Given the size of the UK\u2019s debt pile, in addition to poor economic forecasts any expectations of Trump style spending are misplaced and he is likely to opt for a rather conservative budget in comparison. Sterling has seen a soft start to the week as Hammond\u2019s talking down of the UK\u2019s post Brexit economy over the weekend has done little to support the battered currency; we are expecting to see more volatility in the lead up to and during the course of the Statement on Wednesday. And Edward Hardy of currency exchange firm World First points out that Britain\u2019s financial position appears to be deteriorating: The size of Hammond\u2019s fiscal arsenal has been somewhat limited by new estimates forecasting a \u00a3100bln black hole in the UK\u2019s finances due to slower growth and limited international investment attributed to the UK\u2019s decision to leave the EU. Despite the government ditching the pledge to balance the books by 2020, this lack of fiscal rigour will prevent Hammond, and any future governments, from enacting wider-reaching fiscal reform such as lifting the 1% public sector pay rise cap and revitalising public services. And She\u2019s off! Theresa May is telling the CBI conference that capitalism is the best hope for people struggling in the UK. But she\u2019s also challenging business to do more to help Britain, through long-term investment, helping communities and creating jobs for the next generation. May also declares that Wednesday\u2019s autumn statement will be \u201cambitious for business and ambitious for Britain\u201d. Philip Hammond, she says, will commit to creating a \u201cstrong and stable\u201d basis for the economy, while also bringing the deficit down and cutting the national debt That may be a hint not to expect a major easing of fiscal policy this week. Stay tuned to Politics Live for more from the CBI.... The CBI\u2019s annual conference is up and running, and Theresa May should give the keynote speech in a few minutes. Our Politics Live blog has all the details: Britain\u2019s government is signalling that it may pull a sharp u-turn over plans to put workers on company boards. The Sunday Times reported yesterday that Theresa May is considering \u2018watering down\u2019 the plan, which was one of her early pledges when she replaced David Cameron in July. Business minister Greg Clark is now hinting that the government is indeed backing away from the plan (which wasn\u2019t popular with City bosses), telling Radio 4 that: \u201cTheresa May has talked about an economy that works for everyone - that includes workers, employees, consumers, the supply chain businesses - so we will put forward a series of ways in which those voices can be represented on boards. \u201cWe will publish those plans. We will have options. We are working with business. Frances O\u2019Grady, head of the TUC, isn\u2019t impressed: Italy\u2019s stock market has shed 1% in early trading as traders anticipate that voters will reject constitutional reforms in next month\u2019s referendum. The FTSE MIB has shed 160 points to 16,103, putting it on track for its weakest close since early July. The latest polls show that the public are likely to reject prime minister Matteo Renzi\u2019s proposal, to trim the Italian Senate\u2019s power and change the way its members are selected. Renzi has threatened to resign if he loses, which could plunge the eurozone into a fresh crisis (although he could yet lead a caretaker government). Social networking platform Facebook has given the UK economy a fillip, by announcing plans for a new headquarters in central London. The company is planning to hire 500 new workers, increasing its UK headcount by 50%, to work at the new site in Fitzrovia (the part of London around the BT Tower). Fingers crossed that this helps Facebook tackle its fake news problem.... Trump spent the weekend entertaining potential cabinet member at his New Jersey golf club. One \u2018serious\u2019 option for the Secretary of State position is former presidential candidate Mitt Romney (who has presumably been forgiven for labelling Trump as \u201ca phoney, a fraud\u2019\u2019 in March). These choices will be a litmus test for Trump\u2019s administration -- international investors will look for signs that the next president might row back from his anti-globalisation message. Rob Carnell, chief international economist at ING, explains that politics will still drive the markets: \u201cWe\u2019ll to have to take a view as to whether these people are pro free trade, or not as anti free trade as Trump sounded on the campaign trail, and what we\u2019re likely to get in policies such as fiscal expansion and the dollar.\u201d After 12 days of shock, the City may have adjusted to the prospect of Donald Trump becoming the next US president. The world\u2019s financial markets are stubbornly, indeed disappointingly, quiet this morning as investors watch the billionaire president-elect form his new cabinet. Excited chatter about trillion-dollar infrastructure plans has faded, and anxiety over a bond market crash has eased too, while people wait to see how Trump prepares for power. So the pound is absolutely flat against the US dollar at $1.2345, and most government bond prices are inching a little higher. European stock markets are calm too, with Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 index up 15 points in early trading. Trump\u2019s success pushed the Dow Jones index to a series of record highs, and sent government bond prices reeling. But that initial wild reaction may now have faded, as FXTM Chief Market Strategist Hussein Sayed explains: The reflationary trade, or as some like to call it \u201cTrump trade\u201d, probably led some big name bearish investors, who were calling the end of 8-year bull market to reconsider their judgments. Since Trump won the elections on November 9, the dollar index gained 3.6%, the Dow Jones traded at new record highs, and yields on U.S. 10-year treasury bonds rallied 25%. The shift in market sentiment was based on hopes that a Trump presidency means businesses\u2019 profits skyrocketing due to sharp cut in taxes, more capital expenditures, and finally some inflation supported by aggressive government infrastructure spending. It\u2019s difficult to know how much further this bull can run especially that it\u2019s driven by animal spirits, and yet no fundamental evidence. However, when everybody turns bullish, this is the time when you should get worried. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. It\u2019s wet and gloomy in the City, as traders squelch to the office at the start of another busy week. The big event comes on Wednesday, when chancellor Phillip Hammond delivers the Autumn Statement. It\u2019ll be Hammond\u2019s first major set piece event since replacing George Osborne at the Treasury, and a chance to set the economy on its post-Brexit path. However, the omens aren\u2019t great. Yesterday, Hammond downplayed the chances of giving much help to struggling families, pointing out that the national debt was \u201ceye-wateringly\u201d large. So hopes of a major infrastructure spending plan are already receding (although the chancellor may find \u00a31.3bn for the nation\u2019s roads). And after six years of Osborne-omics, we can see that those families at the bottom of the income pile have suffered badly. A new survey has shown that current austerity-driven welfare cuts will cost low-income working families more than \u00a32,500 a year by 2020. Our front page story explains: A study of 187,000 households across the UK found that policies including cuts to universal credit and the four-year benefit rate freeze, coupled with rising rents and higher inflation, would see low-income working families typically lose \u00a348.90 a week by the end of the decade. The findings have alarmed councils and charities worried that the growing financial burden on low-income families will raise poverty and homelessness levels. Also coming up today.... The impact of Brexit will be high on the agenda at the CBI\u2019s annual conference in London today. Prime minister Theresa May is the keynote speaker, and will be talking about her plans for \u201cA stronger, fairer Britain\u201d at 9.45am. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn is also speaking, along with many of Britain\u2019s top business leaders. Our politics team will be covering the CBI conference, but we\u2019ll keep an eye for interesting titbits too. French politics took a twist last night when former PM Francois Fillon won the first round of the race to become the Republican party\u2019s candidate for the presidency next year. Fillon is now the odds-on favourite to become the next president, and has probably sunk Nicolas Sarkozy\u2019s hopes of a political comeback. European Central Bank president Mario Draghi is presenting the ECB\u2019s annual report to MEPs in Strasbourg this afternoon. The oil price could be volatile, as producers prepare for an OPEC meeting at the end of this month. But there\u2019s not much in the economic calendar to excite us, alas, so some traders are expecting a quiet day...",

The social network will <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/nov/21/facebook-hire-500-uk-workers-opens-london-hq-fitzrvovia\">hire another 500 employees in the UK</a>, boosting its British headcount by 50%, as it prepares to open new London officesin 2017.</p> <p>The news has been welcomed as proof that Britain can continue to compete globally in the tech industry even if it leaves the EU. Gerard Grech, the chief executive of industry body Tech City UK, said that the moves \u201care a huge endorsement of the country\u2019s attractiveness to tech companies\u201d.</p> <p>He acknowledged that other European cities, led by Berlin and Paris, will attempt to lure firms away from London by raising the spectre of post-Brexit instability, adding: \u201cLondon remains the digital capital of Europe but we know that we face friendly rivalry from other European cities over the next two years. International competitiveness raises the game for the whole of Europe as we want to see more European tech companies.\u201d</p> <p>But Russ Shaw, the head of lobby group Tech London Advocates, warns that the UK ambitions of Facebook and Google could bring dire Brexit warnings to life by creating an industry-wide skills shortage. Under this scenario, Facebook and Google will hoover up the best tech talent as they expand their UK bases and the competition for personnel will be intensified if immigration curbs are imposed in a post-Brexit UK at the same time. </p> <p>\u201cThe post-Brexit issue around talent has still not gone away,\u201d said Shaw. If the UK leaves the EU without retaining freedom of movement, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/jul/07/brexit-already-hurt-tech-but-next-step-could-be-worse\">tech companies have warned that they could struggle to fill key engineering roles</a>. \u201cPerhaps the irony of all of these good news stories is that it will put even more pressure on the talent issue,\u201d Shaw adds.<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"73fc423db320d6317a3f8c91372ef7b0204b77d8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/73fc423db320d6317a3f8c91372ef7b0204b77d8/0_169_3000_1801/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Google HQ\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Google\u2019s new HQ will be in close proximity to its existing site in Kings Cross, creating a \u2018London campus\u2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bloomberg/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>For overseas companies looking to expand, particularly those that already have a European headquarters, the UK remains attractive, according to Suranga Chandratillake, a general partner of venture capital firm Balderton. But that sentiment could turn. <br></p> <p>\u201cThe good news from Brexit is the pound is weak and so traditionally expensive UK employees are looking cheaper,\u201d said Chandratillake. \u201cLonger term confusion remains, however, on immigration policy and its societal impact. All of our companies employ highly diverse, critical employees from around the world. If it becomes difficult for them to live here in the future, whether legally or because they feel they are unwanted, the cheap pound won\u2019t help.\u201d</p> <p>Shaw warns that an atmosphere of uncertainty around the government\u2019s negotiation stance with Brussels has not helped inward investment to the UK, despite Theresa May\u2019s insistence that \u201cBrexit means Brexit\u201d. He added: \u201cI have heard that some investors have been holding back until there is clarity around what \u2018Brexit means Brexit\u2019 means.\u201d<br></p> <p>But recent events in other countries have left Britain looking like a comparatively safe investment opportunity. Speaking as Google confirmed the new London campus last week, the mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, said the capital welcomed all comers \u2013 and unlike Canada, which was inundated with migration queries following the election of Donald Trump, \u201cour website is not going to crash\u201d.</p> <p>Khan told the Guardian that Google\u2019s commitment was \u201can example of people still having confidence in London\u201d. When asked directly whether Trump\u2019s election would help attract talent to the capital, he demurred. \u201cWe\u2019ve had a special relationship with the US, we\u2019ve had presidents in the past who have been very familiar with the prime minister, we\u2019ll wait and see about the relationship between the president elect and Theresa May. </p> <p>\u201cThe key thing is, American businesses have great relationships with British businesses, and Americans have great relationships with Brits. Google making a big announcement in London, I think, bodes well.\u201d</p> <p>Facebook\u2019s London office is the company\u2019s largest engineering base outside the US, and houses the team behind Workplace, a product that lets businesses build their own internal Facebooks for employee communication. Intended to compete with Silicon Valley darling Slack, it\u2019s one of the first Facebook products that charges users directly: fees start at $1 per employee.</p> <p>Google\u2019s campus won\u2019t be the largest, but it will contain the first Google owned and designed building outside America. It will also host one of the UK\u2019s biggest tech successes of recent years, DeepMind: Google\u2019s world-leading AI research outfit. Co-founded by three Brits, Demis Hassabis, Shane Legg, and Mustafa Suleyman, DeepMind was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/jan/27/google-acquires-uk-artificial-intelligence-startup-deepmind\">bought by Google for \u00a3400m in 2014</a>.</p> <p>The fear among tech professionals is that a post-Brexit Britain will frighten away the skills and the money needed to ensure that more companies such as DeepMind emerge. For now, however, Google and Facebook are indicating that this will not be the case. </p>",

Google confirmed that its enormous \u201clandscraper\u201d London HQ, first mooted in 2013, would be going ahead despite the vote. The company\u2019s chief executive, Sundar Pichai, admitted to having reservations after the referendum verdict, but would not be dissuaded from establishing a new campus in King\u2019s Cross that will house up to 7,000 employees. Facebook followed on Sunday by announcing its own UK expansion. The social network will hire another 500 employees in the UK, boosting its British headcount by 50%, as it prepares to open new London officesin 2017. The news has been welcomed as proof that Britain can continue to compete globally in the tech industry even if it leaves the EU. Gerard Grech, the chief executive of industry body Tech City UK, said that the moves \u201care a huge endorsement of the country\u2019s attractiveness to tech companies\u201d. He acknowledged that other European cities, led by Berlin and Paris, will attempt to lure firms away from London by raising the spectre of post-Brexit instability, adding: \u201cLondon remains the digital capital of Europe but we know that we face friendly rivalry from other European cities over the next two years. International competitiveness raises the game for the whole of Europe as we want to see more European tech companies.\u201d But Russ Shaw, the head of lobby group Tech London Advocates, warns that the UK ambitions of Facebook and Google could bring dire Brexit warnings to life by creating an industry-wide skills shortage. Under this scenario, Facebook and Google will hoover up the best tech talent as they expand their UK bases and the competition for personnel will be intensified if immigration curbs are imposed in a post-Brexit UK at the same time. \u201cThe post-Brexit issue around talent has still not gone away,\u201d said Shaw. If the UK leaves the EU without retaining freedom of movement, tech companies have warned that they could struggle to fill key engineering roles. \u201cPerhaps the irony of all of these good news stories is that it will put even more pressure on the talent issue,\u201d Shaw adds. For overseas companies looking to expand, particularly those that already have a European headquarters, the UK remains attractive, according to Suranga Chandratillake, a general partner of venture capital firm Balderton. But that sentiment could turn. \u201cThe good news from Brexit is the pound is weak and so traditionally expensive UK employees are looking cheaper,\u201d said Chandratillake. \u201cLonger term confusion remains, however, on immigration policy and its societal impact. All of our companies employ highly diverse, critical employees from around the world. If it becomes difficult for them to live here in the future, whether legally or because they feel they are unwanted, the cheap pound won\u2019t help.\u201d Shaw warns that an atmosphere of uncertainty around the government\u2019s negotiation stance with Brussels has not helped inward investment to the UK, despite Theresa May\u2019s insistence that \u201cBrexit means Brexit\u201d. He added: \u201cI have heard that some investors have been holding back until there is clarity around what \u2018Brexit means Brexit\u2019 means.\u201d But recent events in other countries have left Britain looking like a comparatively safe investment opportunity. Speaking as Google confirmed the new London campus last week, the mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, said the capital welcomed all comers \u2013 and unlike Canada, which was inundated with migration queries following the election of Donald Trump, \u201cour website is not going to crash\u201d. Khan told the Guardian that Google\u2019s commitment was \u201can example of people still having confidence in London\u201d. When asked directly whether Trump\u2019s election would help attract talent to the capital, he demurred. \u201cWe\u2019ve had a special relationship with the US, we\u2019ve had presidents in the past who have been very familiar with the prime minister, we\u2019ll wait and see about the relationship between the president elect and Theresa May. \u201cThe key thing is, American businesses have great relationships with British businesses, and Americans have great relationships with Brits. Google making a big announcement in London, I think, bodes well.\u201d Facebook\u2019s London office is the company\u2019s largest engineering base outside the US, and houses the team behind Workplace, a product that lets businesses build their own internal Facebooks for employee communication. Intended to compete with Silicon Valley darling Slack, it\u2019s one of the first Facebook products that charges users directly: fees start at $1 per employee. Google\u2019s campus won\u2019t be the largest, but it will contain the first Google owned and designed building outside America. It will also host one of the UK\u2019s biggest tech successes of recent years, DeepMind: Google\u2019s world-leading AI research outfit. Co-founded by three Brits, Demis Hassabis, Shane Legg, and Mustafa Suleyman, DeepMind was bought by Google for \u00a3400m in 2014. The fear among tech professionals is that a post-Brexit Britain will frighten away the skills and the money needed to ensure that more companies such as DeepMind emerge. For now, however, Google and Facebook are indicating that this will not be the case.",
