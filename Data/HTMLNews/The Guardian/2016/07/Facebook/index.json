                "bodyText":"Africa\u2019s digital transformation would be nothing without the tens of thousands of people who have invested, and continue to invest, energy into propelling it forward. They are the leading lights driving change in infrastructure, mobile connectivity, online activism, e-commerce and financial services. Some are opening up digital cultural spaces or working to bring in investment for tech startups. As part of the Guardian\u2019s focus on technology in Africa we\u2019ve listed 10 individuals who\u2019ve been pioneers in the transformation from Tanzania to Tunisia, with the three of sub-Saharan Africa\u2019s big tech hitters \u2013 South Africa, Nigeria and Kenya \u2013 particularly well represented. And in a bid to look forward we asked each of the 10 pioneers to predict the next development in Africa\u2019s digital transformation and to each nominate an emerging talent to watch. Jason Njoku, Nigeria: \u2018We\u2019ve got everything to play for, but it won\u2019t be easy\u2019 The British-Nigerian entrepreneur founded iROKOtv which hosts the most extensive online catalogue of Nollywood content in the world. Nicknamed the Netflix of Africa, iROKOtv is one of the continent\u2019s biggest internet TV providers and has raised over $35m in international investment. He says Africa\u2019s digital transformation is ahead of us. By my calculations, we haven\u2019t even really started, we\u2019re still building, we\u2019re still scaling. Everything is to play for \u2013 the majority of Africa\u2019s potential digital population aren\u2019t properly online yet, but it\u2019s not going to be an easy ride. We need homegrown investors to get behind the tech sector and understand the opportunities that are under our noses. He nominates Fikayo Ogundipe, co-founder of ToLet.com.ng which has completely reshaped Nigeria\u2019s property market, starting with Lagos. Buying, selling and renting houses in the city isn\u2019t for the faint-hearted but Fikayo and his team have painstakingly researched the market, pouring their findings into a website to help consumers navigate the process. But Fikayo is not building the Foxtons of Nigeria, he\u2019s building a Nigerian company for Nigerians, that tackles the problems encountered by Nigerians in the Nigerian property market. Lina Ben Mhenni, Tunisia: \u2018Digital action must be combined with real world action\u2019 Author of the blog A Tunisian Girl, Lina Ben Mhenni rose to prominence during the Tunisian revolution in 2011, as she documented the Tunisian uprising and violence at the hands of the security forces. Mhenni was one of the few Tunisian cyber activists who blogged under her real name while President Zine Ben Ali was still in office. Her blog was turned into a book and she was later a favourite for the Nobel peace prize. She says After Ben Ali fled Tunisia, people all around the world focused on the role of the internet in his departure. Some talked about a Facebook or internet revolution. But this ignored the sacrifices of the people who took to the streets and demonstrated, often against live fire. No one can deny the importance of the internet and social networks \u2013 when a regime imposes a media blackout, they can be used to both inform and mobilise people. But some have overestimated its role. Action in the digital world must be combined with actions in the real world. She nominates Rahma Sghaier a young leader who is using ICT to bring change to Tunisia, Rahma blogs on the YaLa platform, commenting on politics and advocating for international peace. Her main mission is to support young Tunisians to write, create photo essays and videos and explore their talents. She also promotes citizen journalism through blogging and vlogging and wants to train young girls in how to make videos.
