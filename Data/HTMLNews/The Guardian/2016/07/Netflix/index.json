The research company\u2019s Michael Pearce said:</p> <blockquote> <p>After spending the run-up to the UK\u2019s EU referendum warning that Brexit would cause \u201csevere regional and global damage\u201d, the IMF all but admitted on Tuesday that it had been bluffing, forecasting that the impact would be largely benign after all. </p> <p>The IMF downgraded its forecasts for global growth this year and next by just 0.1 percentage point, to 3.1% and 3.4% respectively. The biggest downward revision was of course to the UK, which the Fund now expects to grow by just 1.3% in 2017, almost a percentage point slower than its previous forecast. But even this is not as bad as the recession many commentators had warned of.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the IMF nudged down its forecast for growth in the euro-zone next year by 0.2 percentage points, while the forecast for economies further afield was \u201clittle affected\u201d by the Brexit vote. So much for the IMF\u2019s claim that there would be \u201csevere damage.\u201d</p> <p>Admittedly, the Fund did warn of a more disorderly outcome from Brexit, providing two alternative scenarios in which global growth stalls or slows further. However IMF Chief Economist, Maurice Obstfeld, acknowledged that these would require the impact on global trade to be \u201cgreater than [the IMF] thinks likely\u201d while financial conditions would need to deteriorate far more than they had done so far...</p> <p>Instead of Brexit, prospects for the world economy will be shaped far more by the outlook for China and the US. Recent data suggest that growth in both economies is holding up fairly well. </p> </blockquote> <p><strong>And on that note, it\u2019s time to close for the day.

It said:</p> <blockquote> <p>The outlook revision reflects our view that the unfavorable operating environment poses particular challenges to Deutsche Bank as it implements its 2016-2020 strategic plan. Although market conditions may recover somewhat from the weak first quarter of 2016, ultra-low interest rates and generally subdued client trading activity may persist for the foreseeable future. These pressures affect the entire sector but we believe they are particularly unhelpful for Deutsche Bank as it seeks to strengthen capital and maintain its franchise while fundamentally restructuring its business model and balance sheet...</p> <p>The U.K.\u2019s recent vote to leave the EU (Brexit) is a consideration in the outlook revision, but not a prominent one. We consider that Deutsche Bank should not be materially affected if the U.K. were to lose access to the EU financial services passporting arrangement, although it may need to relocate some activities from its large London branch. We assume Deutsche Bank\u2019s trading revenues received a boost from Brexit-related market volatility but, in the longer term, we see Brexit as a factor that may prolong the current period of ultra-low global interest rates and depressed business volumes. </p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/Schuldensuehner/status/755438750654668800\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">S&amp;P cut Deutsche Bank outlook to negative, citing difficult environment.

In a new report the agency says:</p> <blockquote> <p>As we have stated previously, the full impact of Brexit, and any potential ratings impact, will depend on the exit terms negotiated, which remain uncertain. For the higher education sector, a favourable exit deal would limit the reduction in research grants from EU funds. Even so, restrictions on free movement could reduce projected student demand and increase pressure on universities\u2019 revenues. The impact may be greater on English than on Scottish universities due to their different tuition fee arrangements for non-UK EU students, although we do not currently rate any Scottish universities.</p> <p>Unfavourable exit terms for universities could be rating negative, primarily due to lower research grants from EU funds. This would hinder the recruitment and retention of academic talent and could create difficulties in collaborating with EU countries on international research development. Press reports indicate that some UK institutions and academics have been asked to withdraw from applications for joint EU-funded research projects by their EU partners. This would reduce their appeal to more lucrative international students.</p> <p>UK Universities could also lose access to EU regional development, structural and cohesion funds to build new infrastructure. Modernization and expansion to attract overseas students is one reason sector debt has increased, reaching 26% of income in FY14.</p> <p>Reductions in EU funding could be mitigated by savings on contributions for EU funding from the UK government. However, EU funding has significantly risen in the last five years to 15% or more of UK universities\u2019 total revenue, while Britain\u2019s own national research budget is below international averages and is facing existing pressure.</p> </blockquote> <p>On the health service - <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/26/eu-referendum-brexit-vote-leave-iain-duncan-smith-nhs\"><strong>a contentious issue during the referendum campaign of course</strong></a> - Fitch says:</p> <blockquote> <p>For the NHS, staffing is a key Brexit-related issue: 55,000 of the NHS\u2019s 1.3 million workforce and 80,000 of the 1.3 million workers in adult social care come from the EU. The NHS is struggling to recruit enough staff, with a shortage of about 50,000 staff. The ability of providers and social care services to recruit EU staff will be crucial for Trusts and FTs to maintain patient care income from NHS Commissioners.</p> <p>The UK has been able to develop its medical research through collaboration across the EU in the same way that higher education has benefitted from access to European talent and funding. Between 2007 and 2013, the UK contributed GBP5.4bn to EU R&amp;D, while it received GBP8.8bn from the EU for R&amp;D and innovation. As it is unlikely that NHS Trusts and FTs would be able to cover the shortfall if EU funds were no longer available, funds spent on R&amp;D would probably be significantly reduced.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-578e3018e4b0ec4df2a16fa1\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-07-19T13:59:02.858Z\">2.59pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The IMF is not forecasting a recession for the UK following Brexit although it is still a possibility.

                "bodyText":"And here\u2019s another view on the IMF\u2019s latest pronouncements, from Capital Economics. The research company\u2019s Michael Pearce said: After spending the run-up to the UK\u2019s EU referendum warning that Brexit would cause \u201csevere regional and global damage\u201d, the IMF all but admitted on Tuesday that it had been bluffing, forecasting that the impact would be largely benign after all. The IMF downgraded its forecasts for global growth this year and next by just 0.1 percentage point, to 3.1% and 3.4% respectively. The biggest downward revision was of course to the UK, which the Fund now expects to grow by just 1.3% in 2017, almost a percentage point slower than its previous forecast. But even this is not as bad as the recession many commentators had warned of. Meanwhile, the IMF nudged down its forecast for growth in the euro-zone next year by 0.2 percentage points, while the forecast for economies further afield was \u201clittle affected\u201d by the Brexit vote. So much for the IMF\u2019s claim that there would be \u201csevere damage.\u201d Admittedly, the Fund did warn of a more disorderly outcome from Brexit, providing two alternative scenarios in which global growth stalls or slows further. However IMF Chief Economist, Maurice Obstfeld, acknowledged that these would require the impact on global trade to be \u201cgreater than [the IMF] thinks likely\u201d while financial conditions would need to deteriorate far more than they had done so far... Instead of Brexit, prospects for the world economy will be shaped far more by the outlook for China and the US. Recent data suggest that growth in both economies is holding up fairly well. And on that note, it\u2019s time to close for the day. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. Deutsche Bank has had its credit rating cut from stable to negative by S&amp;P Global Ratings. It said: The outlook revision reflects our view that the unfavorable operating environment poses particular challenges to Deutsche Bank as it implements its 2016-2020 strategic plan. Although market conditions may recover somewhat from the weak first quarter of 2016, ultra-low interest rates and generally subdued client trading activity may persist for the foreseeable future. These pressures affect the entire sector but we believe they are particularly unhelpful for Deutsche Bank as it seeks to strengthen capital and maintain its franchise while fundamentally restructuring its business model and balance sheet... The U.K.\u2019s recent vote to leave the EU (Brexit) is a consideration in the outlook revision, but not a prominent one. We consider that Deutsche Bank should not be materially affected if the U.K. were to lose access to the EU financial services passporting arrangement, although it may need to relocate some activities from its large London branch. We assume Deutsche Bank\u2019s trading revenues received a boost from Brexit-related market volatility but, in the longer term, we see Brexit as a factor that may prolong the current period of ultra-low global interest rates and depressed business volumes. An uncertain day saw markets struggle for direction, but recover from their their worst levels. Global worries continued, with a further clampdown in Turkey in the wake of the recent coup attempt sending the lira tumbling, and concerns about the recent spate of terror attacks adding to the downbeat mood. On the economic front, UK inflation came in higher than expected, but after an initial move higher for the pound, investors decided that the Bank of England was still likely to plump for a rate cut in August despite the new data. German investor confidence fell sharply, hitting the Dax and other European markets, but strong US housing starts prompted further talk of a US rate hike and gave further support to the dollar. In turn the gains in the US currency put pressure on commodity prices including oil. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished up virtually unchanged, up just 0.03% or 1.95 points at 6697.37 Germany\u2019s Dax dropped 0.81% to 9981.24 France\u2019s Cac closed down 0.63% at 4330.13 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB fell 0.53% to 16,673.77 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended down 0.46% to 8485.2 But Portugal\u2019s PSI20 put on 0.35% to 4591.93 And in Greece, the Athens market added 1.53% to 563.75 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 20 points or 0.11%. Tony Cross, market analyst at Trustnet Direct, said: The FTSE-100 is continuing to toy with that 6,700 level but to be almost 4 weeks on from the shock of that Brexit vote and have the index seemingly in such good health \u2013 admittedly it\u2019s flattered by a weak pound too \u2013 is certainly something worth noting. The Turkish lira has tumbled as the government continues to take action in the wake of the failed coup. Jasper Lawler, market analyst at CMC Markets, said: The Turkish lira has dropped sharply as the government continues to purge vast swathes of the establishment, risking a level of destabilisation that could seriously derail economic growth. The Turkey Education Ministry reportedly suspended 15,200 staff whilst 1,577 university deans have been asked to resign. Here\u2019s the UK Treasury response to the IMF world economic outlook: Brexit is negative for the UK\u2019s higher education sector and NHS Trusts and Foundation Trusts, according to ratings agency Fitch, due to the likely impact on staff and research funding. In a new report the agency says: As we have stated previously, the full impact of Brexit, and any potential ratings impact, will depend on the exit terms negotiated, which remain uncertain. For the higher education sector, a favourable exit deal would limit the reduction in research grants from EU funds. Even so, restrictions on free movement could reduce projected student demand and increase pressure on universities\u2019 revenues. The impact may be greater on English than on Scottish universities due to their different tuition fee arrangements for non-UK EU students, although we do not currently rate any Scottish universities. Unfavourable exit terms for universities could be rating negative, primarily due to lower research grants from EU funds. This would hinder the recruitment and retention of academic talent and could create difficulties in collaborating with EU countries on international research development. Press reports indicate that some UK institutions and academics have been asked to withdraw from applications for joint EU-funded research projects by their EU partners. This would reduce their appeal to more lucrative international students. UK Universities could also lose access to EU regional development, structural and cohesion funds to build new infrastructure. Modernization and expansion to attract overseas students is one reason sector debt has increased, reaching 26% of income in FY14. Reductions in EU funding could be mitigated by savings on contributions for EU funding from the UK government. However, EU funding has significantly risen in the last five years to 15% or more of UK universities\u2019 total revenue, while Britain\u2019s own national research budget is below international averages and is facing existing pressure. On the health service - a contentious issue during the referendum campaign of course - Fitch says: For the NHS, staffing is a key Brexit-related issue: 55,000 of the NHS\u2019s 1.3 million workforce and 80,000 of the 1.3 million workers in adult social care come from the EU. The NHS is struggling to recruit enough staff, with a shortage of about 50,000 staff. The ability of providers and social care services to recruit EU staff will be crucial for Trusts and FTs to maintain patient care income from NHS Commissioners. The UK has been able to develop its medical research through collaboration across the EU in the same way that higher education has benefitted from access to European talent and funding. Between 2007 and 2013, the UK contributed GBP5.4bn to EU R&amp;D, while it received GBP8.8bn from the EU for R&amp;D and innovation. As it is unlikely that NHS Trusts and FTs would be able to cover the shortfall if EU funds were no longer available, funds spent on R&amp;D would probably be significantly reduced. The IMF is not forecasting a recession for the UK following Brexit although it is still a possibility. Earlier the European Commission issued its own forecasts, and suggested Britain\u2019s economy could indeed fall into recession next year. Reuters reports: Britain\u2019s economy may slip into recession next year following the vote to quit the European Union, the European Commission estimated on Tuesday in its first assessment of the economic impact of Brexit. Last week the commissioner for economic affairs, Pierre Moscovici, said the cumulative negative impact for British gross domestic product (GDP) would be between about 1 percent and 2.5 percent by 2017. Estimates prepared by the EU executive staff and released on Tuesday give more precise figures than those provided by Moscovici and add a breakdown for this and next year. Britain is expected to endure a \u201csubstantial slowdown\u201d which will limit its economic growth to between 1.3 and 1.6 percent this year, lower than earlier estimates of a 1.8 percent growth. The European Commission\u2019s simulations project a much worse situation for next year, when Britain may experience a 0.3 percent contraction in the worst scenario. In the most optimistic scenario Britain\u2019s gross domestic product would grow 1.1 percent in 2017, still much less than the previously forecast 1.9 percent rise. Back with the IMF and asked about Japan, Maury Obstfeld says there has been currency volatility but he would not characterise conditions as \u201cdisorderly.\u201d Japanese growth and the 2% inflation target face challenges, he says, but he does not view currency intervention as a necessary or useful policy. US markets are marginally lower in early trading despite oil price weakness and disappointing results overnight from Netflix. But positive earnings statements from Goldman Sachs and Johnson &amp; Johnson have helped limit the damage. So the Dow Jones Industrial Average is down just 2 points, helping other markets come off their worst levels. Indeed, the FTSE 100 is now up on the day, albeit only by 13 points while Germany and France have recovered some ground although both are still down around 0.8%. On Turkey, Maury Obstfeld says the IMF is monitoring the potential economic fallout of the failed coup attempt. We have seen some market volatility but we would anticipate that things will settle down. Turning to the G20, he says monetary policy has been bearing to much of the burden for growth and that more structural reforms are required. Obstfeld says uncertainty surrounding Brexit is particularly acute, partly because it is unclear what trade agreements the UK will be able to secure outside the EU. Naturally the greatest effects of Brexit will be felt in the UK. The real effects of Brexit will play out over a number of months, giving an added layer of uncertainty. He says the move by central banks to make additional liquidity available has helped to limit negative market reaction to the Brexit vote. There are other risks to the global economy, Obstfeld says, including geopolitical risks and high long-term unemployment. Policymakers should not accept low growth rates as the new normal. A slow growth environment will increase social tensions. Obstfeld is saying that politicians in particular must make it their mission to dispel the idea that all ills stem from the globalisation of markets. Maury Obstfeld, the IMF\u2019s chief economist, is giving a press conference. You can watch it here. Here is our full story on the IMF\u2019s downgrades: The dollar has risen to a four-month high against a basket of currencies following figures that showed a bigger-than-expected rise in housing starts. Housing starts at an annual rate of 1.19 million new homes in the year ending in June, up 4.8% according to the Commerce Department. The dollar index, which tracks the US currency agains six major currencies, rose to 97.125, its highest level since mid March. Breaking: The International Monetary Fund has sharply lowered its forecasts for UK growth and says Britain\u2019s decision to leave the EU has \u201cthrown a spanner in the works\u201d. The Washington-based fund cut its forecast for UK growth in 2017 to 1.3% from an earlier forecast of 2.2% as the impact of the vote is felt. UK growth this year is expected to be 1.7%, 0.2 points lower than the IMF\u2019s previous forecast. Global growth is forecast to rise by 3.1% this year and 3.4% in 2017, a 0.1 point cut for both years. According to Maury Obstfeld, IMF chief economist: Brexit has thrown a spanner in the works. The report adds: The Brexit vote implies a substantial increase in economic, political, and institutional uncertainty, which is projected to have negative macroeconomic consequences, especially in advanced European economies. The IMF says the UK and Europe will be worst hit by the Brexit fallout, but the effects will be felt around the world. Had it not been for Brexit, the IMF was prepared to leave its outlook for this year broadly unchanged as better-than-expected euro-area performance offset disappointing US first-quarter growth. The IMF also had been prepared to raise its outlook for 2017 slightly, by 0.1 percentage point, on the back of improved performance in a few big emerging markets, in particular Brazil and Russia. The European Commission has fined Daimler, Volvo/Renault and two other truck makers a record \u20ac2.93bn (\u00a32.5bn) for colluding on prices and passing the costs of emissions rules on to customers. Full story here: IG\u2019s opening calls for Wall Street: The IMF\u2019s update on the world economic outlook is coming up at 2pm UK time. UK house prices increased 1.1% between April and May, the ONS reported earlier, with the average price of a home rising to \u00a3211,000. Over the year they rose by 16,000 or 8.1% - the same rate of annual growth as April. The biggest increases were in London and the south east. Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, says strong growth in house prices is \u201cunlikely to persist\u201d following the Brexit vote, predicting a 3% drop over the next year. Indicators of demand at the beginning of the home purchase process weakened sharply during the second quarter and have plunged since referendum. Meanwhile, mortgage rates are likely to edge up soon as banks price in higher default risk and pass on recent increases in their funding costs. Prices in London and the South East, up 13.6% and 12.9% year-over-year respectively in May, look particularly vulnerable, because the outlook for employment in the financial services sector has darkened and banks will think twice about high loan-to-income lending. As a result, we think that house prices are set to fall by about 3% from current levels over the next year. The new chancellor Philip Hammond says any immediate response to the surprise Brexit vote should come from the Bank of England. Taking his first Treasury questions as chancellor, Hammond said he would unveil fiscal plans to deal with a possible slowdown in the autumn. The initial response to this kind of shock must be a monetary response delivered by the Bank of England. And the governor, announcing that interest rates were not to be lowered last week, did make it clear that the Bank is developing a monetary package that it will announce in due course. The Bank of England is still expected to cut interest rates in August, despite the stronger-than-expected rise in inflation in June. The Bank\u2019s Monetary Policy Committee surprised the City last week when it left rates on hold at 0.5% and announced no other measures to stimulate the economy in the post referendum world. Governor Mark Carney has been explicit that he expects loosening of policy over the summer, and economists have shifted their expectation to a move in August. Jennifer McKeown, senior European economist at Capital Economics, says the weak ZEW survey in Germany signals there is more concern about the fallout from Brexit than markets suggest. July\u2019s German ZEW Survey, which was conducted over the past two weeks, suggests that investors are more worried about the effects of Brexit on the German economy than the financial market response has so far implied. The Economic Sentiment Indicator [on the ZEW] is now at its lowest level since November 2012 when Germany was in recession. And the fact that it is below zero means that most investors expect economic conditions to deteriorate over the next six months. On the basis of its past loose relationship with GDP growth, the ESI looks consistent with falls in GDP. Britain should be prepared for higher inflation in the coming months following its vote to leave the EU, economists are warning. The Bank of England\u2019s target for inflation is 2%, so we\u2019re still a way off that but perhaps not for much longer given the fall in the pound since the Brexit vote should increase import prices. Ben Brettell at Hargreaves Lansdown describes the rise in inflation to 0.5% in June as \u201cthe calm before the storm\u201d. Sterling\u2019s weakness means higher import prices, and this is expected to feed through to significantly higher inflation figures in the coming months. Forecasts suggest it could reach 3-4%. However, this will be a temporary factor: assuming sterling remains weak, the effect will fall out of the year-on-year calculation in the second half of next year. Brettell says that as a result, Bank of England policymakers are likely to discount a short-term spike in inflation. Underlying inflationary pressure is hard to see, with Brexit-related economic uncertainty likely to dampen both consumer spending and wage growth in the short term. As such the Bank of England is almost certain to ignore what should be a temporary spike in inflation when it sets monetary policy. The weak German ZEW survey will add to investor jitters. Market falls have accelerated since early trading: FTSE 100: -0.5% at 6,662 FTSE 250: -0.4% at 16,803 Euro Stoxx 600: -0.9% at 336 Gemany\u2019s DAX: -1.3% at 9,936 French CAC: -1.1% at 4,312 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB: -1.8% at 16,456 Spanish IBEX: -0.7% at 8,466 Andrew Bailey has told the public meeting of the Financial Conduct Authority that access to the single market post-Brexit is important. Speaking in his new role as chief executive of the regulator, Bailey told the members of the public assembled in the Queen Elizabeth Conference Centre in London that the regulator was also keen for trade arrangements with other countries too. At the same time, he told the meeting that the current rules had to remain in place - including the bonus cap - and that Brexit did not \u201clead to a bonfire of regulation\u201d. He said: \u201cI welcome the chancellor\u2019s statement that the UK will seek access to the single market through the coming negotiations. We will support the government\u2019s work to put in place new arrangements, and I would include in that, alongside access to the single market, seeking to have in place agreements with other countries. From an FCA perspective, there is, for instance, no doubt that our objective of ensuring healthy competition in UK financial markets is supported by cross-border trade in these financial services\u201d. Confidence among German investors and analysts fell sharply in July as a result of the uncertainty created by Britain\u2019s decision to leave the EU. The result of the 23 June referendum sent shockwaves across Europe and hit confidence in the region\u2019s largest economy more than expected. Economic sentiment on Germany\u2019s closely watched ZEW index fell to -6.8 in July, from 19.2 in June. Economists polled by Reuters were predicting a smaller fall to 9. The current conditions measure of the ZEW also fell more than expected, to 49.8 in July from 54.5 in May. Florian Hense, economist at German bank Berenberg, said the Brexit vote had taken the ZEW back down to euro crisis levels. The data comes two days before the ECB\u2019s governing council makes its latest policy decision. Hense: While monthly data are volatile, this reading will be valuable for policymakers in Frankfurt. It is the first reading for the eurozone\u2019s economy since June 23. The first reading of the economy is somewhat in contrast to market developments. When the ECB\u2019s governing council convenes on Thursday for its monetary policy meeting, they will acknowledge that market moves so far have been relatively orderly and sovereign bond yields, particularly in the Eurozone periphery, signal limited contagion risk. But today\u2019s soft data will be some cause for concern, supporting our view that Draghi\u2019s press conference will take a dovish tone. Here is our full story on this morning\u2019s inflation data, from the Guardian\u2019s economics editor, Larry Elliott: Fans of Pokemon Go get carried away in Australia: In corporate news, the market value of Nintendo has more than doubled since the release of its Pokemon Go game earlier this month. The Japanese company now has a 4.5tn yen (\u00a332bn) market capitalisation, with investors rushing to buy the shares following the huge success of the game. The ONS says Euro 2016 was probably behind the 10.9% spike in air fares in June. Phil Gooding, ONS statistician: The rising cost of European air flights, possibly boosted by the Euro football championships, was the biggest reason for this month\u2019s increase in inflation. The growing cost of oil, feeding through to petrol prices, also helped nudge up CPI. Today\u2019s figures were collected before the EU referendum, so recent falls in the value of the pound will have had no impact on them. The rise in annual inflation to 0.5% in June was driven largely by higher air fares and petrol prices, as well as games and toys. The last time inflation was higher than 0.5% was November 2014, when it was 1%. A 10.9% increase in air fares was the biggest May to June rise on record. Prices increased on European routes in particular. Petrol and diesel prices rose by 2.3p and 2.6pm per litre. Prices in the recreation and culture category increased by 0.6%, with toys and games, particularly computer games, driving the rise. Breaking: UK annual inflation increased to 0.5% in June from 0.3% in May. That was a bigger than expected rise, with economists predicting 0.4%. Government borrowing will be \u00a320bn higher this year than the \u00a355bn forecast in the March budget, according to a forecast by RBC Capital Markets. Sam Hill, economist at RBC, said comments made by Philip Hammond, the new chancellor, suggested he was in favour of fiscal loosening to support investment. The new Chancellor\u2019s early comments point towards fiscal policy loosening focused towards investment. This would fit well with a return to the more conventional fiscal rule adopted in the early days of the Cameron/Osborne era. The pound is down this morning before the latest UK inflation data at 9.30am. It has dipped below $1.32, falling 0.6% against the dollar to $1.3175. Sterling is also down 0.4% against the euro, at \u20ac1.1914. Any impact of comments made by Martin Weale - a member of the Bank of England\u2019s Monetary Policy Committee \u2013 on Monday appear to have faded. Weale suggested a cut in UK interest rates in August was not a foregone conclusion. One of nine MPC members, Weale\u2019s voting record suggests he is traditionally more in favour of raising rates than the majority of other members. Markets have opened down this morning, as geopolitical tensions create uncertainty. The FTSE 100 is off 20 points or 0.3% at 6,677, while the FTSE 250 is down 0.2% at 16,836. All major European indices are down, apart from the Spanish IBEX which is roughly flat. UK inflation data is expected to show a pick up in the annual rate in June. Economists polled by Reuters are expecting to see the headline rate increase to 0.4% from 0.3% in May, partly because of an increase in petrol prices between the two months. The data was collected by the Office for National Statistics before the 23 June EU referendum. As a result, the fall in the value of the pound since the vote will not have fed through to the official inflation data as yet. As Victoria Clarke, economist at Investec, explains: In light of the UK\u2019s vote to leave the EU all pre-referendum releases including this one look particularly historic and the question now is over the extent to which the slump in the pound supports a faster recovery of inflation to target, despite some likely further drag from a weaker domestic demand picture. Our central view is that inflation will head north quite rapidly for a time, but that this sterling boost will be a temporary phenomenon. The ONS will also publish its house price index for May at 9.30am. In Germany, the closely watched ZEW survey for July will provide insight into whether the Brexit vote has dampened confidence in Europe\u2019s largest economy. Later in the US, housing starts data for June will be an indicator of how the property market is performing and its wider implications for the economy. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. All eyes will be on the IMF today as it provides its latest update on the global economy. The Washington-based Fund, headed by Christine Lagarde, is expected to downgrade its previous prediction that the global economy will grow by 3.5% in 2017. It is also expected to cut its 2017 UK growth forecast from its previous prediction of 2.2%. Lagarde was a vocal opponent of Brexit in the run-up to the 23 June referendum, warning the UK of a possible housing and stock market crash. It is likely that the IMF will say in today\u2019s report the vote to leave the EU has increased uncertainty for the global outlook. The update will be published at 2pm UK time.",

                "bodyText":"Africa\u2019s digital transformation would be nothing without the tens of thousands of people who have invested, and continue to invest, energy into propelling it forward. They are the leading lights driving change in infrastructure, mobile connectivity, online activism, e-commerce and financial services. Some are opening up digital cultural spaces or working to bring in investment for tech startups. As part of the Guardian\u2019s focus on technology in Africa we\u2019ve listed 10 individuals who\u2019ve been pioneers in the transformation from Tanzania to Tunisia, with the three of sub-Saharan Africa\u2019s big tech hitters \u2013 South Africa, Nigeria and Kenya \u2013 particularly well represented. And in a bid to look forward we asked each of the 10 pioneers to predict the next development in Africa\u2019s digital transformation and to each nominate an emerging talent to watch. Jason Njoku, Nigeria: \u2018We\u2019ve got everything to play for, but it won\u2019t be easy\u2019 The British-Nigerian entrepreneur founded iROKOtv which hosts the most extensive online catalogue of Nollywood content in the world. Nicknamed the Netflix of Africa, iROKOtv is one of the continent\u2019s biggest internet TV providers and has raised over $35m in international investment. He says Africa\u2019s digital transformation is ahead of us. By my calculations, we haven\u2019t even really started, we\u2019re still building, we\u2019re still scaling. Everything is to play for \u2013 the majority of Africa\u2019s potential digital population aren\u2019t properly online yet, but it\u2019s not going to be an easy ride. We need homegrown investors to get behind the tech sector and understand the opportunities that are under our noses. He nominates Fikayo Ogundipe, co-founder of ToLet.com.ng which has completely reshaped Nigeria\u2019s property market, starting with Lagos. Buying, selling and renting houses in the city isn\u2019t for the faint-hearted but Fikayo and his team have painstakingly researched the market, pouring their findings into a website to help consumers navigate the process. But Fikayo is not building the Foxtons of Nigeria, he\u2019s building a Nigerian company for Nigerians, that tackles the problems encountered by Nigerians in the Nigerian property market. Lina Ben Mhenni, Tunisia: \u2018Digital action must be combined with real world action\u2019 Author of the blog A Tunisian Girl, Lina Ben Mhenni rose to prominence during the Tunisian revolution in 2011, as she documented the Tunisian uprising and violence at the hands of the security forces. Mhenni was one of the few Tunisian cyber activists who blogged under her real name while President Zine Ben Ali was still in office. Her blog was turned into a book and she was later a favourite for the Nobel peace prize. She says After Ben Ali fled Tunisia, people all around the world focused on the role of the internet in his departure. Some talked about a Facebook or internet revolution. But this ignored the sacrifices of the people who took to the streets and demonstrated, often against live fire. No one can deny the importance of the internet and social networks \u2013 when a regime imposes a media blackout, they can be used to both inform and mobilise people. But some have overestimated its role. Action in the digital world must be combined with actions in the real world. She nominates Rahma Sghaier a young leader who is using ICT to bring change to Tunisia, Rahma blogs on the YaLa platform, commenting on politics and advocating for international peace. Her main mission is to support young Tunisians to write, create photo essays and videos and explore their talents. She also promotes citizen journalism through blogging and vlogging and wants to train young girls in how to make videos. Ory Okolloh, Kenya: \u2018We\u2019ve reached the important stage of African-led technology that\u2019s not over-hyped\u2019 Ory Okolloh is an activist, lawyer, blogger and technology commentator. She helped to create Ushahidi, and mapping platform that crowd-sourced incidents of violence after Kenya\u2019s disputed 2007 election. The site has since been used to map crisis everywhere from Haiti to Gaza. Okolloh was previously Google\u2019s policy manager for Africa and now works with the Omidyar Network. In 2014 she was featured in Time magazine\u2019s top 100 list of the world\u2019s most influential people. She says What\u2019s next? To borrow a phrase from founders of mobile money providers Paystack we must \u201cdo the difficult things differently\u201d. We are maturing from the \u201clook how amazing Africans can code\u201d to a phase of solid African-built-and-led technology: companies tackling real problems or without much hype. This is an important stage because it\u2019s how we get to a sustainable digital Africa. She nominates Billikiss Adebiyi-Abiola, co-founder of recycling company Wecyclers. Why? I\u2019ve long spoken against the tendency to embrace tech as a solution to the myriad of problems facing Africa as an end in itself, rather than a means to an end. Bilikiss turns this on its head. At the heart of her work is solving a problem that previously seemed intractable: creating livelihoods and leveraging technology to improve how we live in our cities. She\u2019s also a fantastic entrepreneur. *Okolloh is commenting in a personal capacity Nii Quaynor, Ghana: \u2018The internet improved development by making communication more efficient\u2019 The computer scientist and engineer is a pioneer of internet development and expansion on the continent. He was the first African to be elected to the board of the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN), the global non-profit body that coordinates databases across the internet and is often referred to as the \u201cfather of the internet in Africa\u201d. He says The internet has already improved development by making communication more efficient in Africa, but the next steps are to look at how we improve digital currency transactions like Bitcoin. Citizens currently rely on companies to act as the go-between when transferring money, but when they are able to transfer money directly between peers then development will be further improved. He nominates Ashifi Gogo, the CEO and founder of Sproxil, a company that uses mobile phones to fight counterfeiting in developing country markets. The product allows consumers to check if their products are genuine with a free text message. Gogo came up with the idea after witnessing how damaging counterfeit medicines were for developing countries. Now, customers can check their pills in one simple step. The technology is also being used verify other products from cars to electrical goods. Mbwana Alliy, Tanzania: \u2018Drones are the next big thing for Africa\u2019 Mbwana Alliy is the founder and managing partner of Savannah Fund for tech startups in Africa, specialising in $25,000-$500,000 seed investments. As of this year, Alliy has invested in 22 companies across six African countries \u2013 Kenya, Uganda, South Africa, Zimbabwe Nigeria and Ghana \u2013 and has generated over 200 full-time jobs and raised more than $20m. He says Drones are the next big thing and the possibilities go way beyond delivery. Drones can help farmers understand their land better, they can help with mapping, with construction and mining, even market research. They are becoming available to the masses with prices starting as low as $300. Drones may well bring the most exciting potential to marry the real and vast physical challenges of Africa with the digital revolution. He nominates South African telecommunications entrepreneur Alan Knott-Craig for all the work that he is doing to improve internet access through mobiles and public wifi. Anyone who is spreading affordable internet access \u2013 not under a corporate umbrella \u2013 deserves a lot of respect. Without air, you can\u2019t breathe and without reliable and affordable internet, we\u2019re doomed in Africa tech. Jepchumba, South Africa and Kenya: \u2018Our digital transformation will be seen through the content we create\u2019 A digital artist and founder of the African Digital Art project, that provides an online space to display the work of African artists using technology in their work, and a space for digital artists to connect. She recently received a Creative Disturbance Fellowship, and has been listed by Forbes as one of the 20 Youngest Power Women in Africa. She says With the explosion of mobile and access to new and faster devices, we have become an internet-consuming culture, hungry for digital content created in Africa. The next frontier will be the exploration of our stories and collective culture: stories that will help us explore political instability, immigration, security, racism, religion and spiritualism. Our digital transformation will be seen through the content we create. She nominates Tegan Bristow, a Johannesburg-based interactive media arts and lecturer at the Digital Arts Division of the Wits School of the Arts. A behind-the-scenes champion of African culture and technology. She was also involved in Africa\u2019s first digital innovation festival, Fak\u2019ugesi, in South Africa. A true pioneer in the development of digital art. Opeyemi Awoyemi, Ayodeji Adewunmi and Olalekan Olude, Nigeria: \u2018We\u2019ll see transformations to our lives in ways we cannot yet expect\u2019 The idea for Jobberman, sub-Saharan Africa\u2019s largest jobs site was conceived in the student dorm room of its cofounders, Opeyemi Awoyemi, Ayodeji Adewunmi and Olalekan Olude, in 2009. Seven years on and the site is now used by over 45,000 companies and is valued at millions of dollars. They say Africa will see transformations that touch the fundamental aspects of our lives in ways we cannot yet expect, or have not yet experienced, all made possible by the ubiquitous presence of the mobile phone on a continent with limited infrastructure. They nominate Solar electricity provider Txtlight, which wants to bring light to the 90 million Nigerians who currently live off grid. They provide home solar panels linked to indoor storage units and the Lumos service that provides a \u201cpay-as-you-go\u201d option , letting people purchase electricity by text message. Hilda Moraa, Kenya: \u2018Financial technology is set to grow and grow\u2019 Hilda Moraa is known for her work as the founder and CEO of Weza Tele Ltd. A Kenyan startup that offers supply chain, payroll and distribution solutions for businesses and a company that sold for over $1m in 2015. Moraa has since become a director at PesaZetu, a mobile lending marketplace. She says The financial technology space is set to grow and grow. Nearly 80% of adults in Africa do not have access to formal or semi-formal banking services \u2013 the majority of the continent is still unbanked. The failure of three Kenyan banks in the past year has made mobile money more attractive as the Uber effect forces the banks that remain to think about how their services work online. She nominates Wangechi Mwangi, CEO of Valuraha a company that is trying to foster a new generation of African investors. The company, which Mwangi founded as a student in Nairobi, runs investment clubs in schools where students learn about personal finance and practice investing in a virtual trading platform, a platform recently opened up to the public via a low-cost subscription. Last year she won the Global Social Impact Award at the Global Student Entrepreneur Awards. Mteto Nyati, South Africa: \u2018Entertainment-on-the-go is gaining traction\u2019 Mteto Nyati has been CEO of MTN South Africa, the country\u2019s second largest telecommunications provider, since July 2015. He previously worked at MTN South Africa\u2019s parent MTN Group, and at Microsoft and IBM. He says Africa has already demonstrated leadership in innovation in the mobile ecosystem. We have seen a surge in e-commerce and we expect this momentum to continue as affordable sub-$50 smartphones are introduced to the market. Entertainment-on-the-go is also gaining traction and customers now demand TV viewing that is not dictated by broadcasters, but by their viewing requirements. He nominates Founded in Cape Town in 2013, Hepstar are trying to transform the insurance market by making policies more freely available online. It assists its partners, including airlines and online travel agencies, to maximise revenue from the sales of insurance providing \u201cplug-and-play\u201d options for websites to help customers sign up quickly and efficiently. It\u2019s an industry worth billions. Funke Opeke, Nigeria: \u2018Submarine cables and satellites connect us, but mobile networks are congested\u2019 Funke Opeke is the CEO of MainOne, which was responsible for bringing broadband connectivity to Nigeria, and other west African countries, via a 7,000km undersea fibre optic cable from Portugal. The company now provides wholesale internet capacity to eight countries across the region. She says Submarine cables and satellites mean that Africa has more than adequate connectivity. Mobile penetration is high, 60%, of and more than 50% of those users have access to the internet. However the quality of the service is poor \u2013 limited infrastructure on the ground leads to congested mobile networks. For digital services to become pervasive citizens need affordable access to the internet and businesses need to provide continent-specific services that address low incomes and limitations on infrastructure. She nominates Iyinoluwa Aboyeji, co-founder of Andela, a global talent website that trains developers and connects them with employers. The company recruits the brightest on the continent and helps them grow into the next generation of global technology leaders. Over the past two years, the company has trained over 200 tech talents.",
