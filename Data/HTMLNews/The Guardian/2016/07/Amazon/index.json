                "body":"<p>You\u2019ve probably never heard of him, but incoming Asda boss Sean Clarke is said to be the man with his hand wavering over the red button, ready to trigger a supermarket price war to end all price wars.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jul/06/supermarket-shares-fall-asda-price-cut-warning\" title=\"\">Last week respected HSBC retail analyst David McCarthy put the cat among the pigeons</a> warning that Clarke, installed by his American paymasters Walmart, was gearing up for a summer price war that could \u201cwipe out\u201d rivals\u2019 profits. On publication the note, titled Defcon 1, managed to wipe \u00a31.6bn from the stock market value of listed rivals Tesco, Sainsbury\u2019s and Morrisons in a single day\u2019s trading.</p> <p>Clarke, who started his retail career at Asda in 1996, is an unknown quantity albeit with a global supermarket pedigree. He has worked for Walmart for 20 years, serving tours in Japan, Germany, Canada and latterly Walmart China and is being parachuted in to end a long period of underperformance at the retailer\u2019s UK business. His surprise appointment deposed another Clarke (Andy), who had been in charge since 2010 \u2013 a gruelling period characterised by the rise of discounters Aldi and Lidl, unprecedented price deflation and changing shopping habits.</p> <p>While its publicly listed rivals have spent the last two years cutting prices (and profit margins) to win back shoppers, Asda has focused on defending its profitability rather than market share with an efficiency drive that has seen it fall behind rivals in both the quality and availability of its food. Customers have punished Asda for taking this stance, with the retailer nursing a fall in underlying sales that is approaching its second anniversary. It is now the UK\u2019s third-largest grocer after surrendering second place to Sainsbury\u2019s, a swap once considered inconceivable.</p> <p>The changing of the Clarkes, which officially takes place tomorrow, came soon after Walmart International chief David Cheesewright told the Walmart annual investor jamboree in Bentonville, Arkansas that it was \u201cvery disappointed\u201d with Asda and it was time to change tack and switch from \u201cprotecting profit to protecting share\u201d.</p> <p>Does that mean a price war? In McCarthy\u2019s note he suggests: \u201cIf Asda decided to invest half its margin into price, a competitor reaction could wipe out almost all industry profitability and would force an industry restructure.\u201d</p> <p>But why would he do that? It would hurt Asda too. Other experts point out that Asda offers the lowest prices of the \u201cbig four\u201d supermarket chains anyway. Bryan Roberts, analyst at TCC Global points out: \u201cAsda\u2019s been the cheapest for 15 years and it\u2019s obviously not working. Why would being even cheaper work more effectively? It\u2019s not about getting cheaper, it\u2019s about getting people to re-evaluate and revisit Asda.\u201d</p> <p>To win shoppers in China, Clarke (Sean) has had to do more than play the price card as their choice of supermarket is also influenced by concerns such as food quality and freshness. \u201cHe has experience of using messages other than price to drive sales,\u201d says Roberts.</p> <p>Talk of a more intense groceryprice war comes as food retailers gird themselves for the fallout from the Brexit vote. The collapse in the value of the pound is bad news for a country that imports 40% of its food and retailers will have to walk the tightrope of taking a hit on profits by absorbing price rises themselves, or passing cost increases on to price-sensitive shoppers.</p> <p>As if that were not enough for supermarket bosses to wring their hands over, another City broker waded in last week in to argue that Tesco\u2019s shares, currently at 163p, are only really worth 80p because there are too many UK grocery stores as Aldi and Lidl expand and the online crew, Ocado and Amazon Fresh, take share. Up to a third of supermarkets need to close to make the industry more profitable, is the message from analysts at Redburn.</p> <p>It\u2019s not just price that makes us shop where we shop and Asda needs to broaden its appeal beyond \u201cbusy mums on a budget\u201d. Two-thirds of shoppers now frequent the discounters, yet many Britons still turn their noses up at Asda. It has an image problem, not a price problem, it needs to address. For Clarke (Sean) to choose the nuclear price option looks like the road to mutually assured destruction.</p> <h2>It\u2019s grim down south</h2> <p>The unfortunate commuters of south London and Sussex can from tomorrow plan their lives on a surer basis, according to Southern. The solution, though, involves \u201cpre-cancelling\u201d 341 trains a day and consigning coastal residents to the bus.</p> <p>These are desperate times on Southern, a once unremarkable train service whose extraordinary decline has sent its passengers \u2013 many priced out of London into the suburbs and beyond \u2013 into despair. The management, its reputation shredded, has sought to lay the blame on the unions, which brought industrial action over the role of conductors on new trains.</p> <p>But accusing staff of playing sick does not, unsurprisingly, appear to have won over employees. And the chaos had already been plain to see for commuters, who know that the strikes and staff shortages have only exacerbated deep-rooted problems: problems that include the revelation to MPs last week that Southern owner Govia Thameslink Railway (GTR) only found out how few staff it had when it took over the franchise.</p> <p>Yet GTR has one supporter: the Department for Transport (DfT). The continuing defence by ministers, and refusal to countenance <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/jul/04/calls-strip-southern-rail-operator-franchise-govia-thameslink\" title=\"\">appeals to strip the company of its franchise</a>, no matter how many performance measures it breaches, has fuelled union suspicion that GTR are simply doing the DfT\u2019s dirty work. Union opposition to driver-only operation of doors, a practice GTR is extending, is a stated safety concern, but underlined by the fear that job cuts will inevitably eventually follow.</p> <p>The government doubtless would like to cut staff costs, but the actual problem may run deeper than just money. The rail franchising system is creaking badly. Bidders have been far from plentiful in recent competitions. The totemic, lucrative East Coast franchise has not delivered the anticipated rewards back in private hands.</p> <p>Now, the newly combined Thameslink, Great Northern and Southern mega-franchise that Govia operates is starting to look just too big to manage. For rivals, taking it over might now look about as appealing as a daily commute to the capital from Brighton.</p> <h2>Putting up the warning signs</h2> <p>The commercial property market is an early-warning radar for the economy. If businesses start pulling out of rental deals to occupy office or shop space, that it is not a good sign for job creation.

                "bodyText":"You\u2019ve probably never heard of him, but incoming Asda boss Sean Clarke is said to be the man with his hand wavering over the red button, ready to trigger a supermarket price war to end all price wars. Last week respected HSBC retail analyst David McCarthy put the cat among the pigeons warning that Clarke, installed by his American paymasters Walmart, was gearing up for a summer price war that could \u201cwipe out\u201d rivals\u2019 profits. On publication the note, titled Defcon 1, managed to wipe \u00a31.6bn from the stock market value of listed rivals Tesco, Sainsbury\u2019s and Morrisons in a single day\u2019s trading. Clarke, who started his retail career at Asda in 1996, is an unknown quantity albeit with a global supermarket pedigree. He has worked for Walmart for 20 years, serving tours in Japan, Germany, Canada and latterly Walmart China and is being parachuted in to end a long period of underperformance at the retailer\u2019s UK business. His surprise appointment deposed another Clarke (Andy), who had been in charge since 2010 \u2013 a gruelling period characterised by the rise of discounters Aldi and Lidl, unprecedented price deflation and changing shopping habits. While its publicly listed rivals have spent the last two years cutting prices (and profit margins) to win back shoppers, Asda has focused on defending its profitability rather than market share with an efficiency drive that has seen it fall behind rivals in both the quality and availability of its food. Customers have punished Asda for taking this stance, with the retailer nursing a fall in underlying sales that is approaching its second anniversary. It is now the UK\u2019s third-largest grocer after surrendering second place to Sainsbury\u2019s, a swap once considered inconceivable. The changing of the Clarkes, which officially takes place tomorrow, came soon after Walmart International chief David Cheesewright told the Walmart annual investor jamboree in Bentonville, Arkansas that it was \u201cvery disappointed\u201d with Asda and it was time to change tack and switch from \u201cprotecting profit to protecting share\u201d. Does that mean a price war? In McCarthy\u2019s note he suggests: \u201cIf Asda decided to invest half its margin into price, a competitor reaction could wipe out almost all industry profitability and would force an industry restructure.\u201d But why would he do that? It would hurt Asda too. Other experts point out that Asda offers the lowest prices of the \u201cbig four\u201d supermarket chains anyway. Bryan Roberts, analyst at TCC Global points out: \u201cAsda\u2019s been the cheapest for 15 years and it\u2019s obviously not working. Why would being even cheaper work more effectively? It\u2019s not about getting cheaper, it\u2019s about getting people to re-evaluate and revisit Asda.\u201d To win shoppers in China, Clarke (Sean) has had to do more than play the price card as their choice of supermarket is also influenced by concerns such as food quality and freshness. \u201cHe has experience of using messages other than price to drive sales,\u201d says Roberts. Talk of a more intense groceryprice war comes as food retailers gird themselves for the fallout from the Brexit vote. The collapse in the value of the pound is bad news for a country that imports 40% of its food and retailers will have to walk the tightrope of taking a hit on profits by absorbing price rises themselves, or passing cost increases on to price-sensitive shoppers. As if that were not enough for supermarket bosses to wring their hands over, another City broker waded in last week in to argue that Tesco\u2019s shares, currently at 163p, are only really worth 80p because there are too many UK grocery stores as Aldi and Lidl expand and the online crew, Ocado and Amazon Fresh, take share. Up to a third of supermarkets need to close to make the industry more profitable, is the message from analysts at Redburn. It\u2019s not just price that makes us shop where we shop and Asda needs to broaden its appeal beyond \u201cbusy mums on a budget\u201d. Two-thirds of shoppers now frequent the discounters, yet many Britons still turn their noses up at Asda. It has an image problem, not a price problem, it needs to address. For Clarke (Sean) to choose the nuclear price option looks like the road to mutually assured destruction. It\u2019s grim down south The unfortunate commuters of south London and Sussex can from tomorrow plan their lives on a surer basis, according to Southern. The solution, though, involves \u201cpre-cancelling\u201d 341 trains a day and consigning coastal residents to the bus. These are desperate times on Southern, a once unremarkable train service whose extraordinary decline has sent its passengers \u2013 many priced out of London into the suburbs and beyond \u2013 into despair. The management, its reputation shredded, has sought to lay the blame on the unions, which brought industrial action over the role of conductors on new trains. But accusing staff of playing sick does not, unsurprisingly, appear to have won over employees. And the chaos had already been plain to see for commuters, who know that the strikes and staff shortages have only exacerbated deep-rooted problems: problems that include the revelation to MPs last week that Southern owner Govia Thameslink Railway (GTR) only found out how few staff it had when it took over the franchise. Yet GTR has one supporter: the Department for Transport (DfT). The continuing defence by ministers, and refusal to countenance appeals to strip the company of its franchise, no matter how many performance measures it breaches, has fuelled union suspicion that GTR are simply doing the DfT\u2019s dirty work. Union opposition to driver-only operation of doors, a practice GTR is extending, is a stated safety concern, but underlined by the fear that job cuts will inevitably eventually follow. The government doubtless would like to cut staff costs, but the actual problem may run deeper than just money. The rail franchising system is creaking badly. Bidders have been far from plentiful in recent competitions. The totemic, lucrative East Coast franchise has not delivered the anticipated rewards back in private hands. Now, the newly combined Thameslink, Great Northern and Southern mega-franchise that Govia operates is starting to look just too big to manage. For rivals, taking it over might now look about as appealing as a daily commute to the capital from Brighton. Putting up the warning signs The commercial property market is an early-warning radar for the economy. If businesses start pulling out of rental deals to occupy office or shop space, that it is not a good sign for job creation. If property firms pull out of deals to buy buildings or scrap plans for new developments, those are not good signs either. Last week saw a wave of property funds announce that they will stop investors withdrawing their money, which is another warning sign. The funds stopped redemptions because so many investors were looking to get their cash after the European Union referendum. This risks creating a vicious circle. As investors pull their money out of investment funds, those funds are forced to sell assets to hand back the cash, suppressing prices in the market and causing further uncertainty. The sharp fall in the value of sterling means that commercial property in the UK, particularly in London, is now cheaper for overseas investors. That could be the only thing that protects the sector \u2013 and maybe the economy \u2013 from a Brexit slump.",

There are those who want our exit from the EU to signal that we should now turn our back on the world, resist the free-market forces of globalization and become a more insular, less tolerant place. Similar forces are at work in other Western nations.</p> <p>We must not be afraid to confront them head-on.

                "bodyText":"That\u2019s all for tonight (although I might pop back and add some front pages later). Here\u2019s our latest news story about the markets: Goodnight and thanks for reading and commenting! GW And finally tonight.... America\u2019s stock market has hit a new alltime high, as global markets continue their relief rally. The S&amp;P 500 index closed 7 points higher, or 0.33%, at 2,136.95 points. That narrowly breaches the previous high set in May 2015. Jim Paulsen, chief investment strategist at Wells Capital Management, reckons that traders are feeling more optimistic about the global economy (after last Friday\u2019s decent US employment report). Paulsen says: \u201cYou have Brexit and global stagnation, but underneath that we keep getting really good economic numbers and that is forcing the (stock) market to new highs.\u201d The tantalising scent of fresh stimulus packages in Britain and Japan soon also worked its usual magic, of course. So, record highs on Wall Street. The London stock market back in bull market territory (thanks to the weak pound) and even Europe shaking off its Brexit fears. Not a bad day, but also not a reason to think the Brexit crisis is over. This chart of the FTSE 250 index of smaller UK companies this year shows how it has scrambled back from the Brexit shock last month (red for down, green for up): Ken Odeluga, market analyst at trading firm City Index, says companies most focused on the UK got the biggest boost today from Theresa May\u2019s rise to the top. We believe \u2018pure-play\u2019 UK equities have rallied on relief that the more pragmatic, less conspicuously ideological and more experienced candidate has emerged as Britain\u2019s next Prime Minster, ahead of difficult and multi-faceted discussions with a wounded and potentially vengeful EU. Investors were pleased to focus on political developments, rather than the Bank of England\u2019s promises to cushion the impact of Brexit. As Odeluga puts it: We note markets shrugged off revolving doors in the Conservative leadership contest and Labour\u2019s failure to open a trapdoor under its own chief. It has taken the withdrawal of the last right-leaning Eurosceptic standing, Andrea Leadsom, to raise an unmistakably positive reaction in the City. There\u2019s real anticipation in the City tonight about whether the Bank of England will cut interest rates to fresh record lows on Thursday. The BoE has already hinted that more stimulus will be needed this summer to help the economy. But given the inflationary impact of a weak pound, it may be reluctant to lower borrowing costs (and weaken sterling further). Kallum Pickering says the Bank could decide to leave its powder dry until August, when governor Mark Carney will present the new quarterly inflation report. He writes: We see a 60% chance that the nine member MPC votes to cut the bank rate, if so, probably by 25 basis points. However, there is a chance that the MPC holds for now, and instead opts to send a dovish signal that the bank will ease monetary policy three weeks later at the August Inflation Report when it is due to publish its revised economic forecasts. The pound is getting a late lift tonight, as Theresa May prepares to become Britain\u2019s next prime minister, on Wednesday afternoon. Sterling is hovering just below $1.30, up half a cent today. Chris Saint, senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown Currency Service, says: Markets will be hopeful that the prospect of Theresa May becoming Prime Minister will soon bring some clarity to the UK political landscape as well as a more conciliatory approach towards Europe. May has already insisted, though, that \u201cBrexit means Brexit\u201d, so she\u2019s not hinting at a referendum u-turn... European stock markets have also enjoyed a May-bounce. The STOXX Europe 600 .STOXX closed up 1.6% at 332.72, its highest close since June 23. However it is still 4% below its pre-referendum levels, due to concerns that Brexit will hurt the European economy. The news that Theresa May would replace David Cameron on Wednesday seemed to bring relief to European trading floors. Ankit Gheedia, equity and derivative strategist at BNP Paribas, reckoned that May was a safer pair of hands than Andrea Leadsom (who stepped down from the leadership race today) \u201cThe difference between Theresa May and her counterpart was that she has a disciplined approach and a proper strategy for Brexit. The alternative was uncertain. \u201cWe know she has experience, and is a bit more strategic, so the market is relieved on the back of that.\u201d (Thanks to Reuters for the quotes) Some late newsflashes from Brussels, where eurozone finance ministers have been meeting. Jeroen Dijsselbloem, head of the Eurogroup, says the Brexit vote is hurting eurozone confidence: And European commissioner Pierre Moscovici has revealed that the EC is dialling down its growth forecasts for the UK and the eurozone next year: The global rally in shares today has sent America\u2019s S&amp;P 500 index to a record high today: Fawad Razaqzada, market analyst at Forex.com, believes the S&amp;P 500 will keep climbing: So, the S&amp;P 500 is rallying to fresh unchartered territories today. Where do we go from here? Well, the monthly chart suggests onwards and upwards. America\u2019s tech index has hit its highest level of the year: The FTSE 100 burst into Bull Market territory moments before Theresa May was crowned as the new leader of the Conservative Party. May will become prime minister on Wednesday, and investors have welcomed this sudden outbreak of certainty in UK politics. Laith Khalaf, senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, says shares are also benefiting from expectations of an interest rate cut on Thursday. Here\u2019s his take: \u2018The Footsie has been tipped into a bull market by the emergence of Theresa May as Prime Minister, though the whiff of some loose monetary policy coming from the Bank of England this Thursday probably helped the index over the line too. The role played by the commodity behemoths should not be under-estimated either, these stocks are now trading at much higher prices than in the depths of the market in February. The Tories may be starting to get their house in order, but the stock market has hardly followed in the mould of the one-nation conservatism espoused by the party. There have been very divergent fortunes amongst the big blue chips, with some airlines, house builders and banks being left behind by the rest of the market. Here\u2019s the top risers and fallers on the FTSE 100 tonight: The FTSE 250 used to be the ugly duckling of the City, full of companies not big enough to make the Footsie 100. Now, though, it\u2019s blossomed into everyone\u2019s favourite stock market index (or so it feels, anyway). It\u2019s official! Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 index is back in bull market territory. The blue-chip index of the largest firms listed on the London stock market has just closed 92 points higher tonight, at 6682, a gain of 1.4% today. That means the Footsie has risen by over 20% since 11 February, when global investors were fretting about China\u2019s slowing economy tipping the world into recession. That was a simpler time, before Brexit became the word on everyone\u2019s lips and British politics entered a period of remarkable upheaval (which ain\u2019t over yet, judging by events in the Labour party today). Mining firm Anglo American is the biggest gainer, closing 8.5% higher, followed by building supply firm Travis Perkins (up 7.8%). However, this does not mean that Britain\u2019s economy is suddenly rosy. Remember... Most of the FTSE 100 constituents are international companies, so they\u2019re not a good gauge of the UK economy The weak pound drives up their earnings (as the dollars, yen and euros they collect as profits are worth more in sterling terms). The value of these firms has been hit hard by the 10% slump in the value of the pound. The smaller FTSE 250 is still below its pre-referendum levels (despite jumping by over 2% today). Two surveys today have shown that investor confidence has been hit very hard by the Brexit vote (see Moody\u2019s warning here....and also Hargreaves Lansdown\u2019s alarming survey here..). But still, investors will be relieved to see the index up, not down. Chris Beauchamp of IG explains that events in Westminster have boosted confidence in the City. UK politics continues to provide the most compelling TV viewing of the year so far, as Teresa May\u2019s last opponent abandons the field. The bounce in UK mid-caps is more than partly due to hopes that, with Remainer May as PM, talks with Europe may be smoother, while the disappearance of a summer leadership contest has helped clear road ahead for UK equities. Shares in many smaller UK companies are also strongly higher today. Michael Hewson of CMC Markets explains why: The FTSE250 has also enjoyed a decent bounce, up nearly 3% hitting its highest levels since its plunge from its 23rd June peaks. This removal of one element from the mix of political uncertainty is likely to bring into sharp relief the next stage of the \u201cBrexit\u201d process and in particular the timings of when Article 50 is likely to get triggered. However, the FTSE 250 index is still below its pre-referendum levels, unlike the FTSE 100 (which gets that weak pound boost) Here\u2019s another sign that the Brexit vote has hurt the European economy. A new survey by Moody\u2019s Analytics reports that: Global business confidence has slumped in the wake of the Brexit vote in late June. European sentiment continues to sink and is now consistent with an economy that is on the verge of stalling out. More than one-fourth of the survey responses by European businesses are negative, the highest that has been on a consistent basis since the European debt crisis. Encouragingly, sentiment in the United States and Pacific Rim haven\u2019t been materially impacted by British exit vote. Weak business confidence often leads to lower investment, and less new hiring, so it could be quite damaging.... City traders are pleased that at least some of the political uncertainty sitting over Britain like a heavy fog is lifting. Connor Campbell of Spreadex explains: Theresa May is clearly the market\u2019s preferred choice for Britain\u2019s top job, as evidenced by the reaction that greeted Leadsom\u2019s stand-down statement. May\u2019s lack of interest in rushing to activate Article 50 and her relatively less contentious relationship with the EU when compared to her (now long gone) rivals, as well as the general cheer at the mere fact of the UK once again having a PM, is arguably responsible for the rise from the FTSE and pound, both of which improved on their morning performances. The former jumped by nearly 1%, sitting firmly at 2016 (and indeed 11 month) highs; the latter, meanwhile, managed to climb away from its earlier lows, even if the currency remains haunted by the spectre of a Bank of England rate cut on Thursday. The chancellor is watching events unfold from across the Atlantic, and tweets: The FT reckons that foreign secretary Phillip Hammond could become finance minister in Theresa May\u2019s government.... London shares have extended their gains this afternoon, as Wall Street opened strongly on the back of Friday\u2019s forecast-busting non-farm payrolls. The S&amp;P 500 set a record high, while the Dow was up 92 points, or 0.5 percent, to 18,240 within the first half hour of trading, with banks leading the charge. \u201cReaching a new high may see money moving from the sidelines of safety trades, like Treasury bonds and gold, back into the equity markets,\u201d Robert Pavlik, chief market strategist at Boston Private Wealth, told Reuters. \u201cThe emphasis of the markets will be how fast and how long the S&amp;P remains above the record today.\u201d By 3pm, the FTSE 100 had extended its gains to just over 70 points, or 1.1%, at 6664 points. A quick recap: Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 index is poised to smash into bull market territory, after being boosted by the weakness of the pound since the Brexit referendum. It has jumped 1% today, meaning it is 20% higher than in February. The smaller FTSE 250 index is also romping higher, on expectations that UK interest rates will be cut to fresh record lows on Thursday. But the pound has been volatile today, as Theresa May moved to the brink of becoming UK prime minister. May has called for a new clampdown on executive pay and predatory capitalism, getting a \u2018better late than never\u2019 welcome from the unions. Film studio Pinewood has declared that it should benefit from the weak pound, as Britain will become a more attractive place to make films. Chancellor George Osborne has landed in America, in an attempt to reassure US investors that they should still invest in Britain. In non-Brexit news: Shares in Nintendo have surged, on the back of the Pokemon Go craze Burberry has ended Chris Bailey\u2019s tenure as CEO, and hired a senior fashion chief Some non-Brexit news.... Fashion chain Burberry have just announced a new chief executive. It\u2019s Marco Gobbetti, currently CEO of fashion chain C\u00e9line. This means that Christopher Bailey, Burberry\u2019s creative mastermind, is moving to become president, after two years as CEO. He\u2019ll be chief creative officer too - but effectively he\u2019s losing day-to-day control of the company It\u2019s not a great surprise; City investors were concerned that Bailey couldn\u2019t do both jobs, especially as trading has deteriorated in recent months. Burberry shares have jumped 6%... Chancellor George Osborne has now landed New York, for his mission to reassure America that Britain is still open for business despite the Brexit vote (as we covered earlier). He\u2019ll be on US TV shortly, in an early-morning treat for America..... Enjoy the pound\u2019s rally while it lasts, says Jake Trask, currency analyst at UKForex. He predicts that sterling will soon weaken again, possibly later this week when the Bank of England announces its interest rate decision \u201cSterling pushed higher today as pro-Brexit candidate Angela Leadsom pulled out of the contest to be the next prime minister. The pound pushed up through $1.30 against the US dollar on the news, but the rally is likely to be short-lived, as Mark Carney is expected to cut interest rates to a record low of 0.25% this Thursday. \u201cShould he decide to cut rates to zero, we will likely see another multi-year low for sterling as we head towards a probable recession in the second half of the year.\u201d Almost every company on the FTSE 250 index of medium-sized UK companies has risen today. Property companies are leading the rally, driving the FTSE 250 up by 2.7% right now. Investment group St. Modwen Properties has jumped 9%, and British housebuilding company Crest Nicholson are up 7.6%. Earlier today, Theresa May identified housebuilding as a key priority if she became prime minister (which now seems an imminent prospect). This graph shows how shares in big companies on the FTSE 100 (red line) have roared back since the referendum, thanks to the slump in the pound. Smaller UK companies are shown on the blue line (the FTSE 250), and Germany\u2019s DAX is the pink line. In exquisite timing, confidence among small investors has hit its lowest level since the heights of the eurozone crisis in 2012 - just as shares keep rallying. Hargreaves Lansdown, the financial services firms, reports that its Investor Confidence Index has suffered its sharpest monthly fall in 5 years. The survey of retail investors took place on 30 June, a week after the EU referendum result, and asked them to give their view of the UK stock market over the next three years. The index fell from 92 points in May to 67 in June; the biggest one month percentage fall since June 2011. The index now stands at a four year low - in May 2012 it stood at a level of 61, as Greece looked like it might be on the brink of leaving the eurozone. Laith Khalaf, senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, says confidence appears to have \u201ccollapsed\u201d after the Brexit vote, among investors, consumers and businesses. The dwindling faith in the UK\u2019s future financial prospects has the potential to become a self-fulfilling prophecy, if companies and individuals start to assume a bunker mentality, and delay or cancel spending and investment. Investors are naturally twitchy about what Brexit means for the future of the stock market in the coming months and years. However continued low interest rates will remain supportive of shares, not least because there is really nowhere else for investors to go for income. Commercial property is one other option, though we have seen problems that can arise for investors in that market over the last week or so. The pound just put its nose back over the $1.30 mark, on the prospect of Theresa May becoming Britain\u2019s next PM sooner than expected. Britain\u2019s blue-chip FTSE 100 index is smashing into Bull Market territory. The Footsie has jumped by 60 points to 6650, a new 11-month high, as Andrea Leadsom confirms that she is withdrawing from the Tory party leadership battle. Crucially, more than 20% above the 5,537 level hit in mid-February, when markets had been driven down by fears over the global economy. So if it closes there tonight, the Footsie will be in bull market territory. Mining stocks are leading today\u2019s rally, with Anglo American up 5%. UK building companies are also sharply higher; Taylor Wimpey and Persimmon have both gained 6%. The usual provisos apply; the FTSE 100 is priced in sterling (which is worth 10% less than last month). And it is dominated by international firms, not UK ones. The smaller FTSE 250 is still 5% below its pre-referendum levels, following a 2% jump this morning. Joshua Mahony, market analyst at IG, says investors are expecting the Bank of England to ease monetary policy on Thursday. Last Friday\u2019s upbeat US employment report is also cheering the City. Mahony adds: Amid a sea of green in the FTSE, it is interesting to see the housebuilders and banks gaining heavily, in what has become a proxy for risk appetite across financial markets. There is no doubt that the housebuilders and banks are currently a risky play, given the severity of their recent devaluation. However, in days when the market is in the green, the performance of these sectors will reflect how far reaching that optimism really is. The pound is suddenly jumping, clawing back most of today\u2019s losses, as rumours sweep Westminster that Andrea Leadsom is about to quit the Tory leadership race. Caution is needed, as it\u2019s only at a three-hour high.... Maybe traders aren\u2019t sure what happens next. And they\u2019re not alone... Our politics liveblog have full coverage of Theresa May\u2019s speech: Theresa May, one of the two candidates to replace Cameron, is preaching a progressive message this morning. May is arguing that ordinary families need more help. Wages have only grown slowly, energy bills have rocketed, and monetary stimulus measures have helped those on the property ladder - but not those who can\u2019t [who wrote this speech, Ed Miliband?]. May is also promising a crackdown on executive pay, giving workers more power, and improving UK productivity. TUC General Secretary Frances O\u2019Grady says it\u2019s better late than never.... \u201cThe TUC has long argued for workers to be given seats on company boards and remuneration committees. Workers have a clear interest in the long-term success of their companies and deserve a bigger say. \u201cThis move would inject a much-needed dose of reality into boardrooms, as well as putting the brakes on the multi-million pay and bonus packages which have done so much to damage the reputation of corporate Britain. \u201cIf politicians are serious about making chief executives more accountable this is a common sense approach. I stand ready to meet Theresa May to discuss these proposals.\u201d David Cameron also told the Farnborough Airshow that it is in Britain\u2019s \u201cfundamental interest\u201d to remain very close to the EU. Prime minister David Cameron is urging Britain to use the Brexit vote to tackle the country\u2019s productivity problems. Speaking at the Farnborough Air Show, Cameron calls for a \u201cmassive national effort\u201d to build a strong dynamic economy.. He points out that output per hour in the UK is lower than US, Germany or France, and cites high speed rail, superfast broadband and housebuilding as key infrastructure areas to work on. Now we are leaving the EU, Britain must rapidly explore all possible supply-side reforms, such as tax reforms, Cameron continues. And he\u2019s singling out pharmaceuticals, life sciences, technology, and fintech as important areas where Britain can lead the world. One problem, of course... Cameron won\u2019t be in power in two month\u2019s time. So for all his talk about the \u201cground work\u201d being underway, his successor must actually do the heavy lifting.... The AFP newswire have a good take on George Osborne\u2019s trip to America: British finance minister George Osborne was Monday holding talks with Wall Street investors, kicking-off a series of visits to leading international financial centres to build post-Brexit economic ties. \u201cVital work will begin today on building stronger economic and trade relationships with the UK\u2019s closest trading partners,\u201d the Treasury said in a statement as Chancellor of the Exchequer Osborne headed to New York to meet investors on Wall Street. And Osborne will next week lead a trade mission to Singapore and China after Britain last month voted in a referendum to exit the European Union, the Treasury added. \u201cWhile Britain\u2019s decision to leave the EU clearly presents economic challenges, we now have to do everything we can to make the UK the most attractive place in the world to do business,\u201d Osborne, who voted for Britain to remain in the EU, said in the statement. \u201cWe will continue to be a beacon for free trade, democracy and security, more open to that world than ever.\u201d They also point out that the UK is considering easing the tax bill on companies: Following the Brexit vote, Osborne is planning to slash corporation tax over fears of an exodus by big business. According to the Treasury, he could extend planned cuts to Britain\u2019s levy on company profits to under 15 percent. Prior to the vote, the tax rate on corporate profits was already set to be cut from 20 percent to 19 next year and to 17 percent in 2020. Britain\u2019s business minister Sajid Javid on Friday held post-Brexit talks on the country\u2019s future trade relationship with India, the first of many such discussions he plans with world powers. Britain is left with the huge task of forging fresh trade agreements with individual countries as a non-bloc member. Javid has said that the British government, which will soon be led by a new prime minister after the post-Brexit vote resignation of David Cameron, plans to have up to 300 specialist staff by the end of the year to aid in the new trade negotiations. The jump in the FTSE 100 doesn\u2019t tell us much about the UK economy, except that it may trigger bonus payments to chief executives.... Japanese bank Nomura are predicting that sterling could hit a new 31-year low by Friday: The pound may be losing its shock value... Neil Wilson, markets analyst at ETX Capital, confirms that the prospect of fresh stimulus from the Bank of England is driving shares up (and the pound down) The prospect of looser monetary will help equities but it\u2019s another nail in sterling\u2019s coffin. Homebuilders, which rallied on Friday after a turbulent week, are on the up again today. Miners are also rising again as investors price in an interest rate cut. Encouragingly for UK firms, the FTSE 250 is trading up 1%, beating the FTSE 100\u2019s 0.5% rise. European markets are up across the board as they react to Friday\u2019s upbeat jobs report from the US, which spurred the Dow to a 1% gain and saw the S&amp;P 500 close within one point of its record high. Asian stock markets have now closed at one-month highs. Traders are betting that Japanese PM Shinzo Abe can now implement new structural reforms to make the economy more productive, having won a key election victory over the weekend. British film studio Pinewood has emerged as one of the winners from the Brexit vote. The company told shareholders this morning that the 10% tumble in the pound since the referendum was good for business. It said: The result of the UK\u2019s referendum on membership of the EU is now known. In the context of our business, the decline in the \u00a3sterling exchange rate is undoubtedly positive for our international customers. We will continue to monitor sentiment around the issue going forward. Pinewood has played a vital role in the UK film industry for decades. Everything from the Carry On and Pink Panther series to James Bond and the later Harry Potter films were produced at its sites. Maybe they\u2019ll make Brexit, The Movie one day too (rating PG). There were astonishing scenes on the Tokyo stock market today, as shares in console maker Nintendo surged by 25% following the runaway success of the new Pok\u00e9mon Go game. It\u2019s particularly notable, as Nintento is only indirectly linked to the game (which has sent users racing around, squinting into their phones, looking for the monsters) Sterling is weakening this morning, down over half a percent against the US dollar at $1.288. That underlines how the City expect a UK interest rate cut this week. Robin Bew of the Economist Intelligence Unit is confident that the Bank of England will do something this week: City investors are expecting the Bank of England to cut interest rates to fresh record lows on Thursday, to fight the dangers of recession following the Brexit vote. Tony Cross of Trustnet Direct says this is helping to drive shares up in London today: London\u2019s FTSE-100 is starting the week with some solid gains as Friday\u2019s upbeat unemployment data from the US and hopes of further stimulus measures out of Japan continue to buoy sentiment. There\u2019s also the spectre of a rate cut and further QE being unveiled at the Bank of England later in the week which is again delivering some cause for cheer and gains are eye-catchingly broad-based as a result. European stock markets have jumped in early trading, as last Friday\u2019s knockout US jobs report continues to cheer the City. In London, the FTSE 100 has risen by 45 points, or +0.7%, at 6636. That\u2019s the highest level since mid-August. Mining companies, banks, and UK housebuilders are the top risers, suggesting trader are less worried about the global economy and a UK recession. The FTSE 100 isn\u2019t the best gauge of the UK economy, as it is full of international companies whose overseas earnings are boosted by the weak pound. And also... the index is valued in sterling (so it\u2019s not at an 11-month high in US dollar terms). Encouragingly, the FTSE 250 index is up 0.7% this morning too. It contains more UK companies than the blue-chip FTSE 100. Top risers include retail chain Sports Direct and bank Virgin Money. Other European markets are also in the green: George Osborne may get a rough ride as he tries to woo America\u2019s top politicians and financiers this week: Bloomberg\u2019s reckons he faces a \u2018tall order\u2019 to persuade the US that all is well in the UK: He\u2019ll be mounting a public relations exercise at a time when the pound has slumped to a 31-year low against the U.S. dollar and real-estate funds are beingfrozen to avoid fire sales. Further undermining sentiment in the country is the two-month wait to discover the identity of the next prime minister, and discord gripping the opposition Labour Party. There\u2019s also no guarantee that Osborne will have high office once his close ally, David Cameron, has been replaced by either Theresa May or Andrea Leadsom. UK chancellor George Osborne is urging international investors not to give up on Britain, as the fallout from the EU referendum continues to hit the global economy. Osborne is flying to New York today, to meet with top Wall Street bankers. And his message is that Britain is not \u201cquitting the world\u201d, even though it has voted to leave the European Union. He has set the scene with an opinion piece in the Wall Street Journal this morning, arguing that Britain will still play a key role on the world stage. Quitting the EU (something Osborne campaigned in vain against) must mean closer links with the rest of the world, starting with America. He writes: \u200eThe question now is not what Britain is leaving; it is what Britain will become. There are those who want our exit from the EU to signal that we should now turn our back on the world, resist the free-market forces of globalization and become a more insular, less tolerant place. Similar forces are at work in other Western nations. We must not be afraid to confront them head-on. I am determined that \u2014 on the contrary \u2014 we now set out to build a more outward-looking, global-facing Britain, with stronger links with its friends and allies around the world. That must start with a closer economic relationship with North America. President Obama had warned that Britain would be at the \u2018back of the queue\u2019 for a trade deal. Osborne, though, hopes we can squeeze our way to the front. For first time in 40 years, the U.K. will be setting its own trade terms. So we should begin the conversation now with the U.S., and with the members of the North American Free Trade Agreement, about how we can deliver even closer economic ties. I have spoken to House Speaker Paul Ryan several times in the past two weeks about a stronger trading relationship\u2014and this week I will welcome Treasury Secretary Jack Lew to London to see what more we can do together. It is now in the overwhelming interest of both countries to do so. We are each other\u2019s largest investors, with almost $1 trillion invested in each other\u2019s economies. U.S. investment in the U.K. is around 10 times U.S. investment in China; British investment in the U.S. is around 50 times Chinese investment in the U.S. And that \u2018special relationship\u2019 with the US needs strengthening: Our economic trade ties with North America must now become stronger. My message is simple: Britain may be leaving the EU, but we are not withdrawing from the world. Britain will be a beacon for free trade, democracy and security, more open to that world than ever. Here\u2019s the full piece: WSJ: Britain Is Open for Business Osborne\u2019s mission makes sense; this would be an awful time for US companies to pull investment out of the UK. But he\u2019d better expect some tough questions about Britain\u2019s plans for Brexit, the Tory leadership battle, and the prospects for the pound.... Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. At first glance, all looks calm this morning. Asia\u2019s stock markets have hit a one-month high overnight after Japan\u2019s prime minister romped to election victory, potentially paving the way for constitutional changes and perhaps more stimulus measures. Investors are still feeling a warm glow after last Friday\u2019s US employment report, which showed many more jobs were created last month than expected. But beneath the surface, nasty things are lurking. The Brexit vote continues to dominate the UK, although we could be in limbo until Conservative Party members have appointed our next prime minister. And worries are mounting about Italy\u2019s banks, after Deutsche Bank AG\u2019s chief economist predicted that the sector may need a \u20ac150bn bailout. David Folkerts-Landau told the Welt am Sonntag newspaper that: \u201cEurope is extremely sick and must start dealing with its problems extremely quickly, or else there may be an accident. I\u2019m no doomsday prophet, I am a realist.\u201d Also coming up today.... UK chancellor George Osborne is meeting with US financial chiefs on Wall Street Eurozone finance ministers will hold a eurogroup meeting in Brussels this afternoon It\u2019s the Farnborough Airshow We\u2019ll be tracking all the main events through the day...",

For one thing, the sacking of George Osborne made it clear that austerity was for the history books.</p> <p>She vented her frustration at the lack of an industrial policy and also acknowledged that ordinary working people were angry at the way corporate executives paid themselves lavish salaries while ignoring the concerns of local communities and the demands of shareholders.</p> <p>In a speech that echoed many of the points made by Labour\u2019s Ed Miliband in the 2015 election, she said: \u201cWe need to reform the economy to allow more people to share in the country\u2019s prosperity. We need to put people back in control of their lives. We need to give more people more opportunity. And we need to get tough on irresponsible behaviour in big business.\u201d</p> <p>There will still be cuts to welfare spending pencilled into budgets until 2020 and hard-pressed councils can expect little favour from chancellor Philip Hammond. Moreover, May\u2019s support for a co-ordinated effort to drive up the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/may/24/george-osborne-productivity-plan-uk-economy\" title=\"\">UK\u2019s skills base and productive capacity</a> is largely in line with Osborne\u2019s previous approach. But what&#xa0;will mark out her administration from those covering the last six years, according to experts, will be more direct action.</p> <p>Will she sanction raising \u00a3100bn or more in government-backed infrastructure bonds? And will she implement new rules enforcing executive pay restraint, with sanctions for those who ignore them? Simon Walker, head of the Institute of Directors, says he wants businesses to heed May\u2019s warning and implement the spirit of her demands without waiting for legislation: \u201cBusiness needs to bloody act fast because rules on this always tend to have perverse outcomes.\u201d</p> <p>Here we examine the main areas put forward by May as being central to her vision for a better economy.</p> <h2><strong>Industrial policy</strong></h2> <p>May has put industrial policy in the hands of Greg Clark, who will head the new Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy department.

                "bodyText":"Theresa May signalled a sharp change in direction for the Conservative government when she set out her economic agenda. For one thing, the sacking of George Osborne made it clear that austerity was for the history books. She vented her frustration at the lack of an industrial policy and also acknowledged that ordinary working people were angry at the way corporate executives paid themselves lavish salaries while ignoring the concerns of local communities and the demands of shareholders. In a speech that echoed many of the points made by Labour\u2019s Ed Miliband in the 2015 election, she said: \u201cWe need to reform the economy to allow more people to share in the country\u2019s prosperity. We need to put people back in control of their lives. We need to give more people more opportunity. And we need to get tough on irresponsible behaviour in big business.\u201d There will still be cuts to welfare spending pencilled into budgets until 2020 and hard-pressed councils can expect little favour from chancellor Philip Hammond. Moreover, May\u2019s support for a co-ordinated effort to drive up the UK\u2019s skills base and productive capacity is largely in line with Osborne\u2019s previous approach. But what will mark out her administration from those covering the last six years, according to experts, will be more direct action. Will she sanction raising \u00a3100bn or more in government-backed infrastructure bonds? And will she implement new rules enforcing executive pay restraint, with sanctions for those who ignore them? Simon Walker, head of the Institute of Directors, says he wants businesses to heed May\u2019s warning and implement the spirit of her demands without waiting for legislation: \u201cBusiness needs to bloody act fast because rules on this always tend to have perverse outcomes.\u201d Here we examine the main areas put forward by May as being central to her vision for a better economy. Industrial policy May has put industrial policy in the hands of Greg Clark, who will head the new Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy department. Clark, the MP for Tunbridge Wells, has a reputation as a smart operator, but is largely unknown outside Westminster. There is scope for a coordinated effort between Clark, Hammond and Bank of England governor Mark Carney to kickstart a national infrastructure building programme with money borrowed from Threadneedle Street at ultra-low interest rates. Under this scheme, which is being openly talked about inside Westminster, more than \u00a3100bn could be borrowed to improve road, rail, power generation and digital infrastructure. Sir Keith Burnett, vice-chancellor of Sheffield University and a member of the Council for Science and Technology reporting to the prime minister, says: \u201cIf you ask a company what they need, it is orders. Once they have an order they can put in place the staff training and develop the technology and processes they need. It is the orders for high quality work that are lacking.\u201d Burnett says there are huge savings to be made if May can confront government antipathy to state funding. The UK often pays double what it needs to for infrastructure, behaving like a poverty-stricken consumer who must buy their furniture on hire purchase, he says. \u201cWhy on earth are we going into partnership with private contractors that charge an arm and a leg in debt interest and servicing costs when the government can finance projects with money borrowed for next to nothing on the international debt markets?\u201d He points out that the interest rate on UK government borrowing has tumbled to an all-time low as investors seek a safe haven for their funds. Skills training could also be supported with more money. Last November, Osborne whacked businesses with an apprenticeship levy, which critics warned was a tax on wage bills, to raise \u00a311.6bn over the next five years. It is supposed to pay for 3 million apprenticeships over the course of the parliament.

The final figure for the previous month was 93.5. The survey\u2019s chief economist Richard Curtin said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Although confidence strengthened in late July, for the month as a whole the Sentiment Index was still below last month\u2019s level mainly due to increased concerns about economic prospects among upper income households.</p> <p>The Brexit vote was spontaneously mentioned by record numbers of households with incomes in the top third (23%), more than twice as frequently as among households with incomes in the bottom two-thirds (11%). Given the prompt rebound in stock prices as well as the tiny direct impact on U.S. trade, it is surprising that concerns about Brexit remained nearly as high in late July as immediately following the Brexit vote.</p> <p>While concerns about Brexit are likely to quickly recede, weaker prospects for the economy are likely to remain. Uncertainties surrounding global economic prospects and the presidential election will keep consumers more cautious in their expectations for future economic growth. Based on the strength in personal finances and low interest rates, real consumer spending is now expected to rise by 2.6% through mid 2017.</p> </blockquote> <p>Meanwhile the Chicago purchasing managers index has come in at 55.8 in July, better than the expected 54 but below the 56.8 recorded in June.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/spreadexfins/status/759021955320254464\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">USA Chicago PMI announcement -  Actual: 55.8, Expected: 54.0 <a href=\"https://t.co/2kaIjr8fQH\">pic.twitter.com/2kaIjr8fQH</a></p>&mdash; Spreadex (@spreadexfins) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/spreadexfins/status/759021955320254464\">July 29, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p><em>On that note it\u2019s time to close for the day.

Former Anglo Irish Bank treasury official John Bowe was handed down a two year prison sentence. Denis Casey, the former Irish Life &amp; Permanent chief executive was sentence to two years in jail</p> <p>The sentences were delivered at Dublin Circuit Criminal Court on Friday by Judge Mr Martin Nolan. The judge said all the men had behaved in a \u201creprehensible manner\u201d and knew that they were doing was wrong. The trio stood accused of doctoring Anglo Irish Bank\u2019s books to make it look like it had \u20ac7.2bn in its accounts. They faced charges of moving money illegally between the Anglo Irish Bank and Irish Life&amp;Permanent.</p> <p>Judge Nolan said the case was one where \u201chonesty and integrity was sorely lacking.\u201d Addressing the role of McAteer in the illegal scheme, Judge Nolan said: \u201cIt is grossly reprehensible what he did and a great shame.\u201d</p> <p>All three men had pleaded not guilty during a trial that has lasted 89 days. During sentencing the judge also singled out the firm Ernst &amp; Young for its role in signing off Anglo Irish Bank\u2019s accounts: \u201cIt beggars belief that Ernst &amp; Young signed off on the accounts. How they signed off on the accounts as true and fair is a mystery to me.\u201d</p> <p>Judge Nolan added: \u201cThey should have known what was occurring if they were doing their job properly.\u201d</p> <p>In 2009 following the global financial crash Anglo Irish Bank was nationalised with the Irish taxpayer having to pay \u20ac30bn to rescue it.

Thus, whilst the domestic economic picture may be sufficiently strong for another hike, the Fed will likely maintain its current cautious (although broadly positive) stance in September and ahead of the US Presidential Election in November.

Managing economist Danae Kyriakopoulou said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Data released today by Eurostat showed that the pace of quarter-on-quarter GDP expansion across the Eurozone slowed to 0.3% during the second quarter of 2016.

Importantly, today\u2019s release refers to economic growth in the three months to June, ahead of the UK\u2019s vote to leave the EU which is widely expected to negatively impact on the currency bloc. Cebr expects growth to weaken further over the remaining quarters of this year and next....</p> <p>We maintain our view that monetary policy has largely reached its limits in terms of the support it can provide to the recovery and that it needs to be complemented by non-monetary stimulus measures in order to succeed. In that respect, this week\u2019s decision to by-pass the rules of the Stability and Growth pact and not fine Spain and Portugal for breaching the 3% deficit threshold is a welcome move by the European Commission.

And the second quarter growth figure of 0.3% is likely to be revised, he adds:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>After the strong growth in the first quarter (+0.6%), which was helped by some temporary factors like the mild winter weather, it was no surprise that there would be some pay-back in the second quarter.</p> <p>The disappointing 0% growth in France, largely due to a decline in inventories, was one of the culprits behind the weaker Eurozone growth performance. Bear in mind though, that in a number of big member states, comprising Germany and Italy, GDP figures still have to be published, implying that today\u2019s figure is prone to revision.</p> <p>While no demand components have been published yet, we believe that household consumption remained an important growth driver for the Eurozone, as unemployment continued to fall over the previous quarter. Looking at the European Commission\u2019s sentiment indicators, exports probably didn\u2019t play a major role in second quarter growth, though we still pencil in a positive growth contribution.</p> <p>The third quarter started on a good footing, but it is probably too soon to start downplaying the potential negative impact of Brexit on Eurozone growth.</p> <p>In a separate report the flash HICP inflation estimate was published, showing that headline inflation came out at 0.2% in July, slightly higher than expected.</p> <p>Today\u2019s set of data gives policy makers only limited comfort. The good news is that the economy still has some momentum, though there is little acceleration to be expected as long as the Brexit story continues to inject some uncertainty into the external environment. At the same time, inflation remains uncomfortably low, whilst the ECB\u2019s toolbox is getting emptier. The ECB looks set to remain in a wait-and-see mode, but we can imagine that the pressure to come up with something new will increase again, especially if growth shifts more decisively into a lower gear.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"38d47b2c6c22f9c8f3a9461f38ed5ae3d36804b0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/38d47b2c6c22f9c8f3a9461f38ed5ae3d36804b0/0_0_4928_2957/1000.jpg\" alt=\"French economy and industry minister Emmanuel Macron.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">French economy and industry minister Emmanuel Macron.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bertrand Guay/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-07-29T09:59:46.234Z\">at 10.59am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-579b20f0e4b00eff095cd845\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-07-29T09:28:28.631Z\">10.28am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The European Central Bank president Mario Draghi is probably pleased that eurozone inflation is creeping up, although it is still far shy of his 2% target.

This is in line with expectations that first quarter\u2019s consumption rebound could not last without more signs of higher employment growth. Government actions to boost corporate investment seem to have been less effective in the second quarter while net exports remained the weak spot of the French economy. If employment growth fails to accelerate, the risks materializing from the Brexit shock could lead to further weaknesses in the second half of this year.</p> <p>...It should be noted that the US and the UK were large contributors to growth last year, which helped limiting the negative net export growth contribution of 2015 to -0.3%. With the Brexit risk materializing and a weaker US dollar, this position will probably deteriorate further in the second half of the year.</p> </blockquote> <blockquote> <p>After the Brexit shock, we have revised our GDP growth forecast downwards to 1.4% in 2016 after 1.2% in 2015, and to 1.1% in 2017. With no room for manoeuvre left as far as reforms are concerned, the French economy can only count upon the stimulus added by recent policies (lowering labour costs and giving investment tax breaks). We think this will not be enough to secure a stronger recovery path before the 2017 Presidential election, especially if employment growth does not accelerate strongly in the near term.</p> </blockquote> <p><br>But Spain, despite its political troubles, is performing well. ING\u2019s Geoffrey Minne says:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Once again, Spanish figures remain strong and GDP growth rate of 3.2% year on year leaves Spain as a solid leader among large Eurozone countries.</p> <p>Looking at the economic situation, nearly everything seems to continue in the right direction...While the detail about GDP components is not available yet, we suspect consumption to be at the heart of the recovery, as households still benefited from the same cocktail of rising real earnings, decreasing unemployment and rebounding housing prices. The second good news of today is that the inflation rate continues to move towards the positive territory.

                "bodyText":"US consumers were less confident in July than the previous month, according to a new survey, partly due to the Brexit vote. The University of Michigan consumer sentiment index came in at 90 for July, lower than the 90.5 expected but up on the preliminary reading of 89.5. The final figure for the previous month was 93.5. The survey\u2019s chief economist Richard Curtin said: Although confidence strengthened in late July, for the month as a whole the Sentiment Index was still below last month\u2019s level mainly due to increased concerns about economic prospects among upper income households. The Brexit vote was spontaneously mentioned by record numbers of households with incomes in the top third (23%), more than twice as frequently as among households with incomes in the bottom two-thirds (11%). Given the prompt rebound in stock prices as well as the tiny direct impact on U.S. trade, it is surprising that concerns about Brexit remained nearly as high in late July as immediately following the Brexit vote. While concerns about Brexit are likely to quickly recede, weaker prospects for the economy are likely to remain. Uncertainties surrounding global economic prospects and the presidential election will keep consumers more cautious in their expectations for future economic growth. Based on the strength in personal finances and low interest rates, real consumer spending is now expected to rise by 2.6% through mid 2017. Meanwhile the Chicago purchasing managers index has come in at 55.8 in July, better than the expected 54 but below the 56.8 recorded in June. On that note it\u2019s time to close for the day. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back next week. Following the weaker than expected US GDP figures, as well as disappointing results from Exxon and Chevron, it is no surprise that US markets have opened lower. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 27 points or 0.15% while the S&amp;P 500 opened 0.08% lower. But Nasdaq edged up 0.14% after positive updates from Alphabet and Amazon. Meanwhile over in Ireland, three bankers from banks that almost bankrupted Ireland have been sent to jail today by a Dublin court, writes Ireland correspondent Henry McDonald: The trio from the now defunct Anglo Irish Bank and the taxpayer rescued Irish Life &amp; Permanent were given prison sentences for their part in a conspiracy to inflate the accounts of financial institutions by \u20ac7.2 bn. Ex-Anglo Irish Bank chief risk officer Willie McAteer has been sentenced to three and a half years. Former Anglo Irish Bank treasury official John Bowe was handed down a two year prison sentence. Denis Casey, the former Irish Life &amp; Permanent chief executive was sentence to two years in jail The sentences were delivered at Dublin Circuit Criminal Court on Friday by Judge Mr Martin Nolan. The judge said all the men had behaved in a \u201creprehensible manner\u201d and knew that they were doing was wrong. The trio stood accused of doctoring Anglo Irish Bank\u2019s books to make it look like it had \u20ac7.2bn in its accounts. They faced charges of moving money illegally between the Anglo Irish Bank and Irish Life&amp;Permanent. Judge Nolan said the case was one where \u201chonesty and integrity was sorely lacking.\u201d Addressing the role of McAteer in the illegal scheme, Judge Nolan said: \u201cIt is grossly reprehensible what he did and a great shame.\u201d All three men had pleaded not guilty during a trial that has lasted 89 days. During sentencing the judge also singled out the firm Ernst &amp; Young for its role in signing off Anglo Irish Bank\u2019s accounts: \u201cIt beggars belief that Ernst &amp; Young signed off on the accounts. How they signed off on the accounts as true and fair is a mystery to me.\u201d Judge Nolan added: \u201cThey should have known what was occurring if they were doing their job properly.\u201d In 2009 following the global financial crash Anglo Irish Bank was nationalised with the Irish taxpayer having to pay \u20ac30bn to rescue it. The bank was once the preferred bank of builders and property speculators. The sharp practices at the bank during the Celtic Tiger boom when it allowed Irish developers and investors to pay the global property market caused national outrage in Ireland. Here\u2019s our report on the US GDP figures: The US economy grew by just 1.2% from April to June, the US Department of Commerce announced on Friday, as cut backs by businesses wiped out a rise in consumer spending. The lower-than-expected figure is the latest in a series of disappointing economic numbers attributed to growing uncertainty among consumers and businesses, both of whom are keeping a tighter rein on spending. Economists polled by Reuters had expected the US government to report that gross domestic product (GDP) \u2013 the broadest measure of the economy\u2019s health \u2013 would increase at a 2.6% annual rate after rising at a rate of 1.1% in the first quarter. The 1.1% figure was revised down to 0.8% on Friday. The economy has now grown at an annual rate of less than 2% for three straight quarters. The full story is here: And here\u2019s a chart showing how US GDP has been revised in the past: Alex Lydall, senior sales trader at foreign exchange business Foenix Partners, also believes a US rate rise is now unlikely this year: Janet Yellen will continue to sit on the fence with interest rates for the foreseeable future on disappointing news this afternoon that US GDP increased to a sluggish 1.2%, on preliminary figures where analysts had expectations of an uplift to 2.6%. Rhetoric from the Federal Reserve lately has been somewhat cautious, meaning the significant miss of growth figures will put the bearish committee members back in the driving seat. With global risk appetite tentative on the back of the EU Referendum results, the global powerhouse of the US is often seen as a precursor to global performance. If these preliminary figures signify a shift on the downside for the domestic economy in the US, not only will rate hikes be unlikely this year, but the benchmark for global risk will be adversely affected in the medium term. The pound is now up 0.5% against the US currency at $1.3232. The dollar has weakened against the euro to $1.1132, a level last seen on 15 July while the yen has also extended its gains against the US currency. Despite a weaker than expected US GDP number, the underlying picture is more mixed, said economist James Smith at ING Bank: The US economy grew by less than expected in the second quarter, growing by just 1.2% quarter on quarter (annualised). That said, the underlying picture is on balance slightly more encouraging than this headline suggests. Consumption in particular was very strong, increasing by 4.2% quarter on quarter(annualised) and follows some solid retail sales data over the past few months. There was also a large drag from inventories, which shaved -1.16% from the headline, which given that this in the most part is simply noise, the underlying growth picture was probably closer to 2% in the second quarter. However, business investment continues to provide some cause for concern...There were also a series of negative backward revisions to overall GDP, suggesting that trend growth has been slightly lower over the past year or so than previously thought. Overall though, this release is probably fairly neutral for the Fed, with strong consumer activity balancing out with the fall in investment. Indeed, with recent evidence tentatively suggesting that the recent shortfall in job creation was a temporary blip and inflation gradually moving in the right direction, there is fairly minimal cause for concern regarding the domestic economic picture. However, the Federal Reserve Open Markets Committee has got its eye firmly on \u201cglobal economic and financial developments\u201d, which we think refers to uncertainty following Brexit and forthcoming political developments in the US and Europe. Thus, whilst the domestic economic picture may be sufficiently strong for another hike, the Fed will likely maintain its current cautious (although broadly positive) stance in September and ahead of the US Presidential Election in November. That said, assuming the domestic economy continues to head in the right direction, then we think there is a strong likelihood of a rate hike in early 2017. We may see FOMC speakers trying to guide markets closer to this point over coming days and weeks. Pointing out the US GDP figures were subject to revision, the Bureau of Economic Analysis, said: The increase in real GDP in the second quarter reflected positive contributions from personal consumption expenditures and exports that were partly offset by negative contributions from private inventory investment, nonresidential fixed investment, residential fixed investment, and state and local government spending. Imports, which are a subtraction in the calculation of GDP, decreased. Further mixed signals from the US economy, with second quarter annualised GDP growth coming in at 1.2%, much lower than the 2.6% expected by analysts but up from the 0.8% seen in the first quarter. The figures back up the Federal Reserve\u2019s decision not to raise interest rates this week. And they may not necessarily rule out an increase later in the year although they do seen to make it less likely. Ahead of US GDP data here are the expected openings on US markets: Back with the markets, and European shares are trying to edge higher following the eurozone GDP figures, with Germany\u2019s Dax up 0.37% and France\u2019s Cac climbing 0.07%. But the FTSE 100 has dipped 0.2%, not helped by a near 10% plunge in education group Pearson reported a bigger than expected 7% fall in half year sales and said it would cut 4,000 jobs as part of a restructuring programme. Ahead of the results of the latest European banking stress tests, one of the most troubled of a troubled Italian banking system is seeking a solution to its difficulties: An eleventh hour rescue deal has been tabled for Italy\u2019s Monte dei Paschi di Siena (MPS), the world\u2019s oldest bank, as investors and pensioners alike brace for the result of an official assessment of its financial health. European regulators release the results of a so-called stress test of MPS, Italy\u2019s third largest bank, and 50 other banks across the EU which are being assessed after the close of US markets on Friday. The results will be closely followed by investors around the world but particularly in Italy, where worse-than-expected news could set off a chain of events that may have drastic consequences for thousands of ordinary Italian investors who bought debt in the bank. The results of the stress tests have already been sent to the banks but will only be made public at 9pm London time. There is concern that an acute banking crisis in Italy, led by troubles at MPS but possibly other banks as well, could ignite European and global banking crises. Ahead of the stress test results, the board of the troubled Italian bank was meeting to weigh up to potential solutions: the last-minute offer received on Thursday night from the former chief executive of Intesa Sanpaolo, Corrado Passsera, and the Swiss bank UBS; and a rescue plan being co-ordinated by JP Morgan and Mediobanca. However, the MPS board is likely to reject the UBS offer, sources told Reuters. The full story is here: Domestic demand in the eurozone is likely to help offset any problems caused by the UK\u2019s Brexit vote, said economist Marco Valli at UniCredit Research: The high volatility of GDP data in the first half of the year probably mainly reflects temporary factors (supportive in the first quarter of 2016, negative in the second quarter), while the underlying growth trend seems to have remained reasonably steady, at least when looking at the most informative survey indicators. Therefore, today\u2019s data do not change the fundamental story. We expect signs of moderate slowdown to emerge in the coming months, mainly reflecting the Brexit fallout via the trade channel and, to a lesser extent, the confidence channel. However, the resilience of eurozone domestic demand on the back of improved fundamentals for consumption and investment is likely to provide a good buffer. The Centre for Economics and Business Research also expects a slowdown in the coming months and warns other measures on top of monetary policy may be needed to support the economy. Managing economist Danae Kyriakopoulou said: Data released today by Eurostat showed that the pace of quarter-on-quarter GDP expansion across the Eurozone slowed to 0.3% during the second quarter of 2016. This confirms Cebr\u2019s view back in April that first quarter\u2019s impressive 0.6% growth was yet another false dawn for the currency bloc. Importantly, today\u2019s release refers to economic growth in the three months to June, ahead of the UK\u2019s vote to leave the EU which is widely expected to negatively impact on the currency bloc. Cebr expects growth to weaken further over the remaining quarters of this year and next.... We maintain our view that monetary policy has largely reached its limits in terms of the support it can provide to the recovery and that it needs to be complemented by non-monetary stimulus measures in order to succeed. In that respect, this week\u2019s decision to by-pass the rules of the Stability and Growth pact and not fine Spain and Portugal for breaching the 3% deficit threshold is a welcome move by the European Commission. Further flexibility, leniency, and initiative on other levers of economic policy, particularly among those economies that can afford it, will be key in ensuring a sustainable recovery for the Eurozone going forward. The eurozone GDP figures show the economy is still growing but inflation remains uncomfortably low, says Peter Vanden Houte at ING Bank. And the second quarter growth figure of 0.3% is likely to be revised, he adds: After the strong growth in the first quarter (+0.6%), which was helped by some temporary factors like the mild winter weather, it was no surprise that there would be some pay-back in the second quarter. The disappointing 0% growth in France, largely due to a decline in inventories, was one of the culprits behind the weaker Eurozone growth performance. Bear in mind though, that in a number of big member states, comprising Germany and Italy, GDP figures still have to be published, implying that today\u2019s figure is prone to revision. While no demand components have been published yet, we believe that household consumption remained an important growth driver for the Eurozone, as unemployment continued to fall over the previous quarter. Looking at the European Commission\u2019s sentiment indicators, exports probably didn\u2019t play a major role in second quarter growth, though we still pencil in a positive growth contribution. The third quarter started on a good footing, but it is probably too soon to start downplaying the potential negative impact of Brexit on Eurozone growth. In a separate report the flash HICP inflation estimate was published, showing that headline inflation came out at 0.2% in July, slightly higher than expected. Today\u2019s set of data gives policy makers only limited comfort. The good news is that the economy still has some momentum, though there is little acceleration to be expected as long as the Brexit story continues to inject some uncertainty into the external environment. At the same time, inflation remains uncomfortably low, whilst the ECB\u2019s toolbox is getting emptier. The ECB looks set to remain in a wait-and-see mode, but we can imagine that the pressure to come up with something new will increase again, especially if growth shifts more decisively into a lower gear. The European Central Bank president Mario Draghi is probably pleased that eurozone inflation is creeping up, although it is still far shy of his 2% target. Alex Lydall, senior sales trader at Foenix Partners, said: A subtle smile will likely creep across Mario Draghi\u2019s face this morning as an uplift in eurozone CPI figures for July (0.2%) gives an element of breathing space which perhaps market participants were not expecting. In what is now a post-Brexit era, little has been noted of the impact on the eurozone, rather focus has largely been on the UK, so solid GDP figures this morning and the inflation rise will give hope that the eurozone is (at least) starting this era on an improved status. Negative sentiment is rife and global impacts largely unknown at present, but as Draghi recently pointed out, the initial headwinds have been dealt with efficiently, and the rest remains to be unknown. One step at a time, but for now, measurable success is emanating from the eurozone. Peter Read, co-founder of trading network Pelican, said: ECB President Mario Draghi will be relieved to see the encouraging inflation data released today, which swiftly followed strong numbers from the two pillars of the eurozone, Germany and France. Yet Draghi will know that hitting his own two per cent yearly growth target for the eurozone off the back of strong German and French economies alone will be difficult. Uncertainty about the UK\u2019s relationship with the EU won\u2019t be going away anytime soon, and many observers are now casting nervous looks at the troubled Italian banking sector to see whether the positives from the rest of the continent will be overshadowed by yet another crisis. The eurozone GDP figures do not really include any effects of the Brexit vote, of course. Dennis de Jong, managing director at UFX.com, said: After a strong first quarter for eurozone GDP it comes as little surprise that second quarter growth has slowed. The effect of the UK\u2019s Brexit vote hasn\u2019t set in yet, although many will expect numbers to continue to slide. We\u2019ve already seen the Bank of Japan underwhelm the markets this morning with just a modest expansion of its stimulus programme, and it will be the Bank of England\u2019s turn to announce its policy decision next week. These are testing times for central banks all over the world and the markets are looking for swift and strong action. There are also inflation and unemployment figures out from the European Union. Eurozone inflation came in higher than expect in July, up 0.2% from 0.1% in June according to the initial estimate from Eurostat. It said: Looking at the main components of euro area inflation, food, alcohol &amp; tobacco is expected to have the highest annual rate in July (1.4%, compared with 0.9% June), followed by services (1.2%, compared with 1.1% in June), non-energy industrial goods (0.4%, stable compared with June) and energy (-6.6%, compared with -6.4% in June). Meanwhile the eurozone unemployment rate for June came in as expected at 10.1%. Eurostat said: The euro area seasonally-adjusted unemployment rate was 10.1% in June 2016, stable compared to May 2016 and down from 11.0% in June 2015. This remains the lowest rate recorded in the euro area since July 2011. The EU28 unemployment rate was 8.6% in June 2016, stable compared to May 2016 and down from 9.5% in June 2015. This remains the lowest rate recorded in the EU28 since March 2009. In the wider European Union, the 28 member states saw GDP rise by 0.4% quarter on quarter, down from 0.5%. Year on year, EU GDP came in unchanges at 1.8%. The eurozone economy slowed in the second quarter, but performed slightly better than expected. GDP growth came in at 0.3% quarter on quarter, down from 0.6% in the first three months of the year but in line with forecasts. Year on year the rise was 1.6%, down from 1.7% but higher than the expected figure of 1.5%. Oil continues to come under pressure on worries of a supply glut and slowing demand. On Thursday West Texas Intermediate - the US benchmark - entered bear market territory by falling 20% below its June high. Now Brent crude has followed suit: In the weeks leading up to the EU referendum, UK mortgage approvals fell to their lowest level since May 2015. But lending to consumers rose at its fastest pace for nearly 11 years, according to new Bank of England figures. The Bank said 64,766 mortgages were approved compared with 66,722 in May, below analyst expectations of a figure of 65,650. As for consumer lending, it jumped by 10.3% year on year although this may slow down in the months following the referendum, if the latest drop in consumer confidence is any guide. German retail sales for June seemed to have held up in the run-up to the UK\u2019s referendum. Reuters reports: German retail sales fell by 0.1 percent on the month in June but a stronger-than-forecast yearly rise suggested consumer spending, which is expected to drive growth this year, remains a pillar of support for the economy as foreign trade weakens. The volatile indicator, which is often subject to revision, was in line with expectations in a Reuters poll for a 0.1 percent monthly drop, data from the Federal Statistics Office showed on Friday. The monthly data for May was revised down to a rise of 0.7 from a previously reported increase of 0.9 percent. On the year, annual retail sales in Europe\u2019s largest economy climbed by 2.7 percent in real terms - far more than the 1.3 percent increase forecast by economists in a Reuters poll. France\u2019s economy could weaken further after the Brexit vote, says ING economist Julien Manceaux: French GDP growth slowed to 0.0% in the second quarter. This is in line with expectations that first quarter\u2019s consumption rebound could not last without more signs of higher employment growth. Government actions to boost corporate investment seem to have been less effective in the second quarter while net exports remained the weak spot of the French economy. If employment growth fails to accelerate, the risks materializing from the Brexit shock could lead to further weaknesses in the second half of this year. ...It should be noted that the US and the UK were large contributors to growth last year, which helped limiting the negative net export growth contribution of 2015 to -0.3%. With the Brexit risk materializing and a weaker US dollar, this position will probably deteriorate further in the second half of the year. After the Brexit shock, we have revised our GDP growth forecast downwards to 1.4% in 2016 after 1.2% in 2015, and to 1.1% in 2017. With no room for manoeuvre left as far as reforms are concerned, the French economy can only count upon the stimulus added by recent policies (lowering labour costs and giving investment tax breaks). We think this will not be enough to secure a stronger recovery path before the 2017 Presidential election, especially if employment growth does not accelerate strongly in the near term. But Spain, despite its political troubles, is performing well. ING\u2019s Geoffrey Minne says: Once again, Spanish figures remain strong and GDP growth rate of 3.2% year on year leaves Spain as a solid leader among large Eurozone countries. Looking at the economic situation, nearly everything seems to continue in the right direction...While the detail about GDP components is not available yet, we suspect consumption to be at the heart of the recovery, as households still benefited from the same cocktail of rising real earnings, decreasing unemployment and rebounding housing prices. The second good news of today is that the inflation rate continues to move towards the positive territory. The harmonized CPI went progressively from -1.2% year on year in April to -0.9% in June and -0.6% in July. Looking at the political situation, nearly everything seems to go wrong. After two election rounds, no concrete solution is on the table and even if Rajoy would like to see a government in the beginning of August, it seems unlikely. All in all, political turmoil has barely scratched GDP growth and job creation in the first semester and Spain has appeared more resilient than expected. The effect of Brexit and national political uncertainty can still suddenly come into play but with current tailwinds, GDP growth in 2016 is set to hover around 3%. However until the end of the year, slippages are possible, caused by political events be it in Barcelona or in Madrid. The French GDP figures could be a bad omen for the forthcoming eurozone GDP figures, says Capital Economics: Another warning about the UK property market - London in particular - in the wake of the Brexit vote, this time from estate agency Foxtons. Despite a second election in six months during the second quarter, Spain\u2019s economy still managed to show steady growth. Spain\u2019s GDP rose by 0.7% quarter on quarter between April and June, in line with expectations and up 3.2% year on year. Earlier in the week, Spain avoided a fine from the European Union over its budget deficit and was given an extra two years to achieve a target for its deficit to be no more than 3% of GDP. Portugal was given similar dispensation. Contrary to expectations, the FTSE 100 has fallen in early trading, down 14 points or 0.2%. Barclays is leading the risers, up 4% after its results while British Airways owner International Airlines Group is down nearly 2% after it reported a lower than expected 4.7% rise in second quarter profit and said it no longer expected to grow 2016 profits by \u20ac900m as it had forecast in February. But Germany\u2019s Dax and France\u2019s Cac both opened 0.4% higher. Ahead of the eurozone GDP figures, Unicredit analysts say they expect a modest expansion in the second quarter: After a strong first quarter, GDP growth likely weakened in the second quarter of 2016: we forecast +0.3% quarter on quarter, with risks tilted to the downside. Hard data suggest that private consumption and construction investment slowed substantially, while the trade channel is unlikely to have picked up the slack. On the output side, industrial production lost traction. There are also eurozone inflation and unemployment figures due, while in the UK we get mortgage approvals for June, and in the US, second quarter GDP. Back to the French GDP numbers, and in volume terms growth was flat in the second quarter after a 0.7% rise in the previous three months. Household expenditure fell sharply from 1.2% to flat, while imports dropped by 1.3% and exports declined by 0.3%. Year on year, GDP grew by 1.4% compared to 1.3% previously but below forecasts of a 1.6% increase. And here\u2019s how the French GDP figures break down: Here are the forecasts for the European market open. Meanwhile the Nikkei is currently up 0.56% while the Hang Seng has slipped 0.86%. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. The eurozone economy will be in the spotlight today with growth figures for the second quarter - the run up to the UK\u2019s Brexit vote - expected to show a slowdown. But bear in mind that UK second quarter GDP ended up being better than forecasts despite the concerns about the referendum. Meanwhile the Bank of Japan has disappointed the market with its latest stimulus package, leaving interest rates at their previous negative level but slightly boosting its stimulus package. Our story is here: Jasper Lawler, market analyst at CMC Markets UK, said the disappointment from the new Japanese measures could put more pressure on Bank of England governor Mark Carney. The B0E is odds on to cut interest rates next week but the scope for an underwhelming result here has increased, said Lawler: The Bank of Japan has eased policy but it hasn\u2019t impressed markets...The Japanese yen has rallied against every major currency following the BOJ announcement, taking USD/JPY down 200 pips to 103. Further declines for another test of the key 100 level appear likely. It was a missed opportunity for the BOJ to have done more at its first meeting after Prime Minister Abe was re-elected with a new mandate to expand Abenomics. Even the Japanese stock market, which is the single biggest beneficiary of the policy change saw shares drop, with the Nikkei choppy before falling nearly 1%. The shift into the yen, typically perceived as a haven asset will have repercussions on demand for risky assets including European stocks. The impact of Japan\u2019s weak monetary stimulus is being interpreted differently across Europe..... Mark Carney has boxed the Bank of England into a corner, with market expectations now 100% that it will cut interest rates in August, primarily because of his \u201cmore monetary easing by summer\u201d comment. The Bank of Japan\u2019s governor Kuroda appears to have felt compelled to act given the weight of expectation but has delivered something underwhelming. Mark Carney might be at risk of doing the same. Back with eurozone GDP and the figures will be scoured for any sign of a Brexit effect. The agenda looks like this: The figures from France are already out and show a flat performance compared to expectations of a 0.2% rise quarter on quarter: More on that in a moment. Also high on the agenda are the results of the latest European banking stress tests, with Italian banks in particular in the spotlight on concerns about their balance sheets and non-performing loans. The report is due out after the close of the US market. Speaking of banks, Barclays has just reported a 10% fall in half year underlying profit. Elsewhere there are updates from British Airways owner International Airlines Group, and there is likely to be more fallout from the last minute delay to the Hinkley Point C nuclear deal with EDF:",

Consumers, however, have turned back to Amazon and other online sites because of the size of their catalogue as they look for classic songs and albums by Prince and David Bowie, who both died this year. Prince sold more albums during the 12-week period than any artist apart from Adele. Sales of CDs more than six months old grew by 9% year on year, helped by Prince and Bowie. No music titles, however, made it into the top 30 entertainment products for the quarter. Following its box office success, the latest Star Wars movie was the bestselling title in the entertainment market, with 1.8 million shoppers picking up a copy of the DVD or Blu-ray. Tesco was the big winner, taking nearly a third of all spending on the product. Tesco\u2019s overall sales fell 0.5% in the entertainment sector, meaning its market share dropped slightly to 15.2%. On the high street, HMV\u2019s sales rose 2.3% year on year, increasing its market share from 14% to 16.3%. Amazon\u2019s sales rose 0.5%, increasing its share of spending from 22.5% to 23%. Fiona Keenan, Kantar\u2019s strategic insight director, said: \u201cStar Wars: The Force Awakens has become the biggest Blu-ray film title since Avatar over six years ago and there are signs it has helped get people back into the market \u2013 encouraging, given the competition Blu-ray and DVDs face from digital streaming services such as Netflix. \u201cOnline spend across the industry has bounced back from declines over the past year and now accounts for over a third of spend \u2013 the highest it has been since this time in 2015. \u201cHaving the availability of a wide back catalogue means online retailers are extremely well placed to cater to changes in consumer demand, as exemplified by the recent surge in sales of Bowie and Prince albums following the death of both iconic artists earlier this year.\u201d",
