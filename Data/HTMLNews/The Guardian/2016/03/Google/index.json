On Tuesday, it announced <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/mar/01/greggs-says-healthier-options-boosted-sales\">a 25% rise in pre-tax profits, to \u00a373m</a>, on sales of \u00a3835.7m. This is no flash in the pan: last year, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/jul/29/greggs-profits-boosted-by-healthier-options-and-shop-upgrades\">profits for the first six months rose by 51%</a>. The share price rose on the latest announcement. Cuts were announced, too. Three of its 12 main bakeries will be shut, with 335 jobs potentially lost, but the company stressed that this was part of a broader \u00a3100m plan for expansion \u2013 and, at any rate, 1.7% of its roughly 20,000 employees does not seem swingeing. Greggs has 1,698 outlets, more than McDonalds\u2019 or Starbucks, and plans to take this figure beyond 2,000. It shifts more than 2.5m sausage rolls per week, and 1m cups of coffee.</p> <p>The figures were a triumph for CEO Roger Whiteside, a veteran of Ocado and Marks &amp; Spencer, who was hired in 2013 and set about repositioning the bakery as a \u201cfood-on-the-go\u201d brand rather than a \u201ctake-home\u201d bakery. \u201cWe realised we weren\u2019t going to win the battle against the supermarkets for the take-home baked goods,\u201d he tells me. \u201cInstead, we had to deploy our bakery skills to sell our products for instant consumption.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ca39457195c2d845fcb1df05b4b35e46f1423014\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ca39457195c2d845fcb1df05b4b35e46f1423014/0_0_4242_2828/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A flat white from Greggs costs \u00a31.75, 40p cheaper than Pret a Manger.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A flat white from Greggs costs \u00a31.75, 40p cheaper than Pret a Manger.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mark Pinder for the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This means sandwiches, soups and salads rather than just loaves and cakes, and a range of healthier options, too.

It was just down the road that John Gregg inherited a family yeast-and-eggs business in 1939, delivering baked goods by bicycle before opening the first shop in 1951, on Gosforth High Street. The original store was bought by a travel agency, which remains today \u2013 in a back room, staff showed me the outline of where the Greggs oven once stood. John\u2019s sons Ian and Colin took over the business before John\u2019s death in 1964. In his book <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/Bread-Story-Greggs-Ian-Gregg/dp/0552169498\">Bread: The Story of Greggs</a>, Ian Gregg explains that he was inspired by the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vilfredo_Pareto\">early-20th-century Italian economist Vilfredo Pareto</a>, who he came across while studying at Cambridge. Pareto observed that, in Italy in 1905, 20% of the people owned 80% of the land. His rule states that, in any field, 80% of the effect can be achieved with 20% of the effort. Gregg realised that by installing small ovens at the back of the shop and doing most of the heavy baking off site, he could achieve most of the theatre \u2013 the sights and especially smells of the process \u2013 without the hassle of a full-size setup. The brand quickly expanded, assimilating other bakeries along the way. It went public in 1984. In May 1994, it bought the Bakers Dozen chain, doubling its presence overnight. As Greggs grew, it brought its disparate shops together under a single brand \u2013 ditching suffixes such as \u201cof Gosforth\u201d and \u201cthe baker\u201d, but retaining its honest image.</p> <p>Listening to Whiteside\u2019s breezy patter, it is tempting to see Greggs as a microcosm of battles being fought across the country: between green juice and meat pies; global conglomerates and family businesses; London and the north. Greggs\u2019 northern identity is intact: at the Gosforth branch, the menu asks if you want to take your food away or \u201csit in\u201d. \u201cThe culture is very special,\u201d says Whiteside, \u201cand a lot of that comes from the roots in Newcastle.\u201d Newcastle is awash with Greggs, including branches open late into the night, and one protected by a bouncer at weekends.</p> <p>Whiteside says central London is the only place where Greggs has a limited presence: rents are simply too high. \u201cOur average transaction is \u00a32.70,\u201d says Whiteside. \u201cYou need a hell of a lot of customers to make that work where you might be paying \u00a3250,000 a year in rent.\u201d While banks imperil the world economy with risky leveraging, Greggs is debt-free. It contributes widely to local charities and community projects, but still pays an annual dividend to shareholders. Staff are paid above minimum wage, with above-inflation rises and a healthy profit-share scheme \u2013 last year all 20,000 employees received a bonus of \u00a3500. The assistant manager at the Gosforth branch, Susie Brewis, told me she had been with the company for 19 years. When speaking about the profit share and the 50% staff discount card, she practically beamed.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"ee41bbad341b0498c03d4af351a214f912517960\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ee41bbad341b0498c03d4af351a214f912517960/0_0_4242_2828/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The average transaction at Greggs is \u00a32.70.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The average transaction at Greggs is \u00a32.70.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mark Pinder for the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Business-wise, the company seems to combine a conservative approach to product with an open-mindedness about new ideas. \u201cWe watch all the food trends,\u201d says Whiteside. \u201cAnd, in time, if some of the things that are gathering pace in London become universally popular then, yes, we\u2019ll consider it.\u201d They recently introduced a katsu curry pasty, which has been selling well, but are waiting to check that sushi is not a flash-in-the-pan fad. \u201cThe other one I constantly joke about is quinoa,\u201d Whiteside adds. \u201cTrendy restaurants have quinoa all over the place, but we don\u2019t think the British public is ready for it yet. We allow these more fashion-led places to go first, and then follow if there is demand.\u201d There is also a high level of regional variation: you won\u2019t see a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stottie_cake\">stottie</a> south of Thirsk.</p> <p>Yet the company has taken risks and failed before. Under one of Whiteside\u2019s predecessors, Greggs tried to launch in Belgium under the brand \u201cEngelse bakker\u201d before retreating in 2008, in what <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/8ca63d6c-c5d8-11dd-a741-000077b07658.html#axzz41x3OkIZf\">one paper called a \u201cDunkirk moment\u201d</a>. Early attempts at healthier options were slow off the ground. A trial of Greggs Moment, a coffee-shop-style brand with extensive seating, also failed, although its legacy is visible in the shop designs, which are increasingly trendy. In Gosforth, there is plenty of exposed brick, an old delivery bicycle mounted to the wall, and excellent i-fi.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Trendy restaurants have quinoa all over the place, but we don\u2019t think the British public is ready for it yet</p> <footer> <cite>Roger Whiteside, Greggs CEO</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The surprising celebrity fans help. In 2002, the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2009/aug/07/milla-jovovich-resident-evil\">actor and model Milla Jovovich</a>, a woman without outward indicators of a doughnut habit, said <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/2118134.stm\">she would be happy to become the face of Greggs</a>. The actor Thomas Turgoose is a fan, revealing <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2010/mar/13/thomas-turgoose-scouting-book\">in a 2010 Guardian interview</a> that his girlfriend worked in a branch in Grimsby. Last year, <a href=\"http://metro.co.uk/2015/08/25/cheryl-fernandez-versini-throws-her-weight-behind-greggs-charity-chocolate-bar-campaign-5359385/\">Cheryl Fernandez-Versini launched her own Greggs chocolate</a> bar for charity, and Jake Gyllenhaal said that his favourite pastime in the UK was <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/jul/24/jake-gyllenhaal-i-love-greggs\">to sit outside with a Greggs baguette</a>.</p> <p>Even the Observer\u2019s food critic, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/jayrayner\">Jay Rayner</a>, concedes that Greggs is a canny operator. \u201cThey manage to have a very utilitarian high-street presence disguising a rather staunch commitment to a quality product,\u201d he says. \u201cThey have been committed to short supply chains. It\u2019s good stuff, with the caveat that you are talking about massive amounts of carbohydrate.\u201d</p> <p>Obesity is the elephant in the room. All but one of the diners I spoke to couched their love of Greggs in an acknowledgement that it was not the healthiest option, and said that they only stopped by once or twice a week. There are traffic-light labels on all the products, and the company is clear about the calories and fat in its products. But the transparency is only superficial, and the <a href=\"https://www.greggs.co.uk/about-us/faq/\">FAQ on the website</a> is full of dead ends. It says that prices vary across branches, but won\u2019t say which is the most expensive or cheapest. (Our investigations team can reveal that on the Seven Sisters Road, Islington, a sausage roll is 90p, 10p more than in Gosforth.) It confirms that the pure palm oil it uses is sustainable, and that it is \u201cworking on\u201d ensuring sustainability across the supply chain \u2013 which invites the question of whether the combined fats it uses might contain the unsustainable variety.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a13076f8218e5ab453a0355cf0d54ec7f890e808\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a13076f8218e5ab453a0355cf0d54ec7f890e808/0_187_4242_2548/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Gosforth branch of Greggs.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"601\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Gosforth branch of Greggs.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mark Pinder for the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>And the \u201cfreshly prepared\u201d food that it trumpets is different from being freshly made. Although the bread is finished off in store, it arrives frozen. Assistant manager Brewis told me her life had been made easier by the advent of pre-chopped sandwich fillings and salad ingredients. Another former employee agrees: \u201cThe Mexican chicken sandwiches were a \u2019mare.\u201d <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2010/feb/17/warm-baked-food-sausage-rools\">In a Guardian piece from 2010, a former employee recounted</a> sprinkling the loaves with powdered egg to help create an even glaze, and loading lettuce \u201cdrowned in chlorine\u201d into sandwiches. Greggs reveals its exact ingredients only on demand. The cheese-and-vegetable pasty recipe its office sends me makes it clear why: there are more than 50 ingredients, of varying familiarity.

A few years ago, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/aug/19/why-did-an-offensive-greggs-logo-show-up-in-googles-web-search\">an error on Google</a> caused a spoof Greggs logo to flash up with the overlaid slogan: \u201cProviding shit to scum for over 70 years.\u201d Rather than get angry, Greggs replied with grace and charm, offering Google doughnuts if the problem was fixed. Equally, the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/may/16/greggs-pasty-tax-sales-profits\">pasty-tax fiasco</a> allowed Greggs to position itself as the embattled northern charmers against the evil, cash-sucking Tory government. The proposed tax was not aimed at punishing pasty lovers, but partly at levelling the playing field. Some of Greggs\u2019 competition \u2013 fish and chip shops, for example \u2013 have to pay VAT. It is hard to feel too sorry for Greggs\u2019 new competitors such as Pret a Manger or Eat, but high streets up and down the land are littered with the ghosts of old local bakeries killed by Greggs\u2019 power.</p> <p>\u201cEverybody in the industry is watching Greggs, because nobody can quite believe how well it has done,\u201d says Helen Colley, a food consultant who works on cakes for Nando\u2019s and Costa. \u201cGreggs knows its customer base better than most other retailers, and it adapts to demand. It sticks by its principles, and it makes things you want to go back for. It\u2019s great value, but it doesn\u2019t taste cheap. And it is honest. The packaging is simple, and it doesn\u2019t pretend to be healthy. There aren\u2019t any low-sugar cakes. The presentation says: \u2018This is a great big slice of cake and, if you eat it, you are going to enjoy it.\u2019</p> <p>\u201cThere are plenty of little artisan bakeries doing sourdough and avocado and things, but no traditional ones. Greggs is completely on its own, forging ahead.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/jul/24/love-letter-greggs-jake-gyllenhaal\">Here is my love letter to Greggs, with thanks to Jake Gyllenhaal | Joel Golby</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Back at head office, Whiteside is preparing for the next expansion. The rationalisation this week is about creating \u201ccentres of excellence\u201d \u2013 a euphemism for factories specialising in one or two products, rather than making a bit of everything. Greggs\u2019 new focus is on non-high-street sites: hospitals, industrial estates, office parks \u2013 places where there would not have been demand for a bakery, but there might be for baked goods on the go. In 2014, it was reported that the New Cross Hospital in Wolverhampton, where 70% of the population is obese, had the <a href=\"http://www.expressandstar.com/news/2014/08/04/new-cross-hospitals-greggs-the-second-busiest-in-country/\">second-busiest Greggs in the country</a>, which the local <a href=\"http://www.expressandstar.com/news/2014/10/07/health-chiefs-admit-wolverhampton-hospitals-greggs-not-ideal-as-city-tackles-obesity-crisis/\">NHS trust boss described as \u201cnot ideal\u201d</a>.</p> <p>Choosing a site is as much art as science, says Whiteside. \u201cWe use all the data, of course, but there\u2019s no substitute for boot leather. You really need people who know the area. It can be as simple as being on the right of a crossing, not the left. But anything near a bus stop is good news.\u201d </p> <p>The first Greggs-branded shop <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/business/news/greggs-plans-dozen-new-stores-in-northern-ireland-34338969.html\">in Northern Ireland</a> will open soon in Belfast.

But our brand is doing the common uncommonly well. And a big part of our positioning is that we\u2019re market leaders in pasties and sausage rolls. Those are products that only the UK eats.\u201d</p> <p>As ever, it\u2019s hard to look past the sausage rolls.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 5 March 2016. Belfast was incorrectly placed outside the UK in an earlier version because of an editing error.

Even the Observer\u2019s food critic, Jay Rayner, concedes that Greggs is a canny operator. \u201cThey manage to have a very utilitarian high-street presence disguising a rather staunch commitment to a quality product,\u201d he says. \u201cThey have been committed to short supply chains. It\u2019s good stuff, with the caveat that you are talking about massive amounts of carbohydrate.\u201d Obesity is the elephant in the room. All but one of the diners I spoke to couched their love of Greggs in an acknowledgement that it was not the healthiest option, and said that they only stopped by once or twice a week. There are traffic-light labels on all the products, and the company is clear about the calories and fat in its products. But the transparency is only superficial, and the FAQ on the website is full of dead ends. It says that prices vary across branches, but won\u2019t say which is the most expensive or cheapest. (Our investigations team can reveal that on the Seven Sisters Road, Islington, a sausage roll is 90p, 10p more than in Gosforth.) It confirms that the pure palm oil it uses is sustainable, and that it is \u201cworking on\u201d ensuring sustainability across the supply chain \u2013 which invites the question of whether the combined fats it uses might contain the unsustainable variety. And the \u201cfreshly prepared\u201d food that it trumpets is different from being freshly made. Although the bread is finished off in store, it arrives frozen. Assistant manager Brewis told me her life had been made easier by the advent of pre-chopped sandwich fillings and salad ingredients. Another former employee agrees: \u201cThe Mexican chicken sandwiches were a \u2019mare.\u201d In a Guardian piece from 2010, a former employee recounted sprinkling the loaves with powdered egg to help create an even glaze, and loading lettuce \u201cdrowned in chlorine\u201d into sandwiches. Greggs reveals its exact ingredients only on demand. The cheese-and-vegetable pasty recipe its office sends me makes it clear why: there are more than 50 ingredients, of varying familiarity. Hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose, anyone? While the fondness towards the company from staff and customers alike seems to be unforced and universal, there\u2019s no doubt Greggs is helped by a well-greased PR machine, too. A few years ago, an error on Google caused a spoof Greggs logo to flash up with the overlaid slogan: \u201cProviding shit to scum for over 70 years.\u201d Rather than get angry, Greggs replied with grace and charm, offering Google doughnuts if the problem was fixed. Equally, the pasty-tax fiasco allowed Greggs to position itself as the embattled northern charmers against the evil, cash-sucking Tory government. The proposed tax was not aimed at punishing pasty lovers, but partly at levelling the playing field. Some of Greggs\u2019 competition \u2013 fish and chip shops, for example \u2013 have to pay VAT. It is hard to feel too sorry for Greggs\u2019 new competitors such as Pret a Manger or Eat, but high streets up and down the land are littered with the ghosts of old local bakeries killed by Greggs\u2019 power. \u201cEverybody in the industry is watching Greggs, because nobody can quite believe how well it has done,\u201d says Helen Colley, a food consultant who works on cakes for Nando\u2019s and Costa. \u201cGreggs knows its customer base better than most other retailers, and it adapts to demand. It sticks by its principles, and it makes things you want to go back for. It\u2019s great value, but it doesn\u2019t taste cheap. And it is honest. The packaging is simple, and it doesn\u2019t pretend to be healthy. There aren\u2019t any low-sugar cakes. The presentation says: \u2018This is a great big slice of cake and, if you eat it, you are going to enjoy it.\u2019 \u201cThere are plenty of little artisan bakeries doing sourdough and avocado and things, but no traditional ones. Greggs is completely on its own, forging ahead.\u201d Back at head office, Whiteside is preparing for the next expansion. The rationalisation this week is about creating \u201ccentres of excellence\u201d \u2013 a euphemism for factories specialising in one or two products, rather than making a bit of everything. Greggs\u2019 new focus is on non-high-street sites: hospitals, industrial estates, office parks \u2013 places where there would not have been demand for a bakery, but there might be for baked goods on the go. In 2014, it was reported that the New Cross Hospital in Wolverhampton, where 70% of the population is obese, had the second-busiest Greggs in the country, which the local NHS trust boss described as \u201cnot ideal\u201d. Choosing a site is as much art as science, says Whiteside. \u201cWe use all the data, of course, but there\u2019s no substitute for boot leather. You really need people who know the area. It can be as simple as being on the right of a crossing, not the left. But anything near a bus stop is good news.\u201d The first Greggs-branded shop in Northern Ireland will open soon in Belfast. Beyond that, Ireland would be the logical next step. Once all of the UK stores are up to scratch, who knows? Will Greggs take pasties (no longer \u201cCornish\u201d, since EU regulation in 2011) to Japan? \u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019ll rush into that market, no,\u201d says Whiteside with a chuckle. \u201cNever say never. But our brand is doing the common uncommonly well. And a big part of our positioning is that we\u2019re market leaders in pasties and sausage rolls. Those are products that only the UK eats.\u201d As ever, it\u2019s hard to look past the sausage rolls. \u2022 This article was amended on 5 March 2016. Belfast was incorrectly placed outside the UK in an earlier version because of an editing error. The article was further amended on 7 March 2016 to correct a percentage miscalculation; 335 jobs out of 20,000 is 1.7%, not 0.26%.",

But the modern concept of the family office \u2013 an organisation that manages private wealth and other family affairs \u2013 was developed by the financier JP Morgan and the Rockefellers in the 19th century.</p> <p>The number of single-family offices in the UK has more than doubled to around 1,000 since the 2008 financial crash, and they manage more than $1,000bn (\u00a3700bn) in assets, with London now the premier global hub for the secretive organisations. The figures come as researchers from Goldsmiths, University of London and Newcastle University claim the proliferation of family offices is entrenching the rise of inherited wealth and income inequality in Britain.</p> <p>They conclude that the industry has promoted \u201centrenched elitism\u201d, with a growing butler class of financiers and lawyers handsomely rewarded to preserve the wealth and social position of the super-rich.</p> <p>The number of single-family offices worldwide is estimated to have risen by up to 40% since 2008 to 10,000-11,000, with combined investable assets of up to several trillion dollars, according to industry experts. The exact total is difficult to calculate because they are structured in different ways and they are so secretive that some families may have two offices that are not aware of one another.</p> <p>In the UK, those that only manage a single family\u2019s wealth are unlikely to require registration with the <a href=\"http://fca.org.uk/\">Financial Conduct Authority</a>. Therefore, they are subject to far less scrutiny than private banks and hedge funds, despite the size of their assets making family offices influential players in the global economy.</p> <p>These offices serve individual families with investable assets of at least $100m but typically more than $250m, with the top tier managing fortunes of several billion. There are 44,900 individuals with fortunes of at least $100m and 4,500 worth more than $500m, <a href=\"http://publications.credit-suisse.com/tasks/render/file/index.cfm?fileid=C26E3824-E868-56E0-CCA04D4BB9B9ADD5\">according to Credit Suisse</a>. The average assets under management of 157 single-family offices surveyed by Campden Wealth in 2015 was $662m. The uber-wealthy known to have family offices include Bill Gates, former Google boss Eric Schmidt, Oprah Winfrey, the Duke of Westminster, the Sainsbury and Goldsmiths families, and inventor James Dyson. There are now about 1,000 single-family offices in the UK, compared with 400 in 2008, according to Sebastian Dovey of wealth consultancy Scorpio Partnership.</p> <p>Keith Johnston, chief executive of the <a href=\"https://familyofficecouncil.com/\">Family Office Council</a>, which represents 100 single-family offices with combined assets of $100bn, estimated the total assets under management by all offices in the UK was $1,000bn. He added the figure could be higher as there could be as many as 1,800 offices in the country.</p> <p>Johnston said the rise was spurred by the 2008 financial crisis because super-wealthy families were \u201cvery cheesed off with their private banks\u201d because of the poor performance of their investments. \u201cThey decided to take more control and create a structure which they felt was \u2026 entirely doing their bidding,\u201d he added.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c21ca6258910baa5b50d16d729a865bef8a6705d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c21ca6258910baa5b50d16d729a865bef8a6705d/0_83_3831_2298/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Bill Gates\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Bill Gates has a family office.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ted S Warren/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Karen Clark, managing director of the Family Office Exchange, which represents 450 single-family offices worldwide with median assets of just more than $500m, said the rise was also spurred by the subsequent spike in the number of ultra-high net worth individuals, especially since the economic upturn from 2011-12. Over the next 30 years, they will transfer $16tn in assets, which will increase the need for family offices, <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.wealthx.com/articles/2015/five-family-office-trends-2015/\">according to analysts Wealth-X</a>.</p> <p>Clark added that London had become the prime location for family offices, not only because of the high concentration of financial and luxury lifestyle services available to meet the needs of the global super-rich but also because it offered a safe haven for those from Russia, China and the Middle East, and a more favourable tax and regulatory environment than its chief rival, New York.</p> <p>The surge in family offices has also led to exponential growth in a wealthy butler class as the organisations employ three-to-12 core staff, including chief executives and chief investment officers, who are usually senior bankers and investment analysts. Major banks, accountancy and legal firms, and estate agents have also established dedicated teams for super-rich families.</p> <p>Single-family office CEOs typically earn $330,000, according to <a href=\"http://www.globalfamilyofficereport.com/\">Campden Wealth\u2019s 2015 Global Family Office report</a>. But Mark Somers, founder of <a href=\"http://www.somerspartnership.com/\">wealth management recruitment firm Somers Partnership</a>, said those employed by the largest family offices, with assets of several billion, could earn \u201ceasily double or triple that\u201d. They may also receive bonuses of up to $400,000, according to the <a href=\"http://familyoffices.com/\">Family Office Club</a>. Other rewards include use of the family\u2019s properties or private jets.</p> <p>Only the largest family offices, which can have more than 100 employees, usually provide in-house lifestyle management services, according to the Goldsmiths and Newcastle study. The concierge staff organise everything to the liking of the family\u2019s members, wherever they are in the world: \u201cEverything would be taken care of, globally, so that the right kind of drinks would be available in the car that picked them up, on the plane, and so on. Upon arrival, the properties would be perfect, not just clean but recently decorated to the owner\u2019s specification with permanent staff whose job it was to take care of maintenance and gardening.\u201d</p> <p>The study aims to illuminate how family offices create dynasties by maintaining the wealth and lifestyles of the global super-rich. Co-author Luna Glucksberg attended a family-offices conference in a hotel in a converted castle in the Swiss Alps, which heard that only 10% of super-rich families manage to retain their wealth over three generations.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/aug/27/number-of-millionaires-in-uk-rises-by-200000\">One in 65 UK adults now a millionaire, figures show</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The study said the most successful families shared a vision of the purpose of their wealth over future generations.

                "bodyText":"Behind smart Georgian facades in prime West End addresses a little-known industry that serves the growing numbers of the global super-rich in London is booming. Boasting marble foyers and plushly carpeted meeting rooms, some of these companies might be mistaken for luxury hotels. In fact, they are private offices that manage family wealth that can compare with the assets of FTSE 250 companies such as Tate &amp; Lyle and Debenhams. Family offices have their roots in the sixth century when a king\u2019s steward held responsibility for managing royal wealth, a model later adopted by many aristocrats, according to accountancy firm EY. But the modern concept of the family office \u2013 an organisation that manages private wealth and other family affairs \u2013 was developed by the financier JP Morgan and the Rockefellers in the 19th century. The number of single-family offices in the UK has more than doubled to around 1,000 since the 2008 financial crash, and they manage more than $1,000bn (\u00a3700bn) in assets, with London now the premier global hub for the secretive organisations. The figures come as researchers from Goldsmiths, University of London and Newcastle University claim the proliferation of family offices is entrenching the rise of inherited wealth and income inequality in Britain. They conclude that the industry has promoted \u201centrenched elitism\u201d, with a growing butler class of financiers and lawyers handsomely rewarded to preserve the wealth and social position of the super-rich. The number of single-family offices worldwide is estimated to have risen by up to 40% since 2008 to 10,000-11,000, with combined investable assets of up to several trillion dollars, according to industry experts. The exact total is difficult to calculate because they are structured in different ways and they are so secretive that some families may have two offices that are not aware of one another. In the UK, those that only manage a single family\u2019s wealth are unlikely to require registration with the Financial Conduct Authority. Therefore, they are subject to far less scrutiny than private banks and hedge funds, despite the size of their assets making family offices influential players in the global economy. These offices serve individual families with investable assets of at least $100m but typically more than $250m, with the top tier managing fortunes of several billion. There are 44,900 individuals with fortunes of at least $100m and 4,500 worth more than $500m, according to Credit Suisse. The average assets under management of 157 single-family offices surveyed by Campden Wealth in 2015 was $662m. The uber-wealthy known to have family offices include Bill Gates, former Google boss Eric Schmidt, Oprah Winfrey, the Duke of Westminster, the Sainsbury and Goldsmiths families, and inventor James Dyson. There are now about 1,000 single-family offices in the UK, compared with 400 in 2008, according to Sebastian Dovey of wealth consultancy Scorpio Partnership. Keith Johnston, chief executive of the Family Office Council, which represents 100 single-family offices with combined assets of $100bn, estimated the total assets under management by all offices in the UK was $1,000bn. He added the figure could be higher as there could be as many as 1,800 offices in the country. Johnston said the rise was spurred by the 2008 financial crisis because super-wealthy families were \u201cvery cheesed off with their private banks\u201d because of the poor performance of their investments. \u201cThey decided to take more control and create a structure which they felt was \u2026 entirely doing their bidding,\u201d he added. Karen Clark, managing director of the Family Office Exchange, which represents 450 single-family offices worldwide with median assets of just more than $500m, said the rise was also spurred by the subsequent spike in the number of ultra-high net worth individuals, especially since the economic upturn from 2011-12. Over the next 30 years, they will transfer $16tn in assets, which will increase the need for family offices, according to analysts Wealth-X. Clark added that London had become the prime location for family offices, not only because of the high concentration of financial and luxury lifestyle services available to meet the needs of the global super-rich but also because it offered a safe haven for those from Russia, China and the Middle East, and a more favourable tax and regulatory environment than its chief rival, New York. The surge in family offices has also led to exponential growth in a wealthy butler class as the organisations employ three-to-12 core staff, including chief executives and chief investment officers, who are usually senior bankers and investment analysts. Major banks, accountancy and legal firms, and estate agents have also established dedicated teams for super-rich families. Single-family office CEOs typically earn $330,000, according to Campden Wealth\u2019s 2015 Global Family Office report. But Mark Somers, founder of wealth management recruitment firm Somers Partnership, said those employed by the largest family offices, with assets of several billion, could earn \u201ceasily double or triple that\u201d. They may also receive bonuses of up to $400,000, according to the Family Office Club. Other rewards include use of the family\u2019s properties or private jets. Only the largest family offices, which can have more than 100 employees, usually provide in-house lifestyle management services, according to the Goldsmiths and Newcastle study. The concierge staff organise everything to the liking of the family\u2019s members, wherever they are in the world: \u201cEverything would be taken care of, globally, so that the right kind of drinks would be available in the car that picked them up, on the plane, and so on. Upon arrival, the properties would be perfect, not just clean but recently decorated to the owner\u2019s specification with permanent staff whose job it was to take care of maintenance and gardening.\u201d The study aims to illuminate how family offices create dynasties by maintaining the wealth and lifestyles of the global super-rich. Co-author Luna Glucksberg attended a family-offices conference in a hotel in a converted castle in the Swiss Alps, which heard that only 10% of super-rich families manage to retain their wealth over three generations. The study said the most successful families shared a vision of the purpose of their wealth over future generations. The mechanisms employed by family offices to achieve this include creating family constitutions, which set out rules the family members have to follow, such as attending annual or biannual meetings, which keep the various branches and generations together. The rules \u201cmay state that all family members have to get their spouses to sign \u2018pre-nups\u2019 to protect the family capital. It may stipulate how succession is worked out, how inheritances are planned or what happens when family members are not interested in \u2026 family businesses.\u201d The researchers write that family offices do not just prepare the money for the children, but prepare the children for the money: \u201cThe wealth needs to be preserved just as well as the family line \u2026 It is about creating dynasties.\u201d Family office associations said children could be incentivised to generate their own wealth by match-funding: giving them a sum from the family\u2019s assets equivalent to their independent earning. Johnston said some family offices encouraged entrepreneurship by enabling the offspring of the super-wealthy to turn their hobbies into businesses. For example, he said the son of a Middle East magnate, who had no interest in the family business, was given funding to set up a gallery because he collected art. Mike Savage, professor of sociology at the London School of Economics and author of Social Class in the 21st Century, criticised family offices for promoting the rise in inherited wealth, which now accounts for 70% of total wealth in Britain and is expected to rise to 80% by 2050.

The OBR confirmed before the budget last week that the chancellor would miss his target of reducing the deficit in every year of the parliament.</p> <p>It also said the welfare cap would be breached in every year under the current projections for the government\u2019s finances. But Osborne remains on target to create a surplus in five years, achieving his third target. However, as a result of the PIP U-turn, it might not be as large as the \u00a310m indicated in the government\u2019s projections.</p> <p>Chote said there was still a 55% chance of the budget surplus being achieved.

                "bodyText":"Despite falls in travel and leisure shares in the wake of the explosions in Belgium, stock markets managed to hold firm amid the latest terrorist attacks. Even the hard hit holiday and airline companies managed to recover from their lows, and Jasper Lawler, market analyst at CMC Markets, said: The sad reality is that the more frequent these kinds of events become, the more markets become immune and the response in prices becomes less dramatic. Tony Cross at Trustnet Direct said: The FTSE 100 showed some resilience on Tuesday following the latest terrorist atrocities to befall a major European city... Stockmarkets immediately came under pressure, but having falling sharply after the attack London\u2019s blue chip index managed to recover.. its losses. Amid the chaos, however, uncertainty lingered over how much this attack would disrupt travel across Europe. It will be difficult to put an exact figure not just on the cost of lost tourism, the heartbeat of most cities, but of the extra security needed to combat the terrorists. Airlines and tour operators, the likes of TUI, IAG, Intercontinental Hotels and Carnival, all fell. So after recovering from their immediate falls, the final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished up 0.13% or 8.16 points at 6192.74 Germany\u2019s Dax edged up 0.42% to 9990.00 France\u2019s Cac closed up 0.09% at 4431.97 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB was virtually flat, up just 0.01% to 18,698.89 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended down 0.32% at 8992.0 In Greece, the Athens market added 0.48% to 544.30 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up just 9 points or 0.05%. Gold has added $4 an ounce to $1247 as investors sought havens amid the uncertainty, while Brent crude is up 0.46% to $41.73, recovering from earlier falls. On that note, it\u2019s time to close for the evening. Thanks for all your comments and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. Here\u2019s our report on the appearance of Robert Chote of the Office for Budget Responsibility before the Treasure Select Committee. Phillip Inman writes: The Treasury will breach its self-imposed welfare cap by \u00a320bn over the duration of the current parliament following the U-turn on disability benefits, the government\u2019s spending watchdog has confirmed. The Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) said the reversal of a cut in personal independence payments (PIPs)would add another \u00a31.3bn a year to a welfare budget that was already \u00a32.7bn over a limit set by George Osborne before the general election last May. Speaking to MPs on the Treasury select committee, the OBR chairman, Robert Chote, said the move would increase the deficit but would not prevent the chancellor from delivering a budget surplus in the year before the next general election. The welfare cap is one of three targets set by Osborne to measure the success of his economic management. The OBR confirmed before the budget last week that the chancellor would miss his target of reducing the deficit in every year of the parliament. It also said the welfare cap would be breached in every year under the current projections for the government\u2019s finances. But Osborne remains on target to create a surplus in five years, achieving his third target. However, as a result of the PIP U-turn, it might not be as large as the \u00a310m indicated in the government\u2019s projections. Chote said there was still a 55% chance of the budget surplus being achieved. He also denied that a cut in migration after a possible exit from the EU would throw the chancellor off course. The full story is here: Here\u2019s Capital Economics on the day\u2019s manufacturing PMIs: Preliminary PMIs published by Markit today suggest that, having slowed sharply in February, manufacturing growth in advanced economies remained very weak in March. The flash manufacturing PMIs rose slightly for the euro-zone and US, but fell in Japan. As a result, a weighted average of the three edged down from 51.0 to 50.9, its lowest level since June 2013. On past form, this is consistent with GDP growth in advanced economies of just under 1%. Oil is have a volatile day, falling back following the news of the Brussels attacks before steadying again on hopes that a meeting in April could come to a deal to freeze output at January levels. Brent crude is currently up 0.29% at $41.66 a barrel, having earlier fallen as low as $40.97. On services, the Richmond Fed said: Activity in the service sector improved in March following February\u2019s weakness... Growth in revenues, employment, and wages strengthened across the board, with particular intensity in the retail subsector. Retail sales rose sharply compared to a month ago, along with gains in big-ticket sales and heavier shopper traffic. Retail inventories increased dramatically. At other services firms, revenues grew modestly. Survey respondents anticipated good business prospects during the six months ahead. The Richmond Fed manufacturing index reading of 22 was the highest since April 2010. The Fed said: Shipments and the volume of new orders increased this month. Employment advanced at a slightly faster pace in March, while average wages grew moderately and the average workweek lengthened. Prices of raw materials and finished goods rose at a faster pace compared to last month. Manufacturers anticipated robust business conditions during the next six months. Firms expected faster growth in shipments and in new orders in the six months ahead. Additionally, survey participants looked for increased capacity utilization and expected order backlogs to grow. Producers looked for vendor lead times to lengthen modestly. Survey participants\u2019 outlook for the months ahead also included faster growth in average wages and the average workweek, with a pickup in hiring during the next six months. Over the next six months, manufacturers expected faster growth in prices paid and received. Minutes after the Markit manufacturing PMI came in lower than expected, another survey paints a more optmistic picture. The Richmond Federal Reserve composite manufacturing index has jumped to 22 in March compared to -4 in February and an expected level of -1. And the services revenues index was 9 compared to -2 in February. As for US jobs: US manufacturing improved in March but slightly less than expected, according to a new survey. The initial manufacturing PMI index from Markit has come in at 51.4 compared to 51.3 in February and a forecast of 51.9. The new orders index was up from 52.3 to 52.8. Following the attacks in Brussels, US markets have fallen in early trading as investors worry about geopolitical risks. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently 44 points or 0.24% lower, while the S&amp;P 500 opened down 0.28% and Nasdaq dropped 0.53%. European shares have been gradually falling further during the day, with the FTSE 100 now down 22 points or 0.37%, Germany\u2019s Dax down 0.57% and France\u2019s Cac 1.04% lower. But, as is usual when riskier assets are out of favour, gold and silver have both moved higher. Chancellor George Osborne is speaking in parliament now, in the 2016 Budget debate. Andrew Sparrow is covering all the action in his Politics Liveblog: Iain Duncan Smith\u2019s name didn\u2019t come up, but the former Work and Pensions Secretary was the elephant in the Thatcher Room today. MPs from both sides quizzed the Office for Budget Responsibility over the government\u2019s U-turn over disability benefits (called PIPs) following IDS\u2019s resignation, and the impact on the public finances. And they may be quite happy with the results. 1) Robert Chote has not changed his view that Britain has a 55% chance of achieving a surplus by 2019-2020. The OBR chief confirmed that a \u00a34.4bn black hole has now opened up in the budget, after the government confirmed last night that the abandoned PIP savings will not be filled by further cuts to welfare. However, he insists that the impact on the long-term outlook for the UK is not \u201cmaterial\u201d, in fiscal terms. 2) Under questioning by John Mann MP, Chote did concede that the \u00a34bn black hole will slightly cut the chances that George Osborne hits his fiscal rule. But Chote later agreed that the \u00a34bn black hole could be wiped out if the UK grows a little faster than currently forecast. 3) Chote stuck to his statement that George Osborne has shuffled revenue and spending around, helping to keep Britain on track for a surplus in 2019-20. However, he doesn\u2019t believe it is actually an accounting wheeze, even though corporation tax changes have been delayed to deliver \u00a36bn in revenue in that financial year. 4) The PIP u-turn means the UK government will breach Osborne\u2019s welfare cap by an even wider margin than before, the committee heard. Chote agreed with Rachel Reeves\u2019s assessment that it will blow through the cap by \u00a320bn over a five-year period. 5) Chote said that Osborne had \u201cselectively\u201d quoted the OBR over the EU referendum question. [The chancellor didn\u2019t tell MPs the OBR hadn\u2019t actually included Brexit risks in its forecasts]. 6) The committee also exposed some uncertainty over how changes to business rates will hit local councils. They could lose \u00a31.7bn once more small firms stop paying rates. 7) The OBR also conceded that households will be running unprecedentedly deeper deficits by 2020. That could raise the risks of a sterling crisis. 8) And finally, Chote also touched on the Chancellor\u2019s track-record of spending the occasional fiscal windfalls provided by OBR forecast changes. Others must judge whether this fine-tuning is sensible, Chote hinted. Committee chair Andrew Tyrie reckons it is not. And finally, Andrew Tyrie turns to the impact of the OBR\u2019s forecasting changes. Are you surprised that the chancellor has decided to change his plans twice a year, in response to your revisions?? George Osborne spent the \u00a327bn \u2018windfall\u2019 which the OBR handed him in the autumn statement, and is now trying to plug a gap at some political cost.... Chote says that there is inevitably some noise in the forecasts OBR produce for the Chancellor. Last November\u2019s revision was relatively small, compared to previous changes [and has been reversed by the gloomier new forecasts]. So a chancellor must decide how to handle this noise. It has been \u201cthe revealed preference recently\u201d for most of those changes to be offset, Chote puts it diplomatically. Only an economist could give that answer, Tyrie response. Chote then explains that it is a consequence of fiscal targets. The Chancellor has clearly seized a \u00a310bn surplus as 2019-20 as a desirable feature of successive forecasts It is for others to judge whether the degree of fine-tuning required is a sensible response to the noise in the pre-measures forecasts, or not. We are an environment when many counties are setting fiscal rules, so there is a question about how quickly policymakers respond to forecasting changes. It seems to me, Tyrie replies, that there is a good degree of logic to taking a longer-term view. Chote can\u2019t, quite, be persuaded to agree. He says: I can see the logic of your position, but it would be inappropriate of me [to comment]... It\u2019s not our job to say how policy should be set. Oh Robert, Tyrie sighs. Is there not even the hint of an emotional response? I will save it for my farewell appearance, the OBR chief giggles. And with that, he\u2019s up and off. Tyrie will surely hold him to that pledge. The hearing is over. I\u2019ll post a summary now. Jacob Rees-Mogg then turns to the sugar tax. Why do you think there is a \u00a31bn set-up cost, before a saving of \u00a3500m per year? That \u00a31bn cost comes from the inflationary impact of the move. More expensive sugary drinks will raise the inflation rate by 0.25% in the first year, which pushes up the interest rate Britain pays on inflation-linked gilts (called linkers). There\u2019s a small transfer \u201cfrom drinkers to linkers\u201d, Chote says. So will it significantly reduce the consumption of sugar? That\u2019s not something we can answer, Chote says. The OBR has considered how the move will affect customer behaviour, but not exactly what they will drink more and less of. Rees-Mogg: If the sugar tax pushes inflation up, then won\u2019t people on inflation-linked benefits get more money which they can then spend on sugary drinks? Chote suggests that many benefits could still be frozen, rather than rising inline with inflation. Not pensioners, though, thanks to the triple-lock (pensions rise in line with inflation, or by at least 2%) So that means pensioners can still afford tonic with their gin, but young people won\u2019t be able to afford coke, Rees-Mogg concludes. It\u2019s Jacob Rees Mogg\u2019s turn. The Conservative MP and Brexit supporter turns to the EU referendum: He asks if Chote is happy about the way that George Osborne only quoted part of your statement on the impact of the referendum. Didn\u2019t the chancellor rather over-egg the pudding by quoting your line about the \u201cnegative implications\u201d of Brexit, but not mentioning that you haven\u2019t actually judged the impact? Chote confirms that long-term impact of staying in, or leaving, the EU does not fall within the OBR\u2019s five-year forecasting horizon. But we have to be \u201crealistic\u201d, Chote continues. The chancellor only devoted 230 words to our statement - there\u2019s more than 230 words in it. But anyone who read the whole statement would understand our position. It\u2019s not \u201cthe first or the last time that things are selectively quoted\u201d, Chote continues, but the chancellor didn\u2019t misrepresent us. It\u2019s not like when the prime minister misrepresented the OBR\u2019s position [by claiming that the OBR said that austerity had not harmed growth] So is being quoted out of context one of the risks of political life, Rees-Mogg asks? It\u2019s historically not unprecedented, Chote replies. Stephen Hammond then asks about the \u00a34bn in disability payment cuts that have been dropped. What sort of improvement to growth figures would we need to cover that? Chote replies that it would only need a very small change to cover \u00a34bn, given the size of the UK economy. Conservative MP Stephen Hammond turns to the chancellor\u2019s warning about a \u2018cocktail of risks\u2019 facing Britain. How much impact did they have on the OBR\u2019s new forecasts? Most of the downward movement in our forecasts was due to our downgraded view of UK productivity, says Robert Chote, rather than the risks from overseas. Steve Baker then asks what discussions the OBR had with the Treasury over its treatment of the EU referendum, and the Brexit question. We met with the chancellor on the 7th (March) and explained our approach, Robert Chote replies. As usual we sent a draft for checking, they pointed out that we had misinterpreted something Deutsche Bank had said. But that was all. Steve Baker then asks why the OBR thinks government borrowing costs are going to rise, when they\u2019ve actually been falling steadily. Chote says that the OBR has used financial market expectations What happens if sovereign debt costs keep falling, as much as they can do? Will that affect your forecasts? That will depend why it happens, Chote replies, and whether it is because the global economy is weaker than expected. [Britain can currently sell 10-year gilts at around 1.5% per year, which is close to a record low] Steve Baker MP asks whether Bank of England governor Mark Carney is making the OBR\u2019s job harder, when he talks about possible interest rate moves. Robert Chote says that the ability of central bankers to actually move the curve of interest rate expectations is a matter for debate..... Over to Steve Baker, Conservative MP, who thanks the OBR for another excellent report. He then asks why the OBR expects interest rates to dip and not to rise until 2019, while the Bank of England governor has told the committee that the next move is probably up. How do you feel about the Bank of England saying your forecasts are wrong? Robert Chote repeats his earlier point, that the OBR has taken market expectations for interest rate rises. Baker points out that the OBR\u2019s report shows that interest rate forecasts, productivity forecasts and oil price forecasts have all been wildly wrong in the past. Is there any value in them? Chote explains that the OBR uses the same approach at the IMF on oil - to use futures prices for the next couple of years. That works sometimes, but not always [not for oil recently] Baker then slips in a jibe about those flawed forecasts: I\u2019d recommend them to any student of economics, and indeed astrology.... SNP MP George Kerevan asks the OBR to justify its forecast that UK productivity growth will rise from 0.1% to 2%. A twenty-fold increase! Robert Chote argues that this isn\u2019t an unrealistic forecast, as 2% is close to the pre-crisis trend. And his colleague Stephen Nickell explains that productivity was badly hit by the financial crisis and should now recover. However, the OBS has also revised down its productivity forecasts, given improvements since 2008 have been disappointing. Chote says the OBR is trying assess two very different periods - a pre-crisis time of solid productivity, and a post-crisis time of weak productivity. You have to make a judgement about where to draw the line and judge the proper long-term average average. He then points out that US forecasters have subsequently come up with very similar forecasts for productivity. That\u2019s not a defence, argues Kereven. You\u2019re just picking data that matches your case. It\u2019s not a defence, it\u2019s a fact, Chote says. Rachel Reeves MP is also tweeting the answers to her questions: Helen Goodman MP is tweeting from the hearing: Andrew Tyrie asks Steve Nicholls to clarify his warning about interest rate rises possibly triggering recession. If there was a sharp rise in interest rates, brought about by a large trade deficit hitting the pound, that would have a negative impact on household consumption, Nicholls repeats. Define \u201csharp rise\u201d please. Up to 5%, from 0.5% today, in a year, Nicholls explains. Mark Garnier MP focuses on the risk of a sterling crisis. Could we see a \u2018bad scenario\u2019 when the Bank of England is forced to raise interest rates to prop up the pound, just as the economy is deteriorating? The OBR Stephen Nicholls confirms that such a rise in interest rates would cut household consumption. The benefit to some households would be outweighed by the negative consequences - overall consumption would fall, and that would probably lead to a recession. That danger is not in the OBR\u2019s central forecast, though. So is there a sniff of the financial crisis? That is certainly not a phrase I would use, Chote. But you can look at the various scenarios we have considered. Conservative Mark Garnier goes next. You are predicting a current account deficit will be 3.5% of GDP in 2010, a surplus of 0.5% of GDP, but a 3% deficit for households. Is that really sustainable? Chote say that you can\u2019t see that sort of household deficit in the historical data - so to that extent, it\u2019s unprecedented. But the current picture of record low interest rates is also unprecedented, leading to various sectoral imbalances. Some economist could look at that picture, and suggest it is a recipe for problems - perhaps a fall in the value of sterling. OBR committee member Stephen Nickell points out, though, that households look in very good shape if you look at the value of their assets against their debts. But that\u2019s because we\u2019ve had an asset price boom, chairman Andrew Tyrie responds. Rachel Reeves then points out that the OBR has cut its estimate of the household savings ratio from 4.2% to 3.9% -- does that mean that the new ISA changes aren\u2019t expected to boost saving? Chote suggests this is not a verdict on the government\u2019s changes. He says the OBR expects higher consumer spending over the parliament, which will have a knock-on effect on the amount they save. Rachel Reeves turns to the changes to ISAs, which are due to cost \u00a32bn. How much of that is due to raising the annual allowance limit from \u00a315,000 to \u00a320,000, and how much is from the new lifetime ISA? The OBR doesn\u2019t know for sure, but estimate that most (perhaps 80%) is from the new lifetime ISA (designed to encourage under-40s to save by giving then \u00a31 for every \u00a34 they put in). Reeves explains that she believes the ISA limit changes will really only help the wealthiest. The OBR\u2019s Graham Parker confirms that it will only help those who already save the maximum. Conservative MP Steve Baker, a committee member, is tweeting some charts from the OBR: Labour\u2019s Rachel Reeves goes next, with an instruction from Andrew Tyrie to get some more joie de vivre out of Chote. I\u2019ll do my best, she replies, and asks about the welfare cap. Chote confirms that the government is on track to miss its new welfare cap by around \u00a320bn over the lifetime of the parliament, due to its u-turn on the personal independence payments (PIP) disability benefit. Mann turns to migration. The ORB\u2019s forecasts are based on net migration of 900,000 - so can we hit the surplus target if this changes? [perhaps if Britain leaves the EU] Out comes the OBR\u2019s forecasts again. Chote explains that they used three different estimates for migration - high, medium, and low. That raises or lowers the surplus by \u00a34.5bn, which isn\u2019t enough to take it below zero. Robert Chote breaks into a smile as John Mann turns to the corporation tax \u2018shuffle\u2019. Tyrie calls him up on it - you seem to show particular emotions when this issue comes up, he teases the OBR boss. It\u2019s just my natural joie de vivre, Chote twinkles. Anyway, what is the chances of the government getting the \u00a36bn corporation tax windfall in 2019-20, asks Mann. We give it a medium-low uncertainty, the OBR team explain. Companies have to pay corporation tax*; many other fiscal measure have much higher uncertainty. * - even Google, these days..... Your report predicts that the Bank of England will cut interest rates, John Mann continues. Chote replies that the OBR has looked at what the financial markets are predicting. And those \u2018swaps\u2019 suggest a chance that borrowing costs will come down to a fresh record low this year. Labour\u2019s John Mann goes next, and returns to the issue of the chances of hitting the surplus by 2019-2020 now that the PIP disability cuts have been ditched. Surely it is less than 55% now, given these savings have been cut? There is still a 55% chance, when measured to the nearest 5%, Chote explains, adding: But yes, if you\u2019ve got less money the chance is lower, but not materially lower. But the PIP u-turn creates a \u00a34bn black hole, Mann points out. Surely that takes the chances of a surplus down to 50%? Not given the scale of the budget and the various uncertainties, Chote insists. He points to the fan-chart in the OBR\u2019s forecasts, which show that the PIP changes will not materially shift the odds. So are you saying yes, or no, asks Tyrie? Chote says: The probability of achieving a surplus is lower. But to the nearest 5% it\u2019s still 55% but it\u2019s closer than 50% than before. But it\u2019s still closer to 55% than 50%, the OBR\u2019s Graham Parker adds. I think that\u2019s a Yes Minister-style \u201cYes and No\u201d answer. Helen Goodman then asks about the government\u2019s pledge not to make extra welfare cuts in this parliament, as part of the disability cuts u-turn. Is it really credible for the government to hit its budget targets, as so many government departments are now ringfenced from cuts? Robert Chote replies that it\u2019s not up to to the OBR to say if it\u2019s credible or not. It\u2019s simply a matter of arithmetic that savings must come from the unringfenced areas. Within any given amount, the more you protect the more the unprotected bit is affected, he adds. Labour\u2019s Helen Goodman asks if the government is compensating local councils for changes to business rates (which mean more small firms will be exempt from paying rates). This prompts a long, and confusing, discussion and much flicking through the OBR\u2019s latest forecasts. Chote concludes that these changes will cost \u00a31.7bn -- and are part of the \u00a33.5bn of undefined spending cuts and efficiency changes. But the OBR will report back on exactly whether local councils are being compensated, or not, by the latest budget decisions. Chote gets to the nub of the issue: How are public sector pensions contributing \u00a32bn to the fiscal consolidation in 2019-20? Chote says the budget shows that the Treasury will not compensate departments for the cost of public sector pension rises, so the money must come from existing spending. How did the OBR handle the \u00a33.5bn of future undefined welfare spending in the budget? Chote says that it\u2019s hard to assess exactly how this will effect departmental spending in several years time. So the OBR assumed that some of the money would come from departmental underspending. He also points out that the savings are coming from an \u201cefficiency review\u201d. It\u2019s not our role to say if they are actually efficiency savings or cuts, he explains, whether you are getting more bang for your buck, or simply less buck. So did the government simply add these undefined savings to make the numbers work? Chote says that governments always set the full envelope of public spending. Have you come under pressure from the government over your forecast, asks Tyrie. Not at all, Chote replies. Tyrie points out that Chote has reported being \u201crobust\u201d under pressure from the Treasury in the past. He hopes that efforts to \u2018beef up\u2019 the OBR\u2019s memorandum of understanding with the government have helped. The attention that you have brought to this issue has already discouraged that traffic, Chote smiles. Why did you say that the chancellor had \u201cshuffled\u201d some revenue around in the budget, asks Andrew Tyrie. Chote explains that the government has given UK companies more time to adjust to a new system of quarterly corporation tax changes. And that effect is to \u201cshift\u201d \u00a310bn of revenue from 2017-18 and 2018-19 to 2019-20 and 2010-2021. Chote says that the biggest change is an extra \u00a36bn in 2019-2020 (when the government is aiming for a surplus) Q: So you are calling it a shuffle, not an accounting wheeze? Yes, the treatment is straightforward, Chote says, due to the way that Britain treats corporation tax. Tyrie says that the OBR should assess its policy of only publishing new forecasts before the budget and the autumn statement, rather than reacting when the government changes policy. Andrew Tyrie, committee chairman, begins the hearing by asking about the OBR\u2019s treatment of the UK\u2019s surplus target. You attached a 55% probability of the fiscal surplus rule being met by 2019-20, but that was before the government decided to drop plans for PIP disability cuts, says Tyrie. So what is the new probability? Robert Chose says the OBR uses a fan chart to assess the probability of hitting various targets. And given the size of the UK budget, if you take away the \u00a31.3bn in PIP payments, you still get a 55% probability of a surplus before the end of the parliament. But clearly if you drilled right down into the numbers, it would be a slightly lower probability. So are you arguing that this is De minimis for the purposes of the 55% probability, asks Tyrie? Yes, the \u00a31.3bn is not large in the context of other probabilities, but that\u2019s not to downplay the importance of that sum, Chote replies. Over in parliament, the Treasury committee is taking evidence from the Office for Budget Responsibility about the 2016 budget. They will hear from: Robert Chote, the OBR chairman Stephen Nickell, a member of the OBR budget responsibility committee Graham Parker, the third member of its budget responsibility committee It is being streamed live here. While consumer inflation is still low, UK house price inflation has hit a 12-month high. UK house prices climbed 7.9% in January compared with the same month last year, the Office for National Statistics says. London and the South East led the way: Simon French of Panmure Gordon agrees that Osborne is going to miss his budget target, unless there is some tweaking of the data... Chancellor George Osborne is on the brink of breaking his borrowing target for the current financial year. The latest public finance figures, just released, show that Britain borrowed \u00a37.1bn in February, more than expected. That pushes total borrowing since April 2015 up to \u00a370.7bn. Osborne is aiming to borrow \u00a372.2bn in the overall financial year, and it\u2019s very likely that March\u2019s borrowing will push him over the limit. According to the Office for National Statistics, March\u2019s borrowing would have to be the lowest since 2004 for Osborne to keep within his target. Fraser Munro of the Office for National Statistics has tweeted the key details: He also flags up how Britain\u2019s national debt is still steadily rising. This chart from the UK inflation report shows that food, drink and transport costs are still cheaper than a year ago, although the pace of the declines is falling. The Office for National Statistics explains: Since the start of 2015, prices for transport costs, food and non-alcoholic beverages and (to a lesser extent) recreational and cultural goods and services have had a downward pull on the rate of inflation. These have been counterbalanced by an upward pull from price movements for other goods and services, most notably restaurant and hotel bills, and education costs such as university tuition fees. Breaking: The UK\u2019s headline inflation rate remained at 0.3% annually in February, weaker than economists had expected. Analysts at Moody\u2019s Investor Services have warned that the budget unveiled by George Osborne last week is \u2018credit negative\u2019. They are unimpressed by the latest economic forecasts, showing weaker growth, and the fact that Britain will borrow more than \u00a330bn more than planned between now and 2019. They say: Firstly, the budget incorporates a significant downward revision to the economic growth outlook for the coming years compared to just a few months ago, with real GDP growth now expected to average 2.1% over the 2016-19 period, 0.3 percentage points lower than in the November budget statement. \u00bb Secondly, the budget revises deficit forecasts upwards (by between 0.4% and 0.8% of GDP) for each of the next three years.... Hence, compared to the government\u2019s earlier targets, the pace of fiscal consolidation is now markedly slower, and the UK\u2019s public finances will remain weaker for a longer period of time. This is credit negative, given that the UK still has one of the largest budget deficits among its EU peers, such as Austria, Finland (both rated Aaa negative) and comparable to France (Aa2 stable). This isn\u2019t a formal rating decision from Moody\u2019s, who stripped Britain of its prized AAA rating in 2013. It does suggest, though, that another downgrade is possible if economic conditions don\u2019t improve.... German think tank IFO has reported a rise in economic confidence across Germany. It\u2019s business climate index has picked up to 106.7 this month, from 105.7 in February. New UK public sector borrowing figure are also released at 9.30am, alongside the inflation numbers. They are expected to show that Britain borrowed \u00a35.4bn to balance the books in February, following an \u00a311.8bn surplus in January. Germany\u2019s private sector is growing steadily this month, according to the latest data from Europe\u2019s largest member. However, there are also signs that demand may be waning. Markit\u2019s German composite PMI has come in at 54.1, unchanged from February. As with France, service sector firms reported faster growth while factories are lagging. The flash \u2018Services Activity Index\u2019 rose to a three-month high of 55.5. The flash Germany Manufacturing PMI, though, dipped to 50.4, from 50.5, showing the slowest growth in 16 months. Oliver Kolodseike, economist at Markit, cautions: It looks as if momentum in the German economy will remain sluggish in the months ahead, as slowing new order growth was accompanied by the weakest increase in backlogs of work since the summer of last year. Furthermore, there are signs that subdued demand is now also affecting the labour market, as the rate of job creation eased to a near one-year low. Back to the economic data. France\u2019s private sector is growing at its fastest rate in five months. Strong service sector growth made up for a weaker performance from France\u2019s factories, according to data firm Markit. A much-needed rise in new business helped to push up activity. Its French composite output index, which measures activity across the sector, rose to 51.1 this month, up from 49.3 in February (any reading over 50 = growth). The services sector\u2019s PMI jumped to 51.2, from 49.2, but manufacturing dipped to 49.6 from 50.2. \uf0a7Jack Kennedy, Senior Economist at Markit, says: \u201cThe French private sector economy ended the first quarter on a more positive note, reversing the dip in output seen during February.\u201d European stock markets are falling in early trading, led by a sharp selloff in airline and holiday firms. That follows an explosion at Brussels Airport around an hour ago, injuring passengers and reportedly causing fatalities (this isn\u2019t officially confirmed yet, though). Tony Cross of TrustNet Direct explains: The dark cloud of terrorism appears to have returned to haunt European markets this morning with reports of fatal explosions at Brussels airport weighing heavily on sentiment. Companies reliant on tourism are, understandably, leading the stock market fallers. Shares in Thomas Cook slumped by 4.8%; it had already warned today that bookings are down this year, partly due to lower demand for Turkish holidays following a terrorist attack in Istanbul. Rival firm TUI fell by 2%. EasyJet, IAG (owner of British Airways) and Lufthansa are all down over 3%, with hotel groups such as Intercontinental Hotel losing 2.5%. My colleagues are covering the latest developments in Brussels here: Michael Hewson of CMC Markets also predicts that today\u2019s inflation data could raise the chances of UK borrowing costs rising soon. He writes: Unlike the Federal Reserve, the Bank of England has been much more dovish in recent months in respect to its own rate message. This is despite UK economic data being much better than US data, with average earnings in particular rising on a par with those in the US. Furthermore, CPI Inflation has also been rising steadily since November\u2019s -0.1%, with another rise expected to 0.4%, from January\u2019s 0.3%. The rebound in oil prices as well as recent sterling weakness has knocked the scenario of rate rises sometime in 2017. This chart from last month\u2019s inflation report shows how prices finally turned positive recently: This morning\u2019s UK inflation report could reignite talk of a UK interest rate rise in the not-too-distant future. David Song, currency analyst at DailyFX, believes the consumer prices index could put could show signs of stronger price growth, perhaps to 0.4% from 0.3% in January. Another uptick in the U.K. Consumer Price Index accompanied by stickiness in the core-rate of inflation may boost the appeal of the sterling as it puts increased pressure on the Bank of England to normalize monetary policy sooner rather than later. The BoE\u2019s target is an inflation rate of 2%, which appears some distance away. Many economists reckon interest rates will remain on hold until 2017, or later, but Song agues that conditions could change. The BoE looks poised to retain its current policy ahead of the U.K. Referendum in June as the Monetary Policy Committee remains unanimous in keeping the benchmark interest rate at the record-low, but increased price pressures may encourage Governor Mark Carney to adopt a more hawkish tone over the coming months as the central bank sees a risk of overshooting the 2% inflation-target over the policy horizon.\u201d Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. It\u2019s quiet, too quiet, as they say in the old Westerns. But the edgy calm that has broken out in the markets recently could be shaken by a splurge of economic data this morning. The day kicks off with new PMI reports from France and Germany, from 8am GMT. They\u2019ll show how private sector firms are faring this month; whether output is up or down, exports rising or falling, and employment up or down. Then at 9.3am, the latest UK inflation data could show that prices rose at a faster pace last month. Economists expect the Consumer Prices Index to rise to 0.4%, from 0.3% in January. That\u2019ll be followed by two new surveys of German business confidence: Traders expect a quiet start to trading, even though several companies are reporting results. In the City, we\u2019re getting financial results from holiday firm Thomas Cook, housebuilder Bellway, building materials group Wolseley, retailer Majestic Wine and City trading firm IG. There will be drama in the UK parliament too. Robert Chote, the head of the independent Office for Budget Responsibility, is testifying about last week\u2019s Budget from 10am GMT. Few would argue the Budget was chancellor George Osborne\u2019s best work, so Chote should be quizzed about the questionable way Osborne claims he\u2019ll reach a surplus by 2019-20, and the \u00a34bn black hole created by the disability payment cuts u-turn. We\u2019ll be covering all the main events through the day....",
