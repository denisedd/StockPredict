The tables were turned in the UK stock market today with recent winners suffering from profit-taking, while the miners were virtually the only stocks to keep their heads above water.</p> <p>The collapse in the oil price has been a big shock to the financial system and its effects are still being absorbed by international stock markets, in particular the implications for global demand. Financials have been really badly hit of late, and in a sign of how dire things have got, some European banks are trading lower than they did during the depths of the financial crisis.

London\u2019s FTSE-100 has posted a 2.7% sell-off, pushing the benchmark index squarely back into bear-market territory, but losses across mainland Europe have been even more pronounced. The fact that WTI crude tested territory below $30/barrel once again has done nothing to help matters but we\u2019ve got this overriding fear that another global slow down is imminent and many investors are adjusting portfolios to suit. The theme of risk aversion is buoying precious metals... as gold eyes a break above $1200 an ounce for the first time in over six months.</p> <p>But 25 stocks [in the FTSE 100 are] sporting losses in excess of 5% on the day, underlying the sense of panic that is creeping in. Economic data remains thin on the ground tomorrow but given at least some of the downside in stocks can be attributed to that renewed weakness in oil, this remains a metric worth watching closely.

In a new note he says:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We struggle to remember many occasions when investor sentiment was quite as bearish and widespread as it feels today. Sure, 2008 was worse as the global financial crisis and fears of global depression created panic in markets, but today\u2019s cool disdain for risk assets still takes some beating. When we were asked by a client this week what reason bullish investors were citing for their optimism, we had to confess that we couldn\u2019t answer as we hadn\u2019t met any in recent times. The collective noun for a group of bears is a \u2018sleuth\u2019, but it doesn\u2019t take much detective work just now to identify what investors are concerned about. </p> </blockquote> <p>Those concerns revolve around the usual suspects - China, emerging markets, dollar, oil etc - but added to that are the fact that central banks are moving towards negative interest rates, which is not particularly positive for equity markets.

                "bodyText":"That\u2019s all from us until tomorrow, after another day dominated by wild swings in the markets and angst over the global economy. Will Tuesday be different? Come back tomorrow and find out. Goodnight! GW Wall Street has closed for the night, after a day of turmoil in the major stock markets. The Dow Jones industrial has finished down 177 points, or 1.1%, at 16,027, as gloom over global growth hit financial stocks. The S&amp;P 500 index, which covers more US stocks than the Dow, shed 1.4% and the Nasdaq finished down 1.8%. Serious losses, but better than the lowest points of the day. Wall Street was dragged up by a late rally in energy stocks. Credit card firm Visa was the biggest faller on the Dow, followed by Goldman Sachs: Tech firms had a bad day - with social media network Twitter dropping by over 5% to a new record low: As we\u2019ve been covering for the last 14 hours, that followed hefty losses in Europe. The FTSE 100 plunged by 2.7%, or 158 points, wiping \u00a340bn off the blue-chip London index. And European markets fell further, hit by fears over the banking sector and the global economy. Greece was the worst performer, though, hitting its lowest level in 25 years! Owen Callan, senior analyst at Cantor Fitzgerald, said investors are increasingly anxious about the \u201cfundamental picture\u201d of the world economy. Callan said: \u201cPeople are worried about the global economy and particularly now we are beginning to look at the banks. \u201cYou are seeing more and more people saying: \u2018Is this 2008 again?\u2019 Maybe not quite as severe, but do we need to be worrying about the banking sector and risk assets on a bigger level?\u201d Here\u2019s our news story about today\u2019s selloff: Hello..... the US stock market is staging a late rally, bouncing off its earlier lows. The Dow is now down just 150 points, or 0.9%, having been down almost 400 points a couple of hours ago: Some big names are leading the Wall Street fallers, with 20 minutes until the closing bell is rung. Investment bank Goldman Sachs is down 5.8%, mirroring the selloff in global banking stocks. Visa is close behind, down 5.6%, followed by Nike (5%), Home Depot (4.6%) and Boeing (3%). Here\u2019s a few photos from Wall Street today, as traders faced another day of chunky losses. Deutsche Bank\u2019s soothing statement about its bond repayments may have calmed investors nerves a little. Shares are creeping back from their lows on Wall Street, meaning the Dow is now only down 269 points, or 1.7%. Good news, there\u2019s only one hour to go until Wall Street closes and Manic Monday is over. Bad news, the US stock market is still heavily in the red. The Dow is down 2.17%, or 351 points to the bad, with the S&amp;P and Nasdaq in deeper trouble: Newsflash: Deutsche Bank has just issued a statement, saying it can meet a crucial debt repayment in April. The Frankfurt-based bank, which was at the heart of today\u2019s market turmoil, says it has a \u201cpayment capacity\u201d of around \u20ac1bn. That will cover the \u20ac350m due in April on its CoCo bonds -- debt which converts into shares, or is wiped out, if a bank hits financial problems and defaults. As we covered this morning (details here), some analysts fear Deutsche could miss a CoCo payment in 2017, if economic conditions worsen. Deutsche says it will probably have a \u201cpayment capacity\u201d of \u20ac4.3bn next year in 2017, depending on its operating performance this year. Here\u2019s Deutsche\u2019s statement: Deutsche Bank publishes updated information about AT1 payment capacity The stock market turmoil risks blowing a multi-billion pound black hole in the UK government\u2019s fiscal plans. That\u2019s the warning from the IFS thinktank, which published its Green Budget today, one month ahead of the official budget. Here\u2019s the story: Britain\u2019s leading experts on the public finances are warning that the turmoil on global stock markets threatens to leave a \u00a32bn black hole in George Osborne\u2019s deficit-reduction plans that could force the chancellor to raise taxes or make fresh cuts in spending to hit his budget targets. On a day in which share prices crashed in Europe and the US, the Institute for Fiscal Studies said Osborne\u2019s plan to put the UK back in the black by the end of the current parliament was vulnerable to a protracted financial market panic. The IFS said tumbling share prices \u2013 which wiped more than \u00a340bn off the value of the companies quoted on the FTSE 100 Index on Monday \u2013 were one of a number of factors that could blow the chancellor\u2019s plan off course in the next four years. Forecasts that wages growth will be lower than previously expected could knock another \u00a35bn hole in his budget, the thinktank said. And here\u2019s the full story: The Telegraph\u2019s Mehreen Kahn points out that the European banking sector has lost a sixth of its value in the last month. Here\u2019s her take on today\u2019s market mayhem: Global stocks were gripped by a fresh bout of panic selling on Monday raising fears over the health of the world\u2019s banking system for the first time since the financial crisis. European markets slumped to their lowest level in more than two years amid an unremittingly bleak outlook for the global economy and concerns over the resilience of the world\u2019s biggest lenders. The Euro Stoxx 600 index of leading bank shares fell as much as 6pc in Monday\u2019s trading, closing down 5.6pc, plumbing depths not seen since August 2012. The continent\u2019s lenders have now lost 17.3pc of their value of the last 30 days.... (more here) Anxious investors are continuing to pile into gold, sending it up to $1,200 per ounce for the first time in over seven months: So far this year, shares in America\u2019s largest banks have slumped by at least 15% as investors fear a global downturn. The biotech boom has speedily unwound, too.. There\u2019s no sign, yet, that Wall Street might recover from its early selloff. The Dow is stubbornly down around 344 points, or 2.1%, at 15,860 points. The broader S&amp;P 500 is down 2.3%, and the tech stock-packed Nasdaq has shed 2.9%. That\u2019s nearly as bad as the European selloff, and suggests we\u2019re facing yet more market turbulence. \u201cYelp\u201d indeed..... US technology stocks are being hit hard today. Tesla, the electric car company, have slumped by 9% today, dropping below $150 for the first time in two years. Global markets suffered a bad start to the week, with the Chinese new year proving as turbulent as the slump in the early days of January. Although the Chinese markets were closed, that did not end the recent spate of volatility facing investors. Fears about a slowdown in global growth returned with a vengeance, while banking shares were among the poorest performers on worries about the outlook, and the effect of negative interest rates on their business. On top of that came a cocktail of other concerns, from the prospect of Britain leaving the European Union to concerns about the review of Greek\u2019s progress in meeting its bailout targets. The rout was widespread, with the Greek market at its lowest for around 25 years and the Eurofirst300 dropped to a near two and a half year low. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 fell 158.7 points or 2.7% to 5689.36 Germany\u2019s Dax dropped 3.3% to 8979.36 with Deutsche Bank 9.5% lower France\u2019s Cac closed 3.2% lower at 4066.31 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB fell 4.09% to 16,441.2 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended down 4.44% at 8122.1 In Greece, the Athens market lost 7.87% to 464.23 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 323 points or 2%. There seems little justification for the day\u2019s slump in banking shares, said Laith Khalaf, senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown: Markets are clearly worried about a global economic downturn at a time when central banks have little dry powder left to fight off recessionary forces. The tables were turned in the UK stock market today with recent winners suffering from profit-taking, while the miners were virtually the only stocks to keep their heads above water. The collapse in the oil price has been a big shock to the financial system and its effects are still being absorbed by international stock markets, in particular the implications for global demand. Financials have been really badly hit of late, and in a sign of how dire things have got, some European banks are trading lower than they did during the depths of the financial crisis. There doesn\u2019t seem to be much justification for such a dismal outlook, but markets appear to be stuck in a negative feedback loop at the moment. A sense of panic seems to be setting in, but any increase in the oil price might help markets, said Tony Cross at Trustnet Direct: Equities across the globe have kicked off the week in a deeply downbeat mood. London\u2019s FTSE-100 has posted a 2.7% sell-off, pushing the benchmark index squarely back into bear-market territory, but losses across mainland Europe have been even more pronounced. The fact that WTI crude tested territory below $30/barrel once again has done nothing to help matters but we\u2019ve got this overriding fear that another global slow down is imminent and many investors are adjusting portfolios to suit. The theme of risk aversion is buoying precious metals... as gold eyes a break above $1200 an ounce for the first time in over six months. But 25 stocks [in the FTSE 100 are] sporting losses in excess of 5% on the day, underlying the sense of panic that is creeping in. Economic data remains thin on the ground tomorrow but given at least some of the downside in stocks can be attributed to that renewed weakness in oil, this remains a metric worth watching closely. Anything that fundamentally impacts on supply could be all it takes to instil some confidence in markets, but in the absence of any better news the bears are likely to remain in control. One reason for the current market problems is the US Federal Reserve ending its quantitative easing programme, says Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Bloomberg has the story: Ever since the Federal Reserve began to withdraw monetary stimulus, liquidity has steadily been drying up. Therein lies the crux of the broader stress in financial markets, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch, which have seen violent selloffs occur following the surprise revaluations of currencies in Switzerland and China, as well as Japan\u2019s introduction of negative interest rates. Head of U.S. Mortgages Chris Flanagan and Strategist Mao Ding don\u2019t necessarily lay blame for market dislocations squarely on U.S. monetary policymakers. The two observe, however, that since early 2014\u2014when the Fed began winding down its open-ended asset purchases\u2014liquidity stress has \u201cpersistently risen\u201d and served as the proximate cause of the episodic spikes in Merrill Lynch\u2019s Global Financial Stress Index that have since occurred. [They said:] \u201cThis persistence suggests to us that deteriorating liquidity is at the heart of and may be the primary driver of broader rising financial stress.\u201d Full story here: Bank of America: This Chart Shows \u2018Deteriorating Liquidity\u2019 Is at the Heart of Market Carnage More turbulence in the banking sector, which has been by worries about negative interest rates, the outlook for profits and slowing global growth. Trading in Barclays shares was halted briefly after volatile movements. Now resumed, the shares are down 5.4%. With China\u2019s markets closed for the new year holiday, it is a worrying sign that share prices elsewhere continue to tumble, says Chris Beauchamp, senior market analyst at IG: The selling that began this morning has gathered pace across the globe this afternoon, as the US joins in the one-way move. Chinese investors will feel relieved that their market has taken the week off, but the absence of the volatility provided by Shanghai sends a worrying message \u2013 investors in the US and Europe are worried by many things, not least the current interest rate outlook in the US. Recent surveys of fund managers may indicate rising cash balances, but so far these appear to be remaining on the side lines, pulling the rug from under what remains of this bull market. In a week when economic data is relatively light, it is becoming increasingly apparent investors are struggling to find any positive news on which to create a rally. Then there are the banks. Jasper Lawler at CMC Markets said: Banking shares across Europe buckled under the pressure of global growth concerns in concert with the ugly spectre of negative interest rates. Weak earnings from European banks, notably that of Deutsche Bank have seen investors significantly reassess the chance of an earnings turnaround after years of regulatory fines for past misdeeds. The disappointing earnings across the sector from the big US firms to Credit Suisse whose chief executive asked to have his bonus cut by as much as 50% is refocusing investor attention on bad loan books which have not been addressed since the European crisis. In the days after Deutsche Bank issued a surprise profit warning, credit default swap spreads ballooned as investors started to question the bank\u2019s ability to fund itself. The CDS jump has caused a sharp drop in Deutsche Bank shares. Markets continue to slide, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average now down around 300 points. Meanwhile in Greece, the Athens market has closed down 7.87% to 464.23, its lowest level in at least 25 years. Banks - as elsewhere - are among the biggest fallers, down up to nearly 30% in some cases. Greece\u2019s finance minister Euclid Tsakalotos said he expected the review of the country\u2019s bailout programme to restart next week, and conclude two weeks later. But with worries about planned pension and tax reforms - which have seen major protests in recent days - have unnerved investors. Manos Hatzidakis of Beta Securities told Reuters: The market is pricing in financial and political instability, and delays in the review. Sterling has hit a one week low, falling to $1.4393 amid worries about the outlook for banks and concerns about the effects of any vote from Britain to leave the European Union. It is also at a 13 month low against the euro. The recent move by central banks to push interest rates into negative territory is bold but unco-ordinated and could lead to a \u201crace to the bottom,\u201d according to Standard &amp; Poor\u2019s. The ratings agency said: Four European central banks--in Switzerland, Denmark, and Sweden, plus the European Central Bank--have adopted negative policy rates, and Japan surprisingly joined the club on January 29 this year. \u201cThe Bank of Japan\u2019s decision to follow suit on negative rates is likely to reinforce the trend toward shrinking yields in core government bond markets, as the search for yield spreads from Japan into Europe,\u201d said Standard &amp; Poor\u2019s economist Sophie Tahiri... \u201cThe bold venture into negative interest rates signals to market participants that central banks will use all tools at their disposal to meet inflation targets,\u201d said Ms Tahiri. \u201cThe problem is that all developed markets\u2019 central banks face the same deflationary pressures from weak commodity prices and have the same incentive to use their exchange rate to combat those pressures.\u201d This increasing competition between developed markets\u2019 central banks to stem currency appreciation signals a new phase in the extended aftermath of the global financial crisis. Independent attempts to weaken exchange rates could lead to an undesirable \u201crace to the bottom\u201d among central banks. Here\u2019s a snapshot of the Dow movers, mainly down of course: Amid the current worries about the global economy, Europe could start moving up the list according to strategist Graham Secker at Morgan Stanley. In a new note he says: We struggle to remember many occasions when investor sentiment was quite as bearish and widespread as it feels today. Sure, 2008 was worse as the global financial crisis and fears of global depression created panic in markets, but today\u2019s cool disdain for risk assets still takes some beating. When we were asked by a client this week what reason bullish investors were citing for their optimism, we had to confess that we couldn\u2019t answer as we hadn\u2019t met any in recent times. The collective noun for a group of bears is a \u2018sleuth\u2019, but it doesn\u2019t take much detective work just now to identify what investors are concerned about. Those concerns revolve around the usual suspects - China, emerging markets, dollar, oil etc - but added to that are the fact that central banks are moving towards negative interest rates, which is not particularly positive for equity markets. Secker said he feared any moves higher by stock markets, prompted by relief rallies on positive new, would \u201cprove short-lived as investors increasingly question the value and effectiveness of further central bank action.\u201d And then there is Europe: Recent investor caution tends to focus on fears of excess US dollar strength, low oil prices and/or China, but we think it is quite plausible that Europe moves back up the pecking order (to its more usual place some would say!) as we move through 2016. The UK\u2019s forthcoming referendum on EU membership, likely to take place in June, may appear the most plausible catalyst in the short term to raise regional risk premia, but the ongoing migrant issue risks eroding political cohesion over the medium term and political uncertainty is rising in the periphery. Greece has a daunting debt repayment due this summer, Spain is currently without a government, new European regulations are preventing Italy from adopting an effective \u2018bad bank\u2019 solution and the recently elected socialist government in Portugal is reversing course on prior austerity and competitiveness improvements. During a cyclical upswing, markets are prone to overlook such concerns, but the opposite would be true if growth starts to relapse. US markets have followed Europe into the red, as fears about the global economy continue to rattle investors. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 220 points or 1.3% while the S&amp;P 500 is down just over 1% and the Nasdaq has fallen 1.7% at the open. With the Greek stock market at its lowest since at least 1990 and banks bearing the brunt of the selling, here is the huge damage done to the four biggest since the start of the year: Readers in America should brace themselves. The selloff that began in Europe this morning is heading your way. Wall Street is expected to fall sharply when trading begins in 20 minutes time, as fears over the global economy reach New York. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is tipped to fall by over 1%, while US crude oil is flirting with the $30/barrel mark. Terry Sandven, chief equity strategist at U.S. Bank Wealth Management in Minneapolis, told Reuters that investors will remain nervous until the oil price picks up. \u201cEquities are in a \u2018go-nowhere-fast\u2019 mode, with a downward bias in the near term. Some analysts are concerned that Deutsche Bank may struggle to repay some of its bonds, if economic conditions continue to deteriorate. That\u2019s helps explains why its shares have slumped 5%, as investors also drive up the cost of insuring its debt. The key is Deutsche\u2019s CoCo bonds, or contingent convertible bonds, which are written down or converted to equity when a bank\u2019s capital falls to a certain level. CoCo bonds have been introduced since the 2008 financial crisis, to spare governments from funding another bailout. They pay a decent return, to encourage investors to hold them, in return for shouldering the risk if things go wrong. Bloomberg\u2019s John Glover has the story: Deutsche Bank may struggle to pay coupons on its riskiest bonds next year if operating results disappoint or litigation costs are higher than expected, according to analysts at CreditSights Inc. Bonds and stock of Germany\u2019s largest bank have plunged this year, with the shares shedding 35% of their value and its contingent convertible bonds -- known as CoCos, or additional Tier 1 securities -- turning in a similar performance. The cost of protecting the company\u2019s subordinated debt from default for five years using credit-default swaps has more than doubled since the end of 2015, rising to 420 basis points, a four-year high, from 187. \u201cWhile we are confident about 2016 coupons, we are less so about coupon payments in 2017,\u201d CreditSights analyst Simon Adamson wrote in a note to clients today. Deutsche Bank will do \u201ceverything in its power to pay them\u201d because it will need to issue such bonds in the future, he said. Full story: Deutsche Bank\u2019s Woes Threaten CoCo Coupons, CreditSights Says The selloff is gathering pace in Frankfurt. The German DAX index has just slumped through the 9,000 point mark for the first time in 16 months, down 3.2%. Bank stocks are leading the DAX further down.... Stock market wizards like to tell you that \u2018buy and hold\u2019 is a solid strategy, that allows shareholders to ride out turbulence. Shares outperform other assets in the long term, they chant. Well, tell that to a Greek investor. The Athens market has just slumped to its lowest level in at least 25 years. Greek bank shares are being pulverised today, with Eurobank down 27%, National Bank of Greece down 25% and Piraeus down 20%. It\u2019s only three months since the Greek banking sector was recapitalised, getting \u20ac14bn of new funding to help stabilise the economy. China has lost its claim to be the world\u2019s fastest-growing major economy, to India. New government figures from Delhi show that Indian gross domestic product grew by 7.3% in the last quarter of 2015, compared with a year earlier. That beats China, which expanded by 6.8% over the same period. India\u2019s statistics body also estimated that GDP will expand by 7.6% in the year through March. That would also outpace Beijing, which is aiming for growth close to 7%. Caution is needed with these figures. Many economists suspect China is growing rather slower than the official readings. And some have told Reuters that India\u2019s figures are surprisingly strong. Almost every company on the FTSE 100 index has fallen this morning, during another bout of heavy selling across Europe\u2019s stock markets. Worries over the state of the world economy continue to drive shares lower. Only five companies are defying the rout, including gold producer Randgold and silver producer Fresnillo, who are both benefitting from the panic. That has left the FTSE 100 languishing at 5,735 points, down 112 points or 1.9% today. Other European markets are deeper in the red, losing around 2.4% on average, and hitting their lowest level since October 2014. Conner Campbell of Spreadex has summed up the situation (I\u2019ve added links to key points in this blog): A slow start soon turned disastrous this Monday, with many of the European indices plunging to lows not seen since October 2014. With Citigroup warning of a potential \u2018death spiral\u2019 if investors behave irrationally to the stronger dollar/weaker commodities/harmed emerging markets cycle that the world appears to be trapped in at the moment, the markets have taken another kicking this Monday. It doesn\u2019t help, of course, that the day\u2019s economic calendar is so sparse, with investors left pondering the purely negative side of things as the morning continued. The FTSE sank by nearly 2%, plummeting past 5800 in the process as Brent Crude fell back towards the $33 per barrel mark. The DAX, always the liveliest index in instances like this, lopped off a whopping 2.6% in value as the morning progressed, and is in serious danger of falling below the 9000 mark; the CAC, meanwhile, matched its dramatic German peer with its own 2.5% drop. The Eurozone had the added negative of a 10 month low Sentix investor confidence figure, the reported 6.0 far lower than the 9.6 announced in January, whilst the German index has the extra burden of a dismal morning from Deutsche Bank. The FT\u2019s Joel Lewin has a handy explanation of why bank shares are falling today. Fears surrounding non-performing loans and other deep-rooted issues in the Italian banking sector have driven nerves, while a slew of weak earnings from large banks such as Credit Suisse and Deutsche Bank have added to concerns. Weak growth provides an unsupportive backdrop, as does the possibility of more deeply negative benchmark interest rates. And that\u2019s why Commerzbank has dropped by 4.7%, Deutsche Bank is down 3.4%, and BNP Paribas has lost 3.3%. UK banks are also suffering, with Lloyds and Royal Bank of Scotland both down 1.7% In another sign of angst, the gold price has just hit a three month high. Bullion is swapping hands at $1,171 per ounce, the most since the end of October. It has already gained around 10% since the start of 2016, as concerns over the world economic outlook have grown. The OECD think tank has issued new economic indicators for investors to digest (in between hammering the SELL button). It sees \u2018tentative\u2019 signs that the Chinese economy is bottoming out, but slowing growth in the US. The OECD is also quite upbeat about Europe, saying: In the euro area as a whole, and in Germany and Italy, the composite leading indicators signal stable growth momentum while in France the outlook is for firming growth.\u201d We\u2019ll find out on Friday if they\u2019re right, when the latest eurozone GDP figures are published (starting at 6.30am GMT, so set your alarm clocks). How worried should we really, really be about a global recession? No-one knows for sure. But investment bank Goldman Sachs reckons it is still unlikely, despite fears that the recent market turmoil will feed into the \u2018real economy\u2019. They have estimated that there is an 18% chance that the United States goes into recession over the next year, rising to 23% over the next two years. For the eurozone, it\u2019s a 24% risk this year, up to 38% by the end of 2017. So hardly a done deal. Goldman\u2019s Jan Hatzius agues that \u201cThe recent market weakness should provide good risk-adjusted opportunities for those brave enough to defy Mr. Market\u2019s gloomy prognosis about the world economy.\u201d The selloff in European markets this morning suggests Mr Market isn\u2019t convinced.... The Greek stock market is still falling, and now down over 6%. That\u2019s pretty worrying, given the political tensions in Athens. Wall Street is expected to suffer losses when trading begins in New York, in just over three hours time. According to the future market, the Dow Jones industrial average will fall 1.2% at the open. The tech-heavy Nasdaq index is being called down 1.6%. The oil price is falling again, hit by concerns over the global economy. Brent crude has dropped by 1.7% to $33.47 per barrel, wiping out last week\u2019s rally. Confirmation that Germany\u2019s stock market is at a 15-month low: The Greek stock market has slumped by 5% to its lowest level since 2012 - when it nearly left the eurozone. That\u2019s partly due to the general wave of worry today, but it also reflects the standoff over Greece\u2019s bailout. Creditors are pushing the government to make deeper pension reforms, while protestors flocked to the streets last week to call for less austerity. European banking shares are bearing the brunt of today\u2019s rout. In Germany, shares in Deutsche Bank have tumbled by 4.35%. And the cost of insuring Deutsche\u2019s debt against default, using a credit default swap or CDS, has hit the highest level since July 2012. That underlines how much nervousness is in the markets today: Last month, Deutsche announced that it suffered a loss of \u20ac6.7bn last year. New CEO John Cryan said it was \u2018sobering\u2019, and some analysts fear Cryan will struggle to turn Deutsche around in the current market turmoil. As well as the huge loss, Deutsche also reported falling revenues. According to Bloomberg, that could indicate the bank will struggle to hit its capital ratio targets. As shares slide, investors are scrambling to get their hands on safe-haven assets such as German government debt today. And that has driven the yield, or interest rate, on German bunds into deeper negative territory. In other words, traders are willing to pay more than the face value of the bonds and accept a guaranteed loss - unless they can offload them onto someone even more desperate..... A wave of selling is gripping Europe\u2019s stock markets, as this morning\u2019s stream of bad news hits traders. In London, the FTSE 100 index is suddenly down by 101 points, or 1.7%. And there are steeper losses across Europe, where the benchmark FTSeurofirst 300 index has shed 2%. That means European stocks are at their lowest point since October 2014, as money pours out of shares and into safe-haven bonds. Concerns over the weakness of the global economy appear to be rippling through trading floors again. The sharp fall in eurozone investor confidence reported a few minutes ago is contributing to the bad mood: Alastair McCaig, Market Analyst at IG. says: Stock markets in Europe are in full retreat... with the disappointing Sentix figures triggering a mid-morning selloff. The news that UK business morale has hit a three-year low isn\u2019t helping either. More gloom! Economic sentiment among investors across the eurozone has fallen sharply this month, as the problems in the global economy hit Europe. Sentix, the Frankfurt-based think tank, has just reported that its index of investor morale has hit a 10-month low in February, dropping from 9.6 to 6.0. And its sub-index of economic expectations hit its lowest level since November, 2014, sliding from 6.3 to just 1.5. Manfred Huebner, Sentix\u2019s managing director, warns: The euro zone proves it is not immune to the enormous loss of momentum in the global economy. The global economy is thus currently on the brink, led by a US economic downturn! Sentix blamed \u201cthe loss of dynamism\u201d in Germany and the United States, while Latin America and Eastern Europe are in a worse state. And Sentix singles out the Federal Reserve\u2019s interest rate increase last December, which is \u201cnow considered a big mistake by the majority of investors\u201d. It also pointed to the slump in commodity prices, and its impact on emerging markets. Wall Street bank Citigroup has contributed to the sombre feeling in the markets, with a research note last week warning that we could face a \u2018death spiral\u2019. The bad news, according to Citi, is that the dollar could keep strengthening, driving commodity prices lower, hurting emerging markets (EM), and thus pushing the dollar higher etc etc. The good news is that it probably won\u2019t happen though, if \u2018rational behaviour\u2019 kicks in . CNBC has the details: \u201cThe world appears to be trapped in a circular reference death spiral,\u201d Citi strategists led by Jonathan Stubbs said in a report on Thursday. \u201cStronger U.S. dollar, weaker oil/commodity prices, weaker world trade/petrodollar liquidity, weaker EM (and global growth)... and repeat. Ad infinitum, this would lead to Oilmageddon, a \u2018significant and synchronized\u2019 global recession and a proper modern-day equity bear market.\u201d Stubbs said that macro strategists at Citi forecast that the dollar would weaken in 2016 and that oil prices were likely bottoming, potentially providing some light at the end of the tunnel. \u201cThe death spiral is in nobody\u2019s interest. Rational behaviour, most likely, will prevail,\u201d he said in the report. Great headline - but maybe the report is a little overblown? One money manager thinks so.... The Economist Intelligence Unit is also concerned about the economic situation. Their managing director, Robin Bew, tweets that they think UK interest rates will remain at 0.5% until 2019 In another sign of unease, shares in UK chipmaker ARM Holdings have slipped by 4% to the bottom of the FTSE 100 leaderboard. ARM reports results on Wednesday, and analysts fear it is suffering from the slowdown in the US technology sector. Last week, Apple predicted that sales of the iPhone (which uses ARM chips) will start to fall later this year. Another UK tech firm called Imagination, which designs chips, warned this morning it will make an operating loss this year. It blamed a slowing market, and uncertainty over China. Peter Elston, chief investment officer at Seneca Investment Managers, argues that we\u2019re unlikely to be entering a recession yet. Recessions generally start because central banks are trying to restrain economies, he told Bloomberg TV this morning. But right now, inflation pressures are very low, and economies are still some way from full capacity. \u201cThis would be an extremely unusual place for a global recession to start.\u201d True. But arguably, we\u2019ve been in an \u201cextremely unusual place\u201d since the financial crisis, with central bank stimulus has been underpinning growth. Ultra-low interest rates helped struggling firms limp on and quantitative easing pumped up the stock market. Still, though, global growth is weak and vulnerable to the impact of higher US interest rates - unless the Fed changes course.... Shares in engine maker Rolls Royce have shed 2% at the start of trading, as the City braces for further problems. After hitting shareholders with five profit warnings in two years, Rolls-Royce could now slash its dividend when it posts its annual results on Friday. My colleague Graham Ruddick explains: The company has been hurt by cuts to defence spending by western governments, a fall in demand for corporate jets, and a slump in the oil price. European stock markets have begun the new week rather gingerly. The FTSE 100 index has gained 20 points, or 0.4%, but Germany\u2019s DAX is only up 0.1% and the French CAC is slightly lower. This fall in UK business confidence will only fuel concern that the global economy is slowing. Chris Weston of financial spread-betting firm IG says this is the biggest issue in the markets today. Will we see a recession in the US and other developed nations? There is little doubt this is the number one question being asked right now. He points out that insurance against company\u2019s defaulting has spiked in value recently, especially for banks. And the stock market turbulence, and the recent surge in the US dollar, show how financial conditions have deteriorated. If that feeds through to the real economy, we could be in serious trouble. As Chris puts it: The strong fear is this stress \u2013 that is clearly being felt in the financial markets \u2013 will start to filter through to Main Street. We have some worrying news to start the week -- confidence among UK executives has hit its lowest level since 2013. Concerns over Britain\u2019s upcoming EU referendum are adding to worries over the global economy. And business leaders now fear their companies are suffering. That\u2019s according to a regular survey conducted by BDO, the professional services firm. It warns that the UK is now suffering from problems in the global economy, particularly China\u2019s slowdown and signs of weakness in America. The turmoil in the Middle East is also hitting confidence. Peter Hemington, partner at BDO LLP, warns: \u201cGlobal headwinds are finally hitting business confidence and the added uncertainty of EU referendum just round the corner is fuelling concerns. This knocked BDO\u2019s Business Optimism Index \u2013 which predicts growth six months ahead \u2013 down to 100.0. That\u2019s the tipping point below which firms expect their output growth to drop under the long term trend rate. So what can be done? One option, the BDO says, is for the government to introduce a zero-rate of VAT on companies that sell their goods to exporters. Manufacturers could certainly use some help. The sector is already in recession, even though the wider UK economy grew by a solid-enough 0.5% in the final quarter of 2015. BDO found that manufacturing output contracted again this month, which it attribued to \u201cdecreasing global confidence\u201d. Dr Gerard Lyons, the Mayor London\u2019s economic advisor, points out that other measures were less gloomy: Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. It looks like a quiet start to the week, as investors wait to hear from Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen. Yellen testifies to Congress on Wednesday and Thursday, and will give her take on the recent turmoil in the financial markets, and the state of the global economy. She\u2019s also likely to be questioned on whether the Fed was right to raise interest rates in December, and whether future hikes are now on the back-burner. It could be a tricky balancing act for Yellen; she won\u2019t want to fuel the current market angst, but nor can she sound complacent. Thomas Costerg, of Standard Chartered Bank in New York, predicts that Yellen will keep her options open regarding future interest rate rises: \u201cShe may emphasize the positives in the U.S. economy, particularly the still-strong labor market. Looking ahead, she may sound more cautious, and she will likely highlight that the negatives are mostly from abroad and that they are watching the global picture closely.\u201d City traders are also digesting the news that China burned through another $99.5bn in foreign exchange reserves last month, defending the yuan. That takes China\u2019s FX reserves down to their lowest level since 2012, although Beijing still has $3.23 trillion fo firepower. Those figures haven\u2019t alarmed Chinese investors, though, as they are now on holiday for the Chinese New Year. We\u2019re expecting a quiet start to trading in Europe, with the main indices expected to rise. And there\u2019s not much in the economic calendar today, apart from the monthly survey of eurozone Investor Confidence, from Sentix, at 9.30am GMT.",

Analyst Connor Campbell at Spreadex said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Initially threatening a 300 point plunge when the bell rang on Wall Street the Dow Jones settled into a more solid, if still troublesome, 175 point drop as the open receded into the background. Whether or not the better than expected, and best since December, jobless claims helped (it probably didn\u2019t) is unclear, though at this point in time in the most worthless piece of positive news is likely appreciated by fear-stricken investors. The Dow was probably saved (and this is all relative, remember) by the fact that the blood loss endured by the US banking sector was nowhere near as gory as the scenes over in Europe, Bank of America the worst hit at around a 4% decline.</p> <p>In Europe things were much the same, i.e. not too good at all. The FTSE just about managed to claw its way back to the 5600 mark, arguably thanks to the fact that Brent Crude is now closer to $31 per barrel than it is to $30. The DAX, meanwhile, tucked under a 2% decline around 40 points away from 8900, whilst the CAC climbed down from its 3.7% nadir to post a 2.7% loss, both indices aided by a (minor) reduction in losses form Deutsche Bank and Societe Generale respectively.</p> <p>The big question now is, does today\u2019s horrorshow continue into Friday? Given just how fearful investors appear to be at the moment it is incredibly hard to tell; one thing tomorrow does have going for it, however, is data. Lots and lots of it.

                "bodyText":"That\u2019s an appropriate moment to stop. Back tomorrow, for another day of market drama - plus the latest eurozone growth figures, starting with France at 6.30am GMT. Here\u2019s our latest news story: Better get some sleep :) Goodnight! GW Today\u2019s selloff in Asia, Europe and America have pulled global stocks into bear market territory. Reuters has the details: Stock indexes worldwide stumbled on Thursday on fears over the health of the global economy, with a global equity benchmark index closing the day more than 20 percent below its record high last May, confirming global stocks are in a bear market. MSCI\u2019s all-country world equity index which tracks shares in 45 nations, was last down 4.73 points, or 1.32%, to 353.35. The index hit its lowest level in more than two and a half years and was down 20.18% from an all-time high close of 442.70 on May 21, 2015. As we\u2019ve been covering today, this fall into bear market territory began with hefty losses in Hong Kong. Its stock market fell by 4%, on the first day\u2019s trading since the Lunar New year holiday. The baton then passed to Europe, which fumbled it. Bank shares had a very poor day indeed, on escalating fears that they will struggle to handle an economic slowdown, and lower negative interest rates. In nervous trading, shares slumped and government bonds soared, while oil took a dive and gold rallied. That tee\u2019d up America for its fifth daily fall in a row, as Fed chair Janet Yellen repeated her concerns that financial conditions are deteriorating. Uncertainty over US monetary policy going forward - will rates be hiked, cut, or even go negative? - weighed on shares again. It looks like the S&amp;P 500 has finished at its lowest closing level since April 2014, at 1829 points. Financial shares in the S&amp;P fell by 3%, bringing 2016 losses to roughly 18%, points out our US business editor Dominic Rushe. Here\u2019s the main movers and shakers: The Dow has lost around 4.6% of its value since last Thursday - the last time it posted a daily rise. The index is down 10.1% since the start of this year. This is the fifth day running in which the Dow Jones index has lost ground. Reminder: Tonight\u2019s losses in New York follow another day\u2019s torrid trading in Europe. Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 has another day to forget, losing 2.4% as investors raced for safe-haven assets such as German bonds, the yen, and gold. The Footsie, which includes the top 100 companies in London, closed at its lowest level in three and a half years. Our friends at the Daily Telegraph have worked out that \u00a380bn has been wiped off the FTSE 100 index this week. And there\u2019s still one day to go.... Phew! America\u2019s stock market has closed for the night, and the main three indices are all in the red. The Dow ended the day down around 251 points, having clawed back from a 400-point loss an hour or so ago. And the Nasdaq wilted in the final moments, surrendering earlier gains to finish down 0.4%. Shares picked up after the WSJ reported that Opec might be prepared to cut oil production. But financial stocks dragged again, with Goldman Sachs down 4.1%, and JP Morgan losing 3.98%. The biggest Dow faller was Boeing, following reports that regulators are investigating the airline maker. The latest research note from French Bank BNP Paribas just landed in my inbox. Here\u2019s their \u2018big picture\u2019 view: Central-bank action looks uncoordinated and we see few signs of calm ahead. We expect no further action from the Fed in 2016 or 2017 and we think central banks across the world will continue to adopt easier policies in response. It looks like traders are trying to give the Dow a late push. It\u2019s now down 188 points, or half its earlier losses..... Hello hello.... look at the Nasdaq. The tech stock-heavy index has shrugged off its earlier losses, and is now up 7 points (or 0.2%). Leading the way are: TripAdvisor: +13% Cisco +10% Expedia +8.5% Tesla: +6.3% That still leaves the Nasdaq down 6.9% this month, and 13% since the start of the year. Now that today\u2019s OPEC rumour has sunk in, Wall Street is still in red, but off its lowest levels. The Dow is currently down 273 points, or -1.7%, with just 40 minutes until the closing bell. This final hour can be a volatile time.... This is the story that moved the market a few minutes ago, by Summer Said of the Wall Street Journal. OPEC members are ready to cooperate on a cut, but current prices are already forcing producers outside the group to at least cap output increases, says UAE Energy Minister Suhail bin Mohammed al-Mazrouei. Non-OPEC supplies are expected to drop up to 800K barrels/day while global demand growth is seen at 1.3M\u2013which will help the market balances itself. \u201cThe positive thing is the current market is forcing everyone not to increase output,\u201d says al-Mazrouei, adding, \u201cI\u2019m optimistic that the balance will happen this year despite the oversupply and stocks overhang.\u201d  Interesting stuff. But it\u2019s not exactly definitive proof that OPEC is about to cave in and axe production. Energy stocks are suddenly spiking, pulling the US stock market off its lowest levels. And it\u2019s triggered reports that the energy minister of the UAE has said Opec members are \u201cready to co-operate\u201d on production cuts. Rumours of this sort have been swirling, and then denied, for some time. But maybe this time it\u2019s different.... Wow. The Dow just lurched through the 400-point loss mark, as news of the latest tumble in the oil price broke. Then it ricocheted back, to \u201cjust\u201d 340 points down in a few moments. Oil has just plumbed new depths, as oversupply fears and global recession worries take their toll again. West Texas Intermediate (US crude oil) has sunk below $26.19 per barrel, to hit the lowest levels since May 2003. There\u2019s no let-up in the market gloom today, with the Dow Jones industrial average still down over 2%. The Dow is currently trading at 15,570, a loss of 344 points. Only two stocks are up - network equipment vender Cisco, and entertainment group Walt Disney (who posted strong results earlier this week). Boeing is the big faller; the aircraft maker has lost 8.9% today following reports that regulators are probing the company\u2019s accounting. Reuters also blames \u201cmounting concerns\u201d about Boeing\u2019s its slowing sales and production. Following close behind in the losers bench are Goldman Sachs (-4.4%) and JP Morgan (-4.2%). They\u2019re tracking the general sell-off in financial stocks today. Two months after the first US rate rise in a decade, the financial markets reckon the Fed is more likely to CUT, rather than risk a second hike. Kit Juckes, top currency strategist at Societe Generale, reckons that the market turmoil has been sparked by a loss of faith in central bankers. In a new note to clients, he writes: We\u2019ve relied on central bankers to fix all the world\u2019s woes, when all they could really do was to get the global financial system back on an even keel. Keeping policy too easy for too long and boosting asset markets in the vain hope that this would deliver a sustainable demand pick-up has meant that even a timid attempt at normalising Fed policy has caused two months of mayhem. Now, a growing realisation that central banks\u2019 powers are waning has prompted a rush into safe havens. And, of course, years of ultra-loose monetary policy have also led us to this point: We\u2019re just getting the stickers saying \u2018Easy Money may cause harmful side-effects if consumed persistently for long periods\u2019 printed.... Yellen\u2019s second and final testimony ends with chairman Richard Shelby suggesting a review of the Fed\u2019s structure. She seems unconvinced but says it is up to Congress. And with that it\u2019s over. A cocktail of concerns has sent markets tumbling again. Worries about a severe global economic downturn, stresses on bank balance sheets, the falling oil price and Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen\u2019s comments about the impact of a slowdown and the market turmoil on the US economy have sent investors scurrying away to havens such as gold. Yellen\u2019s comments about negative interest rates added to the unease as the afternoon wore on. The final scores in Europe showed: The FTSE 100 fell 135.33 points or 2.39% to 5536.97, its lowest level since the end of July 2012 Germany\u2019s Dax dropped 2.93% to 8752.87 France\u2019s Cac closed 4.03% lower at 3896.71 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB finished down 5.63% at 15,773.00 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended down 4.88% at 7746.3 In Greece, the Athens market fell 1.89% to 440.88 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 349 points or 2.2%. Charles Schumer of New York says the strength of the US dollar is another form of rates rise so another hike would be a double whammy for the economy. Yellen says the dollar is a factor in interest rate policy, but says although some sectors have been hit by the strength of the US currency the economy has managed to continue creating jobs. Heller: A year ago you said falling oil would be good for the economy. Do you think you made a mistake. Yellen: Clearly declining oil prices have had some negative effects [on the economy]. [But] we are still a net importer of oil, and households are seeing sustantial gains from falling oil price. Dean Heller of Nevada: Different Fed officials saying different things causes confusion to public and markets. Do you see a problem? Yellen: Congress created a system with a large committee with diverse views so we did not fall into groupthink mentality. We have 17 members with a range of views. We have guidelines for communications. It says everyone should make clear they are speaking for themselves, not the committee. The market response to the Fed rate decision for a number of weeks was tranquil, it had been communicated and was expected. At the turn of the year markets saw more volatility. The drivers were China and oil price falls amid weakening global growth, so I don\u2019t think it was our policy. Yellen is asked again about the rate rise at the end of last year. Yellen: We felt in December the economy was moving up and inflation would go up. A lot has gone on since then. We are in the process of assessing how those developments affect our outlook. We will meet in March and have a new set of projections. I\u2019ve not thought that a downturn sufficient to make the next move a cut was a likely possibility. Not seen a shift in economic outlook to make that likely. But she added that if things changed to make that appropriate, the Fed would look at it. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts asks about living wills for banks, which are designed to make sure if they fail there will not be a systemic risk, and says there are 11 where they were deemed not to be sufficient and have been resubmitted. Yellen: We gave detailed guidance about what we want to see in these latest rounds of living wills. We are..evaluting them. If a living will does not address the shortcomings, we are prepared to make the finding that the living will is insufficient. Tom Cotton of Arkansas asks the December rate rise, and Yellen says the Fed wanted to move gradually so that the economy remained on a sustainable growth path. Cotton then asks about when she expects energy prices and the dollar to stabilise. Yellen: Energy prices have continued to move down, eventually they will stabilise. When that happens and the dollar stabilises, inflation will begin to move up but [difficult to predict when.] Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania: I wanted the Fed to normalise policy [ie start raising rates again which happened in December]. Markets now appear to price in no further increases in interest rates. But what are the risks of negative rates? [He lists several including pressure on banks, the prospect of currency war, an effective tax on savings and so on] Yellen: In European countries which have [introduced negative rates], I was surprised it was possible to take them as negative as they did. Don\u2019t think they pass on negative rates to small depositors, which means bank\u2019s margins are squeezed. They [other central banks] were concerned about inflation being below objectives and wanted to stimulate economy. In our context, in 2010 we were concerned about the impact on money market functioning. Before we took such a step we would have to see how they worked in US context. But we don\u2019t even know if clearing and settlement systems would be able to handle negative rates. Toomey asks about the legal position, saying a Fed memo seemed to suggest there could be a probem. Yellen: A memo from 2010 said legal issues had not been studied. I am not aware of any legal restriction that would mean we could not establish negative rates but I haven\u2019t studied legal side of it. Question from Bob Corker of Tennessee : Is Fed out of ammunition unless you go to negative rates? If things go south are you considering negative rates? Yellen: The answer is we had previously considered them and decided they would not work well back in 2010. In light of others [introducing them], we are taking a look at them again because we would want to be prepared. We have not finished that investigation. Not automatic they would work well here. I would not take them off the table, but there is work to do to see if they would be suitable. Senator Jon Tester of Montana: What is Fed seeing in housing sector right now? Yellen: We are seeing recovery in housing, it has gone on for a number of years but is very gradual. House prices have increased quite a bit. [But] the level of new construction remains quite low relative to demographic trends. Quite a significant way for housing to go before it is consistent with demographic trends. It is a support to the economy. Senator Mike Crapo asks: Would you agree liquidity in bond markets may be less available in stressed market conditions. Yellen: Normal conditions haven\u2019t changed that much but perceptions suggest that under stressed conditions liquidity may disappear when its most needed. We are looking at these things... Asked about wages, she says a pick up in wage growth is tentative. She hopes as the economy improves this will increase. Chair Richard Shelby asks if the precipitous decline in the price of 0il and gas plus the rise of the dollar surprised the Fed or could you have predicted it? Yellen says the Fed and the markets have been quite surprised by movements in oil price. In part they reflect supply isssue, demand may also play a role. The stronger dollar we in some ways anticipated as US economy has been performing more strongly than others. But she says they were surprised at how much it has risen. Asked about the economy and recession, she says there is always some chance of recession in any year. But evidence suggests expansions don\u2019t die of old age. We are looking very carefully at global financial developments which create risk... they may influence the trajectory of the economy and monetary policy. It is premature to make a judgement [on a recession this year]. On the strength of banks: We have a more resistent banking system. We have used stress tests to see if firms can support credit needs of our economy even in times of great [financial] stress. We do have a strong banking system and we\u2019ve seen marked improvement. Here\u2019s a chart showing how the chances of a Fed rate rise have dropped sharply since January in the wake of the market turmoil and Yellen\u2019s comments: After opening comments from committee chair Richard Shelby and senator Sherrod Brown of Ohio, Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen is currently delivering her testimony (identical to yesterday\u2019s speech remember). Meanwhile markets seem to have recovered a little from their worst levels. Analyst Connor Campbell at Spreadex said: Initially threatening a 300 point plunge when the bell rang on Wall Street the Dow Jones settled into a more solid, if still troublesome, 175 point drop as the open receded into the background. Whether or not the better than expected, and best since December, jobless claims helped (it probably didn\u2019t) is unclear, though at this point in time in the most worthless piece of positive news is likely appreciated by fear-stricken investors. The Dow was probably saved (and this is all relative, remember) by the fact that the blood loss endured by the US banking sector was nowhere near as gory as the scenes over in Europe, Bank of America the worst hit at around a 4% decline. In Europe things were much the same, i.e. not too good at all. The FTSE just about managed to claw its way back to the 5600 mark, arguably thanks to the fact that Brent Crude is now closer to $31 per barrel than it is to $30. The DAX, meanwhile, tucked under a 2% decline around 40 points away from 8900, whilst the CAC climbed down from its 3.7% nadir to post a 2.7% loss, both indices aided by a (minor) reduction in losses form Deutsche Bank and Societe Generale respectively. The big question now is, does today\u2019s horrorshow continue into Friday? Given just how fearful investors appear to be at the moment it is incredibly hard to tell; one thing tomorrow does have going for it, however, is data. Lots and lots of it. Germany, Italy and the Eurozone as a whole reveal their preliminary fourth quarter GDP figures, whilst the US sees retail sales, import prices and the University of Michigan consumer sentiment number. The markets will be hoping (nay, praying) that, with a bit of distraction (like on Wednesday), the week can end on a slightly more positive note. Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen is back on Capitol Hill to discuss the global outlook and monetary policy with the Senate Banking Committee, the second and last day of her testimony to Congress. The hearing has begun and can be viewed here. Elsewhere Morgan Stanley has agree to pay $3.2bn relating to the sale of mortgage-backed bonds before the financial crisis. Ahead of Yellen\u2019s testimony, some think it is time for a US rate cut: As predicted, the US market has followed the rest of the world lower. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 243 points or 1.5%, while the S&amp;P 500 has lost 1% and Nasdaq 1.3%. Meanwhile the International Monetary Fund has confirmed that Christine Lagarde has been nominated for a second five year term as managing director unopposed. Her first term ends in July. Well, here\u2019s the answer to the question about whether Janet Yellen would change her testimony from Wednesday\u2019s remarks in the light of the day\u2019s renewed market turmoil. No. The Fed said: Chair Yellen submitted identical remarks to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs, U.S. Senate, on February 11, 201. So if you want to read along with Yellen at 10am EST (3pm GMT) here it is again. Here\u2019s some comments on Portugal and Greece from Slovakia\u2019s finance minister Peter Ka\u017eim\u00edr ahead of the eurogroup: Bloomberg points out another possible reason behind the plunge in bank shares: Oil rich Gulf states have of course been hard hit by the plunge in crude prices. Now here\u2019s a key question about today\u2019s second testimony from Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen: Over in Brussels, eurozone finance ministers are telling reporters that the European banking sector is in good shape, as they arrive for a Eurogroup meeting. Eurogroup president Jeroen Dijsselbloem revealed that ministers will consider the market turbulence during today\u2019s session. European commissioner Pierre Moscovici was pretty optimistic too: And Finnish finance minister Alex Stubb was \u201crelaxed\u201d about the situation: Out of the mists of gloom comes some good news, in the shape of the weekly US jobless figures. They show that the number of Americans filing new unemployment claims fell by 16,000 last week, to a seven-week low. The initial jobless claims figure came in at 269,000, down from 280,000. So, US companies kept hiring staff last week, despite the market turmoil. World stock markets are gripped by another bout of feverish selling today. Fears over the global economy and the financial sector have hit shares, driven down (most) sovereign bond yields, and sent wild gyrations through the foreign exchange markets. In London, the FTSE 100 has hit a three and a half-year low. The blue-chip index is currently down 120 points, or 2%. Financial stocks are under real pressure, with Aberdeen Asset Management, Prudential and Barclays all down 6%. Other European markets are being routed too, with the French CAC plunging by 3.5%, Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB losing 5%(!) and German DAX off by 2%. Wall Street is expected to follow suit, with the Dow being called down 280 points or almost 2%. The day began with a big selloff in Asia, as traders returned after the Lunar New Year. Hong Kong\u2019s stock market slid by 4%. Maike Currie, investment director for personal investing at Fidelity International, says investors face volatile markets: \u201cFebruary has continued much like January begun, with markets yo-yoing and investor sentiment swinging from one concern to the next. The FTSE 100 broke the 5,500 barrier today \u2013 hitting a new low since July 2012. \u201cInvestors can\u2019t be blamed for feeling unnerved. There is a cocktail of worries clouding the investment horizon from a slowing China, emerging market rout, the unprecedented collapse in the oil prices and more recently, the problems brewing in the banking sector. Bank shares are in the eye of the storm again: France\u2019s Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale has tumbled by 13% after warning that \u201cheadwinds\u201d could hit profitability this year. Deutsche Bank is down by 9%, two days after insisting it was \u201crock-solid\u201d. The dollar has fallen sharply against the yen, before suddenly rebounding, sparking rumours that the Bank of Japan has intervened to weaken its currency. And the British pound has fallen by over a cent against the US dollar to $1.439. Money has poured into German, US and UK government debt. This has driven down Britain\u2019s cost of borrowing to an alltime low. But Portugal\u2019s bonds have weakened, sparking fears that investors are worrying about Lisbon again. Sweden\u2019s central bank fired another shot in the currency wars, surprising the markets by slashing interest rates to a new record low of minus 0.5%. The oil price has weakened again, with US crude oil trading at levels last seen in 2003. But gold has jumped by 2.6% to $1,229 per ounce, a nine-month high. Financial sentiment right now: A rumour is sweeping the trading floors that the Bank of Japan has intervened to weaken the yen, following today\u2019s surge against the US dollar. And the yen has weakened, moving from \u00a5111.5 to \u00a5112 against the $1. America is waking up to the news that Asian and European markets have taken another bath this morning. And they are next in line: Investors are ditching Portuguese government bonds this morning, as the financial turmoil grows. The wave of selling has driven up the yield on Portugal\u2019s 10-year bonds to 4.3%, up from 3.5% yesterday. That\u2019s a remarkable surge, meaning that prices have dropped sharply. It implies that the markets are losing confidence in Portugal again, demanding a higher rate of return for holding its bonds. Shorter-term Portuguese debt is also being hit. The move comes as Lisbon\u2019s new left-wing government begins to reverse some of its predecessor\u2019s austerity policies. Last week, the EU warned that Portugal was \u201cat risk\u201d of breaching Europe\u2019s fiscal rules, after warily approving its 2016 budget. Joshua Mahony, market analyst at IG, reckons fear is driving shares down today, rather than a fundamental shift. He says: The fear surrounding global financial markets has been cranked up further today, as risk assets once more took a battering in favour of defensive plays. The continued deterioration in the FTSE is as much to do with the ongoing fall in oil and the fall in the US dollar against the yen, as the outlook for the UK economy itself, yet with markets in freefall, who is going to argue with a trend? There are many potential causes of the current rout. For example: signs of slowing global growth; fears that negative interest rates severely undermine bank profitability; the bad loans lurking in the European financial sector; suspicions that China is much weaker than the GDP figures show.... All good reasons to worry. But as the Wall Street Journal\u2019s Juliet Samuel flags up, the City isn\u2019t sure what\u2019s really behind it. In a morning of wild and alarming moves, one stands out. The Japanese yen has jumped by 1.7% against the US dollar today, strengthening from \u00a5113.3 to $1, to \u00a5111.5. That\u2019s a chunky daily move. And so far this year, the yen has gained by 7.5% against the US dollar, hitting its strongest point since November 2014. That will surely concern the Bank of Japan, which imposed negative rates last month in its latest attempt to stimulate growth and inflation. A stronger yen is bad for exports, and also deflationary as it makes imported goods cheaper. Yann Quelenn, market analyst at Swissquote Bank, explains: The US dollar printed a fresh 16-month low against the Japanese yen, suggesting that traders believe the BoJ will be unable to further weaken the yen, while betting the Fed will remain sidelined for a longer period of time. But there is also chatter that the BoJ may have to intervene in the markets to weaken the yen. Here, courtesy of David Buik of Panmure Gordon, is a snapshot of the day\u2019s rout (so far) in the banking sector: Britain\u2019s borrowing costs have now hit their lowest level since the late 1600s, thanks to the plunge in bond yields today (details here). So reckons Sky News\u2019s economics editor, Ed Conway, who has checked the historic data. It\u2019s unlikely that Britain\u2019s medieval kings could have borrowed any cheaper either. They were notorious serial defaulters, due to the demands of court life and military ambitions. Mind you, academics at the University of Reading have argued that the picture was more nuanced.... They wrote: It can be difficult to identify medieval interest rates, in part because interest charges had to be disguised to circumvent the Church prohibition on usury, but we found that the king could borrow at 15% annualised interest when his finances were stable but that this could increase to more than 40% during periods of financial pressure, most notably during wartime. Edward I probably had a surplus on his account with the Ricciardi, who collapsed as the result of a \u2018credit crunch\u2019 caused by the unexpected outbreak of war between England and France..... More here: Credit Finance in the Middle Ages: loans to the English crown c.1272-1340 The Greek stock market is suffering another rout, led by its banks: Oil is being thumped by predictions of a growing crude glut, as the world economy slows. The price of US crude has fallen by almost 3% today, to $26.74 per barrel. That\u2019s a one-month low, but also close to the levels ploughed in 2003: Bloomberg\u2019s Caroline Hyde tweets the details: The refusal of oil producers to cut production is fuelling concerns that we may run out of places to put the stuff, as inventory levels keep rising. Jasper Lawler of CMC Markets explains: The threat of further rate hikes from the Fed coupled with diminished prospects for a joint production cut between OPEC and non-OPEC producers have sent US oil prices back down to 12-year lows. The renewed slump in the price of oil has been unfortunate timing for French oil giant Total to report a 20% rise in annual net profits which CEO Patrick Pouyanne proclaimed as the \u201cbest performance\u201d amongst the oil majors. Today\u2019s rout has driven European bank shares down to their lowest level in three and a half years. The Stoxx 600 Banks index, which includes the main lenders in Europe, has shed 6.1% and is now at its lowest level since August 2012. Summer 2012 was the point at which the eurozone debt crisis began to ease, with European Central Bank chief Mario Draghi vowing to do \u201cwhatever it takes\u201d to save the euro. Today\u2019s rout is being led by Italian banks, and French bank SocGen (after its results missed forecasts today). Britain\u2019s government borrowing costs have just hit an all-time low, according to Reuters data. The yield on 10-year UK gilts, which are the benchmark for UK borrowing, has fallen to 1.29% this morning in a wave of buying. Yield, the interest rate on the debt, fall when prices rise. So this implies Britain can borrow cheaper than at any time before (the data I can see goes back to 1989) That sounds like good news, except that it reflects wider fears over a global recession. If traders were upbeat about growth prospects, they\u2019d be buying shares instead. Investors are scrambling into \u201csafer\u201d eurozone government bonds. That\u2019s another sign that they\u2019re seeking protection against recession and market turmoil. German government bond yields (the interest rate on bunds) has hit a nine-month low this morning - meaning the prices of these bonds has hit the highest level since May 2015. And the yield on US 10-year Treasury bills has hit its lowest in three years, at just 1.62%. That also suggests traders are pessimistic about future growth and inflation prospects. Bank shares are getting a tonking this morning. Deutsche Bank, the source of so much worry, is down by 6.3% in Frankfurt, with Commerzbank close behind. After a rough start to trading, European stock markets are deep and turbulent sea of red. Italy is the worst performer, with its FTSE MIB index slumping by over 4%: FXTM Research Analyst Lukman Otunuga says Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen is partly to blame. He reckons investors are disappointed that Yellen didn\u2019t rule out interest rate rises, when she appeared at Congress yesterday: Although the economic environment has transformed for the worst since the start of the year with ongoing China woes and violent declines in oil prices exposing the US economy to downside risks, in defiance the Fed continues to hold the view of raising rates at a gradual pace. While Yellen also emphasized that financial conditions in the US have become less supportive of growth, this was counterbalanced with the impressive labour report which in the eyes of the Fed opened doors for a potential rate rise in March. Yellen will get a second bite at the cherry later today, when she continues testifying to US lawmakers. Wall Street is expected to take a tumble later today: Nour Al-Hammoury, chief market strategist at ADS Securities in Abu Dhabi says: Asia and Europe equities remain weak following the Feds acknowledgment that they have concerns over global markets. European financial risk indices continue to rise, which is keeping demand high for safe haven assets. Ahead of the open we\u2019re currently calling the DOW down 275 15640 and the S&amp;P down 32 at 1820 Sweden\u2019s central bank has cut the country\u2019s interest rates deeper into negative territory, in another sign of the turbulence in the financial world. The Riksbank has just announced that the headline rate will fall to -.50%, from -0.35%. The move is designed to drive inflation up and stimulate growth. The bank says: The economy continues to strengthen but inflation is expected to be lower during 2016 than previously forecast. The rate cut will also weaken the Swedish currency. It is already hitting the Swedish Krone hard, sending the euro surging against the krone. Only 3 economists surveyed by Bloomberg has expected such a deep cut (8 thought rates would stay at minus 0.35%, and 7 predicted a cut to minus 0.45%) Tony Cross, analyst at Trustnet Direct, says fears over the world economy are hitting shares hard, and also pushing the oil price down. Any hopes that yesterday\u2019s modest rally for the FTSE-100 would mark something of a turning point have been dashed. WTI crude oil prices tested territory below $27/barrel, whilst the return to work after the Lunar New Year break saw traders in Hong Kong lacked any signs of optimism. Janet Yellen\u2019s words yesterday have clearly done nothing to calm sentiment \u2013 yes the next US rate hike may have been pushed back, but the challenge now is managing the US recovery against a potential global slowdown. The London selloff is accelerating, wiping 130 points off the Footsie. The index of major blue-chip shares has now hit its lowest level since July 2012: Over in Paris, French bank Societe Generale has plunged by 9%. It missed City forecasts this morning, with net income coming in around 31% below analyst forecasts. SocGen also warned that \u201cheadwinds\u201d could hamper its efforts to hit profitability targets this year. That wipes out yesterday\u2019s recovery: Money is pouring into safer assets, and out of shares. The gold price has risen to $1,211 per ounce, its highest since May 2015. And the Japanese yen has hit its highest level against the British pound since November 2013. Down we go again! European shares are falling at the start of trading. The FTSE 100 has shed 101 points, or 1.7%, to 5,570 points. Germany\u2019s DAX has lost 1.5%, and the French CAC is off by 1.6% Most London shares are down, but mining stocks are leading the selloff reflecting ongoing gloom about the global economy. Rio Tinto has slumped by 6.7%, after it abandoned its \u201cprogressive dividend\u201d policy this morning (a promise to pay more shareholders in future years). This follows a late-selloff on Wall Street last night, and the slumps in Asia earlier today. Mike van Dulken of Accendo Markets says: The weakness stems from Fed chair Janet Yellen warning on current financial market turbulence and suggesting further rate hikes could be delayed, which added to already raised anxiety about the health of the global economy to hold back risk sentiment. It\u2019s never great returning to work after a holiday. But the mood in Hong Kong was particularly grim, as investors watched shares tumble. Nitin Dialdas, chief investment officer at Mandarin Capital in Hong Kong, told Reuters that 2016 will be tough. \u201dI think this is going to be a difficult year for investors and even a fledgling U.S. economic recovery looks to be snuffed out by global markets development.\u201d Charles Li, chief executive of the Hong Kong Stock exchange, was also gloomy: \u201cThere is very little good news and continuous bad news and this is a test of market confidence.\u201d Hong Kong\u2019s stock market is suffering its worst start to the Lunar New Year since 1994. A wave of selling has hit shares as traders return to their desks after this week\u2019s holiday. They were swift to catch up with the turmoil in European and US markets, with Asian markets having been shut since Friday. The Hang Seng index has lurched down, losing 795 points or nearly 4% to 18,535. That\u2019s its biggest one-day loss in six months. As this chart from Bloomberg shows, that\u2019s the worst start to a Lunar New Year in over two decades: There were similar losses in other Asian markets. South Korea\u2019s Kospi staged its biggest daily drop in nearly four years, down 2.9 percent to finish at 1,861.54. Shane Oliver, chief economist at AMP Capital in Sydney, blamed fears over the global slowdown, and the oil price slump, adding: \u201cWhat started in January as mainly China based worries has clearly broadened back out to concerns about global growth\u201d Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. There\u2019s no end in sight to the market turmoil. European stocks are expected to fall at the start of trading, with worries over the global slowdown centre-stage again. The futures market suggests the main indices, including London\u2019s FTSE 100, will lose around 1% at the opening - wiping out Wednesday\u2019s small rally. Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen is testifying to Congress for the second day running (at 3pm GMT). She\u2019ll probably repeat her concerns about the turmoil in the markets, which could prevent the Fed from hiking rates this year. We\u2019ll hear from another central bank today, too. At 8.30am, Sweden\u2019s Riksbank announces its monetary policy decision, and some economists believe it will cut interest rates deeper into negative territory. And Eurozone finance ministers are meeting in Brussels; Greece\u2019s struggling bailout talks will be on the agenda, as Athens and its creditors continue to argue over its austerity plan. In the corporate world. oil giant Total, holiday firm Thomas Cook, insurance group Zurich and mining giant Rio Tinto are all reporting results (more on them shortly....) We\u2019ll be tracking all the main events through the day...",
