                "bodyText":"Sainsbury\u2019s has agreed terms to buy Home Retail Group, the owner of Argos, in a \u00a31.3bn deal which will create a combined food and non-food retailer that can take on Amazon and John Lewis. Britain\u2019s second-biggest supermarket has promised to pay Home Retail shareholders 55p in cash and 0.321 Sainsbury\u2019s shares for each of their shares, valuing Home Retail at \u00a31.1bn, subject to regulatory approval and a closer look at the Argos-owner\u2019s books. Under the terms of the proposed deal, Home Retail shareholders would get a further \u00a3200m in cash from the sale of Homebase, Home Retail\u2019s DIY and homewares business. Along with a 2.8p a share payment in lieu of a final dividend, the proposed offer values Home Retail at 161.3p a share or about \u00a31.3bn. Home Retail said its board had decided to recommend the potential offer to shareholders once details are agreed and both sides complete due diligence by examining each other\u2019s books. Home Retail shareholders will own about 12% of the combined company if the deal is completed \u2013 a process likely to take at least three months. Sainsbury\u2019s said the takeover would create the UK\u2019s largest non-food retailer \u2013 ahead of John Lewis or Marks &amp; Spencer \u2013 with about 2,000 stores and 100,000 products combined. It plans to put Argos outlets in Sainsbury\u2019s large stores as well as selling items online and expects to generate cost and revenue gains of at least \u00a3120m. Mike Coupe, Sainsbury\u2019s chief executive, said: \u201cOur customers want us to offer more choice and for that choice to be faster than ever, driven by the rise of mobile phone and digital technology. \u201cIt will enhance both businesses. We are baking a bigger cake than either company can bake by themselves.\u201d Sainsbury\u2019s is buying Home Retail as people increasingly shop online or pick up groceries from small neighbourhood stores instead of visiting supermarkets for a weekly shop, threatening large stores with irrelevance. The rapid growth of the discounters Aldi and Lidl has also created a price war, slashing supermarket profits. Sainsbury\u2019s argues buying Argos will allow it to offer a broader range of goods at its stores and offer a wider delivery service \u2013 both to homes and click and collect points in stores. Argos outlets will also provide a useful filler for spare space in Sainsbury\u2019s largest outlets.

Crude prices were on the slide once more, given there was no sign of any deal between Opec and the likes of Russia to cut production and stem the supply glut. On top of that, sentiment was hit by major losses at BP and a 48% drop in profits at Exxon Mobil.</p> <p>So Brent crude fell as much as 5% before recovering some ground - and helping markets off their worst levels at the same time. It is currently down 2.8% at $33.26 a barrel. West Texas, which slipped below $30 at one point, is now down 1% at $30.6 a barrel.</p> <p>Adding to the downbeat mood came reports that China was imposing new controls to help control outflows of capital from the country, in particular a cap on people buying insurance from overseas.</p> <p>So despite the marginal recovery, the final scores showed some hefty falls:</p> <ul> <li><strong>The FTSE 100 fell 138.09 points or 2.2% to 5922.01</strong></li> <li><strong>Germany\u2019s Dax dropped 1.8% to 9581.04</strong></li> <li><strong>France\u2019s Cac closed down 2.47% at 4283.99</strong></li> <li><strong>Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB fell 3.05% to 17,922.45</strong></li> <li><strong>Spain\u2019s Ibex ended down 2.96% at 8528.7</strong></li> <li><strong>In Greece, the Athens market slipped 0.84% to 552.5</strong></li> </ul> <p>On Wall Street the Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 271 points or 1.65%.</p> <p><em>On that gloomy note, it\u2019s time to close for the evening.

Major indices are rapidly shedding the gains they made in the second half of January, as a cocktail of worries returns. The first of these is the oil price, which has rediscovered its old habit of diving like a stone, helped in no small part by the absence of any rumours about another OPEC meeting.</p> <p>The session started with oil firms in the red, as BP\u2019s results sent the shares into a tail spin, but the company has been joined at the bottom of the index by miners and insurers. The former are down as economic growth concerns take centre stage, with this concern not helped by warnings from Fed policymakers, while the latter are in retreat thanks to China, which appears to be coming up with new and creative ways to try to stem capital flight. The reaction is probably overdone where the likes of Prudential are concerned, but it is hard to remain positive when the tentative rally of the past two weeks is slipping from your grasp.</p> <p>Adding to concerns was ExxonMobil, which is down 3% as the earnings beat fades amidst the stark reality of a remarkable slump in profits. As crude prices slide once more, thanks to markets suddenly waking up and remembering the massive oversupply story, it looks like this sector will be the trailblazer for any renewed slump in stock markets.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-56b0cd3ee4b054341b6d0f04\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-02-02T15:41:42.361Z\">3.41pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Back in the UK, and one of the biggest fallers apart from commodity companies is Prudential.</strong></p> <p>The insurance group is down nearly 8% on reports that China might be taking steps to stem outflows of capital. In particular Bloomberg has said the country could impose restrictions on people buying insurance products abroad, with a $5,000 cap per transaction to be imposed from 4 February. Analyst David Morrison at Spread Co said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Amid today\u2019s unsettling stock market action, Prudential stands out as one of the big losers. But this has nothing to do with the announcement that Anne Richards will be joining the Pru from Aberdeen Asset Management later this year.</p> <p>Instead it comes on the back of China\u2019s currency regulator imposing restrictions on its citizens buying overseas insurance products. This isn\u2019t just bad news for the Pru or the insurance sector in general. It raises fears that the Chinese authorities may take further action to limit capital controls. This is a particular worry as we head towards the extended Chinese New Year holiday break.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-02-02T15:42:08.581Z\">at 3.42pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-56b0c8ade4b048ec83a765b2\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-02-02T15:19:25.110Z\">3.19pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Here are the Dow movers:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8933fcf4c624135f794f9ec398e4a6b7d066294b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8933fcf4c624135f794f9ec398e4a6b7d066294b/0_0_1133_919/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Dow under pressure\" width=\"1000\" height=\"811\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dow under pressure</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-56b0c6e6e4b048ec83a765ab\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-02-02T15:12:24.955Z\">3.12pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>A sliding crude price and the lack of any major data to give direction have combined to send markets lower, </strong>says financial analyst Connor Campbell of Spreadex:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Things turned ugly this afternoon, with a woeful performance from Brent Crude and a particularly weak open from the US indices seeing the markets double down on the day\u2019s losses.</p> <p>Now down around 4.5% and threatening to fall below $32 per barrel, the resumption of Brent Crude\u2019s decline has been the main catalyst for the day\u2019s dismal trading. And as ever, when the commodities begin to fall the FTSE loses its way in pretty dramatic fashion, the UK index dropping a whopping 150 points as the day went on. The main casualty was BP; plunging by nearly 10% the oil has lost wave upon wave of investors this Tuesday following the revelation of its worst annual losses for 20 years.</p> <p>Whilst the DAX was prevented from posting the kind of absurd losses it is known for thanks to a record low German unemployment rate figure, the CAC was right up there with its UK peer this afternoon, falling around 2.6% as the day wore on. Over in the US, meanwhile, the Dow Jones quickly sank by 250-ish points after the bell rang on Wall Street, exactly what the markets didn\u2019t need following such an awful morning in Europe.</p> <p>The lack of truly significant data likely exacerbated today\u2019s losses, investors left with little other option but to focus on the same fears that have caused the markets to start 2016 in such dire fashion.

                "bodyText":"The optimism seen at the end of last week seems to have disappeared as quickly as it came. Crude prices were on the slide once more, given there was no sign of any deal between Opec and the likes of Russia to cut production and stem the supply glut. On top of that, sentiment was hit by major losses at BP and a 48% drop in profits at Exxon Mobil. So Brent crude fell as much as 5% before recovering some ground - and helping markets off their worst levels at the same time. It is currently down 2.8% at $33.26 a barrel. West Texas, which slipped below $30 at one point, is now down 1% at $30.6 a barrel. Adding to the downbeat mood came reports that China was imposing new controls to help control outflows of capital from the country, in particular a cap on people buying insurance from overseas. So despite the marginal recovery, the final scores showed some hefty falls: The FTSE 100 fell 138.09 points or 2.2% to 5922.01 Germany\u2019s Dax dropped 1.8% to 9581.04 France\u2019s Cac closed down 2.47% at 4283.99 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB fell 3.05% to 17,922.45 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended down 2.96% at 8528.7 In Greece, the Athens market slipped 0.84% to 552.5 On Wall Street the Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 271 points or 1.65%. On that gloomy note, it\u2019s time to close for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow for a busy day of service sector surveys around the globe. As European markets head towards the close nursing heavy losses again Chris Beauchamp, senior market analyst at IG, said: The end of January, when markets raced higher, seems such a long time ago. Major indices are rapidly shedding the gains they made in the second half of January, as a cocktail of worries returns. The first of these is the oil price, which has rediscovered its old habit of diving like a stone, helped in no small part by the absence of any rumours about another OPEC meeting. The session started with oil firms in the red, as BP\u2019s results sent the shares into a tail spin, but the company has been joined at the bottom of the index by miners and insurers. The former are down as economic growth concerns take centre stage, with this concern not helped by warnings from Fed policymakers, while the latter are in retreat thanks to China, which appears to be coming up with new and creative ways to try to stem capital flight. The reaction is probably overdone where the likes of Prudential are concerned, but it is hard to remain positive when the tentative rally of the past two weeks is slipping from your grasp. Adding to concerns was ExxonMobil, which is down 3% as the earnings beat fades amidst the stark reality of a remarkable slump in profits. As crude prices slide once more, thanks to markets suddenly waking up and remembering the massive oversupply story, it looks like this sector will be the trailblazer for any renewed slump in stock markets. Back in the UK, and one of the biggest fallers apart from commodity companies is Prudential. The insurance group is down nearly 8% on reports that China might be taking steps to stem outflows of capital. In particular Bloomberg has said the country could impose restrictions on people buying insurance products abroad, with a $5,000 cap per transaction to be imposed from 4 February. Analyst David Morrison at Spread Co said: Amid today\u2019s unsettling stock market action, Prudential stands out as one of the big losers. But this has nothing to do with the announcement that Anne Richards will be joining the Pru from Aberdeen Asset Management later this year. Instead it comes on the back of China\u2019s currency regulator imposing restrictions on its citizens buying overseas insurance products. This isn\u2019t just bad news for the Pru or the insurance sector in general. It raises fears that the Chinese authorities may take further action to limit capital controls. This is a particular worry as we head towards the extended Chinese New Year holiday break. Here are the Dow movers: A sliding crude price and the lack of any major data to give direction have combined to send markets lower, says financial analyst Connor Campbell of Spreadex: Things turned ugly this afternoon, with a woeful performance from Brent Crude and a particularly weak open from the US indices seeing the markets double down on the day\u2019s losses. Now down around 4.5% and threatening to fall below $32 per barrel, the resumption of Brent Crude\u2019s decline has been the main catalyst for the day\u2019s dismal trading. And as ever, when the commodities begin to fall the FTSE loses its way in pretty dramatic fashion, the UK index dropping a whopping 150 points as the day went on. The main casualty was BP; plunging by nearly 10% the oil has lost wave upon wave of investors this Tuesday following the revelation of its worst annual losses for 20 years. Whilst the DAX was prevented from posting the kind of absurd losses it is known for thanks to a record low German unemployment rate figure, the CAC was right up there with its UK peer this afternoon, falling around 2.6% as the day wore on. Over in the US, meanwhile, the Dow Jones quickly sank by 250-ish points after the bell rang on Wall Street, exactly what the markets didn\u2019t need following such an awful morning in Europe. The lack of truly significant data likely exacerbated today\u2019s losses, investors left with little other option but to focus on the same fears that have caused the markets to start 2016 in such dire fashion. Tomorrow, then, maybe slightly better, with a cavalcade of services figures around the globe set to distract the markets (however briefly or successfully is unclear) from their current malaise. The Alphabet success comes as the overall market has moved sharply lower. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 241 points or 1.46%, as Wall Street follows other markets lower. Fears of a global slowdown in the wake of weak industrial data this week have unnerved investors once more, while oil continues to slide as hopes fade of a deal between Opec and other oil countries - Russia in particular - to cut production. Brent crude is down 5% at $32.5 while West Texas has slipped below $30 a barrel. Elsewhere the S&amp;P is down 1.4% while the falls on European markets are accelerating. The FTSE 100 is now down 154 points or 2.5% while Germany\u2019s Dax is down 1.35% and France\u2019s Cac has lost 2.1%. Alphabet shares have jumped more than 4% at the open, valuing it at around $545bn. In contrast Apple is down almost 1% to give it a market capitalisation of around $530bn. Wall Street has opened and Alphabet has indeed overtaken Apple to become the world\u2019s largest listed company. UK energy group British Gas has announced it will axe 500 jobs as part of a cost cutting programme by its parent company Centrica. It did not say where or when the cuts would be made, according to Reuters which quotes British Gas chief executive Mark Hodges as saying: British Gas is well positioned to grow but we must ensure that our costs allow us to be competitive for our customers. Back with big oil, and Exxon Mobil has unveiled a 48% drop in its fourth quarter profit to $2.78bn and said it would cut spending this year by a quarter. That follows news that BP has made its biggest ever loss and plans 7,000 job cuts. The sell-off in stock markets is continuing, with the FTSE 100 now down 116 points or 1.9%. BP, now down 8.4%, has contributed around 21 points to the fall. Oil and mining companies as a whole have knocked some 50 points off the index. In Europe Germany\u2019s Dax is down 1.3% and France\u2019s Cac is 2% lower. At the moment, the Dow Jones Industrial Average futures are showing a 128 point loss on the US index when Wall Street opens. Whether that has an impact on Google - sorry Alphabet - overtaking Apple as the world\u2019s most valuable listed company remains to be seen. Worried about China? Maybe you\u2019re not worried enough. Royal Bank of Scotland has issued an online research note today, explaining how China\u2019s economy could hit trouble. Senior Economist Marcus Wright fears that China\u2019s economy has slowed more quickly than official data shows, and is struggling to break its addiction to debt (which helped fuel growth in recent years) This means Beijing is struggling to rebalance the economy in the face of a credit boom, triggering recent market turbulence and fears of a disorderly yuan devaluation. Wright predicts that a \u201chard landing\u201d is a serious risk for China, with consequences for countries worldwide. He says: China\u2019s slowdown is already impacting the global economy through the channels of growth, trade, inflation, interest rate expectation and financial linkages. There is more to come on all these fronts. The full presentation is online here. RBS have helpfully tweeted some of the key charts: Our energy editor Terry Macalister has established that BP is actually planning to cut 7,000 more jobs, more than first thought, after reporting an an annual loss of $6.5bn this morning. Terry also reports that CEO Bob Dudley thinks investors are \u201coverreacting\u201d by sending its shares down by 9% so far today.... Over in Greece, the negotiations between Athens and its creditors over its bailout programme have taken a curious twist, as talks resume today. The EU side has apparently hinted that Greece might get an easier ride, if it does a better job processing the refugees arriving on its shores from the Middle East. The Greek newspaper Kathimerini explains: Greek authorities are scrambling to set up screening centers for migrants and refugees as soon as possible as German officials have made it clear to Athens that more efficient management of the refugee crisis could help along creditors\u2019 review of the country\u2019s third bailout, Kathimerini understands. According to sources, German Chancellor Angela Merkel has indicated to Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras that success in tackling the migration crisis could boost the country\u2019s prospects for progress with the review, which Athens hopes could ease the way for debt talks. Combined with a burgeoning debate about Greece\u2019s future in the passport-free Schengen area, the message from Berlin is said to have encouraged action by Greek officials. Blackmail? Bribery? Or an attempt to fix two problems in one go? Currently, some refugees trying to move west from Greece are stranded at the border with Macedonia, due to anti-austerity protests held by farmers. BP\u2019s share price continues to wilt as analysts digest today\u2019s slump in profits/record loss (depending what measure you pick). It is currently down 8.8%, which by my reckoning wipes \u00a35.8bn off its market capitalisation. BP boss Bob Dudley has also warned that other oil companies will follow his lead and slash jobs, in response to the slide in the crude price. ITV\u2019s Joel Hills has the details: The oil sector is churning out the rumours today, as the crude price drops. The latest one is that member of the OPEC cartel are still resisting an emergency meeting where a production cut could be hammered out. That\u2019s despite the pain being suffered across the oil-producing countries, with Saudi facing serious austerity, Nigeria seeking help from the World Bank, and Russia apparently considering privatising various state assets. BP is briefing journalists in London now, after reporting its biggest annual loss in at least 20 years. The oil giant is predicting a volatile 2016, and warning that the cost of the Deepwater Horizon spill disaster is still rising. The oil is continuing to weaken, mirroring the selloff in the equity markets. Brent crude is now off 3.7% or $1.20 at $32.97 per barrel, hit by persistent fears of economic slowdown and oversupply in the oil market. And the Russian rouble is falling in sympathy, as cheaper oil brings more trouble for struggling petro-exporters. Tim Condon, head of Asia research at ING, fears that the oil sector is locked in a vicious downward spiral with factories. Oil companies cut spending last year after crude prices fell sharply, which meant they ordered less from manufacturers. That hit factory growth, and also meant they needed less energy. That hit demand for oil, helping to push stockpiles up and prices down. Or as Condon put it to clients: \u201cManufacturing is (the) leading edge of a global growth slowdown.\u201d \u201cWe think the 50% crash in global oil prices in the second half of 2014 caused the manufacturing slump by crushing commodity producers\u2019 spending. However, we also think that in 2015 weaker manufacturing, especially in China, began to drive down oil prices. The negative feedback loop is causing severe strains.\u201d Mario Draghi and colleagues at the European Central Bank will be relieved that the eurozone jobless rate fell last month, as they ponder whether to take new stimulus measures next month. Alex Lydall, senior sales trader at Foenix Partners, says investors expect action in March. Traders and investors assumed from the latest ECB press conference that further cuts in the deposit rate and perhaps an extension and expansion of Quantitative Easing are potentially on the cards. Today\u2019s selloff has wiped out almost all the spike last Friday, after the Bank of Japan took the dramatic step of introducing negative interest rates. Central bank stimulus packages don\u2019t have the impact they used to, as investors worry that the global economy is heading remorselessly downwards. Brenda Kelly of London Capital Group explains: It would seem that central bank impact is really beginning to lose its charm and the days of buying the dip on the back of stimulus expectations is no longer the winning strategy it once was. We\u2019re back to the same old story today with materials and energy providing a drag on the FTSE as BP delivered what was frankly a terrible set of results \u2013 its worst loss in 20 years. Breaking: The Eurozone unemployment rate has hit its lowest level since September 2011. Eurostat is reporting that the region\u2019s jobless rate dipped in December to 10.4%, from 10.5%. Across the wider EU, the jobless rate remained at 9.0%. Although the fall is encouraging, it still leaves 21.944 million men and women out of work in the 28 members of the EU, including 16.750m in the euro area. There were, as usual, stark difference across Europe too. Among the Member States, the lowest unemployment rates in December 2015 were recorded in the Czech Republic and Germany (both 4.5%), Malta and the United Kingdom (both 5.1%, October data for the UK). The highest unemployment rates were observed in Greece (24.5% in October 2015) and Spain (20.8%). More gloom. Growth in Britain\u2019s building sector has hit a nine-month low, according to new figures from data firm Markit. Markit\u2019s UK construction PMI has fallen to 55.0 in January, from 57.8 in December. That suggests growth slowed to its lowest rate since April 2015. The survey found that:\uf0a7 UK construction sector experiences growth slowdown at the start of 2016 Job creation eases to its slowest for almost two-and-a-half years Construction firms report lowest business confidence since December 2014 Worries about global growth and weak, falling oil prices are back under the spotlight today, warns Arnaud Masset, market analyst at Swissquote Bank. And that\u2019s why the European markets are sliding again. The FTSE 100 is now down 85 points, and being dragged lower by oil companies, banks and miners: Investors are also gloomy after yesterday\u2019s factory data. It showed the US manufacturing sector was not as strong as hoped, while China continued to weaken. Kit Juckes of Societe Generale explains: Yesterday afternoon\u2019s US economic data was pretty consistently below expectations, reinforcing the clear signs that global manufacturing is down in the dumps. BP\u2019s poor results are also a reminder of the havoc playing out in the oil sector, as hopes of a deal between Russia and Saudi Arabia to cut production dwindle. FXTM Research Analyst Lukman Otunuga says: Tepid manufacturing data from China, the world\u2019s largest energy consumer, renewed fears that demand may be dwindling. These anxieties added to the rapidly fading expectations around OPEC cooperating with Russia to curb production, while ongoing concerns over the excessive oversupply of oil in the markets continued to haunt investors. BP\u2019s CEO, Bob Dudley, has warned that the oil price will remain volatile until the second half of 2016. Speaking on Bloomberg TV, he predicted spikes - up and down - in the next few months as Iran returns to the oil market. Just in: Germany\u2019s unemployment rate has hit a new record low of just 6.2%. Destatis, the stats body, reports that the German jobless total fell by 20,000 in January, compared to expectations of an 8,000 decline. Another difficult morning is unfolding on the European stock markets. In London, the FTSE 100 has shed 1.3%, or 82 points, to 5977. BP is partly to blame - it has knocked 17 points off the Footsie on it own, and also dragged rival Royal Dutch Shell down too (it reports results on Thursday). Mining shares are also down, with BHP Billiton off 4%. Across the channel, Germany\u2019s DAX is down 0.9% and the French CAC is down 1.3% BP\u2019s stonking loss has hit shares across the energy sector: Shares in BP have slumped at the start of trading, after the energy giant reported its worst loss in 20 years. BP shares fell 5.8%, or 21p, to 345p as investors reacted to the news that it lost $6.482bn in 2015, on a pre-tax basis, compared to a profit of \u00a33.780bn in 2014. That, Reuters reports, is the biggest loss in two decades. Oil companies like to report their results in \u201cunderlying replacement cost profit\u201d terms, to strip out the impact of the fluctuating oil price. But even then, BP\u2019s results are worse than expected. It reported a 91% drop in underlying profits in the last three months, to just $196m. It\u2019s bad news for workers - BP is planning to cut an extra 3,000 jobs in its downstream unit by the end of 2017, on top of 4,000 earlier cuts. After weeks of haggling, Sainsbury has finally secured the takeover of Home Retail - owner of catalogue shopping chain Argus. The two sides reached terms overnight of a \u00a31.3bn merger. This is Sainsbury CEO Mike Coupe\u2019s first big deal -- he\u2019s hoping to repel the march of Amazon, and rising pressure from discount grocers. Assuming shareholders back the deal, Sainsbury will soon be installing Argos outlets in its stores. My colleague Sean Farrell has the details of the deal: Britain\u2019s second-biggest supermarket has proposed paying Home Retail shareholders 55p in cash and 0.321 Sainsbury\u2019s shares for each of their shares, valuing Home Retail at \u00a31.1bn. Under the terms of the proposed deal, Home Retail shareholders would also get a further \u00a3200m from the sale of Homebase, Home retail\u2019s DIY and homewares business. Along with a 2.8p per share payment in lieu of a final dividend, the proposed offer values Home Retail at 161.3p a share or about \u00a31.3bn. Most Asian stock markets lost ground today, with Japan\u2019s Nikkei closing 0.64% lower. China bucked the trend, though, jumping over 2%, after the People\u2019s Bank of China pumped more money into the system. Marketwatch explains why: China\u2019s central bank injected 100 billion yuan ($15.2 billion) in short-term loans to money markets, in a move to stave off potential liquidity squeezes ahead of the weeklong Lunar New Year holiday that starts on February 7. This is the first leg of the bank\u2019s usual twice-a-week money-market operations. Overnight, Australia\u2019s central bank left interest rates unchanged at the record low of 2%. But it also warned it could cut soon if the recent financial market turbulence continues. Worries over the strength of the global economy has pushed the gold price up to its highest level since the start of November. Bullion hit $1,130 per ounce in early reading, as investors scurried for safe-havens in the face of recent weak economic data. Fears over China were also rife, after yesterday\u2019s data showed its factory sector shrinking at the fastest rate since 2012. Japan\u2019s move into negative interest rates on Friday has also caused jitters, as traders wonder whether further unconventional monetary policy will be deployed soon. And this uncertainty is making gold more attractive. Reuters explains: With rates close to zero, the \u201conly option is to move either towards zero or negative rates as the Japanese and selected European countries are already doing in a desperate attempt to force banks to lend\u201d, INTL FCStone analyst Edward Meir wrote to clients. \u201cWhatever the case, this should be constructive for gold.\u201d Good morning, and welcome to our rolling overage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Worries over the global economy continue to weigh on markets today, after yesterday\u2019s disappointing manufacturing surveys from China and the US. The main European markets are expected to dip, extending yesterday\u2019s selloff: On the data front, we find out at 10am whether Europe\u2019s jobs market improved in December. The main eurozone jobless rate is expected to remain at 10.5% , matching the four-year low reached in November. And at 9.30am, we also get the latest survey of the UK construction sector for January. Last week we learned that the building industry contracted in the last quarter of 2015, so analysts will be hoping for signs of recovery. In the City, oil giant BP and online supermarket Ocado are reporting financial results. As feared, BP has suffered from the slump in the oil price. It\u2019s also outlining significant job cuts. And supermarket chain Sainsbury has been hammering out the terms of a takeover for Home Retail, to get control of its Argos shops.",

                "bodyText":"Apple has come under pressure to scrap its controversial policy of permanently disabling repaired iPhone 6s when software is upgraded, following a global consumer backlash and claims the company could be acting illegally. At least one firm of US lawyers said it hopes to bring a class action against the technology giant on behalf of victims whose \u00a3500 phones have been rendered worthless by an Apple software upgrade. In the UK, a barrister told the Guardian that Apple\u2019s \u201creckless\u201d policy of effectively killing people\u2019s iPhones following the software upgrade could potentially be viewed as an offence under the Criminal Damage Act 1971. The act makes it an offence to intentionally destroy the property of another. The Guardian revealed on Friday how thousands of iPhone 6 users found an iOS software upgrade permanently disabled their phone, which was left displaying an \u201cError 53\u201d code.

The Apple iOS 9 software update which it launched last autumn will, in the jargon, \u201cbrick\u201d the handset if it detects that the touch ID fingerprint recognition and/or the home button is not the original.

People whose phones have been shut down and have complained at Apple stores have been told that nothing can be done and they must buy a new handset. Within hours of publication of the Guardian story, the Seattle-based law firm PCVA called for victims to get in touch, with a view to bringing a class action suit. Consumers have reacted with disbelief and growing anger. \u201cShow me where, in consumer law, the vendor has the right to render inoperable the hardware you just bought,\u201d said one poster on the Guardian\u2019s website.

                "bodyText":"The former boss of Sainsbury\u2019s has waded into the row over the tax paid by multinationals such as Amazon and eBay, saying it was unfair that that traditional retailers must pay huge rates bills for services such as roads and waste collection, while their online rivals paid little but received the same benefits. Business rates, said Justin King, are a bigger problem for British retailers than the corporation tax scandal. Amazon and other US businesses including Starbucks, Google and eBay have been criticised for paying little corporation tax in the UK compared to the value of the business that they do. But for retailers, said King, corporation tax is vastly overshadowed by the huge difference in business rates between firms with chains of stores and online players with just a few big warehouses. \u201cBusiness rates are by far the most significant inbalance in the tax system,\u201d King said. \u201cBusiness rates for most retail businesses are a much more significant part of the tax burden than any other part of the tax system.\u201d He said the low level of business rates paid by online retailers in comparison to supermarkets and other major retail chains was accelerating change on Britain\u2019s high streets. Amazon, which raked in sales of more than \u00a36bn in sales from UK shoppers, is estimated to pay only about \u00a310m in business rates. Marks &amp; Spencer, which has UK sales of just less than \u00a310bn, last year faced a rates bill of \u00a3177m. Tesco\u2019s UK sales last year were nearly \u00a344bn, more than seven times those of Amazon, but its business rates bill is 60 times higher. Sainsbury\u2019s, Kings former employer, pays \u00a3480m in business rates. King said: \u201cA big part of of the advantage non bricks and mortar retailers enjoy is their ability to use services that their competitors paid for. They use the roads, they still use waste collection services but they are paid for by the local retailer, through business rates, who has just had that sale competed away from him. \u201cThat unbalance is a [big] part of the change we are seeing [on the high street] and clearly has to change at some point,\u201d added King, who now works for private equity firm Terra Firma, which owns Wyevale Garden Centres, Odeon cinemas and the Four Seasons care homes.

John Lewis boss Andy Street, Tesco\u2019s Dave Lewis and Mike Coupe, the current boss of Sainsbury\u2019s, have all said the system is putting unfair pressure on their businesses. Lewis said retailers face a \u201cpotentially lethal cocktail\u201d as profits come under pressure from increased competition but costs rise because of business rates and the national living wage. Paul Turner-Mitchell, a business rates campaigner who calculated Amazon\u2019s estimated business rates bill, said: \u201cRetail has evolved over recent years but the current business rate regime simply does not ebb and flow with economical or market place changes.\u201d David Cameron promised \u201cradical reform\u201d of the system, but a Treasury review has only pledged to look at the way the system is administered, not the total amount of tax taken. The complexity of the system could increase after chancellor George Osborne said that local councils could be allowed to retain the amount they raise from business rates and set special rates for certain areas.

                "bodyText":"Wall Street has opened higher. The Dow Jones and the Nasdaq both gained 0.3% while the S&amp;P 500 edged up 0.1%. Most European stock markets are trading higher, with Germany\u2019s Dax up 1.5%, France\u2019s CAC 0.8% ahead, and Spain\u2019s Ibex up 0.9%. The price of Brent crude has climbed 2.6% to $35.37 a barrel today. A notable exception is the FTSE 100 index in London, which has fallen more than 50 points to 5979.15, a fall of 0.85%. With this, we are closing up for the day. Thank you for all your comments. We will be back tomorrow. There\u2019s been a spate of job loss announcements by major British-based companies in the past fortnight or so, with Centrica today and Bombardier yesterday the latest companies to talk about job cuts. We\u2019ve done a round-up of companies axeing jobs in the UK, and looked at what it means for the wider economy. Allan Monks, UK economist at JPMorgan Chase, said: The one thing everyone is looking for at the moment is a sign that there is a slide in business sentiment. In the manufacturing sector in particular the trend doesn\u2019t look encouraging.\u201d Here\u2019s some reaction to the Asda sales slump, which confirmed its position as the worst-performing of the Big Four supermarkets over the Christmas period, amid a fierce price war. George Scott, senior analyst at Verdict Retail, has looked at the chain\u2019s problems in detail. Asda\u2019s now prolonged story of negative like-for-like sales shows that it has not done enough to broaden its appeal beyond price. Indeed news this week that it has asked suppliers for cash contributions to help cover costs of promotions reflects its predicament. Away from price, Asda has a relatively weak reputation for quality, with its more upmarket Extra Special label needing greater product coverage and marketing communications. While its more functional instore experience sits well with its traditional shoppers, it also needs to do more to improve its staffing levels, adding reasons to visit, if it is to claw back ground from the discounters \u2013 Tesco has been leading by example on this front with good effect.\u201d He noted that Asda had announced some positive steps for this year, including the modernisation of 95 large stores, mostly around layout and merchandising. It also plans to further simplify its head office structure,and has joined the EMD European supermarket alliance, which will give it added buying power and allow it compete more strongly on price. If it is to improve its outlook Asda however needs to evolve its mainstay food positioning. Indeed its George fashion and home label, which has been performing strongly for some time, has exactly the type of balanced consideration of price and quality which that it needs to aim for in food.\u201d Asda has reported a sharp fall in sales over Christmas as it failed to stem an exodus of shoppers to German discount chains Aldi and Lidl. The UK supermarket chain, owned by US retail giant Wal-mart, posted a 5.8% decline in like-for-like sales in the 13 weeks to 1 January, marking the sixth quarter of falling sales. It is a steeper fall than the 4.5% and 4.7% declines seen in the previous two quarters. However, the company stressed that profitability in the quarter remained stable. European shares have hit a two-week high, helped by gains in technology shares led by France\u2019s Capgemini which reported a 20% rise in full-year profits. The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index rose 0.7% to 1304.31. The FTSE 100 index in London is still down, however. It has slipped 24 points or 0.4%, but is holding above the 6000 mark at 6006.36. The minutes of the European Central Bank\u2019s January meeting are out. They show that policymakers thought that the eurozone\u2019s modest recovery was continuing but flagged up rising risks to the growth outlook. They also pointed to weak wage growth and other signs that low energy prices could feed through into the price of other goods and services \u2013 so-called second-round effects that could keep inflation low. The ECB\u2019s governing council left interest rates unchanged at the meeting, but its president Mario Draghi dropped heavy hints that it could ease policy at the next meeting on 10 March. The minutes said: While incoming information had confirmed the ongoing moderate recovery... downside risks had increased again amid heightened uncertainty about the growth prospects of emerging market economies, volatility in the financial and commodity markets and geopolitical risks. Inflation had continued to be weaker than expected, mainly owing to the renewed sharp fall in oil prices, but also to persistently subdued underlying price pressures. Weaker than anticipated growth in wages, in conjunction with declining inflation expectations, could also signal increased risks of second-round effects. After a bit of a wobble earlier on, the rally on European stock markets continues, underpinned by rising oil prices. London\u2019s leading share index, the FTSE 100, is the only exception, trading down 0.3% or 16 points at 6015.05. Germany\u2019s Dax is 1.6% ahead, France\u2019s CAC has gained 0.8% while Spain\u2019s Ibex and Italy\u2019s FTSE Mib are just over 1% higher. Crude oil prices are rising again, adding to yesterday\u2019s 7% leap. Brent crude is up 2.1% at $35.24 a barrel after encouraging comments from Iraq\u2019s oil minister. He said talks would continue between Opec and non-Opec members about how to shore up oil prices, and that producers needed to find a way of restoring \u201cnormal\u201d prices. The Paris-based OECD think tank has called for less austerity and more public investment as it cut its growth forecasts. And Britain\u2019s productivity gap with other major economies has widened to the worst level since records began in 1991. Here is some reaction to the UK\u2019s poor productivity figures. TUC general secretary Frances O\u2019Grady said: For all the good news on rising employment, the UK is still not creating enough quality jobs. The yawning productivity gap between us and other countries shows how much room there is for us to do better.\u201d Workplace management firm Condeco Software is calling for more flexible working, saying the impact on productivity is well-documented. There is increased need to take the potential of flexible working seriously. In research by Vodafone, which surveyed 8,000 global employers and employees, 83% said they had seen an improvement in productivity after introducing flexible working arrangements. In addition, 61% of respondents said profits had increased. This latest report adds to research suggesting that UK businesses could make productivity gains of \u00a38.1bn by optimising flexible working. Oil prices are pushing higher again, with Brent crude rising 2.6% to $35.39 a barrel, after comments from Iraq\u2019s oil minister. Adel Abdul Mahdi said talks would continue between Opec and non-Opec members about how to shore up oil prices, a day after a meeting aimed at reaching a global pact to freeze production ended inconclusively. In his first public comments since the meeting between oil ministers from Iran, Iraq, Qatar and Venezuela in Tehran yesterday, the Iraqi oil minister said producers needed to find a way of restoring \u201cnormal\u201d prices and that rapprochement between the oil cartel and non-Opec members was a step in the right direction. Two of the world\u2019s biggest exporters \u2013 Opec leader Saudi Arabia and Russia, which is not a member of the cartel \u2013 reached a surprise compromise deal earlier this week to freeze output at January levels if other producers join in. A lot hinges on Iran, whose oil minister praised the plan yesterday \u2013 but did not commit to reining in the country\u2019s own growing output. We\u2019ve long known that despite decent economic growth, UK productivity growth isn\u2019t great (why, nobody really knows - it\u2019s called the productivity puzzle). Official figures now show that productivity gap between Britain and other G-7 countries has widened to the biggest since records began in 1991. The figures underscore the challenge for the chancellor, George Osborne, who has made raising the UK\u2019s poor productivity growth a priority. In 2014, output per hour in the UK was 18 percentage points below the average for the rest of the G-7 economies, final figures from the Office for National Statistics showed this morning. For the first time, the ONS has published international comparisons of productivity at a sectoral level. The results show that UK labour productivity trails behind the US in all sub-sectors and particularly in manufacturing. In financial services, the UK\u2019s comparative productivity has worsened sharply since 2009 and trails France and Italy as well as the US. The UK was 5% more productive than Germany but 6% less productive than France, and 22% less productive than the US between 2010 and 2014. When looking at manufacturing, the UK was 24% less productive than Germany, 18% behind France and 45% less productive than the USA. One of the Bank of England\u2019s deputy governors, Jon Cunliffe, said this morning that the recent shift in market expectations regarding the timing of the first interest rate hike was not justified. A month ago, financial markets were expecting the first rate hike from the Bank in 2017, but are now pricing in a rise in the second quarter of 2019. Cunliffe said at an event in Brussels held by the Swiss Finance Council: I can\u2019t see anything in the economic news that would lead to a shift like that.\u201d The OECD has called for its rich-country members to ease up on austerity and collectively agree to spend more on infrastructure projects to boost flagging growth. Our economics editor Larry Elliott reports: The Paris-based Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development expressed concern about the state of the global economy as it cut growth forecasts made three months ago and warned that low interest rates and money creation by central banks were no longer enough for a lasting recovery. Marking the latest stage in its shift away from support for austerity, the OECD criticised the over-reliance on monetary policy \u2013 low interest rates and the money-creation process known as quantitative easing \u2013 and urged that countries adopt a more balanced approach. The OECD has in the past supported the deficit-reduction programme taken by the UK chancellor, George Osborne, but believes Britain should now join with other countries in spending more on public investment. You can read the full story here. Alastair McCaig, market analyst at online trading firm IG, has sent us his thoughts on the markets. Early trading in Europe has seen markets creep higher with levels of enthusiasm normally shown by teenagers tidying their rooms. The FTSE has an added disadvantage as Shell, GlaxoSmithKline and AstraZeneca all go ex-dividend, knocking 24 points off the index. The importance of David Cameron\u2019s negotiations at the EU summit can\u2019t be underestimated, as a failure to get a resolution at this meeting will almost certainly derail a Brexit referendum in June. The IG Brexit binary still indicates a 67% chance that the UK will vote to remain in the EU. Oil continues to levitate just above the $30 level as traders gauge how likely it is that major oil producers will adhere to the new production cap. It was the turn of Iran and Iraq to discuss production levels yesterday, and although Iran made all the right noises it simultaneously failed to make any promises. Considering it has only just managed to get off an oil embargo list, Iran could be forgiven for being a little reluctant to reduce capacity.\u201d Japanese prime minister Shinzo Abe said this morning he hopes the Bank of Japan\u2019s move to negative interest rates will support consumer spending and investment. Speaking at a meeting of government ministers, he added that the government is monitoring moves in financial markets and hopes to cooperate with G-7 countries as needed. London\u2019s leading share index, the FTSE 100, is still down 0.6%, suffering under the weight of the commodity sector. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, says: The FTSE started the day suffering under the weight of its commodity sector. The miners appear to be falling back to the levels they rose from yesterday, arguably harmed by the fact that, whilst at its highest point since last September the Chinese inflation figures from the early hours of the day underperformed the 1.9% expected by analysts, coming in at 1.8%. Add onto that the slowing momentum of Brent Crude and the oil stocks joined in with the losses, leaving the FTSE with little wiggle room this Thursday. This is despite strong gains from British Gas owner Centrica, up 3.8% to 201.5p, the top riser on the FTSE. Defence contractor BAE Systems was up 2% earlier and is now trading 0.8% higher at 503.5p. Campbell notes: Though Centrica\u2019s better than expected 12% fall in yearly adjusted operating profit to \u00a31.5bn was joined by a 5% fall in revenue to \u00a328bn AND a cut dividend, British Gas\u2019 31% surge in profit to \u00a3574m appeared to be enough for investors, the utility company rising by 3.5% to hit the \u00a32 mark for the first time since the start of February. And whilst not as explosive as rival Rolls-Royce\u2019s gains last Friday, BAE Systems will likely be pleased with its 2% rise this Thursday, that jump seeing the defence and aerospace firm re-cross the \u00a35 mark after revealing a 2% increase in its final dividend and a \u00a31.3bn increase in sales to \u00a317.9bn, the latter aided by a Saudi Arabian aircraft splurge. The United Arab Emirates\u2019 energy minister Suhail bin Mohammed al-Mazrouei has given verbal support to plans by Russia and Saudi Arabia to cap production. He said this morning that oil prices are \u201cnot suitable\u201d and will force producers to freeze their output. State news agency WAM quoted him as saying: Current prices are not suitable... and will force producers to hold production levels and limit investments in the higher cost oil [production].\u201d Amazon said it would open a new 1m sq ft fulfillment centre in in Coalville, Leicestershire, creating 500 new jobs over three years, as it expands aggressively in the UK and the rest of Europe. The company has started recruiting for a range of positions, from operations managers to engineers, HR and IT roles. The centre will open in the autumn. The move forms part of plans to hire 2,500 people for permanent roles in the UK this year. The online giant is also pushing ahead with plans for \u201chundreds\u201d of bookshops in the US, after opening its first bookshop in Seattle recently. Oil prices continue to climb, after Iran welcomed plans by Russia and Saudi Arabia to cap production, although analysts noted that the move would not lead to any output cuts and Tehran did not commit to reining in its own growing output. The price of Brent crude, the global benchmark, jumped 7% yesterday. Today, Brent rose more than 1% in early London trading but is now flat at $34.52 a barrel. Stock markets have got off to a cautious start: The FTSE 100 index is down nearly 40 points, or 0.6%, at 5992.86. The Dax in Frankfurt is 0.15% ahead while the CAC in Paris has edged up 0.1%. Disappointing corporate results are weighing on European stocks. Shares in food giant Nestl\u00e9 dropped more than 4% after sales missed forecasts and it admitted it was struggling to raise its prices. It has been hit by the slowdown in emerging markets, and a recall of its popular Maggi noodles in India. Belgian bank and insurance group KBC also saw its shares fall by 4% after it took an impairment on its operations in Bulgaria and Slovakia. On the agenda today, a report on the state of the global economy from the Paris-based Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development is out at 10.00 GMT. The number of properties in Britain worth \u00a31m or more is set to more than triple by 2030, widening the gap between the housing haves and have-nots, according to a new report. Less than half a million homes in the UK are currently valued at \u00a31m-plus, but a study by high street lender Santander claims this number will rise to more than 1.6m in the next 15 years. You can read the report on property millionaires here (PDF). Santander said: By 2030 the UK will be even more starkly divided into the housing wealthy and the housing poor than it is now.\u201d But Centrica, Britain\u2019s biggest energy supplier, also said adjusted pretax profits for the group had fallen to \u00a31.1bn in 2015 from \u00a31.3bn the previous year, as the falling oil price took its toll. It is axeing 1,000 jobs this year, as part of 4,000 cutbacks by 2020 that were announced last year. The company is also cutting back investments further, and reduced its dividend by 30% to 12p a share. Following the collapse in wholesale prices, it booked charges of \u00a32.4bn on oil and gas assets and power stations. Here is the full story. On the corporate front, British Gas owner Centrica has reported a leap in annual profits of 31%, to \u00a3574m, at its residential supply business. Our energy editor, Terry Macalister, reports: The soaring profit comes amid growing calls for the big six suppliers to cut their power bills for customers in line with wholesale prices. Fuel Poverty Action, a campaign group for those struggling to pay their energy bills, said the figures showed the company was profiteering at the expense of hard-pressed consumers. \u201cIt is absolutely sickening that British Gas has made bumper profits in a year when there were more winter deaths than at any time this century. We have seen British Gas mercilessly hound hard-up customers even when bills are in dispute,\u201d said a spokeswoman, Ruth London. Meanwhile, Eurotunnel is claiming \u20ac29m (\u00a323m) from the British and French governments for lost revenue caused by refugees trying to get from Calais to the UK. You can read the full story here. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Stock markets have had a decent run this week, after all the recent turmoil. London\u2019s leading share index, the FTSE 100, posted four consecutive daily gains for the first time this year, its best run since November. The gains have come on the back of a recovery in oil prices, which have been boosted by support from Iran for a plan put forward by Saudi Arabia and Russia to freeze production. Brent crude is now trading at $34.73, up 0.7% on the day. Asian stock markets rose strongly after the minutes of the last US Federal Reserve meeting indicated caution among policymakers regarding the next interest rate hike. Japan\u2019s Nikkei finished 2.3% higher at 16,196.80 while Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng rose 2.1% to 19,328.91. Paul Ashworth, chief US economist at Capital Economics, said the minutes showed Fed policymakers are playing for time. Despite the increased uncertainty, [Fed] officials seemed content to wait and see whether the tightening of financial conditions was sustained and, if so, whether it would negatively impact on GDP growth. In the immediate aftermath of that January meeting financial conditions tightened even further, with equity prices tumbling and riskier corporate bond spreads widening. As it stands now, however, the S&amp;P 500 is back at its late January level, the dollar has weakened and, even though junk bond yields have increased, investment-grade corporate bond yields and mortgage rates have actually fallen. The incoming economic data have also improved, with employment, retail sales and manufacturing output recording solid gains in January. The chances of a March rate hike are still very slim, particularly in light of the most recent comments from Fed officials, but we think the Fed will resume hiking interest rates later this year. By the middle of this year, fears of a collapse in both China and the US should have faded and rising domestic price pressures will be even harder to ignore. We expect the fed funds rate to end this year at between 1.00% and 1.25%.\u201d",

                "bodyText":"HSBC is rolling out voice recognition and touch ID services for 15 million customers by the summer in a big step towards biometric banking in the UK. Other banks are also introducing biometric security, but HSBC, which recently suffered an online cyber attack, is the first to roll it out to millions of retail customers. HSBC and First Direct customers using telephone banking and the mobile app are being offered the chance to access their accounts with a voice and fingerprint verification system. The bank hopes the software will help tackle the issue of forgotten passwords. Francesca McDonagh, HSBC UK\u2019s head of retail banking and wealth management, described the move as \u201cthe largest planned rollout of voice biometric security technology in the UK\u201d. She said: \u201cThe launch of voice and touch ID makes it even quicker and easier for customers to access their bank account, using the most secure form of password technology \u2013 the body.\u201d First Direct will begin to enrol customers for voice ID in coming weeks and HSBC will follow by the summer. Customers who opt in will have to enrol their \u201cvoice print\u201d and will no longer need to remember a telephone security password or PIN. Barclays introduced voice recognition software for all its 300,000 wealthiest clients in the UK in 2013. A year later the bank said the technology had been so successful that it would be rolled out to 12m retail banking customers. Barclays now intends to offer them voice recognition later this year, saying it had been \u201cincredibly popular\u201d with its wealthier clients, with the time taken to verify their identity falling from 1.5 minutes to less than 10 seconds. Lloyds Banking Group said it was considering whether to introduce the Amazon Echo, a hands-free and voice-controlled device currently only available in the US, for its online banking services. The bank said Britain\u2019s 360,000 blind or partially sighted people could benefit from voice recognition. Royal Bank of Scotland said touch ID had been a \u201chuge success\u201d after its launch last year, with more than one million customers now logging in with their fingerprint. In the US, a number of banks have been experimenting with biometrics technology, and Citi has about 250,000 customers who are using voice recognition to authenticate themselves. Touch ID is available on all new Apple mobile devices for HSBC and First Direct. Customers need to download the mobile banking app and follow the instructions to link their fingerprint to it. Joe Gordon, UK head of customer contact at HSBC, said the voice recognition would still work if people have a cold. He told the BBC\u2019s Today programme: \u201cWe will be able to cope with people who have got colds or slight impediments. Things such as the size of your mouth or your vocal tract don\u2019t change. Neither do your cadence or your accent when you\u2019ve got those little colds.\u201d Nuance Communications is supplying the voice biometrics technology which works by cross-checking against more than 100 unique identifiers including behavioural features such as speed, cadence and pronunciation, and physical aspects including the shape of larynx, vocal tract and nasal passages. Together with voice and touch, Britons believe heartbeats, head hair and even saliva could form the passwords of the future, according to a YouGov poll released by HSBC. The survey shows 38% of people use the same password across most of their online accounts, while 55% say they rarely update their passwords. It found that 78% of 2,038 adults questioned were confident their body was unique enough to be used as a password and that 74% felt this would become the default password of the future. Tracy Garrad, chief executive of First Direct, said voices and fingerprints were unique, with physical and behavioural characteristics almost impossible to mimic. \u201cWhile this is the largest rollout of voice ID in UK banking, other industries will soon follow our lead,\u201d she said. However, Ryan Rubin, managing director at consulting firm Protiviti, warned: \u201cAs the technologies themselves are still emerging it is often the implementation of them that brings about security vulnerabilities, not necessarily the techniques themselves. In general biometrics have been known to create false positives and false negatives thereby blocking legitimate access or allowing illegitimate access.\u201d And Phil Tootell, director at banking consultancy Certeco, said: \u201cThe challenge for HSBC \u2013 bogged down as they are with legacy IT systems \u2013 will be to reduce some of the complexity in their IT architecture, whilst introducing these voice and touch authentication services.

                "bodyText":"Amazon is at the centre of a row about a warehouse development in Kent that is set to benefit from almost \u00a350m of government funding and threatens the future of a listed medieval church. Councillors and local residents have expressed concerns about Amazon opening a new 1m sq ft warehouse at the site in Sevington, claiming it would bring low-paid jobs and the \u201cworst kind of corporate citizenship\u201d to the area. The GMB trade union claims the online retailer is involved in the project and council documents suggest it is connected to the proposed development. However, Amazon and the Ashford borough council deny the claims, while the developer that submitted the planning application says it is yet to sign up a tenant. The row highlights how the Amazon brand has become an emotive topic in local communities and has echoes of Tesco\u2019s regular clashes with towns and villages as it tried to expand a decade ago. Tesco filed planning applications under different company names so they had a better chance of succeeding and avoiding local opposition. The proposed development would be built on boggy greenfields located next to the picturesque villages of Sevington and Mersham in Kent, which are locked between the A2070 and the M20, two of the main travel arteries in the south east. The developers, backed by local and national government, want a new junction on the M20 to be built to help the businesses that will occupy the site. Highways England has estimated the cost of the new junction will be \u00a370m, with the Department for Transport providing \u00a327m, the South East Local Enterprise Partnership \u00a320m, and the developer and occupiers of the new buildings the rest. That means the businesses which will use the site are set to benefit from tens of millions of pounds of government funding. Project Amazon The GMB trade union is convinced Amazon is involved in the project after seeing leaked council documents, and it is furious that the online retailer could be in line for financial support despite the small amount of tax it pays and the way it treats staff. Frank Macklin, GMB regional officer, said the council needs to \u201ccome clean\u201d about the project. \u201cThere is so much secrecy. No one in Ashford borough council will say anything,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are not opposed to Amazon opening a site here, we are opposed to their business practices, they do not treat their staff very well.\u201d The Guardian has seen Ashford borough council budget documents that shows it is expecting income from a project labelled simply as \u201cAmazon\u201d. However, the council denied that Amazon will occupy the site and in a statement the company itself said: \u201cAmazon has no plans to open a fulfilment centre in Ashford.\u201d A spokesman for the council leadership said the reference to Amazon in the leaked document was because the company was \u201cbeing used internally as a proxy for the type of occupier for the site\u201d.

Twitter is on-again, off-again in Turkey, depending on the mood of the government, which frequently censors its feed. Pakistan banned Google\u2019s YouTube. Uber has made enemies of taxi drivers and even its own drivers in cities around the world as it undercuts the first group, then cuts payments to the latter. Airbnb is under investigation in New York, London and elsewhere over whether its accommodation site breaks short-let laws. Amazon is rebuked by MPs over its revenue-shifting, tax-minimising ways, and by bookshop lovers who have seen it undercut high-street retailers. Spotify (which hails from Sweden) is criticised by fans and players for the tiny amounts musicians get paid when people stream music through it rather than buying a download or \u2013 remember when? \u2013 a CD.</p> <p>And that\u2019s before we get to artificial intelligence, where people fear huge job losses as machines take over more and more complex jobs. Google, again, is at the nexus of that row, with UK company DeepMind (which it bought in 2014) having to try to dampen worries while raising expectations.</p> <p>Technology companies may not create oil spills, but their effects on modern life are suddenly spreading across a gamut of topics \u2013 privacy, tax, regulation, safety, even housing.</p> <p>That\u2019s why the San Bernardino case could be the straw that breaks the camel\u2019s back. The FBI knows that the publicity from this battle won\u2019t be favourable to Apple, whichever way the courts rule. That worries every other technology company: it\u2019s notable that <a href=\"https://twitter.com/sundarpichai\" title=\"\">Google chief executive Sundar Pichai\u2019s tweets on the topic</a> were carefully hedged, while Microsoft\u2019s Satya Nadella was similarly unwilling to stand foursquare behind Tim Cook (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/feb/18/apple-fbi-encryption-battle-iphone-facebook-twitter-san-bernardino-shooting\" title=\"\">unlike WhatsApp\u2019s Jan Koum and Twitter\u2019s Jack Dorsey</a>). Facebook\u2019s Mark Zuckerberg has been completely silent, though his company did issue a supportive statement.</p> <p>Apple, of course, wasn\u2019t looking for a row with the FBI when it improved the encryption on its phones. And that is what will worry tech companies. As their influence on our daily lives grows, the effects of new features become less predictable \u2013 but probably greater.</p> <p>What if the next case involves taxis and short lets used for child trafficking? Or tax avoidance turning out to fund terrorism? Those may sound farfetched, but they\u2019re only a form of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melvin_Kranzberg\" title=\"\">Kranzberg\u2019s first law</a>: \u201cTechnology is neither good nor bad; nor is it neutral.\u201d</p> <p>This week, the tech business is learning, to its reputational cost, just what that really means.</p> <h2>An old-fashioned fix for the G20<br></h2> <p>When G20 finance ministers and central bank governors meet this week in Shanghai, the failure of low interest rates to stimulate growth in their economies will be top of the agenda.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/feb/18/oecd-calls-for-less-austerity-and-more-public-investment\" title=\"\">The global economy is faltering</a> and the knee-jerk response is the same today as it has been since 2008: extra monetary stimulus. But when it seems clear that cutting interest rates to zero \u2013 or even below, a move already deployed in Europe and Japan \u2013 has the same catalysing force as a weak decaff cuppa, surely it is time for a rethink.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/economics-blog/2016/feb/18/oecd-calls-less-austerity-common-sense-prevailed\" title=\"\">The Organisation of Economic Co-operation &amp; Development will be on hand with an alternative</a>, though it will not sound very modern or innovative: it is recommending G20 nations coordinate an increase in spending to upgrade their infrastructure. Countries with the capacity to borrow should do so, and that includes the UK.</p> <p>According to the OECD, the growth this plan induces will more than offset the cost of borrowing and will expand national incomes sustainably.</p> <p>This embrace of Keynesianism is not before time. Economists outside the central banks have known for some time that flooding the financial system with cheap funds is a recipe for stagnation. It neither breeds confidence nor tackles structural imbalances, especially not the growing inequality that robs people on lower pay of decent wages to spend.</p> <p>George Osborne will fight the OECD, primarily to defend his economically nonsensical pitch to voters that the exchequer will benefit from balancing the books by 2020. Likewise, Germany will oppose the plan because its ageing population wants to conserve cash, not spend it for the benefit of the next generation.</p> <p>Other countries will resist for more practical reasons. China is investing like crazy and needs to continue switching to consumption, though it might be better if it encouraged the consumption of healthcare via taxation than the purchase of high street goods.</p> <p>Which illustrates how political forces defeat economic arguments, even when those arguments make sense for almost every country and could end the reliance on increasingly exhausted central banks.</p> <h2>Banks need a nice thick cushion</h2> <p>The words \u201csystemic risk buffers\u201d may cause many eyes to glaze over. But they shouldn\u2019t. This is the extra bit of capital cushion that banks should hold, on top of the regulatory minimum, to help protect them against a system-wide meltdown such as we saw in the 2008 crisis. Sir John Vickers, who in 2011 was charged with finding ways of preventing another taxpayer bailout of the banking system, concluded that banks should hold an extra buffer worth 3% of their assets.</p> <p>Five years on, the Bank of England has set the buffer at around 0.5%. The Bank argues that when it is all added together, the amount of capital banks are required to hold is more than the overall total prescribed by Vickers.</p> <p>Even so, Vickers <a href=\"https://next.ft.com/content/674b16b8-d184-11e5-831d-09f7778e7377\" title=\"\">spoke out last week to urge Threadneedle Street to think again</a>. He says these buffers are as important as ever for the safety of the UK banking sector, which remains bigger than the nation\u2019s GDP. He should be given a good hearing.</p>",

Pakistan banned Google\u2019s YouTube. Uber has made enemies of taxi drivers and even its own drivers in cities around the world as it undercuts the first group, then cuts payments to the latter. Airbnb is under investigation in New York, London and elsewhere over whether its accommodation site breaks short-let laws. Amazon is rebuked by MPs over its revenue-shifting, tax-minimising ways, and by bookshop lovers who have seen it undercut high-street retailers. Spotify (which hails from Sweden) is criticised by fans and players for the tiny amounts musicians get paid when people stream music through it rather than buying a download or \u2013 remember when? \u2013 a CD. And that\u2019s before we get to artificial intelligence, where people fear huge job losses as machines take over more and more complex jobs. Google, again, is at the nexus of that row, with UK company DeepMind (which it bought in 2014) having to try to dampen worries while raising expectations. Technology companies may not create oil spills, but their effects on modern life are suddenly spreading across a gamut of topics \u2013 privacy, tax, regulation, safety, even housing. That\u2019s why the San Bernardino case could be the straw that breaks the camel\u2019s back. The FBI knows that the publicity from this battle won\u2019t be favourable to Apple, whichever way the courts rule. That worries every other technology company: it\u2019s notable that Google chief executive Sundar Pichai\u2019s tweets on the topic were carefully hedged, while Microsoft\u2019s Satya Nadella was similarly unwilling to stand foursquare behind Tim Cook (unlike WhatsApp\u2019s Jan Koum and Twitter\u2019s Jack Dorsey). Facebook\u2019s Mark Zuckerberg has been completely silent, though his company did issue a supportive statement. Apple, of course, wasn\u2019t looking for a row with the FBI when it improved the encryption on its phones. And that is what will worry tech companies. As their influence on our daily lives grows, the effects of new features become less predictable \u2013 but probably greater. What if the next case involves taxis and short lets used for child trafficking? Or tax avoidance turning out to fund terrorism? Those may sound farfetched, but they\u2019re only a form of Kranzberg\u2019s first law: \u201cTechnology is neither good nor bad; nor is it neutral.\u201d This week, the tech business is learning, to its reputational cost, just what that really means. An old-fashioned fix for the G20 When G20 finance ministers and central bank governors meet this week in Shanghai, the failure of low interest rates to stimulate growth in their economies will be top of the agenda. The global economy is faltering and the knee-jerk response is the same today as it has been since 2008: extra monetary stimulus. But when it seems clear that cutting interest rates to zero \u2013 or even below, a move already deployed in Europe and Japan \u2013 has the same catalysing force as a weak decaff cuppa, surely it is time for a rethink. The Organisation of Economic Co-operation &amp; Development will be on hand with an alternative, though it will not sound very modern or innovative: it is recommending G20 nations coordinate an increase in spending to upgrade their infrastructure. Countries with the capacity to borrow should do so, and that includes the UK. According to the OECD, the growth this plan induces will more than offset the cost of borrowing and will expand national incomes sustainably. This embrace of Keynesianism is not before time. Economists outside the central banks have known for some time that flooding the financial system with cheap funds is a recipe for stagnation. It neither breeds confidence nor tackles structural imbalances, especially not the growing inequality that robs people on lower pay of decent wages to spend. George Osborne will fight the OECD, primarily to defend his economically nonsensical pitch to voters that the exchequer will benefit from balancing the books by 2020. Likewise, Germany will oppose the plan because its ageing population wants to conserve cash, not spend it for the benefit of the next generation. Other countries will resist for more practical reasons. China is investing like crazy and needs to continue switching to consumption, though it might be better if it encouraged the consumption of healthcare via taxation than the purchase of high street goods. Which illustrates how political forces defeat economic arguments, even when those arguments make sense for almost every country and could end the reliance on increasingly exhausted central banks. Banks need a nice thick cushion The words \u201csystemic risk buffers\u201d may cause many eyes to glaze over. But they shouldn\u2019t. This is the extra bit of capital cushion that banks should hold, on top of the regulatory minimum, to help protect them against a system-wide meltdown such as we saw in the 2008 crisis. Sir John Vickers, who in 2011 was charged with finding ways of preventing another taxpayer bailout of the banking system, concluded that banks should hold an extra buffer worth 3% of their assets. Five years on, the Bank of England has set the buffer at around 0.5%. The Bank argues that when it is all added together, the amount of capital banks are required to hold is more than the overall total prescribed by Vickers. Even so, Vickers spoke out last week to urge Threadneedle Street to think again. He says these buffers are as important as ever for the safety of the UK banking sector, which remains bigger than the nation\u2019s GDP. He should be given a good hearing.",

As a result, some of the month\u2019s gains are being booked with an eye to buffing up returns for February. However, while this rally has been in effect for two weeks now, it doesn\u2019t really show much sign of stopping, especially since we are hitting a strong historical period for stocks. So long as everyone keeps looking for a reason for the next selloff, the default direction for the market is upwards.</p> <p>The performance of crude oil remains the most important element in this market, and with both Brent and WTI holding up well today there is every reason to expect more upside.

More speculatively, there may even be some positives for the world economy \u2013 notably the additional pressure for more growth-friendly policies in the remainder of the EU.</p> <p> In our view... while Brexit would have global ramifications, these should not be overstated, nor need they all be negative. For a start, we doubt the disruption to the UK economy would be as large as many fear. In particular, the uncertainties about the UK\u2019s relations with the rest of Europe could be reduced during the period of negotiations before exit actually takes place. And unlike some potential euro departures, the UK already has its own currency and would be opting to leave rather than being pushed out. The UK would surely also swiftly reassert its commitment to international organisations like NATO and to cooperation with other Western powers in areas of common geopolitical interests.</p> <p>What\u2019s more, even if the UK economy does initially struggle following Brexit, it only accounts for around 4% of world GDP. Indeed, some of the feared costs to the UK \u2013 such as the relocation of international companies to the Continent \u2013 would not have any net impact on the global economy...</p> <p>[And] it is surely inconsistent to argue \u2013 as some do \u2013 that Brexit would both be a disaster for the UK and encourage other member states to quit the EU as well. It is even possible \u2013 though perhaps only wishful thinking at this stage \u2013 that Brexit would be the catalyst for much-needed structural reform in the remainder of the EU, as well as a shift away from austerity. In this (admittedly rosy) scenario, Brexit might yet prove to be a long-term positive both for the UK and for the world economy. </p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-56d45c17e4b0d38537b1fc9b\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-02-29T14:59:00.513Z\">2.59pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Meanwhile there are more signs of weakness in the US economy, with the Chicago purchasing managers index coming in lower than expected.</p> <p>The index fell from 55.6 in January to 47.6 in February, compared to forecasts of a figure of 53.

                "bodyText":"Despite continuing worries about the global economy, as well as disappointment that there were no new stimulus measures announced by G20 finance ministers following their meeting in Shanghai, shares held up pretty well on the last day of the month. A rise in crude prices after comments from Saudi Arabia about wanting to limit volatilty helped support markets, as did news that China was acting to try and boost bank lending and reduce borrowing costs. So the final scores in Europe showed: The FTSE 100 finished 1.08 points or 0.02% higher at 6097.09, up 0.22% on the month Germany\u2019s Dax dipped 0.19% to 9495.40 France\u2019s Cac closed up 0.9% at 4353.55 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB added 0.8% to 17,623.07 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended up 1.34% at 8461.4 In Greece, the Athens market rose 1.89% to 516.71 On Wall Street the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 49 points or 0.3%. On that note it\u2019s time to close for the evening. Thanks for all your comments and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow for, among other things, the February manufacturing PMIs and Barclays results. As European markets close in mixed fashion, Tony Cross, market analyst at Trustnet Direct, said: London\u2019s FTSE-100 is finishing up the day\u2019s session broadly flat \u2013 we\u2019re still below where we started the year, but sentiment does appear to be on the up. There was disappointment that we didn\u2019t see more clarity out of the G20 meeting at the weekend, so it\u2019s arguably quite surprising that we haven\u2019t seen additional downside pressures as a result. ... Where March takes the market remains to be seen \u2013 the tide does appear to have turned with regard to London\u2019s FTSE-100 now being well beyond bear market territory and critically oil prices appear to be nudging higher, too. That said, the support we\u2019re seeing for gold does suggest that there\u2019s still a lack of confidence when it comes to the medium term view. An unexpected drop in US home sales adds to the weak data already seen. Reuters reports: Contracts to buy previously owned U.S. homes fell to their lowest level in a year in January, likely weighed down by harsh weather and a shortage of properties for sale, a report showed on Monday. The National Association of Realtors said its pending home sales index declined 2.5 percent to 106.0, the lowest level since January of last year. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast contracts rising 0.5 percent last month. Pending home contracts become sales after a month or two, and January\u2019s unexpected drop suggested home resales will likely weaken after rising only 0.4 percent last month. Contracts were up 1.4 percent from a year ago. The rally in stock markets could continue despite today\u2019s uncertain performance, says Chris Beauchamp at IG: February is going out on a dull note, with markets around the globe ending the month in mixed form. Europe and the UK are broadly lower, with an absence of heavyweight economic and corporate news (after all, who wants to publish data on a leap day?) adding to the general lack of direction. The real fireworks come later in the week, with China data galore and then US non-farms on Friday. As a result, some of the month\u2019s gains are being booked with an eye to buffing up returns for February. However, while this rally has been in effect for two weeks now, it doesn\u2019t really show much sign of stopping, especially since we are hitting a strong historical period for stocks. So long as everyone keeps looking for a reason for the next selloff, the default direction for the market is upwards. The performance of crude oil remains the most important element in this market, and with both Brent and WTI holding up well today there is every reason to expect more upside. Too many traders have been caught out trying to short the market over the past week or so, with little sign so far that the bounce has run its course. China will kick off the manufacturing PMI numbers for February tonight, and there could well be a big impact on market sentiment: More downbeat data from the US: The planned merger between the London Stock Exchange and Deutsche B\u00f6rse poses competition issues, according to France\u2019s economy minister Emmanuel Macron. The deal would hit smaller exchanges such as Euronext Paris. Macron told reporters (quotes courtesy Reuters): We will assess the consequences in strategic terms for Paris\u2019 financial centre. He also raised doubts about the impact of any British exit from Europe on the deal: I think we should assess the possible consequences of a Brexit on such a merger. The G20 was right to list a UK exit from the European Union as a potential risk to the global economy in its statement following last week\u2019s meeting of finance ministers in Shanghai, says Capital Economics. But the research group\u2019s chief global economist Julian Jessop said: However, the negative impacts of \u2018Brexit\u2019 are likely to be smaller than many fear, including the short-term costs to the UK itself. More speculatively, there may even be some positives for the world economy \u2013 notably the additional pressure for more growth-friendly policies in the remainder of the EU. In our view... while Brexit would have global ramifications, these should not be overstated, nor need they all be negative. For a start, we doubt the disruption to the UK economy would be as large as many fear. In particular, the uncertainties about the UK\u2019s relations with the rest of Europe could be reduced during the period of negotiations before exit actually takes place. And unlike some potential euro departures, the UK already has its own currency and would be opting to leave rather than being pushed out. The UK would surely also swiftly reassert its commitment to international organisations like NATO and to cooperation with other Western powers in areas of common geopolitical interests. What\u2019s more, even if the UK economy does initially struggle following Brexit, it only accounts for around 4% of world GDP. Indeed, some of the feared costs to the UK \u2013 such as the relocation of international companies to the Continent \u2013 would not have any net impact on the global economy... [And] it is surely inconsistent to argue \u2013 as some do \u2013 that Brexit would both be a disaster for the UK and encourage other member states to quit the EU as well. It is even possible \u2013 though perhaps only wishful thinking at this stage \u2013 that Brexit would be the catalyst for much-needed structural reform in the remainder of the EU, as well as a shift away from austerity. In this (admittedly rosy) scenario, Brexit might yet prove to be a long-term positive both for the UK and for the world economy. Meanwhile there are more signs of weakness in the US economy, with the Chicago purchasing managers index coming in lower than expected. The index fell from 55.6 in January to 47.6 in February, compared to forecasts of a figure of 53. The PMIs for the US as a whole are due on Tuesday (along with the data for Europe and the UK among others). US markets are marginally higher in early trading, helped by a rise in the oil price. Brent crude is currently up 1.9% at $35.78 a barrel on hopes that oil producers could act to stem the slide in prices. That was helped by Saudi Arabia saying in a statement that it \u201cseeks to achieve stability in the oil markets and will always remain in contact with all main producers in an attempt to limit volatility and it welcomes any co-operative action.\u201d Saudia Arabia and Russia agreed a proposal earlier this month to freeze output at January levels, but Iran is keen to increase production now sanctions against the country have been lifted and it has renewed access to export markets. Iran said on Monday it had increased exports sharply over the past month. So despite continuing worries about the global economy, notably China, and no new stimulus measures agreed by G20 finance ministers over the weekend, US markets have made a vaguely positive start, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average currently up 18 points or 0.1%. Directors at Royal Bank of Scotland must be hoping the shares have reached their bottom. Chief executive Ross McEwan and finance director Ewen Stevenson have both spent nearly \u00a3450,000 or 223p a share on buying 200,000 shares, while chairman Howard Davis has snapped up 40,000 at 222p each. So far their faith is not reaping much reward. RBS shares are currently down 0.6p at 226p. With the eurozone falling back into deflation, the odds on the European Central Bank acting at its meeting next week are growing. Time for a quick recap. Britain has been warned that the pound could slide to parity with the euro if the public votes to leave the EU. Analysts at UBS predicted that sterling would lose around 20% of its value after Brexit, but would strengthen if the Remain side win. They warned that the pound has also been hurt by the EU referendum, pushing it down to 78p to the \u20ac1. In our view, the largest part of the weakness in sterling since November can be attributed to increased concern over the possibility of exit from the EU. ... We think that the result of the referendum will be one of the UK to remain in the EU, thus our forecast is that sterling will eventually strengthen back to 73p. However, we expect some further weakness of sterling between now and the vote on 23 June. And if Britain chooses to Leave the EU, the pound would slide to parity against the euro, UBS reckons. Here\u2019s the key forecast: In other news.... China has eased monetary policy, as Beijing tries to protect its economy from a hard landing. The People\u2019s Bank of China cut the Reserve Requirement Ratio on its banks by 50 basis points (0.5 percentage points), to boost liquidity and credit availability. Economists say more will be needed, though, to cushion the economy. The former governor of the Bank of England has claimed that the eurozone is doomed to failure. In a new book, Lord Mervyn King warned that the public will revolt against mass unemployment and perpetual austerity, if policymakers try to impose closer political union to tackle its problems. He says: Monetary union has created a conflict between a centralised elite on the one hand, and the forces of democracy at the national level on the other. King also argued that Greece needs major debt relief, and a cheaper currency, to end its long economic woes. Campaigners have welcomed the move, arguing that Athens creditors must swallow reality Investors are expecting more stimulus measures from the European Central Bank, after the euro ares slipped back into deflation. Prices fell by 0.2% annually this month, the first negative move since last September. Back in the UK, Amazon has sent shivers through the supermarket sector through a new deal with Morrisons. Under the tie-up, the web giant will sell hundreds of Morrison\u2019s food products to its Amazon Prime customers. This is a fillip for Morrisons, helping the struggling group to sell more items across the UK. Its shares are up 4% so far today. But it\u2019s a blow to Ocado; shares in the online supermarket chain have slumped by 9% as the City sees Amazon eating its market share. And Tesco is also being hit - its shares have lost 2.6% today. John Ibbotson of the retail consultants, Retail Vision, says Amazon could be a serious threat to the major markets: It\u2019s now game on for the rest of the Big Four, who suddenly don\u2019t look so big after all. Tesco could soon be about to find out what it\u2019s like to be David rather than Goliath.\u201dThe problem for the Big Four is that if you pay \u00a379 a year for Amazon Prime, you get the delivery free. Amazon seems content to deliver at a loss indefinitely. Gerard Lyons, chief economic advisor to London mayor (and Brexit campaigner) Boris Johnson, is tweeting about the Chinese RRR cut too. He believes it should help the economy, but also warns it could intensify talk of a currency war (the yuan hit a three-week low when the news was announced) Philip Uglow, chief economist at MNI Indicators, suggests China was right to cut the reserve requirements on its banks today, given its weakening economy. He says: \u201cGiven the continued slowdown in the Chinese economy, it was not too surprising to see the central bank step in once again and loosen policy. The reserve requirement still remains at a relatively high level and there is plenty of room for more easing if needed. Our own survey data showed a significant weakening in February, with the MNI China Business Sentiment Indicator dipping below the all-important 50 mark. The Westpac MNI China Consumer Sentiment Indicator also turned lower in February, clouding the outlook for spending over the coming months.\u201d Britain\u2019s smaller City banks and investment companies are being spared new European rules on bonuses, designed to avoid excessive risk-taking. The UK\u2019s financial regulators have just announced that the rules, which restrict bonuses to 100% of base salary, will only be imposed on big banks and financial firms who are \u201csystemically important\u201d. In a statement, the Bank of England argues that a \u2018blanket ban\u2019 on bonuses would be counter-productive, by pushing up basic pay. Since the introduction of the bonus cap, a number of firms have markedly increased fixed pay as a percentage of total pay, whilst total pay remained stable during the same period. The PRA and FCA believe that the shift to fixed remuneration makes it more difficult for firms to adjust variable remuneration to reflect their financial health, and limits deferral arrangements that put remuneration at risk should financial or conduct risks subsequently come to light. City AM has a good early take: Smaller UK banks and investment firms will not have to abide by EU bonus cap rules \u2013 FCA and PRA And Juliet Samuel of the Wall Street Journal tweets: Money is continuing to pour into Eurozone government debt this morning. This is driving down the interest rate, or yield, on safe-haven bonds. German 10-year bunds have hit a yield of just 0.12%, a 10-month low, meaning investors are accepting virtually no return on their money. It\u2019s another sign of pessimism in the markets, with investors primarily worried about keeping their money safe rather than growing it. Debt campaigners have welcomed Mervyn King\u2019s warning that a \u201csignificant proportion\u201d of Greece\u2019s debts must be written off. But Tim Jones, economist at the Jubilee Debt Campaign, also warns that the current proposals for debt relief fall short: \u201cLord King\u2019s comments are yet another acknowledgment that Greece needs substantial debt cancellation, both for its own recovery, and the wider European economy. Yet even if implemented, the current discussions on debt relief for Greece would not reduce payments for at least 15 years, and would leave them 10 times higher than Germany was paying after it had substantial debt cancellation in 1953.\u201d It takes more than a global market rout to alarm Warren Buffett. The billionaire US investor is sounding remarkably relaxed this morning, as he appears on CNBC. Buffett has revealed that his Berkshire Hathaway fund has been buying shares in 2016, despite the heavy falls on some markets. According to the 85-year old, \u201cnot much\u201d happened in the markets recently. He\u2019s also expecting the \u201cpositive effects of low oil prices\u201d to help the world economy in the months ahead. \u201cNot much\u201d is an interesting way of summing up the recent market moves. So far this year, the Nasdaq has lost 7.8% of its value while the Dow Jones Industrial average is off 5%. Across the globe, the German DAX has lost 12% and Japan\u2019s Nikkei has shed almost 16%. But Buffett made his name, and his fortune, by buying and holding stocks, so he knows what he\u2019s doing..... Today\u2019s surprise cut in China\u2019s Reserve Requirement Ratio will help stabilise the Chinese financial system, says Duncan Innes-Ker of the Economist Intelligence Unit. But it isn\u2019t enough on its own, he adds: \u201cThe latest cut in the RRR shows the central bank straining to maintain loose monetary conditions in a difficult economic climate. The move will partly offset the effects of capital outflows from China and the provisioning requirements that are forcing banks to lock up more funds as non-performing loans climb. However, the surge in loans in January highlighted concerns that bank lending may be spiralling out of control. Ultimately, China\u2019s economy cannot grow on credit alone. It needs further reforms to unlock productivity growth.\u201d Nordea analyst Aurelija Augulyte reckons China has the capacity to do more, given it still holds over $3trn of foreign exchange reserves: Today\u2019s in deflation figures also show that the ECB\u2019s existing stimulus programme hasn\u2019t actually worked yet. The ECB is buying \u20ac60bn of assets each month, widening its balance sheet, but having little obvious impact on the consumer prices index (CPI) The eurozone\u2019s lurch back into deflation means Mario Draghi is certain to announce new measures to stimulate the European economy in two week\u2019s time. So argues Teunis Brosens of ING, who writes: The weakening of core inflation shows the real and present danger that cheap oil will cause low inflation to become ingrained in Eurozone price and wage dynamics. This is especially bad for debt-laden households, businesses and governments in Southern Europe, which will have little scope to \u201cinflate away\u201d their debt burden by increasing nominal wages. Today\u2019s weak core inflation gives doves the upper hand at next week\u2019s ECB-meeting and therefore pretty much seals the deal on additional monetary easing. In another alarming sign, the eurozone has slumped back into deflation for the first time in five months. Prices across the single currency region fell by 0.2% in February, according to data just released by Eurostat. That\u2019s worse than expected, and is the first negative inflation reading since September. Energy prices were the main factor, but price pressures in other areas of the economy were also weak. Core inflation, which strips out volatile elements such as food and fuel, dropped to just 0.7% from 1% in January. It raises the pressure on the European Central Bank to ease monetary policy again at its March meeting. The Chinese central bank says it cut the RRR rate, to guarantee \u201cample liquidity\u201d in the financial sector, and to encourage \u201cappropriate growth\u201d in the credit market. The 50bp cut lowers the Reserve Requirement Ratio to 17%, meaning banks need to hold fewer assets in reserve and can offer cheaper credit. A lower RRR will give Chinese banks the leeway to lower borrowing costs, and to make more money available to domestic companies and borrowers. Breaking news from China! The People\u2019s Bank of China has just eased monetary policy, by cutting the RRR - or Reserve Rate Requirement. Swiss bank UBS has just piled into the Brexit debate, saying there is a 40% chance that Britain will vote to leave the EU in June. In a new report, UBS predicts that sterling would be hit hard if Britain left the EU. It estimates that the pound would hit parity with the euro, which would help UK exporters but make trips to the continent much pricier. Currently, sterling is trading around \u20ac1.27, meaning one euro is worth roughly 78p. UBS reckons it will weaken to around 84p by June, and could then either sharply recover, or weaken, depending on the result. That\u2019s an interesting call from UBS. Other analysts have predicted that the euro would also be hit by Brexit - as it would raise new fears over the future of the eurozone. Here\u2019s a flavour of UBS\u2019s report: A date for referendum is set and the pound is getting pounded The United Kingdom reached an agreement with the European Union and the UK announced that the referendum vote will take place on 23 June 2016 (see \u201cBrexit: An ever closer referendum\u201d). We map out where the pound could go in the event of a \u201cBrexit\u201d, how much of a rebound is likely with a vote to \u201cRemain\u201d, and the potential for further currency weakness between now and June. What happens to EUR/GBP if the UK votes to stay in the European Union? We think that EUR/GBP should revert to the 0.73 level, near which it spent most of last year. In our view, the largest part of the weakness in sterling since November can be attributed to increased concern over the possibility of exit from the EU. What happens to EUR/GBP if the UK votes to leave (\u201cBrexit\u201d)? We estimate the exchange rate level that would accommodate a sharp correction in the UK\u2019s current account deficit and find that EUR/GBP could go to parity. What probabilities do we assign to each outcome? We assign a 60% probability to the UK staying in the EU and up to 40% probability of a vote to leave, as we have argued previously based on published opinion polls. Our baseline forecast is 0.73 for the end of 2016 We think that the result of the referendum will be one of the UK to remain in the EU, thus our forecast is that sterling will eventually strengthen back to 0.73. However, we expect some further weakness of sterling between now and the vote on 23 June. But a vote to leave would push EUR/GBP to 1.00 The price action so far makes it clear that sterling would weaken in the event of an exit vote. We think that the market would re-price to parity \u2013 and to the extent that it could accommodate a shift in the current account by 2.7% of GDP. Breaking: UK mortgage approvals have hit their highest level in two years. A total of 74,600 new home loans were approved last month, implying that the British housing market remains pretty robust. Here\u2019s a jaw-dropping fact -- China is planning to lay off almost two million workers from its coal and steel industry. It\u2019s part of Beijing\u2019s attempts to cut capacity in the sector in response to slowing demand, and to rebalance the wider economy towards consumption. Reuters has the details: Yin Weimin, the minister for human resources and social security, told a news conference on Monday that 1.3 million workers in the coal sector could lose their jobs, plus 500,000 from the steel sector. China\u2019s coal and steel sectors employ about 12 million workers, according to data published by the National Bureau of Statistics. \u201cThis involves the resettlement of a total of 1.8 million workers. This task will be very difficult, but we are still very confident,\u201d Yin said.... European stock markets have opened lower, amid disappointment that the world\u2019s top finance ministers didn\u2019t announce any concrete measures at their meeting last week. In London, the FTSE 100 has shed 38 points, or 0.6%, to 6057 points. The French and German markets are down around 0.9%, following moderate losses in Asia overnight which clocked 1% off Japan\u2019s Nikkei. Tony Cross, market analyst at Trustnet Direct, sums up the mood: Markets are kicking off the last trading day of February on a rather downbeat note with the weekend\u2019s G20 meeting of finance ministers in Shanghai almost appearing to have muddied the waters, rather than provided any clarity. Policymakers appear to be in agreement that they need to act in a coordinated manner, but given the reactions we\u2019ve seen so far, that certainly doesn\u2019t appear to be the case. The G20 meeting ended with a communique which warned that the global recovery was \u201cuneven\u201d and failing to deliver \u201cstrong, sustainable and balanced growth\u201d. But in terms of action, it only committed to \u201cfurther enhancing the structural reform agenda\u201d They also warned against Britain leaving the European Union. But as the Guardian reported yesterday, that was added on the insistence of the UK government..... Mervyn King also warns that Greece needs debt relief and a cheaper currency: As he puts it: It is evident, as it has been for a very long while, that the only way forward for Greece is to default on (or be forgiven) a substantial proportion of its debt burden and to devalue its currency so that exports and the substitution of domestic products for imports can compensate for the depressing effects of the fiscal contraction imposed to date. Athens was promised some debt relief as part of its third bailout, agreed last summer. But those talks are on ice right now, as negotiations with its lenders over implementation of the package continue to grind slowly onwards. The Chinese stock market has closed at its lowest level in a month, as fears over the global economy dogged trading floors again. At one stage, the Shanghai Composite was heading for a 15-month low, before finishing down 2.8%. Ray Attrill of National Australia Bank blamed the lack of firm action at last weekend\u2019s G20 meeting: He told Bloomberg: [Finance ministers delivered an]....admission of downside growth risks but no tangible commitments to fiscal policy action in particular to bolster growth in the short term\u201d As a devoted Aston Villa fan, Lord Mervyn King must have relegation on the brain right now. In his new book, the BoE governor suggests that the eurozone missed a trick in 2012 by now allowing struggling eurozone members to be \u201ctemporarily\u201d shunted down to a lower tier. Then they could have won promotion again once they had established closer convergence with their stronger neighbours. Germany\u2019s Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble apparently proposed this to Greece last summer -- but the idea was rejected. The big fear (as many football fans can attest), is that once you\u2019re relegated, there\u2019s no guarantee of getting back. And \u2018relegation\u2019 could also encourage traders to force weaker members out of the euro. Duncan Weldon, head of research at Resolution Group, agrees: Ambrose Evans-Pritchard, the Telegraph\u2019s international business editor, reckons King\u2019s intervention is very significant. Otmar Issing was Germany\u2019s representative on the European Central Bank\u2019s governing council, and thus an influential voice . Lord King also suggests that Germany, rather than Greece, might pull the trigger on the eurozone. He writes: Germany faces a terrible choice. Should it support the weaker brethren in the euro area at great and unending cost to its taxpayers, or should it call a halt to the project of monetary union across the whole of Europe? The attempt to find a middle course is not working. One day, German voters may rebel against the losses imposed on them by the need to support their weaker brethren, and undoubtedly the easiest way to divide the euro area would be for Germany itself to exit. Mervyn King, the former governor of the Bank of England, has fired a fierce broadside at the eurozone - claiming the single currency block may be doomed. In a new book, the man who steered Britain\u2019s central bank through (and into) the financial crisis warned that the tensions within eurozone - and the huge debts piled up by struggling members such as Greece - can never be fully resolved. Crucially, King also argues that any moves to harden up the single currency could also backfire. Closer political union (which would make it easier to forgive Greece\u2019s debts) will actually inflame popular anger against the eurozone project. As he puts it: \u201cMonetary union has created a conflict between a centralised elite on the one hand, and the forces of democracy at the national level on the other. This is extraordinarily dangerous.\u201d Breaking up the 18-member strong union may be the only way to allow Europe\u2019s struggling Southern states to regain competitiveness. Here\u2019s more from King, via the Daily Telegraph (who have the serialisation rights): The more likely cause of a break- up of the euro area is that voters in the south will tire of the grinding and relentless burden of mass unemployment and the emigration of talented young people. The counter-argument \u2013 that exit from the euro area would lead to chaos, falls in living standards and continuing uncertainty about the survival of the currency union \u2013 has real weight. If the members of the euro decide to hang together, the burden of servicing external debts may become too great to remain consistent with political stability. But if the alternative is crushing austerity, continuing mass unemployment, and no end in sight to the burden of debt, then leaving the euro area may be the only way to plot a route back to economic growth and full employment. The long-term benefits outweigh the short-term costs. Outsiders cannot make that choice, but they can encourage Germany, and the rest of the euro area, to face up to it. If the members of the euro decide to hang together, the burden of servicing external debts may become too great to remain consistent with political stability. As John Maynard Keynes wrote in 1922, \u201cIt is foolish\u2026 to suppose that any means exist by which one modern nation can exact from another an annual tribute continuing over many years.\u201d Here\u2019s the full piece: Daily Telegraph: Lord Mervyn King: \u2018Forgive them their debts\u2019 is not the answer Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. It may be February 29th, but investors aren\u2019t exactly leaping for joy this morning. Asian markets are falling, and European bourses are likely to follow suit. Several issues dominate the trading floors right now, including: The state of the global economy, with China\u2019s weaknesses threatening a wider slowdown. Angst over the US elections. Donald Trump\u2019s success at the Republican caucuses is alarming many observers, while Wall Street fears that Bernie Sanders\u2019 has put inequality firmly in the spotlight. The eurozone: The refugee crisis is piling new stress on the region, with inflation still worryingly weak The Brexit question, with polls suggesting the EU referendum on June 23 could be close. Worries about negative interest rates, and fears that central bankers are running out of ammo. But despite these fears, finance ministers didn\u2019t agree any new measures at their G20 meeting last weekend. And for some investors, that\u2019s a decent reason to keep out of the markets...or cut their holdings. Coming up this morning... There\u2019s not much on the agenda, but we do get fresh eurozone inflation data at 10am GMT. That is expected to show a further weakening in price pressures, with the consumer prices index tipped to drop to 0% from 0.3% in January. And at 9.30, the latest UK consumer credit and mortgage lending figure are out.",
