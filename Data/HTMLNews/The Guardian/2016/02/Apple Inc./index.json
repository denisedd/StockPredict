Crude prices were on the slide once more, given there was no sign of any deal between Opec and the likes of Russia to cut production and stem the supply glut. On top of that, sentiment was hit by major losses at BP and a 48% drop in profits at Exxon Mobil.</p> <p>So Brent crude fell as much as 5% before recovering some ground - and helping markets off their worst levels at the same time. It is currently down 2.8% at $33.26 a barrel. West Texas, which slipped below $30 at one point, is now down 1% at $30.6 a barrel.</p> <p>Adding to the downbeat mood came reports that China was imposing new controls to help control outflows of capital from the country, in particular a cap on people buying insurance from overseas.</p> <p>So despite the marginal recovery, the final scores showed some hefty falls:</p> <ul> <li><strong>The FTSE 100 fell 138.09 points or 2.2% to 5922.01</strong></li> <li><strong>Germany\u2019s Dax dropped 1.8% to 9581.04</strong></li> <li><strong>France\u2019s Cac closed down 2.47% at 4283.99</strong></li> <li><strong>Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB fell 3.05% to 17,922.45</strong></li> <li><strong>Spain\u2019s Ibex ended down 2.96% at 8528.7</strong></li> <li><strong>In Greece, the Athens market slipped 0.84% to 552.5</strong></li> </ul> <p>On Wall Street the Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 271 points or 1.65%.</p> <p><em>On that gloomy note, it\u2019s time to close for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow for a busy day of service sector surveys around the globe.</em></p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-56b0d47de4b048ec83a765e9\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-02-02T16:16:11.050Z\">4.16pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>As European markets head towards the close nursing heavy losses again Chris Beauchamp, senior market analyst at IG, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The end of January, when markets raced higher, seems such a long time ago. Major indices are rapidly shedding the gains they made in the second half of January, as a cocktail of worries returns. The first of these is the oil price, which has rediscovered its old habit of diving like a stone, helped in no small part by the absence of any rumours about another OPEC meeting.</p> <p>The session started with oil firms in the red, as BP\u2019s results sent the shares into a tail spin, but the company has been joined at the bottom of the index by miners and insurers. The former are down as economic growth concerns take centre stage, with this concern not helped by warnings from Fed policymakers, while the latter are in retreat thanks to China, which appears to be coming up with new and creative ways to try to stem capital flight. The reaction is probably overdone where the likes of Prudential are concerned, but it is hard to remain positive when the tentative rally of the past two weeks is slipping from your grasp.</p> <p>Adding to concerns was ExxonMobil, which is down 3% as the earnings beat fades amidst the stark reality of a remarkable slump in profits. As crude prices slide once more, thanks to markets suddenly waking up and remembering the massive oversupply story, it looks like this sector will be the trailblazer for any renewed slump in stock markets.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-56b0cd3ee4b054341b6d0f04\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-02-02T15:41:42.361Z\">3.41pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Back in the UK, and one of the biggest fallers apart from commodity companies is Prudential.</strong></p> <p>The insurance group is down nearly 8% on reports that China might be taking steps to stem outflows of capital. In particular Bloomberg has said the country could impose restrictions on people buying insurance products abroad, with a $5,000 cap per transaction to be imposed from 4 February. Analyst David Morrison at Spread Co said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Amid today\u2019s unsettling stock market action, Prudential stands out as one of the big losers. But this has nothing to do with the announcement that Anne Richards will be joining the Pru from Aberdeen Asset Management later this year.</p> <p>Instead it comes on the back of China\u2019s currency regulator imposing restrictions on its citizens buying overseas insurance products. This isn\u2019t just bad news for the Pru or the insurance sector in general. It raises fears that the Chinese authorities may take further action to limit capital controls. This is a particular worry as we head towards the extended Chinese New Year holiday break.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-02-02T15:42:08.581Z\">at 3.42pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-56b0c8ade4b048ec83a765b2\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-02-02T15:19:25.110Z\">3.19pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Here are the Dow movers:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8933fcf4c624135f794f9ec398e4a6b7d066294b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8933fcf4c624135f794f9ec398e4a6b7d066294b/0_0_1133_919/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Dow under pressure\" width=\"1000\" height=\"811\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dow under pressure</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-56b0c6e6e4b048ec83a765ab\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-02-02T15:12:24.955Z\">3.12pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>A sliding crude price and the lack of any major data to give direction have combined to send markets lower, </strong>says financial analyst Connor Campbell of Spreadex:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Things turned ugly this afternoon, with a woeful performance from Brent Crude and a particularly weak open from the US indices seeing the markets double down on the day\u2019s losses.</p> <p>Now down around 4.5% and threatening to fall below $32 per barrel, the resumption of Brent Crude\u2019s decline has been the main catalyst for the day\u2019s dismal trading. And as ever, when the commodities begin to fall the FTSE loses its way in pretty dramatic fashion, the UK index dropping a whopping 150 points as the day went on. The main casualty was BP; plunging by nearly 10% the oil has lost wave upon wave of investors this Tuesday following the revelation of its worst annual losses for 20 years.</p> <p>Whilst the DAX was prevented from posting the kind of absurd losses it is known for thanks to a record low German unemployment rate figure, the CAC was right up there with its UK peer this afternoon, falling around 2.6% as the day wore on. Over in the US, meanwhile, the Dow Jones quickly sank by 250-ish points after the bell rang on Wall Street, exactly what the markets didn\u2019t need following such an awful morning in Europe.</p> <p>The lack of truly significant data likely exacerbated today\u2019s losses, investors left with little other option but to focus on the same fears that have caused the markets to start 2016 in such dire fashion. Tomorrow, then, maybe slightly better, with a cavalcade of services figures around the globe set to distract the markets (however briefly or successfully is unclear) from their current malaise.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-56b0bfcce4b048ec83a7658e\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-02-02T14:45:44.300Z\">2.45pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Wall Street drops nearly 250 points, with US crude below $30</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The Alphabet success comes as the overall market has moved sharply lower.</p> <p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 241 points or 1.46%, as Wall Street follows other markets lower.

                "bodyText":"The optimism seen at the end of last week seems to have disappeared as quickly as it came. Crude prices were on the slide once more, given there was no sign of any deal between Opec and the likes of Russia to cut production and stem the supply glut. On top of that, sentiment was hit by major losses at BP and a 48% drop in profits at Exxon Mobil. So Brent crude fell as much as 5% before recovering some ground - and helping markets off their worst levels at the same time. It is currently down 2.8% at $33.26 a barrel. West Texas, which slipped below $30 at one point, is now down 1% at $30.6 a barrel. Adding to the downbeat mood came reports that China was imposing new controls to help control outflows of capital from the country, in particular a cap on people buying insurance from overseas. So despite the marginal recovery, the final scores showed some hefty falls: The FTSE 100 fell 138.09 points or 2.2% to 5922.01 Germany\u2019s Dax dropped 1.8% to 9581.04 France\u2019s Cac closed down 2.47% at 4283.99 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB fell 3.05% to 17,922.45 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended down 2.96% at 8528.7 In Greece, the Athens market slipped 0.84% to 552.5 On Wall Street the Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 271 points or 1.65%. On that gloomy note, it\u2019s time to close for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow for a busy day of service sector surveys around the globe. As European markets head towards the close nursing heavy losses again Chris Beauchamp, senior market analyst at IG, said: The end of January, when markets raced higher, seems such a long time ago. Major indices are rapidly shedding the gains they made in the second half of January, as a cocktail of worries returns. The first of these is the oil price, which has rediscovered its old habit of diving like a stone, helped in no small part by the absence of any rumours about another OPEC meeting. The session started with oil firms in the red, as BP\u2019s results sent the shares into a tail spin, but the company has been joined at the bottom of the index by miners and insurers. The former are down as economic growth concerns take centre stage, with this concern not helped by warnings from Fed policymakers, while the latter are in retreat thanks to China, which appears to be coming up with new and creative ways to try to stem capital flight. The reaction is probably overdone where the likes of Prudential are concerned, but it is hard to remain positive when the tentative rally of the past two weeks is slipping from your grasp. Adding to concerns was ExxonMobil, which is down 3% as the earnings beat fades amidst the stark reality of a remarkable slump in profits. As crude prices slide once more, thanks to markets suddenly waking up and remembering the massive oversupply story, it looks like this sector will be the trailblazer for any renewed slump in stock markets. Back in the UK, and one of the biggest fallers apart from commodity companies is Prudential. The insurance group is down nearly 8% on reports that China might be taking steps to stem outflows of capital. In particular Bloomberg has said the country could impose restrictions on people buying insurance products abroad, with a $5,000 cap per transaction to be imposed from 4 February. Analyst David Morrison at Spread Co said: Amid today\u2019s unsettling stock market action, Prudential stands out as one of the big losers. But this has nothing to do with the announcement that Anne Richards will be joining the Pru from Aberdeen Asset Management later this year. Instead it comes on the back of China\u2019s currency regulator imposing restrictions on its citizens buying overseas insurance products. This isn\u2019t just bad news for the Pru or the insurance sector in general. It raises fears that the Chinese authorities may take further action to limit capital controls. This is a particular worry as we head towards the extended Chinese New Year holiday break. Here are the Dow movers: A sliding crude price and the lack of any major data to give direction have combined to send markets lower, says financial analyst Connor Campbell of Spreadex: Things turned ugly this afternoon, with a woeful performance from Brent Crude and a particularly weak open from the US indices seeing the markets double down on the day\u2019s losses. Now down around 4.5% and threatening to fall below $32 per barrel, the resumption of Brent Crude\u2019s decline has been the main catalyst for the day\u2019s dismal trading. And as ever, when the commodities begin to fall the FTSE loses its way in pretty dramatic fashion, the UK index dropping a whopping 150 points as the day went on. The main casualty was BP; plunging by nearly 10% the oil has lost wave upon wave of investors this Tuesday following the revelation of its worst annual losses for 20 years. Whilst the DAX was prevented from posting the kind of absurd losses it is known for thanks to a record low German unemployment rate figure, the CAC was right up there with its UK peer this afternoon, falling around 2.6% as the day wore on. Over in the US, meanwhile, the Dow Jones quickly sank by 250-ish points after the bell rang on Wall Street, exactly what the markets didn\u2019t need following such an awful morning in Europe. The lack of truly significant data likely exacerbated today\u2019s losses, investors left with little other option but to focus on the same fears that have caused the markets to start 2016 in such dire fashion. Tomorrow, then, maybe slightly better, with a cavalcade of services figures around the globe set to distract the markets (however briefly or successfully is unclear) from their current malaise. The Alphabet success comes as the overall market has moved sharply lower. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 241 points or 1.46%, as Wall Street follows other markets lower. Fears of a global slowdown in the wake of weak industrial data this week have unnerved investors once more, while oil continues to slide as hopes fade of a deal between Opec and other oil countries - Russia in particular - to cut production. Brent crude is down 5% at $32.5 while West Texas has slipped below $30 a barrel. Elsewhere the S&amp;P is down 1.4% while the falls on European markets are accelerating. The FTSE 100 is now down 154 points or 2.5% while Germany\u2019s Dax is down 1.35% and France\u2019s Cac has lost 2.1%. Alphabet shares have jumped more than 4% at the open, valuing it at around $545bn. In contrast Apple is down almost 1% to give it a market capitalisation of around $530bn. Wall Street has opened and Alphabet has indeed overtaken Apple to become the world\u2019s largest listed company. UK energy group British Gas has announced it will axe 500 jobs as part of a cost cutting programme by its parent company Centrica. It did not say where or when the cuts would be made, according to Reuters which quotes British Gas chief executive Mark Hodges as saying: British Gas is well positioned to grow but we must ensure that our costs allow us to be competitive for our customers. Back with big oil, and Exxon Mobil has unveiled a 48% drop in its fourth quarter profit to $2.78bn and said it would cut spending this year by a quarter. That follows news that BP has made its biggest ever loss and plans 7,000 job cuts. The sell-off in stock markets is continuing, with the FTSE 100 now down 116 points or 1.9%. BP, now down 8.4%, has contributed around 21 points to the fall. Oil and mining companies as a whole have knocked some 50 points off the index. In Europe Germany\u2019s Dax is down 1.3% and France\u2019s Cac is 2% lower. At the moment, the Dow Jones Industrial Average futures are showing a 128 point loss on the US index when Wall Street opens. Whether that has an impact on Google - sorry Alphabet - overtaking Apple as the world\u2019s most valuable listed company remains to be seen. Worried about China? Maybe you\u2019re not worried enough. Royal Bank of Scotland has issued an online research note today, explaining how China\u2019s economy could hit trouble. Senior Economist Marcus Wright fears that China\u2019s economy has slowed more quickly than official data shows, and is struggling to break its addiction to debt (which helped fuel growth in recent years) This means Beijing is struggling to rebalance the economy in the face of a credit boom, triggering recent market turbulence and fears of a disorderly yuan devaluation. Wright predicts that a \u201chard landing\u201d is a serious risk for China, with consequences for countries worldwide. He says: China\u2019s slowdown is already impacting the global economy through the channels of growth, trade, inflation, interest rate expectation and financial linkages. There is more to come on all these fronts. The full presentation is online here. RBS have helpfully tweeted some of the key charts: Our energy editor Terry Macalister has established that BP is actually planning to cut 7,000 more jobs, more than first thought, after reporting an an annual loss of $6.5bn this morning. Terry also reports that CEO Bob Dudley thinks investors are \u201coverreacting\u201d by sending its shares down by 9% so far today.... Over in Greece, the negotiations between Athens and its creditors over its bailout programme have taken a curious twist, as talks resume today. The EU side has apparently hinted that Greece might get an easier ride, if it does a better job processing the refugees arriving on its shores from the Middle East. The Greek newspaper Kathimerini explains: Greek authorities are scrambling to set up screening centers for migrants and refugees as soon as possible as German officials have made it clear to Athens that more efficient management of the refugee crisis could help along creditors\u2019 review of the country\u2019s third bailout, Kathimerini understands. According to sources, German Chancellor Angela Merkel has indicated to Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras that success in tackling the migration crisis could boost the country\u2019s prospects for progress with the review, which Athens hopes could ease the way for debt talks. Combined with a burgeoning debate about Greece\u2019s future in the passport-free Schengen area, the message from Berlin is said to have encouraged action by Greek officials. Blackmail? Bribery? Or an attempt to fix two problems in one go? Currently, some refugees trying to move west from Greece are stranded at the border with Macedonia, due to anti-austerity protests held by farmers. BP\u2019s share price continues to wilt as analysts digest today\u2019s slump in profits/record loss (depending what measure you pick). It is currently down 8.8%, which by my reckoning wipes \u00a35.8bn off its market capitalisation. BP boss Bob Dudley has also warned that other oil companies will follow his lead and slash jobs, in response to the slide in the crude price. ITV\u2019s Joel Hills has the details: The oil sector is churning out the rumours today, as the crude price drops. The latest one is that member of the OPEC cartel are still resisting an emergency meeting where a production cut could be hammered out. That\u2019s despite the pain being suffered across the oil-producing countries, with Saudi facing serious austerity, Nigeria seeking help from the World Bank, and Russia apparently considering privatising various state assets. BP is briefing journalists in London now, after reporting its biggest annual loss in at least 20 years. The oil giant is predicting a volatile 2016, and warning that the cost of the Deepwater Horizon spill disaster is still rising. The oil is continuing to weaken, mirroring the selloff in the equity markets. Brent crude is now off 3.7% or $1.20 at $32.97 per barrel, hit by persistent fears of economic slowdown and oversupply in the oil market. And the Russian rouble is falling in sympathy, as cheaper oil brings more trouble for struggling petro-exporters. Tim Condon, head of Asia research at ING, fears that the oil sector is locked in a vicious downward spiral with factories. Oil companies cut spending last year after crude prices fell sharply, which meant they ordered less from manufacturers. That hit factory growth, and also meant they needed less energy. That hit demand for oil, helping to push stockpiles up and prices down. Or as Condon put it to clients: \u201cManufacturing is (the) leading edge of a global growth slowdown.\u201d \u201cWe think the 50% crash in global oil prices in the second half of 2014 caused the manufacturing slump by crushing commodity producers\u2019 spending. However, we also think that in 2015 weaker manufacturing, especially in China, began to drive down oil prices. The negative feedback loop is causing severe strains.\u201d Mario Draghi and colleagues at the European Central Bank will be relieved that the eurozone jobless rate fell last month, as they ponder whether to take new stimulus measures next month. Alex Lydall, senior sales trader at Foenix Partners, says investors expect action in March. Traders and investors assumed from the latest ECB press conference that further cuts in the deposit rate and perhaps an extension and expansion of Quantitative Easing are potentially on the cards. Today\u2019s selloff has wiped out almost all the spike last Friday, after the Bank of Japan took the dramatic step of introducing negative interest rates. Central bank stimulus packages don\u2019t have the impact they used to, as investors worry that the global economy is heading remorselessly downwards. Brenda Kelly of London Capital Group explains: It would seem that central bank impact is really beginning to lose its charm and the days of buying the dip on the back of stimulus expectations is no longer the winning strategy it once was. We\u2019re back to the same old story today with materials and energy providing a drag on the FTSE as BP delivered what was frankly a terrible set of results \u2013 its worst loss in 20 years. Breaking: The Eurozone unemployment rate has hit its lowest level since September 2011. Eurostat is reporting that the region\u2019s jobless rate dipped in December to 10.4%, from 10.5%. Across the wider EU, the jobless rate remained at 9.0%. Although the fall is encouraging, it still leaves 21.944 million men and women out of work in the 28 members of the EU, including 16.750m in the euro area. There were, as usual, stark difference across Europe too. Among the Member States, the lowest unemployment rates in December 2015 were recorded in the Czech Republic and Germany (both 4.5%), Malta and the United Kingdom (both 5.1%, October data for the UK). The highest unemployment rates were observed in Greece (24.5% in October 2015) and Spain (20.8%). More gloom. Growth in Britain\u2019s building sector has hit a nine-month low, according to new figures from data firm Markit. Markit\u2019s UK construction PMI has fallen to 55.0 in January, from 57.8 in December. That suggests growth slowed to its lowest rate since April 2015. The survey found that:\uf0a7 UK construction sector experiences growth slowdown at the start of 2016 Job creation eases to its slowest for almost two-and-a-half years Construction firms report lowest business confidence since December 2014 Worries about global growth and weak, falling oil prices are back under the spotlight today, warns Arnaud Masset, market analyst at Swissquote Bank. And that\u2019s why the European markets are sliding again. The FTSE 100 is now down 85 points, and being dragged lower by oil companies, banks and miners: Investors are also gloomy after yesterday\u2019s factory data. It showed the US manufacturing sector was not as strong as hoped, while China continued to weaken. Kit Juckes of Societe Generale explains: Yesterday afternoon\u2019s US economic data was pretty consistently below expectations, reinforcing the clear signs that global manufacturing is down in the dumps. BP\u2019s poor results are also a reminder of the havoc playing out in the oil sector, as hopes of a deal between Russia and Saudi Arabia to cut production dwindle. FXTM Research Analyst Lukman Otunuga says: Tepid manufacturing data from China, the world\u2019s largest energy consumer, renewed fears that demand may be dwindling. These anxieties added to the rapidly fading expectations around OPEC cooperating with Russia to curb production, while ongoing concerns over the excessive oversupply of oil in the markets continued to haunt investors. BP\u2019s CEO, Bob Dudley, has warned that the oil price will remain volatile until the second half of 2016. Speaking on Bloomberg TV, he predicted spikes - up and down - in the next few months as Iran returns to the oil market. Just in: Germany\u2019s unemployment rate has hit a new record low of just 6.2%. Destatis, the stats body, reports that the German jobless total fell by 20,000 in January, compared to expectations of an 8,000 decline. Another difficult morning is unfolding on the European stock markets. In London, the FTSE 100 has shed 1.3%, or 82 points, to 5977. BP is partly to blame - it has knocked 17 points off the Footsie on it own, and also dragged rival Royal Dutch Shell down too (it reports results on Thursday). Mining shares are also down, with BHP Billiton off 4%. Across the channel, Germany\u2019s DAX is down 0.9% and the French CAC is down 1.3% BP\u2019s stonking loss has hit shares across the energy sector: Shares in BP have slumped at the start of trading, after the energy giant reported its worst loss in 20 years. BP shares fell 5.8%, or 21p, to 345p as investors reacted to the news that it lost $6.482bn in 2015, on a pre-tax basis, compared to a profit of \u00a33.780bn in 2014. That, Reuters reports, is the biggest loss in two decades. Oil companies like to report their results in \u201cunderlying replacement cost profit\u201d terms, to strip out the impact of the fluctuating oil price. But even then, BP\u2019s results are worse than expected. It reported a 91% drop in underlying profits in the last three months, to just $196m. It\u2019s bad news for workers - BP is planning to cut an extra 3,000 jobs in its downstream unit by the end of 2017, on top of 4,000 earlier cuts. After weeks of haggling, Sainsbury has finally secured the takeover of Home Retail - owner of catalogue shopping chain Argus. The two sides reached terms overnight of a \u00a31.3bn merger. This is Sainsbury CEO Mike Coupe\u2019s first big deal -- he\u2019s hoping to repel the march of Amazon, and rising pressure from discount grocers. Assuming shareholders back the deal, Sainsbury will soon be installing Argos outlets in its stores. My colleague Sean Farrell has the details of the deal: Britain\u2019s second-biggest supermarket has proposed paying Home Retail shareholders 55p in cash and 0.321 Sainsbury\u2019s shares for each of their shares, valuing Home Retail at \u00a31.1bn. Under the terms of the proposed deal, Home Retail shareholders would also get a further \u00a3200m from the sale of Homebase, Home retail\u2019s DIY and homewares business. Along with a 2.8p per share payment in lieu of a final dividend, the proposed offer values Home Retail at 161.3p a share or about \u00a31.3bn. Most Asian stock markets lost ground today, with Japan\u2019s Nikkei closing 0.64% lower. China bucked the trend, though, jumping over 2%, after the People\u2019s Bank of China pumped more money into the system. Marketwatch explains why: China\u2019s central bank injected 100 billion yuan ($15.2 billion) in short-term loans to money markets, in a move to stave off potential liquidity squeezes ahead of the weeklong Lunar New Year holiday that starts on February 7. This is the first leg of the bank\u2019s usual twice-a-week money-market operations. Overnight, Australia\u2019s central bank left interest rates unchanged at the record low of 2%. But it also warned it could cut soon if the recent financial market turbulence continues. Worries over the strength of the global economy has pushed the gold price up to its highest level since the start of November. Bullion hit $1,130 per ounce in early reading, as investors scurried for safe-havens in the face of recent weak economic data. Fears over China were also rife, after yesterday\u2019s data showed its factory sector shrinking at the fastest rate since 2012. Japan\u2019s move into negative interest rates on Friday has also caused jitters, as traders wonder whether further unconventional monetary policy will be deployed soon. And this uncertainty is making gold more attractive. Reuters explains: With rates close to zero, the \u201conly option is to move either towards zero or negative rates as the Japanese and selected European countries are already doing in a desperate attempt to force banks to lend\u201d, INTL FCStone analyst Edward Meir wrote to clients. \u201cWhatever the case, this should be constructive for gold.\u201d Good morning, and welcome to our rolling overage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Worries over the global economy continue to weigh on markets today, after yesterday\u2019s disappointing manufacturing surveys from China and the US. The main European markets are expected to dip, extending yesterday\u2019s selloff: On the data front, we find out at 10am whether Europe\u2019s jobs market improved in December. The main eurozone jobless rate is expected to remain at 10.5% , matching the four-year low reached in November. And at 9.30am, we also get the latest survey of the UK construction sector for January. Last week we learned that the building industry contracted in the last quarter of 2015, so analysts will be hoping for signs of recovery. In the City, oil giant BP and online supermarket Ocado are reporting financial results. As feared, BP has suffered from the slump in the oil price. It\u2019s also outlining significant job cuts. And supermarket chain Sainsbury has been hammering out the terms of a takeover for Home Retail, to get control of its Argos shops.",

                "bodyText":"Brothers Bill and Jim Mitchell shared a passion for homebrewed beer but, when they shared a recipe, the pair could never seem to get the same result. Although Jim\u2019s Angry Amber was his best beer, Bill could not replicate it even though their brewing systems were largely identical. It\u2019s a common problem for home brewers. Producing a consistent-tasting batch of beer depends on the fickle brewing process, where a subtle change involving the barley and hops can result in very different products. Bill, a former Microsoft executive, set out to apply science to the homebrewing process. \u201cWe said that the end goal is to build an every-person countertop craft beer machine that can brew just like the professional breweries do and give all the level of process control and repeatability to get a great tasting craft beer batch in your home,\u201d he said. The result, they claim, is the Pico, a machine with a passing resemblance to a microwave. It brews 5-litre batches of beers after the exact ingredients are fed via pods into the device much like coffee being loaded into a Nespresso machine. The 14kg machine works by loading water with PicoPaks of ingredients, and then brewed for about two hours. The beer recipes come from various breweries but the bitterness, thickness and alcohol volume can be adjusted at home. After the brewing process, the beer is transferred to a keg to ferment for about a week. The aim, says Seattle-based Mitchell, is to engage amateurs by brewing consistent beer each and every time by eliminating the frequent possibility of \u201cbad batches\u201d. \u201cYou don\u2019t know what went wrong, you can\u2019t track back. If you are at all scientific, it drives you nuts and usually for most people that is it. You just wasted eight hours, a fair amount of money. You thought you did everything right and you produce a bad batch. There are just so many ways that a batch could go bad.\u201d About 2,000 of the machines have been preordered and are expected to ship from April. The early bird price was $500 (\u00a3340) and this is expected to rise to $999 at retail. The PicoPaks are available from the company\u2019s website, among them pale ales, porter and a strong English bitter. Another aim is to make beers from different parts of the world available and customisable. \u201cIf you tasted Rogue Dead Guy Ale from one of the popular Oregon breweries, it is a great beer. It is pretty high alcohol at 8% and if you really enjoy that beer, you are going to have a hard time enjoying more than a couple of pints of it at a time unless you have a pretty big liver.

The growing interest in craft beers \u2013 Mitchell says there were 1m homebrewers in the US when they started their company PicoBrew in 2010 \u2013 has created a demand for niche beers from around the world but not necessarily any demand for the intricate system of sourcing and measuring hops and grains out, he says.

The tables were turned in the UK stock market today with recent winners suffering from profit-taking, while the miners were virtually the only stocks to keep their heads above water.</p> <p>The collapse in the oil price has been a big shock to the financial system and its effects are still being absorbed by international stock markets, in particular the implications for global demand. Financials have been really badly hit of late, and in a sign of how dire things have got, some European banks are trading lower than they did during the depths of the financial crisis.

London\u2019s FTSE-100 has posted a 2.7% sell-off, pushing the benchmark index squarely back into bear-market territory, but losses across mainland Europe have been even more pronounced. The fact that WTI crude tested territory below $30/barrel once again has done nothing to help matters but we\u2019ve got this overriding fear that another global slow down is imminent and many investors are adjusting portfolios to suit. The theme of risk aversion is buoying precious metals... as gold eyes a break above $1200 an ounce for the first time in over six months.</p> <p>But 25 stocks [in the FTSE 100 are] sporting losses in excess of 5% on the day, underlying the sense of panic that is creeping in. Economic data remains thin on the ground tomorrow but given at least some of the downside in stocks can be attributed to that renewed weakness in oil, this remains a metric worth watching closely.

In a new note he says:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We struggle to remember many occasions when investor sentiment was quite as bearish and widespread as it feels today. Sure, 2008 was worse as the global financial crisis and fears of global depression created panic in markets, but today\u2019s cool disdain for risk assets still takes some beating. When we were asked by a client this week what reason bullish investors were citing for their optimism, we had to confess that we couldn\u2019t answer as we hadn\u2019t met any in recent times. The collective noun for a group of bears is a \u2018sleuth\u2019, but it doesn\u2019t take much detective work just now to identify what investors are concerned about. </p> </blockquote> <p>Those concerns revolve around the usual suspects - China, emerging markets, dollar, oil etc - but added to that are the fact that central banks are moving towards negative interest rates, which is not particularly positive for equity markets.

                "bodyText":"That\u2019s all from us until tomorrow, after another day dominated by wild swings in the markets and angst over the global economy. Will Tuesday be different? Come back tomorrow and find out. Goodnight! GW Wall Street has closed for the night, after a day of turmoil in the major stock markets. The Dow Jones industrial has finished down 177 points, or 1.1%, at 16,027, as gloom over global growth hit financial stocks. The S&amp;P 500 index, which covers more US stocks than the Dow, shed 1.4% and the Nasdaq finished down 1.8%. Serious losses, but better than the lowest points of the day. Wall Street was dragged up by a late rally in energy stocks. Credit card firm Visa was the biggest faller on the Dow, followed by Goldman Sachs: Tech firms had a bad day - with social media network Twitter dropping by over 5% to a new record low: As we\u2019ve been covering for the last 14 hours, that followed hefty losses in Europe. The FTSE 100 plunged by 2.7%, or 158 points, wiping \u00a340bn off the blue-chip London index. And European markets fell further, hit by fears over the banking sector and the global economy. Greece was the worst performer, though, hitting its lowest level in 25 years! Owen Callan, senior analyst at Cantor Fitzgerald, said investors are increasingly anxious about the \u201cfundamental picture\u201d of the world economy. Callan said: \u201cPeople are worried about the global economy and particularly now we are beginning to look at the banks. \u201cYou are seeing more and more people saying: \u2018Is this 2008 again?\u2019 Maybe not quite as severe, but do we need to be worrying about the banking sector and risk assets on a bigger level?\u201d Here\u2019s our news story about today\u2019s selloff: Hello..... the US stock market is staging a late rally, bouncing off its earlier lows. The Dow is now down just 150 points, or 0.9%, having been down almost 400 points a couple of hours ago: Some big names are leading the Wall Street fallers, with 20 minutes until the closing bell is rung. Investment bank Goldman Sachs is down 5.8%, mirroring the selloff in global banking stocks. Visa is close behind, down 5.6%, followed by Nike (5%), Home Depot (4.6%) and Boeing (3%). Here\u2019s a few photos from Wall Street today, as traders faced another day of chunky losses. Deutsche Bank\u2019s soothing statement about its bond repayments may have calmed investors nerves a little. Shares are creeping back from their lows on Wall Street, meaning the Dow is now only down 269 points, or 1.7%. Good news, there\u2019s only one hour to go until Wall Street closes and Manic Monday is over. Bad news, the US stock market is still heavily in the red. The Dow is down 2.17%, or 351 points to the bad, with the S&amp;P and Nasdaq in deeper trouble: Newsflash: Deutsche Bank has just issued a statement, saying it can meet a crucial debt repayment in April. The Frankfurt-based bank, which was at the heart of today\u2019s market turmoil, says it has a \u201cpayment capacity\u201d of around \u20ac1bn. That will cover the \u20ac350m due in April on its CoCo bonds -- debt which converts into shares, or is wiped out, if a bank hits financial problems and defaults. As we covered this morning (details here), some analysts fear Deutsche could miss a CoCo payment in 2017, if economic conditions worsen. Deutsche says it will probably have a \u201cpayment capacity\u201d of \u20ac4.3bn next year in 2017, depending on its operating performance this year. Here\u2019s Deutsche\u2019s statement: Deutsche Bank publishes updated information about AT1 payment capacity The stock market turmoil risks blowing a multi-billion pound black hole in the UK government\u2019s fiscal plans. That\u2019s the warning from the IFS thinktank, which published its Green Budget today, one month ahead of the official budget. Here\u2019s the story: Britain\u2019s leading experts on the public finances are warning that the turmoil on global stock markets threatens to leave a \u00a32bn black hole in George Osborne\u2019s deficit-reduction plans that could force the chancellor to raise taxes or make fresh cuts in spending to hit his budget targets. On a day in which share prices crashed in Europe and the US, the Institute for Fiscal Studies said Osborne\u2019s plan to put the UK back in the black by the end of the current parliament was vulnerable to a protracted financial market panic. The IFS said tumbling share prices \u2013 which wiped more than \u00a340bn off the value of the companies quoted on the FTSE 100 Index on Monday \u2013 were one of a number of factors that could blow the chancellor\u2019s plan off course in the next four years. Forecasts that wages growth will be lower than previously expected could knock another \u00a35bn hole in his budget, the thinktank said. And here\u2019s the full story: The Telegraph\u2019s Mehreen Kahn points out that the European banking sector has lost a sixth of its value in the last month. Here\u2019s her take on today\u2019s market mayhem: Global stocks were gripped by a fresh bout of panic selling on Monday raising fears over the health of the world\u2019s banking system for the first time since the financial crisis. European markets slumped to their lowest level in more than two years amid an unremittingly bleak outlook for the global economy and concerns over the resilience of the world\u2019s biggest lenders. The Euro Stoxx 600 index of leading bank shares fell as much as 6pc in Monday\u2019s trading, closing down 5.6pc, plumbing depths not seen since August 2012. The continent\u2019s lenders have now lost 17.3pc of their value of the last 30 days.... (more here) Anxious investors are continuing to pile into gold, sending it up to $1,200 per ounce for the first time in over seven months: So far this year, shares in America\u2019s largest banks have slumped by at least 15% as investors fear a global downturn. The biotech boom has speedily unwound, too.. There\u2019s no sign, yet, that Wall Street might recover from its early selloff. The Dow is stubbornly down around 344 points, or 2.1%, at 15,860 points. The broader S&amp;P 500 is down 2.3%, and the tech stock-packed Nasdaq has shed 2.9%. That\u2019s nearly as bad as the European selloff, and suggests we\u2019re facing yet more market turbulence. \u201cYelp\u201d indeed..... US technology stocks are being hit hard today. Tesla, the electric car company, have slumped by 9% today, dropping below $150 for the first time in two years. Global markets suffered a bad start to the week, with the Chinese new year proving as turbulent as the slump in the early days of January. Although the Chinese markets were closed, that did not end the recent spate of volatility facing investors. Fears about a slowdown in global growth returned with a vengeance, while banking shares were among the poorest performers on worries about the outlook, and the effect of negative interest rates on their business. On top of that came a cocktail of other concerns, from the prospect of Britain leaving the European Union to concerns about the review of Greek\u2019s progress in meeting its bailout targets. The rout was widespread, with the Greek market at its lowest for around 25 years and the Eurofirst300 dropped to a near two and a half year low. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 fell 158.7 points or 2.7% to 5689.36 Germany\u2019s Dax dropped 3.3% to 8979.36 with Deutsche Bank 9.5% lower France\u2019s Cac closed 3.2% lower at 4066.31 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB fell 4.09% to 16,441.2 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended down 4.44% at 8122.1 In Greece, the Athens market lost 7.87% to 464.23 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 323 points or 2%. There seems little justification for the day\u2019s slump in banking shares, said Laith Khalaf, senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown: Markets are clearly worried about a global economic downturn at a time when central banks have little dry powder left to fight off recessionary forces. The tables were turned in the UK stock market today with recent winners suffering from profit-taking, while the miners were virtually the only stocks to keep their heads above water. The collapse in the oil price has been a big shock to the financial system and its effects are still being absorbed by international stock markets, in particular the implications for global demand. Financials have been really badly hit of late, and in a sign of how dire things have got, some European banks are trading lower than they did during the depths of the financial crisis. There doesn\u2019t seem to be much justification for such a dismal outlook, but markets appear to be stuck in a negative feedback loop at the moment. A sense of panic seems to be setting in, but any increase in the oil price might help markets, said Tony Cross at Trustnet Direct: Equities across the globe have kicked off the week in a deeply downbeat mood. London\u2019s FTSE-100 has posted a 2.7% sell-off, pushing the benchmark index squarely back into bear-market territory, but losses across mainland Europe have been even more pronounced. The fact that WTI crude tested territory below $30/barrel once again has done nothing to help matters but we\u2019ve got this overriding fear that another global slow down is imminent and many investors are adjusting portfolios to suit. The theme of risk aversion is buoying precious metals... as gold eyes a break above $1200 an ounce for the first time in over six months. But 25 stocks [in the FTSE 100 are] sporting losses in excess of 5% on the day, underlying the sense of panic that is creeping in. Economic data remains thin on the ground tomorrow but given at least some of the downside in stocks can be attributed to that renewed weakness in oil, this remains a metric worth watching closely. Anything that fundamentally impacts on supply could be all it takes to instil some confidence in markets, but in the absence of any better news the bears are likely to remain in control. One reason for the current market problems is the US Federal Reserve ending its quantitative easing programme, says Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Bloomberg has the story: Ever since the Federal Reserve began to withdraw monetary stimulus, liquidity has steadily been drying up. Therein lies the crux of the broader stress in financial markets, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch, which have seen violent selloffs occur following the surprise revaluations of currencies in Switzerland and China, as well as Japan\u2019s introduction of negative interest rates. Head of U.S. Mortgages Chris Flanagan and Strategist Mao Ding don\u2019t necessarily lay blame for market dislocations squarely on U.S. monetary policymakers. The two observe, however, that since early 2014\u2014when the Fed began winding down its open-ended asset purchases\u2014liquidity stress has \u201cpersistently risen\u201d and served as the proximate cause of the episodic spikes in Merrill Lynch\u2019s Global Financial Stress Index that have since occurred. [They said:] \u201cThis persistence suggests to us that deteriorating liquidity is at the heart of and may be the primary driver of broader rising financial stress.\u201d Full story here: Bank of America: This Chart Shows \u2018Deteriorating Liquidity\u2019 Is at the Heart of Market Carnage More turbulence in the banking sector, which has been by worries about negative interest rates, the outlook for profits and slowing global growth. Trading in Barclays shares was halted briefly after volatile movements. Now resumed, the shares are down 5.4%. With China\u2019s markets closed for the new year holiday, it is a worrying sign that share prices elsewhere continue to tumble, says Chris Beauchamp, senior market analyst at IG: The selling that began this morning has gathered pace across the globe this afternoon, as the US joins in the one-way move. Chinese investors will feel relieved that their market has taken the week off, but the absence of the volatility provided by Shanghai sends a worrying message \u2013 investors in the US and Europe are worried by many things, not least the current interest rate outlook in the US. Recent surveys of fund managers may indicate rising cash balances, but so far these appear to be remaining on the side lines, pulling the rug from under what remains of this bull market. In a week when economic data is relatively light, it is becoming increasingly apparent investors are struggling to find any positive news on which to create a rally. Then there are the banks. Jasper Lawler at CMC Markets said: Banking shares across Europe buckled under the pressure of global growth concerns in concert with the ugly spectre of negative interest rates. Weak earnings from European banks, notably that of Deutsche Bank have seen investors significantly reassess the chance of an earnings turnaround after years of regulatory fines for past misdeeds. The disappointing earnings across the sector from the big US firms to Credit Suisse whose chief executive asked to have his bonus cut by as much as 50% is refocusing investor attention on bad loan books which have not been addressed since the European crisis. In the days after Deutsche Bank issued a surprise profit warning, credit default swap spreads ballooned as investors started to question the bank\u2019s ability to fund itself. The CDS jump has caused a sharp drop in Deutsche Bank shares. Markets continue to slide, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average now down around 300 points. Meanwhile in Greece, the Athens market has closed down 7.87% to 464.23, its lowest level in at least 25 years. Banks - as elsewhere - are among the biggest fallers, down up to nearly 30% in some cases. Greece\u2019s finance minister Euclid Tsakalotos said he expected the review of the country\u2019s bailout programme to restart next week, and conclude two weeks later. But with worries about planned pension and tax reforms - which have seen major protests in recent days - have unnerved investors. Manos Hatzidakis of Beta Securities told Reuters: The market is pricing in financial and political instability, and delays in the review. Sterling has hit a one week low, falling to $1.4393 amid worries about the outlook for banks and concerns about the effects of any vote from Britain to leave the European Union. It is also at a 13 month low against the euro. The recent move by central banks to push interest rates into negative territory is bold but unco-ordinated and could lead to a \u201crace to the bottom,\u201d according to Standard &amp; Poor\u2019s. The ratings agency said: Four European central banks--in Switzerland, Denmark, and Sweden, plus the European Central Bank--have adopted negative policy rates, and Japan surprisingly joined the club on January 29 this year. \u201cThe Bank of Japan\u2019s decision to follow suit on negative rates is likely to reinforce the trend toward shrinking yields in core government bond markets, as the search for yield spreads from Japan into Europe,\u201d said Standard &amp; Poor\u2019s economist Sophie Tahiri... \u201cThe bold venture into negative interest rates signals to market participants that central banks will use all tools at their disposal to meet inflation targets,\u201d said Ms Tahiri. \u201cThe problem is that all developed markets\u2019 central banks face the same deflationary pressures from weak commodity prices and have the same incentive to use their exchange rate to combat those pressures.\u201d This increasing competition between developed markets\u2019 central banks to stem currency appreciation signals a new phase in the extended aftermath of the global financial crisis. Independent attempts to weaken exchange rates could lead to an undesirable \u201crace to the bottom\u201d among central banks. Here\u2019s a snapshot of the Dow movers, mainly down of course: Amid the current worries about the global economy, Europe could start moving up the list according to strategist Graham Secker at Morgan Stanley. In a new note he says: We struggle to remember many occasions when investor sentiment was quite as bearish and widespread as it feels today. Sure, 2008 was worse as the global financial crisis and fears of global depression created panic in markets, but today\u2019s cool disdain for risk assets still takes some beating. When we were asked by a client this week what reason bullish investors were citing for their optimism, we had to confess that we couldn\u2019t answer as we hadn\u2019t met any in recent times. The collective noun for a group of bears is a \u2018sleuth\u2019, but it doesn\u2019t take much detective work just now to identify what investors are concerned about. Those concerns revolve around the usual suspects - China, emerging markets, dollar, oil etc - but added to that are the fact that central banks are moving towards negative interest rates, which is not particularly positive for equity markets. Secker said he feared any moves higher by stock markets, prompted by relief rallies on positive new, would \u201cprove short-lived as investors increasingly question the value and effectiveness of further central bank action.\u201d And then there is Europe: Recent investor caution tends to focus on fears of excess US dollar strength, low oil prices and/or China, but we think it is quite plausible that Europe moves back up the pecking order (to its more usual place some would say!) as we move through 2016. The UK\u2019s forthcoming referendum on EU membership, likely to take place in June, may appear the most plausible catalyst in the short term to raise regional risk premia, but the ongoing migrant issue risks eroding political cohesion over the medium term and political uncertainty is rising in the periphery. Greece has a daunting debt repayment due this summer, Spain is currently without a government, new European regulations are preventing Italy from adopting an effective \u2018bad bank\u2019 solution and the recently elected socialist government in Portugal is reversing course on prior austerity and competitiveness improvements. During a cyclical upswing, markets are prone to overlook such concerns, but the opposite would be true if growth starts to relapse. US markets have followed Europe into the red, as fears about the global economy continue to rattle investors. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 220 points or 1.3% while the S&amp;P 500 is down just over 1% and the Nasdaq has fallen 1.7% at the open. With the Greek stock market at its lowest since at least 1990 and banks bearing the brunt of the selling, here is the huge damage done to the four biggest since the start of the year: Readers in America should brace themselves. The selloff that began in Europe this morning is heading your way. Wall Street is expected to fall sharply when trading begins in 20 minutes time, as fears over the global economy reach New York. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is tipped to fall by over 1%, while US crude oil is flirting with the $30/barrel mark. Terry Sandven, chief equity strategist at U.S. Bank Wealth Management in Minneapolis, told Reuters that investors will remain nervous until the oil price picks up. \u201cEquities are in a \u2018go-nowhere-fast\u2019 mode, with a downward bias in the near term. Some analysts are concerned that Deutsche Bank may struggle to repay some of its bonds, if economic conditions continue to deteriorate. That\u2019s helps explains why its shares have slumped 5%, as investors also drive up the cost of insuring its debt. The key is Deutsche\u2019s CoCo bonds, or contingent convertible bonds, which are written down or converted to equity when a bank\u2019s capital falls to a certain level. CoCo bonds have been introduced since the 2008 financial crisis, to spare governments from funding another bailout. They pay a decent return, to encourage investors to hold them, in return for shouldering the risk if things go wrong. Bloomberg\u2019s John Glover has the story: Deutsche Bank may struggle to pay coupons on its riskiest bonds next year if operating results disappoint or litigation costs are higher than expected, according to analysts at CreditSights Inc. Bonds and stock of Germany\u2019s largest bank have plunged this year, with the shares shedding 35% of their value and its contingent convertible bonds -- known as CoCos, or additional Tier 1 securities -- turning in a similar performance. The cost of protecting the company\u2019s subordinated debt from default for five years using credit-default swaps has more than doubled since the end of 2015, rising to 420 basis points, a four-year high, from 187. \u201cWhile we are confident about 2016 coupons, we are less so about coupon payments in 2017,\u201d CreditSights analyst Simon Adamson wrote in a note to clients today. Deutsche Bank will do \u201ceverything in its power to pay them\u201d because it will need to issue such bonds in the future, he said. Full story: Deutsche Bank\u2019s Woes Threaten CoCo Coupons, CreditSights Says The selloff is gathering pace in Frankfurt. The German DAX index has just slumped through the 9,000 point mark for the first time in 16 months, down 3.2%. Bank stocks are leading the DAX further down.... Stock market wizards like to tell you that \u2018buy and hold\u2019 is a solid strategy, that allows shareholders to ride out turbulence. Shares outperform other assets in the long term, they chant. Well, tell that to a Greek investor. The Athens market has just slumped to its lowest level in at least 25 years. Greek bank shares are being pulverised today, with Eurobank down 27%, National Bank of Greece down 25% and Piraeus down 20%. It\u2019s only three months since the Greek banking sector was recapitalised, getting \u20ac14bn of new funding to help stabilise the economy. China has lost its claim to be the world\u2019s fastest-growing major economy, to India. New government figures from Delhi show that Indian gross domestic product grew by 7.3% in the last quarter of 2015, compared with a year earlier. That beats China, which expanded by 6.8% over the same period. India\u2019s statistics body also estimated that GDP will expand by 7.6% in the year through March. That would also outpace Beijing, which is aiming for growth close to 7%. Caution is needed with these figures. Many economists suspect China is growing rather slower than the official readings. And some have told Reuters that India\u2019s figures are surprisingly strong. Almost every company on the FTSE 100 index has fallen this morning, during another bout of heavy selling across Europe\u2019s stock markets. Worries over the state of the world economy continue to drive shares lower. Only five companies are defying the rout, including gold producer Randgold and silver producer Fresnillo, who are both benefitting from the panic. That has left the FTSE 100 languishing at 5,735 points, down 112 points or 1.9% today. Other European markets are deeper in the red, losing around 2.4% on average, and hitting their lowest level since October 2014. Conner Campbell of Spreadex has summed up the situation (I\u2019ve added links to key points in this blog): A slow start soon turned disastrous this Monday, with many of the European indices plunging to lows not seen since October 2014. With Citigroup warning of a potential \u2018death spiral\u2019 if investors behave irrationally to the stronger dollar/weaker commodities/harmed emerging markets cycle that the world appears to be trapped in at the moment, the markets have taken another kicking this Monday. It doesn\u2019t help, of course, that the day\u2019s economic calendar is so sparse, with investors left pondering the purely negative side of things as the morning continued. The FTSE sank by nearly 2%, plummeting past 5800 in the process as Brent Crude fell back towards the $33 per barrel mark. The DAX, always the liveliest index in instances like this, lopped off a whopping 2.6% in value as the morning progressed, and is in serious danger of falling below the 9000 mark; the CAC, meanwhile, matched its dramatic German peer with its own 2.5% drop. The Eurozone had the added negative of a 10 month low Sentix investor confidence figure, the reported 6.0 far lower than the 9.6 announced in January, whilst the German index has the extra burden of a dismal morning from Deutsche Bank. The FT\u2019s Joel Lewin has a handy explanation of why bank shares are falling today. Fears surrounding non-performing loans and other deep-rooted issues in the Italian banking sector have driven nerves, while a slew of weak earnings from large banks such as Credit Suisse and Deutsche Bank have added to concerns. Weak growth provides an unsupportive backdrop, as does the possibility of more deeply negative benchmark interest rates. And that\u2019s why Commerzbank has dropped by 4.7%, Deutsche Bank is down 3.4%, and BNP Paribas has lost 3.3%. UK banks are also suffering, with Lloyds and Royal Bank of Scotland both down 1.7% In another sign of angst, the gold price has just hit a three month high. Bullion is swapping hands at $1,171 per ounce, the most since the end of October. It has already gained around 10% since the start of 2016, as concerns over the world economic outlook have grown. The OECD think tank has issued new economic indicators for investors to digest (in between hammering the SELL button). It sees \u2018tentative\u2019 signs that the Chinese economy is bottoming out, but slowing growth in the US. The OECD is also quite upbeat about Europe, saying: In the euro area as a whole, and in Germany and Italy, the composite leading indicators signal stable growth momentum while in France the outlook is for firming growth.\u201d We\u2019ll find out on Friday if they\u2019re right, when the latest eurozone GDP figures are published (starting at 6.30am GMT, so set your alarm clocks). How worried should we really, really be about a global recession? No-one knows for sure. But investment bank Goldman Sachs reckons it is still unlikely, despite fears that the recent market turmoil will feed into the \u2018real economy\u2019. They have estimated that there is an 18% chance that the United States goes into recession over the next year, rising to 23% over the next two years. For the eurozone, it\u2019s a 24% risk this year, up to 38% by the end of 2017. So hardly a done deal. Goldman\u2019s Jan Hatzius agues that \u201cThe recent market weakness should provide good risk-adjusted opportunities for those brave enough to defy Mr. Market\u2019s gloomy prognosis about the world economy.\u201d The selloff in European markets this morning suggests Mr Market isn\u2019t convinced.... The Greek stock market is still falling, and now down over 6%. That\u2019s pretty worrying, given the political tensions in Athens. Wall Street is expected to suffer losses when trading begins in New York, in just over three hours time. According to the future market, the Dow Jones industrial average will fall 1.2% at the open. The tech-heavy Nasdaq index is being called down 1.6%. The oil price is falling again, hit by concerns over the global economy. Brent crude has dropped by 1.7% to $33.47 per barrel, wiping out last week\u2019s rally. Confirmation that Germany\u2019s stock market is at a 15-month low: The Greek stock market has slumped by 5% to its lowest level since 2012 - when it nearly left the eurozone. That\u2019s partly due to the general wave of worry today, but it also reflects the standoff over Greece\u2019s bailout. Creditors are pushing the government to make deeper pension reforms, while protestors flocked to the streets last week to call for less austerity. European banking shares are bearing the brunt of today\u2019s rout. In Germany, shares in Deutsche Bank have tumbled by 4.35%. And the cost of insuring Deutsche\u2019s debt against default, using a credit default swap or CDS, has hit the highest level since July 2012. That underlines how much nervousness is in the markets today: Last month, Deutsche announced that it suffered a loss of \u20ac6.7bn last year. New CEO John Cryan said it was \u2018sobering\u2019, and some analysts fear Cryan will struggle to turn Deutsche around in the current market turmoil. As well as the huge loss, Deutsche also reported falling revenues. According to Bloomberg, that could indicate the bank will struggle to hit its capital ratio targets. As shares slide, investors are scrambling to get their hands on safe-haven assets such as German government debt today. And that has driven the yield, or interest rate, on German bunds into deeper negative territory. In other words, traders are willing to pay more than the face value of the bonds and accept a guaranteed loss - unless they can offload them onto someone even more desperate..... A wave of selling is gripping Europe\u2019s stock markets, as this morning\u2019s stream of bad news hits traders. In London, the FTSE 100 index is suddenly down by 101 points, or 1.7%. And there are steeper losses across Europe, where the benchmark FTSeurofirst 300 index has shed 2%. That means European stocks are at their lowest point since October 2014, as money pours out of shares and into safe-haven bonds. Concerns over the weakness of the global economy appear to be rippling through trading floors again. The sharp fall in eurozone investor confidence reported a few minutes ago is contributing to the bad mood: Alastair McCaig, Market Analyst at IG. says: Stock markets in Europe are in full retreat... with the disappointing Sentix figures triggering a mid-morning selloff. The news that UK business morale has hit a three-year low isn\u2019t helping either. More gloom! Economic sentiment among investors across the eurozone has fallen sharply this month, as the problems in the global economy hit Europe. Sentix, the Frankfurt-based think tank, has just reported that its index of investor morale has hit a 10-month low in February, dropping from 9.6 to 6.0. And its sub-index of economic expectations hit its lowest level since November, 2014, sliding from 6.3 to just 1.5. Manfred Huebner, Sentix\u2019s managing director, warns: The euro zone proves it is not immune to the enormous loss of momentum in the global economy. The global economy is thus currently on the brink, led by a US economic downturn! Sentix blamed \u201cthe loss of dynamism\u201d in Germany and the United States, while Latin America and Eastern Europe are in a worse state. And Sentix singles out the Federal Reserve\u2019s interest rate increase last December, which is \u201cnow considered a big mistake by the majority of investors\u201d. It also pointed to the slump in commodity prices, and its impact on emerging markets. Wall Street bank Citigroup has contributed to the sombre feeling in the markets, with a research note last week warning that we could face a \u2018death spiral\u2019. The bad news, according to Citi, is that the dollar could keep strengthening, driving commodity prices lower, hurting emerging markets (EM), and thus pushing the dollar higher etc etc. The good news is that it probably won\u2019t happen though, if \u2018rational behaviour\u2019 kicks in . CNBC has the details: \u201cThe world appears to be trapped in a circular reference death spiral,\u201d Citi strategists led by Jonathan Stubbs said in a report on Thursday. \u201cStronger U.S. dollar, weaker oil/commodity prices, weaker world trade/petrodollar liquidity, weaker EM (and global growth)... and repeat. Ad infinitum, this would lead to Oilmageddon, a \u2018significant and synchronized\u2019 global recession and a proper modern-day equity bear market.\u201d Stubbs said that macro strategists at Citi forecast that the dollar would weaken in 2016 and that oil prices were likely bottoming, potentially providing some light at the end of the tunnel. \u201cThe death spiral is in nobody\u2019s interest. Rational behaviour, most likely, will prevail,\u201d he said in the report. Great headline - but maybe the report is a little overblown? One money manager thinks so.... The Economist Intelligence Unit is also concerned about the economic situation. Their managing director, Robin Bew, tweets that they think UK interest rates will remain at 0.5% until 2019 In another sign of unease, shares in UK chipmaker ARM Holdings have slipped by 4% to the bottom of the FTSE 100 leaderboard. ARM reports results on Wednesday, and analysts fear it is suffering from the slowdown in the US technology sector. Last week, Apple predicted that sales of the iPhone (which uses ARM chips) will start to fall later this year. Another UK tech firm called Imagination, which designs chips, warned this morning it will make an operating loss this year. It blamed a slowing market, and uncertainty over China. Peter Elston, chief investment officer at Seneca Investment Managers, argues that we\u2019re unlikely to be entering a recession yet. Recessions generally start because central banks are trying to restrain economies, he told Bloomberg TV this morning. But right now, inflation pressures are very low, and economies are still some way from full capacity. \u201cThis would be an extremely unusual place for a global recession to start.\u201d True. But arguably, we\u2019ve been in an \u201cextremely unusual place\u201d since the financial crisis, with central bank stimulus has been underpinning growth. Ultra-low interest rates helped struggling firms limp on and quantitative easing pumped up the stock market. Still, though, global growth is weak and vulnerable to the impact of higher US interest rates - unless the Fed changes course.... Shares in engine maker Rolls Royce have shed 2% at the start of trading, as the City braces for further problems. After hitting shareholders with five profit warnings in two years, Rolls-Royce could now slash its dividend when it posts its annual results on Friday. My colleague Graham Ruddick explains: The company has been hurt by cuts to defence spending by western governments, a fall in demand for corporate jets, and a slump in the oil price. European stock markets have begun the new week rather gingerly. The FTSE 100 index has gained 20 points, or 0.4%, but Germany\u2019s DAX is only up 0.1% and the French CAC is slightly lower. This fall in UK business confidence will only fuel concern that the global economy is slowing. Chris Weston of financial spread-betting firm IG says this is the biggest issue in the markets today. Will we see a recession in the US and other developed nations? There is little doubt this is the number one question being asked right now. He points out that insurance against company\u2019s defaulting has spiked in value recently, especially for banks. And the stock market turbulence, and the recent surge in the US dollar, show how financial conditions have deteriorated. If that feeds through to the real economy, we could be in serious trouble. As Chris puts it: The strong fear is this stress \u2013 that is clearly being felt in the financial markets \u2013 will start to filter through to Main Street. We have some worrying news to start the week -- confidence among UK executives has hit its lowest level since 2013. Concerns over Britain\u2019s upcoming EU referendum are adding to worries over the global economy. And business leaders now fear their companies are suffering. That\u2019s according to a regular survey conducted by BDO, the professional services firm. It warns that the UK is now suffering from problems in the global economy, particularly China\u2019s slowdown and signs of weakness in America. The turmoil in the Middle East is also hitting confidence. Peter Hemington, partner at BDO LLP, warns: \u201cGlobal headwinds are finally hitting business confidence and the added uncertainty of EU referendum just round the corner is fuelling concerns. This knocked BDO\u2019s Business Optimism Index \u2013 which predicts growth six months ahead \u2013 down to 100.0. That\u2019s the tipping point below which firms expect their output growth to drop under the long term trend rate. So what can be done? One option, the BDO says, is for the government to introduce a zero-rate of VAT on companies that sell their goods to exporters. Manufacturers could certainly use some help. The sector is already in recession, even though the wider UK economy grew by a solid-enough 0.5% in the final quarter of 2015. BDO found that manufacturing output contracted again this month, which it attribued to \u201cdecreasing global confidence\u201d. Dr Gerard Lyons, the Mayor London\u2019s economic advisor, points out that other measures were less gloomy: Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. It looks like a quiet start to the week, as investors wait to hear from Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen. Yellen testifies to Congress on Wednesday and Thursday, and will give her take on the recent turmoil in the financial markets, and the state of the global economy. She\u2019s also likely to be questioned on whether the Fed was right to raise interest rates in December, and whether future hikes are now on the back-burner. It could be a tricky balancing act for Yellen; she won\u2019t want to fuel the current market angst, but nor can she sound complacent. Thomas Costerg, of Standard Chartered Bank in New York, predicts that Yellen will keep her options open regarding future interest rate rises: \u201cShe may emphasize the positives in the U.S. economy, particularly the still-strong labor market. Looking ahead, she may sound more cautious, and she will likely highlight that the negatives are mostly from abroad and that they are watching the global picture closely.\u201d City traders are also digesting the news that China burned through another $99.5bn in foreign exchange reserves last month, defending the yuan. That takes China\u2019s FX reserves down to their lowest level since 2012, although Beijing still has $3.23 trillion fo firepower. Those figures haven\u2019t alarmed Chinese investors, though, as they are now on holiday for the Chinese New Year. We\u2019re expecting a quiet start to trading in Europe, with the main indices expected to rise. And there\u2019s not much in the economic calendar today, apart from the monthly survey of eurozone Investor Confidence, from Sentix, at 9.30am GMT.",

                "body":"<p>Markets are staging an early rally after this week\u2019s hefty falls amid panicky trading. But the mood is still cautious ahead of chair Janet Yellen testifying to Congress later, and there are some notable losers.</p> <p><strong>Hikma</strong> has dropped 234p or nearly 12% to \u00a317.61 after the pharmaceutical group revised the terms of its offer for US generic drug group Roxane. It said it would pay $535m less than originally anticipated $2.65bn since the group\u2019s 2015 revenue would be lower than expected. It said Roxane\u2019s revenues this year would also be affected. Analysts at Jefferies said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The company stated they believe 2016 revenue will be negatively impacted and has reduced the revenue range for 2017 to $700-750m vs. $725-775m previously and JEFe $750m.</p> <p>Since the publication of the Prospectus on January 22nd, Hikma received new information from BI with regard to the financial performance of Roxane in 2015, leading to a reassessment of the outlook for 2016 and 2017. Roxane\u2019s unaudited revenue appears to have been lower than Hikma expected at the time of the prospectus\u2019 publication.</p> <p>Higher than expected rebates and increased cost of sales the cause: Rebates were primarily being paid to wholesalers, as the mix shifted from direct sales to retailers towards more indirect sales via wholesalers the level of rebates paid increased. This resulted in lower net selling prices than had been previously expected. Furthermore, Hikma believes the cost of sales is higher due to higher volumes and a change in mix which has led to a higher cost of raw materials.</p> </blockquote> <p>Analysts at Stifel were still positive on the deal, saying:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We still believe the acquisition makes strong strategic sense for Hikma, and plan to adjust our forecasts for these changes in due course.</p> </blockquote> <p>Chip designer <strong>Arm</strong> is also in the doldrums, down 37.5p to 902.5p as the Apple supplier reported a better than expected 14% rise in fourth quarter revenues to $407.9m but brokers pointed out that a $9m royalty catch-up payment inflated the figures. Liberum said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Dollar revenue was 2% ahead of our forecast. However, there was a $9m royalty catch-up which boosted numbers. Excluding this catch up revenue was in-line. Opex was 5% ahead of our forecast. Including the royalty catch-up EBIT was in-line, but excluding it EBIT was 4% below our forecasts. Dividend per share has been increased by 25% but nothing further on cash returns which may disappoint some. Backlog was up quarter on quarter.

                "bodyText":"Markets are staging an early rally after this week\u2019s hefty falls amid panicky trading. But the mood is still cautious ahead of chair Janet Yellen testifying to Congress later, and there are some notable losers. Hikma has dropped 234p or nearly 12% to \u00a317.61 after the pharmaceutical group revised the terms of its offer for US generic drug group Roxane. It said it would pay $535m less than originally anticipated $2.65bn since the group\u2019s 2015 revenue would be lower than expected. It said Roxane\u2019s revenues this year would also be affected. Analysts at Jefferies said: The company stated they believe 2016 revenue will be negatively impacted and has reduced the revenue range for 2017 to $700-750m vs. $725-775m previously and JEFe $750m. Since the publication of the Prospectus on January 22nd, Hikma received new information from BI with regard to the financial performance of Roxane in 2015, leading to a reassessment of the outlook for 2016 and 2017. Roxane\u2019s unaudited revenue appears to have been lower than Hikma expected at the time of the prospectus\u2019 publication. Higher than expected rebates and increased cost of sales the cause: Rebates were primarily being paid to wholesalers, as the mix shifted from direct sales to retailers towards more indirect sales via wholesalers the level of rebates paid increased. This resulted in lower net selling prices than had been previously expected. Furthermore, Hikma believes the cost of sales is higher due to higher volumes and a change in mix which has led to a higher cost of raw materials. Analysts at Stifel were still positive on the deal, saying: We still believe the acquisition makes strong strategic sense for Hikma, and plan to adjust our forecasts for these changes in due course. Chip designer Arm is also in the doldrums, down 37.5p to 902.5p as the Apple supplier reported a better than expected 14% rise in fourth quarter revenues to $407.9m but brokers pointed out that a $9m royalty catch-up payment inflated the figures. Liberum said: Dollar revenue was 2% ahead of our forecast. However, there was a $9m royalty catch-up which boosted numbers. Excluding this catch up revenue was in-line. Opex was 5% ahead of our forecast. Including the royalty catch-up EBIT was in-line, but excluding it EBIT was 4% below our forecasts. Dividend per share has been increased by 25% but nothing further on cash returns which may disappoint some. Backlog was up quarter on quarter. Arm\u2019s outlook statement is cautious. The company has also been under pressure on signs of a slowdown in iPhone sales. Despite poor UK industrial production data, the FTSE 100 is currently up 51.03 points at 5683.22. Rebecca O\u2019Keeffe, head of investment at stockbroker Interactive Investor, said: Major European markets are trying to rally once again, but with previous rebounds having lacked conviction, falling sharply after early gains, sentiment remains fragile. Any early movement in markets is, however, just a precursor to this afternoon\u2019s main event, billed as possibly the most important debate of the year so far, as Janet Yellen makes her first official public statement since raising rates in December. At the House Financial Services Committee today, Janet Yellen can expect a tough examination from lawmakers after the financial carnage that has ensued since the Fed hiked interest rates. Will she insist that the Fed is simply data-dependent, or might there be an acknowledgment that the world simply wasn\u2019t ready for higher US interest rates? With both the Bank of Japan and European Central Bank still in aggressive easing mode, the Fed appears more isolated than ever in its efforts to normalise US monetary conditions. Insurers are among the main gainers, with Prudential up 55p to \u00a311.81 and Legal and General, which on Tuesday reassured investors about its bond exposure, adding 7.5p to 209.9p. Elsewhere Domino\u2019s Pizza has jumped 68p to 924.5p after Credit Suisse moved from neutral to outperform with a target price raised from 770p to \u00a311.",

They could make products and offer services worldwide and, especially in the software field, they would make money hand over fist; look at businesses like Microsoft and Oracle in the 1990s. Oil spills, environmental damage, government regulation \u2013 that was something for other sectors.</p> <p>But with the rise of the internet, and companies\u2019 ability to become not just transnational but supranational, active everywhere yet arguing that their responsibilities belong nowhere, attitudes have changed. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/feb/17/apple-challenges-chilling-demand-decrypt-san-bernadino-iphone\" title=\"\">Apple\u2019s row with the FBI over access to a locked iPhone</a> that belonged to the employer of one of the San Bernardino killers is just the latest example of technology businesses discovering that nothing they now do is without consequences.</p> <p>Apple has been excoriated by presidential candidates, and backed into the tightest of corners by the FBI: the moral case for refusing to hack into a terrorist\u2019s phone is hard to make \u2013 particularly in the US over an Isis-inspired attack during an election year.</p> <p>But it\u2019s not just Apple. Google\u2019s Matt Brittin probably wakes up sweating <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/feb/11/google-matt-brittin-salary-public-accounts-committee-tax-deal-grilling\" title=\"\">about his appearance before the Commons public accounts committee</a>, at which he couldn\u2019t remember how much he earned, and the questions about Google\u2019s sweetheart tax deal with HMRC kept coming.</p> <p>More broadly, the EU is considering an antitrust finding against Google for promoting its own products ahead of rivals\u2019 in search results. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/feb/08/france-facebook-data-privacy-safe-harbour-pact\" title=\"\">Facebook has been threatened with fines by the French data commissioner</a>. Twitter is on-again, off-again in Turkey, depending on the mood of the government, which frequently censors its feed. Pakistan banned Google\u2019s YouTube. Uber has made enemies of taxi drivers and even its own drivers in cities around the world as it undercuts the first group, then cuts payments to the latter. Airbnb is under investigation in New York, London and elsewhere over whether its accommodation site breaks short-let laws. Amazon is rebuked by MPs over its revenue-shifting, tax-minimising ways, and by bookshop lovers who have seen it undercut high-street retailers. Spotify (which hails from Sweden) is criticised by fans and players for the tiny amounts musicians get paid when people stream music through it rather than buying a download or \u2013 remember when? \u2013 a CD.</p> <p>And that\u2019s before we get to artificial intelligence, where people fear huge job losses as machines take over more and more complex jobs. Google, again, is at the nexus of that row, with UK company DeepMind (which it bought in 2014) having to try to dampen worries while raising expectations.</p> <p>Technology companies may not create oil spills, but their effects on modern life are suddenly spreading across a gamut of topics \u2013 privacy, tax, regulation, safety, even housing.</p> <p>That\u2019s why the San Bernardino case could be the straw that breaks the camel\u2019s back. The FBI knows that the publicity from this battle won\u2019t be favourable to Apple, whichever way the courts rule. That worries every other technology company: it\u2019s notable that <a href=\"https://twitter.com/sundarpichai\" title=\"\">Google chief executive Sundar Pichai\u2019s tweets on the topic</a> were carefully hedged, while Microsoft\u2019s Satya Nadella was similarly unwilling to stand foursquare behind Tim Cook (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/feb/18/apple-fbi-encryption-battle-iphone-facebook-twitter-san-bernardino-shooting\" title=\"\">unlike WhatsApp\u2019s Jan Koum and Twitter\u2019s Jack Dorsey</a>). Facebook\u2019s Mark Zuckerberg has been completely silent, though his company did issue a supportive statement.</p> <p>Apple, of course, wasn\u2019t looking for a row with the FBI when it improved the encryption on its phones. And that is what will worry tech companies. As their influence on our daily lives grows, the effects of new features become less predictable \u2013 but probably greater.</p> <p>What if the next case involves taxis and short lets used for child trafficking? Or tax avoidance turning out to fund terrorism? Those may sound farfetched, but they\u2019re only a form of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melvin_Kranzberg\" title=\"\">Kranzberg\u2019s first law</a>: \u201cTechnology is neither good nor bad; nor is it neutral.\u201d</p> <p>This week, the tech business is learning, to its reputational cost, just what that really means.</p> <h2>An old-fashioned fix for the G20<br></h2> <p>When G20 finance ministers and central bank governors meet this week in Shanghai, the failure of low interest rates to stimulate growth in their economies will be top of the agenda.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/feb/18/oecd-calls-for-less-austerity-and-more-public-investment\" title=\"\">The global economy is faltering</a> and the knee-jerk response is the same today as it has been since 2008: extra monetary stimulus. But when it seems clear that cutting interest rates to zero \u2013 or even below, a move already deployed in Europe and Japan \u2013 has the same catalysing force as a weak decaff cuppa, surely it is time for a rethink.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/economics-blog/2016/feb/18/oecd-calls-less-austerity-common-sense-prevailed\" title=\"\">The Organisation of Economic Co-operation &amp; Development will be on hand with an alternative</a>, though it will not sound very modern or innovative: it is recommending G20 nations coordinate an increase in spending to upgrade their infrastructure. Countries with the capacity to borrow should do so, and that includes the UK.</p> <p>According to the OECD, the growth this plan induces will more than offset the cost of borrowing and will expand national incomes sustainably.</p> <p>This embrace of Keynesianism is not before time. Economists outside the central banks have known for some time that flooding the financial system with cheap funds is a recipe for stagnation. It neither breeds confidence nor tackles structural imbalances, especially not the growing inequality that robs people on lower pay of decent wages to spend.</p> <p>George Osborne will fight the OECD, primarily to defend his economically nonsensical pitch to voters that the exchequer will benefit from balancing the books by 2020. Likewise, Germany will oppose the plan because its ageing population wants to conserve cash, not spend it for the benefit of the next generation.</p> <p>Other countries will resist for more practical reasons. China is investing like crazy and needs to continue switching to consumption, though it might be better if it encouraged the consumption of healthcare via taxation than the purchase of high street goods.</p> <p>Which illustrates how political forces defeat economic arguments, even when those arguments make sense for almost every country and could end the reliance on increasingly exhausted central banks.</p> <h2>Banks need a nice thick cushion</h2> <p>The words \u201csystemic risk buffers\u201d may cause many eyes to glaze over. But they shouldn\u2019t.

                "bodyText":"Life for technology companies was once, as the Fast Show character used to say, brilliant. They could make products and offer services worldwide and, especially in the software field, they would make money hand over fist; look at businesses like Microsoft and Oracle in the 1990s. Oil spills, environmental damage, government regulation \u2013 that was something for other sectors. But with the rise of the internet, and companies\u2019 ability to become not just transnational but supranational, active everywhere yet arguing that their responsibilities belong nowhere, attitudes have changed. Apple\u2019s row with the FBI over access to a locked iPhone that belonged to the employer of one of the San Bernardino killers is just the latest example of technology businesses discovering that nothing they now do is without consequences. Apple has been excoriated by presidential candidates, and backed into the tightest of corners by the FBI: the moral case for refusing to hack into a terrorist\u2019s phone is hard to make \u2013 particularly in the US over an Isis-inspired attack during an election year. But it\u2019s not just Apple. Google\u2019s Matt Brittin probably wakes up sweating about his appearance before the Commons public accounts committee, at which he couldn\u2019t remember how much he earned, and the questions about Google\u2019s sweetheart tax deal with HMRC kept coming. More broadly, the EU is considering an antitrust finding against Google for promoting its own products ahead of rivals\u2019 in search results. Facebook has been threatened with fines by the French data commissioner. Twitter is on-again, off-again in Turkey, depending on the mood of the government, which frequently censors its feed. Pakistan banned Google\u2019s YouTube. Uber has made enemies of taxi drivers and even its own drivers in cities around the world as it undercuts the first group, then cuts payments to the latter. Airbnb is under investigation in New York, London and elsewhere over whether its accommodation site breaks short-let laws. Amazon is rebuked by MPs over its revenue-shifting, tax-minimising ways, and by bookshop lovers who have seen it undercut high-street retailers. Spotify (which hails from Sweden) is criticised by fans and players for the tiny amounts musicians get paid when people stream music through it rather than buying a download or \u2013 remember when? \u2013 a CD. And that\u2019s before we get to artificial intelligence, where people fear huge job losses as machines take over more and more complex jobs. Google, again, is at the nexus of that row, with UK company DeepMind (which it bought in 2014) having to try to dampen worries while raising expectations. Technology companies may not create oil spills, but their effects on modern life are suddenly spreading across a gamut of topics \u2013 privacy, tax, regulation, safety, even housing. That\u2019s why the San Bernardino case could be the straw that breaks the camel\u2019s back. The FBI knows that the publicity from this battle won\u2019t be favourable to Apple, whichever way the courts rule. That worries every other technology company: it\u2019s notable that Google chief executive Sundar Pichai\u2019s tweets on the topic were carefully hedged, while Microsoft\u2019s Satya Nadella was similarly unwilling to stand foursquare behind Tim Cook (unlike WhatsApp\u2019s Jan Koum and Twitter\u2019s Jack Dorsey). Facebook\u2019s Mark Zuckerberg has been completely silent, though his company did issue a supportive statement. Apple, of course, wasn\u2019t looking for a row with the FBI when it improved the encryption on its phones. And that is what will worry tech companies. As their influence on our daily lives grows, the effects of new features become less predictable \u2013 but probably greater. What if the next case involves taxis and short lets used for child trafficking? Or tax avoidance turning out to fund terrorism? Those may sound farfetched, but they\u2019re only a form of Kranzberg\u2019s first law: \u201cTechnology is neither good nor bad; nor is it neutral.\u201d This week, the tech business is learning, to its reputational cost, just what that really means. An old-fashioned fix for the G20 When G20 finance ministers and central bank governors meet this week in Shanghai, the failure of low interest rates to stimulate growth in their economies will be top of the agenda. The global economy is faltering and the knee-jerk response is the same today as it has been since 2008: extra monetary stimulus. But when it seems clear that cutting interest rates to zero \u2013 or even below, a move already deployed in Europe and Japan \u2013 has the same catalysing force as a weak decaff cuppa, surely it is time for a rethink. The Organisation of Economic Co-operation &amp; Development will be on hand with an alternative, though it will not sound very modern or innovative: it is recommending G20 nations coordinate an increase in spending to upgrade their infrastructure. Countries with the capacity to borrow should do so, and that includes the UK. According to the OECD, the growth this plan induces will more than offset the cost of borrowing and will expand national incomes sustainably. This embrace of Keynesianism is not before time. Economists outside the central banks have known for some time that flooding the financial system with cheap funds is a recipe for stagnation. It neither breeds confidence nor tackles structural imbalances, especially not the growing inequality that robs people on lower pay of decent wages to spend. George Osborne will fight the OECD, primarily to defend his economically nonsensical pitch to voters that the exchequer will benefit from balancing the books by 2020. Likewise, Germany will oppose the plan because its ageing population wants to conserve cash, not spend it for the benefit of the next generation. Other countries will resist for more practical reasons. China is investing like crazy and needs to continue switching to consumption, though it might be better if it encouraged the consumption of healthcare via taxation than the purchase of high street goods. Which illustrates how political forces defeat economic arguments, even when those arguments make sense for almost every country and could end the reliance on increasingly exhausted central banks. Banks need a nice thick cushion The words \u201csystemic risk buffers\u201d may cause many eyes to glaze over. But they shouldn\u2019t. This is the extra bit of capital cushion that banks should hold, on top of the regulatory minimum, to help protect them against a system-wide meltdown such as we saw in the 2008 crisis. Sir John Vickers, who in 2011 was charged with finding ways of preventing another taxpayer bailout of the banking system, concluded that banks should hold an extra buffer worth 3% of their assets. Five years on, the Bank of England has set the buffer at around 0.5%. The Bank argues that when it is all added together, the amount of capital banks are required to hold is more than the overall total prescribed by Vickers. Even so, Vickers spoke out last week to urge Threadneedle Street to think again. He says these buffers are as important as ever for the safety of the UK banking sector, which remains bigger than the nation\u2019s GDP. He should be given a good hearing.",
