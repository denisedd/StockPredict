Or we might be focusing our attention on those importers or traders who have a history of importing non-compliant and unsafe products.\u201d </p> <p>At one end of the warehouse are stacks of boxes \u2013 plastered with yellow warning labels \u2013 whose contents have already been impounded by trading standards.

But the laboratory tests show that the levels in this toy \u2013 destined for pre-Christmas markets and car boot sales \u2013 breach regulations. In addition, the doll has a bogus CE mark that suggests \u2013 falsely \u2013 that she meets recognised EU safety standards. \u201cThis is purporting to be a stamp of approval and appears to be a deliberate attempt to mislead consumers,\u201d says Reed. Also tested from the same consignment were \u201cplush\u201d dolls, made from a furry synthetic fabric, where weak zips and easy access to battery compartments failed the safety assessment and were deemed to be dangerous choking hazards for young children. Reed is surrounded by piles of bulging cardboard boxes on pallets in Shed 70 - a warehouse the size of a football pitch, where the selected contents of some containers coming into Felixstowe are inspected. More than 40% of all imported goods coming into the UK do so via Felixstowe, where it typically takes three days to unload the up to 19,224 containers on the world\u2019s biggest capacity cargo ship, the 395m MSC Oscar. A staggering 4m full containers come through the port every year, and Reed \u2013 part of the NTS\u2019s ports and borders team and working as part of Suffolk Trading Standards\u2019 own team \u2013 is responsible for organising and carrying out regular inspections. \u201c It would be difficult for any agency to examine anything but a very small proportion of the containers arriving at the port each year,\u201d says Reed. \u201cTherefore we base our examinations on those which we consider to pose the greatest safety risk to consumers. Or we might be focusing our attention on those importers or traders who have a history of importing non-compliant and unsafe products.\u201d At one end of the warehouse are stacks of boxes \u2013 plastered with yellow warning labels \u2013 whose contents have already been impounded by trading standards. At the opposite end sit the contents of one container that has been emptied completely awaiting inspection. This container was singled out because the far east-based company that despatched the goods had no UK or EU base while a UK residential address had been used for VAT registration. Reed opened some boxes and found electrical products that are proving popular in the run-up to the Christmas including hair straightening brushes, steam facial cleansers and portable chargers. He is constantly on the lookout for products with faulty plugs and chargers that can overheat and cause fires. The volume of imported drones suggests that they will be popular as Christmas toys, Reed says, recalling a hectic period this time last year as officials seized thousands of unsafe hoverboards. \u201cOne particular trend we have spotted is the growth in \u201cmicro-importers\u201d \u2013 consumers in the UK who order half or even a whole container of goods to import for onward sale,\u201d adds Reed. \u201cThey have no idea what they are buying and are not interested in finding out. This can lead to fake, and often dangerous, products such as hoverboards ending up in people\u2019s homes.\u201d Cosmetics are also increasingly a problem where they contain a higher proportion of restricted chemicals than is allowed by law. A black henna hair dye popular with ethnic communities has in some cases been found to have more than 2% of the chemical PPD, which can cause burning of the scalp and skin. In September the trading standards team intercepted four separate consignments of nail manicure lamps and nail decoration kits from China because they were unsafe. They were found to have hazards including lack of proper insulation and unsafe plugs and fuses. Consumers were warned that some of these kits may have found their way onto shopping websites like Amazon and eBay. However, the consignment of Shu Yi baby dolls will not get underneath the Christmas tree.

                "body":"<p>Has anyone in Downing Street actually realised that Rupert Murdoch\u2019s 21st Century Fox has lodged a bid for Sky? If you trawl through newspapers and the internet looking for comments from the government about the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/dec/15/rupert-murdoch-sky-bid-pay-tv\">proposed \u00a311.7bn deal</a>, you will not find much.</p> <p>Matt Hancock, the junior culture minister, appeared in the Commons to answer an urgent question from Labour on the matter early last week, and that was it. \u201cAny transaction will be looked at on its merits, on a case-by-case basis,\u201d he said. How insightful.</p> <p>Theresa May, Philip Hammond and Greg Clark, the business secretary, have been silent on the matter. Karen Bradley, Hancock\u2019s boss and the culture, media and sport secretary, was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/dec/12/murdoch-sky-bid-culture-secretary-to-answer-urgent-question\">apparently unavailable to answer the urgent question in parliament.</a></p> <p>This all rather surprising when you consider that other investments in the UK from other overseas companies since the vote to leave the European Union have led to swift comments from the prime minister and chancellor praising their commitment to the country. The boss of Softbank, the Japanese company that bought technology group Arm for \u00a324bn, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2016/jul/18/philip-hammond-softbank-takeover-arm-holdings-overseas-investors\">even posed for photos with Hammond outside 11 Downing Street.</a></p> <p>Now, the government\u2019s silence on this issue may be because Sky shareholders have yet to vote on the proposal, or because it wants to leave the matter to Ofcom and other regulators. Hancock told MPs that the government must be \u201cscrupulously fair and impartial\u201d and that Bradley\u2019s role is \u201ca quasi-judicial one and it\u2019s important she acts independently and is not subject to improper influence\u201d.</p> <p>But that hasn\u2019t stopped the government before. Softbank\u2019s trip to Whitehall came on the day its bid was revealed, before the shareholder vote and before any regulator had cast an eye over the transaction.</p> <p>Instead, the government\u2019s silence looks like an attempt to distance itself from the Sky deal and depoliticise it. May has not even made a clear, public pledge to properly analyse the transaction.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/help/2016/sep/19/how-to-contact-the-guardian-securely\">How to contact the Guardian securely</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In contrast, Gordon Brown, Vince Cable, Tom Watson and plenty of other politicians outside government have had lots to say about the proposal \u2013 mainly that May must ensure that Ofcom conducts a public-interest test on the deal, seriously consider whether the Murdochs are fit and proper people to control Sky and its news operations, or even simply block the proposal.</p> <p>The government\u2019s silence is further evidence that the deal could be railroaded through by 21st Century Fox and Sky before any opposition is allowed to build up a head of steam.</p> <p>Supporters of the takeover claim that much has changed since <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/phone-hacking\">Murdoch last tried to buy Sky in 2011</a>. His business has been split in two, with newspaper brands such as the <em>Sun</em> and the <em>Times</em> held within News Corp and the TV and film assets run through Fox. Also, Google and Facebook now dominate the digital advertising market, transforming the outlook for news and content providers.</p> <p>But both of these defences are easily dismantled. Firstly, splitting News Corp and Fox does not change the fact that one family could end up with extraordinary influence over British media. Take a look at the boards of News Corp and Fox \u2013 Rupert and Lachlan Murdoch are the co-chairs of both, while James Murdoch is chief executive of Fox, on the board of News Corp, and chair of Sky.</p> <p>Secondly, recent changes in the media industry simply reinforce the importance of the established news providers emphasising their independence, credibility and quality. If the public question the veracity of what they read in newspapers or see on TV news, then it simply pushes more people to Facebook, Google and fake news.</p> <p>The government must not sleepwalk its way through this issue. The Fox-Sky deal must be rigorously tested, and the Murdochs should be called to appear in front of MPs to make guarantees about the future of the brands they could control.</p> <h2>A short-term boost for US<br></h2> <p>In the weeks since the US presidential election, financial markets have had a change of heart about Donald Trump\u2019s victory over Hillary Clinton.</p> <p>The knee-jerk reaction when the result came in was to assume the worst. Trump\u2019s programme was sketchy but seemed worrisome. He was threatening to get tough with China. He talked about protectionism. He had made minatory noises about the Federal Reserve. Put simply, Trump meant uncertainty, so markets sold off.</p> <p>This mood did not last long. Wall Street bulls quickly discovered a silver lining: Trump\u2019s plan to cut taxes and increase spending on America\u2019s creaking infrastructure.</p> <p>Dealers in New York think looser fiscal policy means stronger US growth, which in turn will lead to higher profits for companies quoted on Wall Street. Hence the surge in the Dow towards the 20,000 mark.</p> <p>The upbeat mood was only briefly interrupted by the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/dec/14/us-federal-reserve-raises-interest-rates-second-time-since-2008\">Fed\u2019s interest-rate announcement last week</a>. Wall Street quickly shrugged off the quarter-point rise in borrowing costs and the indication that 2017 would see three further increases.</p> <p>There were two main reasons for this.

                "bodyText":"Has anyone in Downing Street actually realised that Rupert Murdoch\u2019s 21st Century Fox has lodged a bid for Sky? If you trawl through newspapers and the internet looking for comments from the government about the proposed \u00a311.7bn deal, you will not find much. Matt Hancock, the junior culture minister, appeared in the Commons to answer an urgent question from Labour on the matter early last week, and that was it. \u201cAny transaction will be looked at on its merits, on a case-by-case basis,\u201d he said. How insightful. Theresa May, Philip Hammond and Greg Clark, the business secretary, have been silent on the matter. Karen Bradley, Hancock\u2019s boss and the culture, media and sport secretary, was apparently unavailable to answer the urgent question in parliament. This all rather surprising when you consider that other investments in the UK from other overseas companies since the vote to leave the European Union have led to swift comments from the prime minister and chancellor praising their commitment to the country. The boss of Softbank, the Japanese company that bought technology group Arm for \u00a324bn, even posed for photos with Hammond outside 11 Downing Street. Now, the government\u2019s silence on this issue may be because Sky shareholders have yet to vote on the proposal, or because it wants to leave the matter to Ofcom and other regulators. Hancock told MPs that the government must be \u201cscrupulously fair and impartial\u201d and that Bradley\u2019s role is \u201ca quasi-judicial one and it\u2019s important she acts independently and is not subject to improper influence\u201d. But that hasn\u2019t stopped the government before. Softbank\u2019s trip to Whitehall came on the day its bid was revealed, before the shareholder vote and before any regulator had cast an eye over the transaction. Instead, the government\u2019s silence looks like an attempt to distance itself from the Sky deal and depoliticise it. May has not even made a clear, public pledge to properly analyse the transaction. In contrast, Gordon Brown, Vince Cable, Tom Watson and plenty of other politicians outside government have had lots to say about the proposal \u2013 mainly that May must ensure that Ofcom conducts a public-interest test on the deal, seriously consider whether the Murdochs are fit and proper people to control Sky and its news operations, or even simply block the proposal. The government\u2019s silence is further evidence that the deal could be railroaded through by 21st Century Fox and Sky before any opposition is allowed to build up a head of steam. Supporters of the takeover claim that much has changed since Murdoch last tried to buy Sky in 2011. His business has been split in two, with newspaper brands such as the Sun and the Times held within News Corp and the TV and film assets run through Fox. Also, Google and Facebook now dominate the digital advertising market, transforming the outlook for news and content providers. But both of these defences are easily dismantled. Firstly, splitting News Corp and Fox does not change the fact that one family could end up with extraordinary influence over British media. Take a look at the boards of News Corp and Fox \u2013 Rupert and Lachlan Murdoch are the co-chairs of both, while James Murdoch is chief executive of Fox, on the board of News Corp, and chair of Sky. Secondly, recent changes in the media industry simply reinforce the importance of the established news providers emphasising their independence, credibility and quality. If the public question the veracity of what they read in newspapers or see on TV news, then it simply pushes more people to Facebook, Google and fake news. The government must not sleepwalk its way through this issue. The Fox-Sky deal must be rigorously tested, and the Murdochs should be called to appear in front of MPs to make guarantees about the future of the brands they could control. A short-term boost for US In the weeks since the US presidential election, financial markets have had a change of heart about Donald Trump\u2019s victory over Hillary Clinton. The knee-jerk reaction when the result came in was to assume the worst. Trump\u2019s programme was sketchy but seemed worrisome. He was threatening to get tough with China. He talked about protectionism. He had made minatory noises about the Federal Reserve. Put simply, Trump meant uncertainty, so markets sold off. This mood did not last long. Wall Street bulls quickly discovered a silver lining: Trump\u2019s plan to cut taxes and increase spending on America\u2019s creaking infrastructure. Dealers in New York think looser fiscal policy means stronger US growth, which in turn will lead to higher profits for companies quoted on Wall Street. Hence the surge in the Dow towards the 20,000 mark. The upbeat mood was only briefly interrupted by the Fed\u2019s interest-rate announcement last week. Wall Street quickly shrugged off the quarter-point rise in borrowing costs and the indication that 2017 would see three further increases. There were two main reasons for this. First, recent form suggests the Fed might not go ahead with next year\u2019s monetary tightening. When it raised rates a year ago, it hinted at four increases in 2016. Only one was actually delivered: the one last week. Second, Wall Street thinks that even if the Fed does go ahead, the economic impact will be modest. In the short term, at least, both assumptions seem reasonable. The Fed is certainly not trigger-happy when it comes to rates and Trump\u2019s fiscal policy should guarantee growth next year. But investors need to be wary. Most of the fiscal boost is going to come through tax cuts, which will inject both demand and inflation into an economy already running up against capacity constraints. At some point in 2017 the Fed will adopt a more aggressive stance. Shares will suffer as the economy slows down. Tech v Trump? Could be interesting Rarely can so much wealth and power have gathered around one table. In a meeting at Trump Tower last week the president-elect of the United States, Donald Trump, held talks with a group of technology bosses that included Tim Cook of Apple, Jeff Bezos of Amazon, Sheryl Sandberg of Facebook, Larry Page and Eric Schmidt of Google\u2019s owner Alphabet, and Elon Musk of Tesla. The executives left claiming it had gone well: Bezos even said he was \u201csuper-excited\u201d about the prospect of working with an \u201cinnovation administration\u201d. But photos of the meeting show a different story. Bezos looked grim, even frightened at times. This is hardly surprising. Trump waged a war of words with Bezos throughout the election, pledging to cause \u201cproblems\u201d for Amazon. He has also criticised Apple for its factories in China.

                "bodyText":"An influential committee of MPs is poised to launch an investigation into Britain\u2019s \u00a31bn online shopping VAT fraud crisis after sellers on Amazon and eBay evaded hundreds of millions of pounds in tax in the run-up to Christmas. Conservative MP Richard Bacon, who sits on the public accounts committee, said: \u201cI think this is absolutely an issue we need to look at. \u201cWe\u2019ve already been discussing VAT fraud in online retailing informally and I expect that it is something the committee will want to turn to.\u201d The National Audit Office could also be asked to examine the subject, and how well it has been addressed by HM Revenue &amp; Customs. In recent years, overseas sellers, particularly from China, have come to dominate many popular goods categories on eBay and Amazon, illegally selling goods without VAT. As a result, many small British businesses have been left unable to compete. Parliament\u2019s public accounts committee has previously played a central role in shining a spotlight on other tax scandals involving the likes of Starbucks, Google and Amazon. Its work has helped trigger international tax reforms as well as generating important evidence for European commission inquiries into alleged sweetheart tax deals for multinational corporations. Now the MPs are expected to turn their attention to the issue of overseas traders committing VAT fraud on an industrial scale through well-known online shopping sites \u2013 a scandal first highlighted by a Guardian investigation last year. HMRC has since admitted VAT evasion in online shopping had become a \u201cvery big issue\u201d, estimating it cost up to \u00a31.5bn a year in lost tax. But officials have been frustrated by what is seen as the uncooperative approach taken by some big websites, including Amazon. In January, Lin Homer, then head of HMRC, told a parliamentary committee: \u201cWe do feel, just as with beer and alcohol, that those people who manage the supply chain should ensure enough diligence is built into it. Marketplace providers [such as Amazon and eBay] have responsibilities.\u201d Two months later, the Treasury announced new powers for HMRC to make large marketplace websites liable \u2013 in some circumstances \u2013 for VAT revenues lost to fraudulent overseas sellers. News of a likely parliamentary inquiry came as the Treasury minister Jane Ellison claimed HRMC\u2019s new measures, which came into force in September, were already proving successful. Latest figures show 7,185 overseas sellers have come forward to register for VAT since January, compared with just 695 in 2015 \u2013 a rush, she said, in anticipation of tough action from HMRC. But Ellison\u2019s claim that HMRC was now tackling online VAT fraud \u201cin time for Christmas\u201d was greeted with scepticism by Bacon and tax fairness campaigners. \u201cI think it\u2019s a bit early to declare HMRC\u2019s actions an unbridled success,\u201d said Bacon, who added the public accounts committee would want to scrutinise such claims closely. Last month, a second Guardian investigation showed widespread evidence of ongoing VAT fraud by sellers on Amazon and eBay \u2013 despite the HMRC\u2019s new powers. HMRC insists action is being taken. \u201cWe are already using new powers granted from September to directly tackle these overseas businesses,\u201d it said. Meanwhile, Amazon and eBay have repeatedly said they cooperate with HMRC where required, but that they are not responsible for policing the VAT compliance of independent sellers. A spokesman for Ellison would not comment on whether HMRC had recovered back taxes and penalties from the influx of overseas traders now belatedly registering for VAT. A spokesperson for campaign group VATfraud.org said: \u201cIt\u2019s all well and good HMRC handed out 7,185 VAT numbers to internet retailers in the last year; it just proves this fraud is enormous. \u201cWhat HMRC failed to say is how much undeclared VAT they have recovered from these retailers. We want to know if HMRC is simply giving out VAT numbers without any due diligence or investigation into these retailers\u2019 online trading history.\u201d",

                "body":"<p>When Mike Coupe <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/jul/09/justin-king-leaves-sainsburys\">took over from his showier former boss Justin King as Sainsbury\u2019s chief executive in 2014</a>, just as the group\u2019s nine year-long stretch of sales growth was coming to an end, many industry observers believed he had been handed one of the biggest turkeys in the business.</p> <p>The rise of discounters Aldi and Lidl forced all of the big four grocers, including Sainsbury\u2019s, to slash profits to fund price cuts just as they had to close stores which were surplus to requirements thanks to the rise of online shopping. </p> <p>However, two-and-a-half years on, despite a slight drift down in market share, Sainsbury\u2019s has more or less held its own helping it to steal back its position as the UK\u2019s second largest grocer from a shrinking Asda. Coupe reckons it is now the discounters on the back foot. \u201cThey are under pressure and it\u2019s more challenging for them,\u201d Coupe says.</p> <p>He says the major chains have all narrowed the price gap with Aldi and Lidl in the past year and, even where the gap hasn\u2019t closed, the discounters have been forced to compress their already slim profit margins to maintain their price lead. </p> <p>Sainsbury\u2019s has already spent more than \u00a3150m on cutting prices in the past two years. </p> <p>The Christmas meal has proved a significant battleground: last year, Tesco stole a march on the discounters with cheap seasonal veg and this year Sainsbury\u2019s claims it has the cheapest turkeys on the market at \u00a33.50 a kg.</p> <p>Sainsbury\u2019s is also investing in developing product areas where it believes it can differentiate itself from the discounters such as ready meals, prepared fruit or the fast growing gluten and dairy free foods. </p> <p>It has already revamped 3,000 food products, a move which it also hopes will help it fight back against the expansion of Waitrose and Marks &amp; Spencer, which has impinged on Sainsbury\u2019s comfortable position as the handiest place to buy quality food. This year, 25% of its Christmas products are new and hundreds more items will be revamped next year.</p> <p>Sainsbury\u2019s has already spent \u00a360m on improving the quality of its products including \u00a39m on its takeaway food ranges. Introducing options such as porridge and cold pressed juices and improving basics by, for example, using tomatoes that will not make its sandwiches soggy, has helped to boost sales.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/dec/2016-12-21T16:51:04/embed.html\" data-alt=\"Graph\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/dec/2016-12-21T16:51:04/embed.html\">Graph</a> </figure>  <p>Coupe says the strategy is working but it\u2019s still tough. \u201cWe have seen a significant refocusing of the mainstream supermarkets on the discounters and that\u2019s undoubtedly dampened their growth. But they are still growing because they are opening lots of shops and the threat isn\u2019t going to go away,\u201d he says.</p> <p>Some argue that, given the tough environment, Coupe should be focusing on the food business, but he believes the future is in branching out.<br></p> <p>Coupe, who after stints at nearly every major grocer was seen as a safe pair of hands after the showmanship of King, has proved to be even more ambitious and bold than his predecessor. </p> <p>Always more interested in online retailing than King, Coupe has invested<a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jul/22/sainsburys-gets-all-clear-to-buy-argos\"> \u00a31.4bn in buying Argos</a>, the catalogue shop which makes half of its sales online and specialises in high speed deliveries.</p> <p>\u201cI believe there is a significant opportunity in clothing and general merchandise. That market is unconsolidated and where we have relatively small market share and an opportunity for financial services,\u201d he says.</p> <p>Coupe\u2019s strategy hinges on the three divisions of Sainsbury\u2019s \u2013 its supermarkets, bank and Argos, all cross selling their goods and services to each other\u2019s client base while reducing central costs. <br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s the three businesses together that gives the group more flexibility, more resources and more ability to compete,\u201d he says.</p> <p>After an \u201coperationally successful\u201d Black Friday last month, the biggest sales day of the year for Argos, Coupe says he is more confident than ever about the buyout.</p> <p>About 250 Argos outlets will open in Sainsbury\u2019s supermarkets as part of an aim to build destination stores where, along with coffee shops, clothing areas, groceries and other services, they will tempt shoppers away from their computers. The Sainsbury\u2019s Argos stores will be cheaper to operate than those on the high street where analysts believe at least 100 will close. </p> <p>A planned \u00a3160m of synergies from the merger will feed through to the group\u2019s bottom line as promised to the City but Coupe hints there are likely to be further financial benefits to play with.<br></p> <p>\u201cIf we can generate benefits above \u00a3160m, Sainsbury\u2019s and Argos have options on what we do with that and one of those is price and another is quality or more profitability.

                "bodyText":"When Mike Coupe took over from his showier former boss Justin King as Sainsbury\u2019s chief executive in 2014, just as the group\u2019s nine year-long stretch of sales growth was coming to an end, many industry observers believed he had been handed one of the biggest turkeys in the business. The rise of discounters Aldi and Lidl forced all of the big four grocers, including Sainsbury\u2019s, to slash profits to fund price cuts just as they had to close stores which were surplus to requirements thanks to the rise of online shopping. However, two-and-a-half years on, despite a slight drift down in market share, Sainsbury\u2019s has more or less held its own helping it to steal back its position as the UK\u2019s second largest grocer from a shrinking Asda. Coupe reckons it is now the discounters on the back foot. \u201cThey are under pressure and it\u2019s more challenging for them,\u201d Coupe says. He says the major chains have all narrowed the price gap with Aldi and Lidl in the past year and, even where the gap hasn\u2019t closed, the discounters have been forced to compress their already slim profit margins to maintain their price lead. Sainsbury\u2019s has already spent more than \u00a3150m on cutting prices in the past two years. The Christmas meal has proved a significant battleground: last year, Tesco stole a march on the discounters with cheap seasonal veg and this year Sainsbury\u2019s claims it has the cheapest turkeys on the market at \u00a33.50 a kg. Sainsbury\u2019s is also investing in developing product areas where it believes it can differentiate itself from the discounters such as ready meals, prepared fruit or the fast growing gluten and dairy free foods. It has already revamped 3,000 food products, a move which it also hopes will help it fight back against the expansion of Waitrose and Marks &amp; Spencer, which has impinged on Sainsbury\u2019s comfortable position as the handiest place to buy quality food. This year, 25% of its Christmas products are new and hundreds more items will be revamped next year. Sainsbury\u2019s has already spent \u00a360m on improving the quality of its products including \u00a39m on its takeaway food ranges. Introducing options such as porridge and cold pressed juices and improving basics by, for example, using tomatoes that will not make its sandwiches soggy, has helped to boost sales. Coupe says the strategy is working but it\u2019s still tough. \u201cWe have seen a significant refocusing of the mainstream supermarkets on the discounters and that\u2019s undoubtedly dampened their growth. But they are still growing because they are opening lots of shops and the threat isn\u2019t going to go away,\u201d he says. Some argue that, given the tough environment, Coupe should be focusing on the food business, but he believes the future is in branching out. Coupe, who after stints at nearly every major grocer was seen as a safe pair of hands after the showmanship of King, has proved to be even more ambitious and bold than his predecessor. Always more interested in online retailing than King, Coupe has invested \u00a31.4bn in buying Argos, the catalogue shop which makes half of its sales online and specialises in high speed deliveries. \u201cI believe there is a significant opportunity in clothing and general merchandise. That market is unconsolidated and where we have relatively small market share and an opportunity for financial services,\u201d he says. Coupe\u2019s strategy hinges on the three divisions of Sainsbury\u2019s \u2013 its supermarkets, bank and Argos, all cross selling their goods and services to each other\u2019s client base while reducing central costs. \u201cIt\u2019s the three businesses together that gives the group more flexibility, more resources and more ability to compete,\u201d he says. After an \u201coperationally successful\u201d Black Friday last month, the biggest sales day of the year for Argos, Coupe says he is more confident than ever about the buyout. About 250 Argos outlets will open in Sainsbury\u2019s supermarkets as part of an aim to build destination stores where, along with coffee shops, clothing areas, groceries and other services, they will tempt shoppers away from their computers. The Sainsbury\u2019s Argos stores will be cheaper to operate than those on the high street where analysts believe at least 100 will close. A planned \u00a3160m of synergies from the merger will feed through to the group\u2019s bottom line as promised to the City but Coupe hints there are likely to be further financial benefits to play with. \u201cIf we can generate benefits above \u00a3160m, Sainsbury\u2019s and Argos have options on what we do with that and one of those is price and another is quality or more profitability. All of those are possible and the key thing is to have the options.\u201d Coupe has promised that the combined business will grow its profit margins from 2.5% to as much as 3.5% over the next few years, clawing back the margin lost during the rise of the discounters. But some analysts argue that the Argos acquisition has only exposed Sainsbury\u2019s to more risk and inflationary cost pressures. It sources more goods, such as electrical appliances, priced in dollars from the far east \u2013 which could only increase the pain from potential cost increases caused by the 15% fall in the value of the pound since the Brexit vote. However, Coupe says the bigger group will be more capable of withstanding competitive pressures. It is not just about saving money. In the 10 Sainsbury\u2019s stores where Argos has already opened outlets, grocery sales have been boosted by 1% to 2% while sales the catalogue outlets are seeing growth of more than 20% a year after they opened. Part of the logic for the buyout of Argos is to access its quick delivery service which Sainsbury\u2019s hopes to capitalise on to sell more of its clothing and homewares and, perhaps one day, groceries. Coupe says the tie-up with Argos makes Sainsbury\u2019s better equipped for the future with the likes of Amazon ploughing into the UK grocery market and online food shopping expected to rise 68% over the next five years, according to the IGD industry body. The smartphone has swiftly become the preferred tool for internet shoppers and Coupe says he expects the pace of change to be even more rapid over the next five years as new technologies and ways of shopping emerge. \u201cThe building blocks are in place. Our job is to make stuff happen as we said it would.\u201d \u2022 This article was amended on 22 December 2016 to correct the price of Sainsbury\u2019s turkeys.",

Smaller services such as Deezer and Tidal have a few million between them.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>However, the music industry, which has fretted that each shift in music format since 1995, from MP3 piracy to downloads to streaming, is driving down revenues, is now so worried about the effect of YouTube on streaming revenues that the US labels tried to push streaming payments on to the agenda of Donald <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/dec/14/donald-trump-google-facebook-amazon-microsoft\">Trump\u2019s \u201ctech summit\u201d in mid-December</a>, when representatives of Apple, Google, Microsoft and others met the US president-elect.</p> <p>What the RIAA, which represents US labels, was complaining about is known in the industry as the \u201cvalue gap\u201d \u2013 the difference in effective per-play payments between audio services such as Spotify, and YouTube. </p> <p>YouTube, though, remains the world\u2019s biggest venue for music streaming, with millions of videos that can be combined into playlists. Hook your phone or computer up to a speaker, and it\u2019s just like Spotify: you\u2019ll get the music, and the audio from any video ads, and then can pick and choose from a huge catalogue.</p> <p>Though the latest figures only cover the first half of 2015, the monitoring service Nielsen reckons that YouTube delivered 60% more music streams than all the on-demand music streaming services combined \u2013 and that the gap had grown since the same period in 2014. The arrival of Apple Music in June 2015 might shift that, but it\u2019s unlikely.</p> <p>What riles the music business is that the amount that YouTube pays it per track played works out as substantially less than Spotify or Apple Music. </p> <p>Whereas the latter two services have complex agreements with the record labels setting a per-play fee, YouTube pays out a share of the ad revenue that any track identified as belonging to a company earns. That tends to be lower than a per-track fee, because advertising prices and value varies enormously. Mulligan says: \u201cVideo consumption went through the roof in 2015, but there weren\u2019t enough ads to put against it \u2013 so the ad revenues paid grew more slowly than consumption.\u201d</p> <p>Hence the RIAA\u2019s push to get streaming payments on to Trump\u2019s mind at the tech summit. It\u2019s unclear whether it succeeded.</p> <p>YouTube says the ad-funded model has transformed the music video from a costly promotional tool into a new source of revenue. \u201cIn the last 12 months, we\u2019ve paid out $1bn to the music industry in ad revenues alone, and are working collaboratively with them to bring more money to artists,\u201d it says. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6f3dd3bdd90f9357e9ba57a3080099ec6f7d5baa\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6f3dd3bdd90f9357e9ba57a3080099ec6f7d5baa/15_200_5142_3086/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Vinyls are back in vogue\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Vinyls are back in vogue</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Michael Bowles/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This doesn\u2019t sit comfortably with the music industry. David Price, director of insight at the IFPI, the global trade body for the recording industry, says: \u201cWe don\u2019t believe YouTube is properly rewarding artists for the huge consumption that\u2019s going on there. But in the last year we have seen the EU take positive steps towards creating a better and fairer licensing environment in Europe.\u201d The BPI, the UK music industry\u2019s trade body, complained in May that artists earn less from YouTube than they do from vinyl.</p> <p>But in the long run, streaming is the only game in town \u2013 along, perhaps, with the CD and vinyl. The download once looked like the future; now, the question is how much more of a future it has. </p>",

What the RIAA, which represents US labels, was complaining about is known in the industry as the \u201cvalue gap\u201d \u2013 the difference in effective per-play payments between audio services such as Spotify, and YouTube. YouTube, though, remains the world\u2019s biggest venue for music streaming, with millions of videos that can be combined into playlists. Hook your phone or computer up to a speaker, and it\u2019s just like Spotify: you\u2019ll get the music, and the audio from any video ads, and then can pick and choose from a huge catalogue. Though the latest figures only cover the first half of 2015, the monitoring service Nielsen reckons that YouTube delivered 60% more music streams than all the on-demand music streaming services combined \u2013 and that the gap had grown since the same period in 2014. The arrival of Apple Music in June 2015 might shift that, but it\u2019s unlikely. What riles the music business is that the amount that YouTube pays it per track played works out as substantially less than Spotify or Apple Music. Whereas the latter two services have complex agreements with the record labels setting a per-play fee, YouTube pays out a share of the ad revenue that any track identified as belonging to a company earns. That tends to be lower than a per-track fee, because advertising prices and value varies enormously. Mulligan says: \u201cVideo consumption went through the roof in 2015, but there weren\u2019t enough ads to put against it \u2013 so the ad revenues paid grew more slowly than consumption.\u201d Hence the RIAA\u2019s push to get streaming payments on to Trump\u2019s mind at the tech summit. It\u2019s unclear whether it succeeded. YouTube says the ad-funded model has transformed the music video from a costly promotional tool into a new source of revenue. \u201cIn the last 12 months, we\u2019ve paid out $1bn to the music industry in ad revenues alone, and are working collaboratively with them to bring more money to artists,\u201d it says. This doesn\u2019t sit comfortably with the music industry. David Price, director of insight at the IFPI, the global trade body for the recording industry, says: \u201cWe don\u2019t believe YouTube is properly rewarding artists for the huge consumption that\u2019s going on there. But in the last year we have seen the EU take positive steps towards creating a better and fairer licensing environment in Europe.\u201d The BPI, the UK music industry\u2019s trade body, complained in May that artists earn less from YouTube than they do from vinyl. But in the long run, streaming is the only game in town \u2013 along, perhaps, with the CD and vinyl. The download once looked like the future; now, the question is how much more of a future it has.",
