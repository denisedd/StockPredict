The shares \u2013 down 85% this year \u2013 slumped by 7.5%. MPS is under instruction from the European Central Bank to bolster its finances after it was the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jul/29/rescue-package-in-place-as-europes-oldest-bank-fails-stress-tests\">weakest of 51 European banks subjected to stress tests</a>.</p> <p>The inability to convince Qatar to put in up to \u20ac1bn is expected to lead the bank\u2019s board to concede it would not be able to secure a solution to its capital gap without the Italian government. This means <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/italy\">Italy</a> would have to impose losses on bondholders before it could stump up cash because of new EU rules intended to stop taxpayers having to pick up the bill for bank losses.</p> <p>However, about \u20ac2bn of the bonds are held by private investors and there are expectations that an arrangement would be put in place to limit their losses.</p> <p>The Italian cabinet is expected to convene on Thursday to discuss its options for protecting retail investors and to try to limit its eventual stake in the bank to below 50%.</p> <p>The bailout is not just a financial issue. It is also expected to have political consequences for Italy\u2019s controlling Democratic party and Matteo Renzi, the former prime minister who <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/dec/11/italy-paolo-gentiloni-to-succeed-matteo-renzi-as-prime-minister\">stepped down from office earlier this month</a> after he was roundly defeated in the 4 December referendum. Paolo Gentiloni has taken over as prime minister for now, but Renzi is expected to run for election again as early as next year.</p> <p>Wolfango Piccoli, an analyst with Teneo Intelligence, said a government rescue might not be immediately damaging politically, in large part because public attention will be diverted from the issue during the Christmas period. But the issue could become \u201cpolitically toxic\u201d later, once it becomes clear how many of the bank\u2019s junior bondholders are eventually compensated for their losses, and how long it takes for them to be paid....<br></p> <p> Piccoli said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\u201cIn terms of the junior bondholders, let\u2019s see what happens. it will eventually be decided by Brussels,\u201d</p> </blockquote> <p>Once MPS is saved, a number of other banks could also require government support, keeping the issue in the news for the foreseeable future.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\u201cThis will drag on for some time. If we have elections in May or June, it will be used then [against Renzi\u2019s Democratic party], and there is no way to deflect that.\u201d</p> </blockquote> <p>Here\u2019s their full story:<br></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/dec/22/italy-bail-out-monte-dei-paschi-di-siena-rescue-matteo-renzi\">Italy poised to bail out Monte dei Paschi di Siena as rescue deal fails</a> </p> </aside> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-585c188de4b0966513aecc7c\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-12-22T18:20:26.356Z\">6.20pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">MPS shares hit new record low</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Shares on Monte dei Paschi (MPS) have slumped to a new all-time low tonight, as investors anticipate a state bailout for the bank.</strong></p> <p>After another volatile day, they closed down 7.5% at \u20ac15.08 - around 99.85% lower than in early 2007.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"380ac4c2a9d5fc9b39e21965a8802c8f57ac77c8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/380ac4c2a9d5fc9b39e21965a8802c8f57ac77c8/0_0_950_401/500.jpg\" alt=\"Monte dei Paschi shares over the last 20 years\" width=\"500\" height=\"211\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Monte dei Paschi shares since it listed in 1999.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Thomson Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>MPS\u2019s apparent failure to raise \u20ac5bn in new capital means investors now expect the Italian government to step in; a move which could end up with it owning a large stake in the bank.</p> <p><strong>Paresh Davdra, CEO and Co-Founder of RationalFX</strong>, says:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The failure of MPS to secure \u20ac5bn from an anchor investor will have far ranging implications, as the Italian government prepares for a \u20ac20bn bailout.</p> <p>With the Italian banking sector in an incredibly fragile state and the ongoing Deutsche Bank situation creating uncertainty in Europe\u2019s banking system as a whole, an unsuccessful rescue effort could destabilise the Eurozone.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-12-22T19:02:24.860Z\">at 7.02pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-585c0e14e4b06265ff0d5ccc\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-12-22T17:32:27.680Z\">5.32pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fb84811325588189ba5b21fa2d24bb74ca5a3c7d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fb84811325588189ba5b21fa2d24bb74ca5a3c7d/0_0_3661_2183/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A man passes by a stock exchange data monitor in Milan, Italy, Thursday, Dec. 22, 2016., as Italian bank Monte dei Paschi di Siena edged closer to a state bailout.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"596\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A man passes by a stock exchange data monitor in Milan, Italy, today as Monte dei Paschi di Siena edged closer to a state bailout.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Luca Bruno/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-585c04cbe4b0d460757eb95b\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-12-22T17:13:33.311Z\">5.13pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Will Italian cabinet meet tonight?</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>So, what happens next with Monte dei Paschi?<br></strong></p> <p>We\u2019re basically waiting for the bank\u2019s board to conclude their meeting, and submit their request for state aid (having failed to raise the necessary \u20ac5bn from private investors to strengthen their balance sheet).</p> <p>Then the ball is in new prime minister Paolo Gentiloni\u2019s court; will his cabinet meet this evening, or push the decision back to Friday?</p> <p>Reuters reckons it could go either way.

With Qatar\u2019s sovereign wealth fund pulling out from the \u20ac5bn cash call, the bank now needs a state bailout to stay afloat. Under the current scenario of low interest rates, massive fines and negligible earnings, the reluctance of the private investors to take on such weak structures is understandable. The Italian parliament has vowed to inject more than \u20ac20bn into the bank, in order to prevent a collapse which would have far reaching consequences. If the bank fails, there are strong fears that its collapse could pull down much of the country\u2019s bad debt ridden banking sector with it.</p> <p>The bank had been named as the weakest lender in Europe because of billions of euros of risky loans, failing the EU stress test in July this year. Given this, the Italian government\u2019s efforts cannot end with simple state support, but rather large-scale banking reforms and stringent policy measures are needed. Unless this is achieved a banking crisis looks almost inevitable. This is not just a threat to Italy, but for the larger Eurozone, the euro and the region\u2019s political future.\u201d</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-585bbf20e4b0966513aeca64\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-12-22T12:12:22.436Z\">12.12pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Weak pound prompts Tesla to hike prices in UK</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"2c5d25aa5cef280c17e2d935f39d8842f8768bdd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2c5d25aa5cef280c17e2d935f39d8842f8768bdd/232_187_3558_2135/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A Tesla Model S electric car.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p><strong>Electric carmaker Tesla has become the latest firm to raise the cost of its products in the UK, in response to the pound\u2019s decline this year.</strong></p> <p>The company told some UK showrooms that prices will go up at the start of next month.</p> <p>In an email, Tesla said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We have just received some information that we need to share with you \u2013 due to currency fluctuations we will be increasing our UK prices for custom orders by 5% on 1 January 2017.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cPrices on showroom and pre-owned cars will remain fixed at current prices.\u201d</p> </blockquote> <p>More here:</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/dec/22/tesla-uk-prices-new-year-currency-brexit-vote\">Tesla to hike UK prices by 5% in the new year</a> </p> </aside> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-585bb0f1e4b0d460757eb76c\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-12-22T11:05:33.260Z\">11.05am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>The fog has now lifted in London, but there\u2019s little else to report from the City. </strong></p> <p>After three hours of trading, Europe\u2019s financial markets still seem becalmed, as people wait for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2016/dec/22/italys-monte-dei-paschi-bailout-rescue-bid-business-live?page=with:block-585b7be6e4b06265ff0d5a1b#block-585b7be6e4b06265ff0d5a1b\">Monte dei Paschi\u2019s cash call to formally end after lunchtime</a> (2pm in Italy, or 1pm GMT).<br></p> <p>Some investors are hopeful that the saga will soon end.

                "bodyText":"All has gone quiet in Italy, so I\u2019m going to pause this liveblog - but I\u2019ll try to pop back if anything dramatic happens. Otherwise, keep an eye on the Guardian Business page for fresh developments. Here\u2019s the situation right now, by my colleagues Jill Treanor and Stephanie Kirchgaessner (out in Rome): The Italian government is braced to bail out the world\u2019s oldest bank, Monte dei Paschi di Siena (MPS), which is expected to reveal it has failed to win support from private investors for a \u20ac5bn (\u00a34.2bn) rescue package. The board of Italy\u2019s third largest bank was meeting on Thursday after it failed to secure an anchor investor \u2013 thought to be the Qatar sovereign wealth fund \u2013 to support its fundraising effort. Shares in the bank were volatile, lifting off record lows but then falling back in confusion about the next steps. The shares \u2013 down 85% this year \u2013 slumped by 7.5%. MPS is under instruction from the European Central Bank to bolster its finances after it was the weakest of 51 European banks subjected to stress tests. The inability to convince Qatar to put in up to \u20ac1bn is expected to lead the bank\u2019s board to concede it would not be able to secure a solution to its capital gap without the Italian government. This means Italy would have to impose losses on bondholders before it could stump up cash because of new EU rules intended to stop taxpayers having to pick up the bill for bank losses. However, about \u20ac2bn of the bonds are held by private investors and there are expectations that an arrangement would be put in place to limit their losses. The Italian cabinet is expected to convene on Thursday to discuss its options for protecting retail investors and to try to limit its eventual stake in the bank to below 50%. The bailout is not just a financial issue. It is also expected to have political consequences for Italy\u2019s controlling Democratic party and Matteo Renzi, the former prime minister who stepped down from office earlier this month after he was roundly defeated in the 4 December referendum. Paolo Gentiloni has taken over as prime minister for now, but Renzi is expected to run for election again as early as next year. Wolfango Piccoli, an analyst with Teneo Intelligence, said a government rescue might not be immediately damaging politically, in large part because public attention will be diverted from the issue during the Christmas period. But the issue could become \u201cpolitically toxic\u201d later, once it becomes clear how many of the bank\u2019s junior bondholders are eventually compensated for their losses, and how long it takes for them to be paid.... Piccoli said: \u201cIn terms of the junior bondholders, let\u2019s see what happens. it will eventually be decided by Brussels,\u201d Once MPS is saved, a number of other banks could also require government support, keeping the issue in the news for the foreseeable future. \u201cThis will drag on for some time. If we have elections in May or June, it will be used then [against Renzi\u2019s Democratic party], and there is no way to deflect that.\u201d Here\u2019s their full story: Shares on Monte dei Paschi (MPS) have slumped to a new all-time low tonight, as investors anticipate a state bailout for the bank. After another volatile day, they closed down 7.5% at \u20ac15.08 - around 99.85% lower than in early 2007. MPS\u2019s apparent failure to raise \u20ac5bn in new capital means investors now expect the Italian government to step in; a move which could end up with it owning a large stake in the bank. Paresh Davdra, CEO and Co-Founder of RationalFX, says: The failure of MPS to secure \u20ac5bn from an anchor investor will have far ranging implications, as the Italian government prepares for a \u20ac20bn bailout. With the Italian banking sector in an incredibly fragile state and the ongoing Deutsche Bank situation creating uncertainty in Europe\u2019s banking system as a whole, an unsuccessful rescue effort could destabilise the Eurozone. So, what happens next with Monte dei Paschi? We\u2019re basically waiting for the bank\u2019s board to conclude their meeting, and submit their request for state aid (having failed to raise the necessary \u20ac5bn from private investors to strengthen their balance sheet). Then the ball is in new prime minister Paolo Gentiloni\u2019s court; will his cabinet meet this evening, or push the decision back to Friday? Reuters reckons it could go either way. Here\u2019s their latest report: Italy\u2019s government will meet late Thursday or early Friday before European markets open to discuss an emergency decree to bail out troubled bank Monte dei Paschi di Siena, sources familiar with the matter told Reuters. The salvage of Monte dei Paschi would be part of a \u20ac20bn safety net that Prime Minister Paolo Gentiloni plans to set up beneath the banking industry. Gentiloni said on Thursday the cabinet would meet on Friday to discuss measures to help Italy\u2019s under-developed southern regions. He did not mention the banking decree, leaving open the door on a late-night meeting on Thursday. European stock markets have closed for the night, after a fairly dull day dominated by worries over Monte dei Paschi. London\u2019s FTSE 100 gained 22 points, or 0.3%, to 7063, led by precious metals producers and defensive stocks including ITV, Whitbread and Tui Travel. Mining stocks, and banks, led the fallers. Across Europe, Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB weakened by 0.5% as investors braced for the country\u2019s biggest banking bailout in many years, while the German DAX lost 0.2% and the French CAC closed flat. Meanwhile on Wall Street, the Dow Jones has slipped a little deeper into the red, and a little further from the 20,000 point milestone. Robert O\u2019Daly of The Economist Intelligence Unit agrees that Monte dei Paschi is heading for a state rescue, now that its attempt to raise \u20ac5bn from private investors has faltered. He also predicts that populist parties could get an electoral boost, if more banks require government help. O\u2019Daly writes: We expect the state to approve the MPS board\u2019s request to inject capital. This will require a bail-in of junior bondholders, though the state may move to compensate retail bondholders. The government is putting in place a \u20ac20bn fund to shore up MPS and other weak banks. More broadly, we believe that addressing Italy\u2019s banking woes would be manageable from an economic standpoint, as market estimates place the costs of cleaning up the banks\u2019 bad loans at 2.5% of GDP or less. If mishandled, MPS\u2019s recapitalisation and future efforts to address other problematic banks could further inflate populist rhetoric at Italy\u2019s next national election campaign, following the boon for anti-establishment parties provided by the resounding \u201cno\u201d vote at the referendum. Over in New York, the US stock market has opened with barely a grunt. The Dow Jones industrial average has dipped by 8 points in muted trading, to 19,933. That takes it away from its record highs, and further way from the much-obsessed about 20,000 mark. Back to Monte dei Paschi.... and the Financial Times also reckons that the bank\u2019s board will meet later today to discuss their next move,. With MPS\u2019s capital raising push now over, the FT says: According to people close to the matter, the Italian cabinet will meet to approve the bailout of MPS late on Thursday or early on Friday, after the MPS board has requested help. The MPS board was not expected to make any statement until after the end of trading on Thursday, those people said. The FT also reports that Rome\u2019s government will try to protect small bondholders, if there is a bailout: Due to EU rules designed to limit the hit to taxpayers, the government rescue will impose losses on MPS shareholders and junior bondholders, making them share some of the financial burden. Italian officials said that they would move to compensate some of the 40,000 MPS retail bondholders who might take a hit, though institutional investors would not be spared. \u201cThe scheme is ready\u201d, said one senior Italian official. \u201cThe burden-sharing principle will be respected but we will try to limit the damage to savers as much as possible. Breaking news from America: the world\u2019s largest economy grew even faster than previously thought in the third quarter of 2016. US GDP expanded by an annual rate of 3.5% in the July-to-September period, up from a previous estimate of 3.2%. That\u2019s the equivalent of a quarterly growth rate of around 0.85% -- much faster than Britain\u2019s 0.5% growth in the same period. This shows that America\u2019s economy is growing at the fastest pace in two years, driven by a 3% rise in consumer spending, a 10% jump in exports, and a rise in companies restocking their inventories: There\u2019s a flurry of other economic data flashing across my terminal too, including the news that New orders for US-made capital goods (heavy-duty machinery, electronics) jumped by 0.9% last month (excluding aircraft sales). The number of new claims for unemployment benefit hit a six-month high of 275,000 last week. The clocks in Siena have chimed two o\u2019clock, which means that Monte dei Paschi\u2019s attempt to raise \u20ac5bn from private investors has officially ended. Unless something remarkable happened in the last few hours, MPS will have failed to hit its target. As we flagged up this morning, MPS had only managed to raise \u20ac2bn, once the Qatar sovereign wealth fund declined to back the plan last night. One insider tells us that the Monte dei Paschi board will now meet to plan their next move. They could decide to ask Italy\u2019s government for assistance tonight, to help the bank reach its \u20ac5bn target. Any rescue plan could also force losses on investors who hold MPS bonds; under European banking rules, these bondholders must be \u2018bailed in\u2019, before the state can help. But the Italian government will be keen to avoid penalising the retail investors (individuals, families, small businesses...) who hold debt issued by the world\u2019s oldest bank..... So they could look to find a way of compensating them (one theory is that anyone holding less than \u20ac100,000 of bonds is protected, as with retail savings accounts). Monte dei Paschi isn\u2019t the only Italian bank in a fix. Economists estimate that Italy\u2019s banking sector needs more than \u20ac50bn in fresh capital, to help it tackle its bad debts. Unicredit, the country\u2019s largest bank, got the ball rolling with a \u20ac13bn cash call last week, but many other lenders have not yet acted. This chart from Bloomberg shows how the \u20ac20bn set aside by the Italian government this week might not be enough: Mihir Kapadia, CEO and Founder of Sun Global Investments, argues that the sector needs deep-rooted reforms, as well as fresh capital. He writes: \u201cShares of Monte dei Paschi di Siena have fallen further as efforts to raise private capital failed at the eleventh hour. With Qatar\u2019s sovereign wealth fund pulling out from the \u20ac5bn cash call, the bank now needs a state bailout to stay afloat. Under the current scenario of low interest rates, massive fines and negligible earnings, the reluctance of the private investors to take on such weak structures is understandable. The Italian parliament has vowed to inject more than \u20ac20bn into the bank, in order to prevent a collapse which would have far reaching consequences. If the bank fails, there are strong fears that its collapse could pull down much of the country\u2019s bad debt ridden banking sector with it. The bank had been named as the weakest lender in Europe because of billions of euros of risky loans, failing the EU stress test in July this year. Given this, the Italian government\u2019s efforts cannot end with simple state support, but rather large-scale banking reforms and stringent policy measures are needed. Unless this is achieved a banking crisis looks almost inevitable. This is not just a threat to Italy, but for the larger Eurozone, the euro and the region\u2019s political future.\u201d Electric carmaker Tesla has become the latest firm to raise the cost of its products in the UK, in response to the pound\u2019s decline this year. The company told some UK showrooms that prices will go up at the start of next month. In an email, Tesla said: We have just received some information that we need to share with you \u2013 due to currency fluctuations we will be increasing our UK prices for custom orders by 5% on 1 January 2017.\u201d \u201cPrices on showroom and pre-owned cars will remain fixed at current prices.\u201d More here: The fog has now lifted in London, but there\u2019s little else to report from the City. After three hours of trading, Europe\u2019s financial markets still seem becalmed, as people wait for Monte dei Paschi\u2019s cash call to formally end after lunchtime (2pm in Italy, or 1pm GMT). Some investors are hopeful that the saga will soon end. As LC Macro Advisors head, Lorenzo Codogno, explains (via Reuters):. \u201cThis situation has dragged on for years without a clear solution. Now a solution is in sight. My perception is that the government backstop will be welcomed by financial markets and it will be a plus for the (Italian) economy as well.\u201d But Mike van Dulken, head of research at Accendo Markets, isn\u2019t pleased that a rescue might take three whole months (see earlier post): Risk appetite remains hampered by thinner holiday trading into Christmas as well as talk of a Monte dei Paschi bailout taking a whopping 3-months to complete, taking us well beyond a supposed 31 Dec deadline for shoring up Italy\u2019s knackered banks. An official announcement still eludes markets which understandably want clarity on the issue. The Financial Times flag up that some Monte dei Paschi savers have been taking money out of the bank in recent months, as its funding crisis accelerated. More here (\u00a3). Toby Nangle, top multi-asset manager at Columbia Threadneedle, isn\u2019t convinced that the Treasury Committee\u2019s new inquiry into the Bank of England will crack the mysteries of monetary policy. After all, the BoE does devote plenty of time to assessing whether its measures are working. So MPs (or their staffers) may find themselves wading through long, competing theories about how interest rates and quantitative easing works. Toby tweets: But...economist Shaun Richards is encouraged that MPs have launched an inquiry into the BoE\u2019s work: Newsflash from London: A group of influential MPs have just launched an inquiry into the effectiveness of Britain\u2019s monetary policy since the financial crisis struck. The Treasury committee will investigate whether the Bank of England was right to slash interest rates to record lows, and buy up hundreds of billions of government bonds with new money. They will examine whether this policy has actually worked, what impact it has had on savers, house prices and struggling companies, and whether policymakers are now out of ammunition to fight the next crisis. The move follows growing criticism of the Bank\u2019s actions in the crisis, most notably from prime minister Theresa May. The BoE, though, insists that it has acted sensibly to protect the economy and preserve jobs. Committee chairman Andrew Tyrie explains why MPs are now taking action: Interest rates are stuck near zero, the Bank of England has used increasingly unconventional forms of quantitative easing, and inflation has been below the two per cent target for three years. \u201cThe efficacy of monetary policy or otherwise, its unintended consequences, and its prospects, need careful examination. \u201cThe Treasury Committee will continue to act as a safeguard on the operational independence of the Bank. The Treasury indemnity, which underpins parts of the Bank\u2019s monetary policy, could all too easily encourage the Treasury, or politicians, to put undue pressure on the Bank. The Committee will examine the risks of that, too.\u201d Here are the terms of reference for the inquiry: The effectiveness of monetary policy in meeting the inflation target: The effectiveness of holding Bank rate near zero and whether extremely low rates can encourage more, rather than less, saving The effectiveness of quantitative easing and whether it has met with diminishing returns The scope for further expansion of \u201cqualitative easing\u201d (e.g. corporate bond purchases) Whether forward guidance effectively binds the Bank to a policy course, and the desirability of doing so The unintended consequences of monetary policy The impact on asset-price inflation, the housing market and financial stability The implications for the long-term sustainability of pensions and savings income The distributional impact The impact on competition, \u201czombie companies\u201d and productivity The effects on the structure of relative prices in capital and commodity markets and the consequences for capital allocation, productivity and the trade cycle The implications of a large balance sheet and the Treasury indemnity for Bank accountability and its relationship with the government and other agencies The use of macro-prudential, fiscal and other policy to counterbalance any unintended consequences of monetary policy The prospects for monetary policy The drivers behind and prospects for low real interest rates in the UK and globally What is the significance for monetary policy of rises in bond yields since the US election? The impact and trade-offs of tightening monetary policy in the near-term Whether monetary policy is currently out of ammunition for the next crisis Options for raising the \u201cnatural rate\u201d of interest (e.g. fiscal policy, promoting investment) Scrap what we said about MPS buyers being in short supply -- its shares are now up 3% on the day. At this stage in proceedings, and with prices so low, we probably shouldn\u2019t read too much into it. Monte dei Paschi\u2019s shares are having one of those mornings; they\u2019ve already been suspended once, after plunging over 6%: Europe\u2019s stock markets have dipped into the red in early, subdued trading. There\u2019s no sign of the traditional \u201cSanta Rally\u201d yet; perhaps it has been lost in the fog gripping London this morning. Connor Campbell of SpreadEx sums up the mood: Once again the main news surrounded Monte dei Paschi. With the world\u2019s oldest bank rapidly running out of time to raise the \u20ac5 billion in capital it desperately needs \u2013 it\u2019s only managed \u20ac2 billion so far, with a key Qatari investors choosing not to invest a \u20ac1 billion chunk \u2013 it looks like MPS will be forced into a government bailout. Italy approved a \u20ac20 billion increase to its debt ceiling yesterday, freeing up money for its ailing banks, starting with Monte dei Paschi. This news has begun to drag on the rest of the European banking sector, with the likes of Deutsche Bank, Barclays and Lloyds all dipping their toes into the red after the bell. This in turn capped the region\u2019s indices, with the DAX and CAC falling 0.1% and 0.2% respectively. Update: Shares in Monte Dei Paschi have finally opened, and they\u2019re down 6.75% at \u20ac15.20. They\u2019ve already shed more than 99% of their value in the last decade, as this graph from blogger Jeroen Blokland shows: Shares in Monte dei Paschi have failed to open at the start of trading in Milan. Buyers may be in short supply today, as they risk being wiped out if the Italian state has to bail the bank out  . Italian newspaper Il Sole 24 is reporting that the rescue of Monte Dei Paschi might take two or three months. The paper says that the details haven\u2019t been worked out yet, but that MPS would initially be able to tap state guarantees to bolster its liquidity. That would help MPS avoid running out of cash, now that Qatar has declined to back its \u20ac5bn cash call. A long-term recapitalisation plan would take longer; and involve MPS\u2019s management presenting a new business plan. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Monte dei Paschi di Siena has been through a lot since it was founded back in 1472, twenty years before Columbus discovered America. And the world\u2019s oldest bank finds itself in the undignified position of needing a bailout this morning, after efforts to persuade private investors to provide desperately needed fresh capital floundered. Monte dei Paschi di Siena admitted last night that Qatar\u2019s sovereign wealth fund had not been persuaded to become the \u201canchor investor\u201d to underpin its \u20ac5bn cash call. So a saga that has been dragging on for months could finally be resolved today, when the cash call closes at lunchtime today. Without private sector capital, MPS is now likely to miss an end of year deadline imposed by the European Central Bank to raise fresh funds. So the Italian government is now under serious time pressure to step in and put in fresh capital itself. As we wrote last night, MPS is running out of time and options. Shares in the bank, Italy\u2019s third largest, gyrated wildly in Wednesday\u2019s trading session, plunging 18% to record lows before closing 12% lower amid rumours that the fund-raising effort would fail. \u201cThe idea that Qatar could be an anchor investor has vanished and without an anchor investor there is no demand from anyone else,\u201d one source told Reuters. In the last few minutes, the bank reported that it had only raised \u20ac2bn in new capital through the debt-for-equity swap, far short of the \u20ac5bn target. Yesterday, Italy\u2019s government prepared for a rescue bid by approving a \u20ac20bn fund for bank recapitalisation. Ministers have also insisted that there will be a \u201cminimised or non-existent\u201d impact on savers. But shareholders, and those who hold MPS\u2019s junior, and riskier, bonds could suffer losses. Also coming up today The Dow Jones industrial average will have another tilt at smashing through the 20,000 point mark, after faltering and falling back from record highs yesterday. We get a flurry of US economic data, including new personal consumption and durable goods orders at 1.30pm GMT, plus the latest weekly jobless report -- and a new estimate of American growth in the last quarter. And rumours continue to swirl that Deutsche Bank might be close to a settlement with the Department of Justice, over misconduct before the 2008 financial crisis.",
