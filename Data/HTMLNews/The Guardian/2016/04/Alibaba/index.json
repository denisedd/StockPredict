This is partly because the IMF appears to be constrained by the official, government forecasts for China and India, but its projections for the US and the euro-zone also look too optimistic.</p> <p>Among advanced economies, the key differences [between the IMF and our forecasts] are that we are less optimistic about both the US and the euro-zone. With first-quarter growth in the US now likely to be only around 1.0%, the risks to our US forecast are to the downside.

For India, too, the difference between our projections and those of the IMF is partly due to uncertainty surrounding the official national accounts data.

A vote to leave would, it says, have serious consequences not just for Britain and its EU partners but for the whole of the global economy. The Fund is twitchy. It can identify a number of different triggers that might possibly bring about a new, dangerous phase of the crisis \u2013 such as a sharper than expected slowdown in China, a collapse in emerging markets or a pandemic. But with little more than two months to go before the referendum, Brexit is the most immediate threat.</p> <p>But if the Fund is right in its assessment, something will trigger the crisis sooner or later even if Britain decides to remain a member of the EU. The IMF says global growth has been too slow for too long, and proposes a mix of expansionary monetary policy (low interest rates and quantitative easing), higher spending on infrastructure and research and development, and structural reforms to boost productivity.</p> <p>This, though, seems a bit timid if the Fund is right in its analysis that globalisation benefits the few not the many and that a rising tide no longer lifts all boats. In that case, the remedy would not be more R&amp;D spending but checks on financial speculation and more aggressive redistribution. Global growth has indeed been too slow for too long.

Tortuous talks to complete the first review under debt-stricken Greece\u2019s third international bailout are beginning to resemble the momentum that triggered crunch time in 2015. Despite the positive face put on by finance minister Euclid Tsakalotos, who emerged in the early hours to say that progress had been made, there is no hiding the divide that still exists between Athens and the foreign lenders keeping the country afloat.</p> <p>As the straight-talking Oxford-educated finance minister himself admitted:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\u201cbecause there are many other small [issues] we did not have the time to discuss it became obvious to all of us that it was not possible to have a staff level agreement by day break today.\u201d</p> </blockquote> <p>Disagreement over non performing loans and pension reforms still linger but beyond discord over Athens\u2019 ability to achieve a primary surplus of 3.5 % by 2018, it is the much bigger disagreement over debt relief that has come to cloud the talks. The inability of Berlin and the International Monetary Fund to see eye-to-eye on the matter is unlikely to be resolved soon.</p> <p>Even if Greek officials manage to put the final touches to a deal that would effectively conclude the process later this week at the IMF\u2019s spring meetings in Washington DC, in Athens almost no one believes in a similar breakthrough on the crucial issue of debt relief. Without debt forgiveness, few have faith in the shattered Greek economy ever recovering. While the IMF continues to advocate a debt haircut, EU member states led by Berlin have hinted that, at most, a reduction would come in the form of longer maturities and grace periods.</p> <p>In private, leading members of the leftist led government are holding out the hope that Europe\u2019s refugee emergency \u2013 and Greece\u2019s frontline role \u2013 will help cut it some slack.</p> <p>\u201cBut that line of thought could backfire in so many ways,\u201d says Aristides Hatzis, associate professor of law and economics at the University of Athens.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\u201cFirst of all from the far right that will exploit anti-immigrant sentiment while the trade off of less reforms for more refugees will, quite rightly, never be accepted by the IMF.\u201d </p> </blockquote> <p>If the talks aren\u2019t concluded by May, Greece, will, once again, face a ferocious liquidity problem just when it confronts \u20ac5bn worth of debt repayments in June and July (money it does not have) and the UK is gearing up for its in-out EU referendum. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/YiannisMouzakis/status/719840789648375809\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Greece?src=hash\">#Greece</a>&#39;s 2016 debt obligations <a href=\"https://t.co/uqXMoeoCr4\">pic.twitter.com/uqXMoeoCr4</a></p>&mdash; Yiannis Mouzakis (@YiannisMouzakis) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/YiannisMouzakis/status/719840789648375809\">April 12, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-04-12T11:33:00.264Z\">at 12.33pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-570cd444e4b00591e8dc8a62\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-04-12T10:58:16.399Z\">11.58am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Newsflash: Saudi Arabia\u2019s credit rating has just been cut by one notch, to AA-, by Fitch.</strong></p> <p>Fitch also left Saudi Arabia with a negative outlook, meaning further cuts are possible.</p> <p>It cited the \u201cnegative implications\u201d of cheaper oil on the country\u2019s fiscal stability, and also pointed to rising tensions with Iran.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/business/status/719840841905369089\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">BREAKING: Saudi Arabia ratings cut by Fitch, which says outlook remains negative <a href=\"https://t.co/wx9kCQwAFW\">https://t.co/wx9kCQwAFW</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/hdRW81pEih\">pic.twitter.com/hdRW81pEih</a></p>&mdash; Bloomberg (@business) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/business/status/719840841905369089\">April 12, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-570cd146e4b00591e8dc8a58\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-04-12T10:53:32.955Z\">11.53am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">ECB's Weidmann defends Draghi</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"07d0814dc6fa3858edb9825faaa43df5d379043c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/07d0814dc6fa3858edb9825faaa43df5d379043c/0_0_3500_1730/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The President of the Deutsche Bundesbank (German Central Bank) Jens Weidmann.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"494\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p><strong>Has peace broken out at the European Central Bank, between president Mario Draghi and his more hawkish colleague Jens Weidmann?</strong></p> <p>Weidmann, who heads up Germany\u2019s central bank, has leapt to Draghi\u2019s defence against critics - including many Germans \u2013 who oppose his monetary easing and record low interest rates.</p> <p>Speaking to the Financial Times, Weidmann argues (persuasively) that it\u2019s too simplistic to just talk about \u2018savers\u2019 suffering from low borrowing costs.

However, the UK economy is battling a number of significant headwinds at present. Consumer spending, aided by low inflation, low unemployment and rising wages, has been the engine of economic growth lately.

Fares rose by 2.7% between the same 2 months in 2015.</p> <p>There was also a smaller upward effect from rail passenger transport with fares rising this year but falling a year ago. These upward effects were partially offset by a downward contribution from motor fuels with petrol prices rising by 0.9 pence per litre this year compared with a larger rise of 3.8 pence per litre a year ago.</p> </blockquote> <h2>Clothing and footwear: </h2> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>prices, overall, rose by 1.0% between February and March this year compared with a fall of 0.1% between the same 2 months a year ago. Last year was the first time that prices had fallen between February and March since the CPI started in 1996. Normally they rise as they continue to recover following the January sales period. The upward contribution this year came from price movements across a range of women\u2019s outerwear.</p> </blockquote> <h2>Restaurants and hotels: </h2> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>prices, overall, rose by 0.5% between February and March 2016 compared with a rise of 0.2% between the same 2 months a year ago.

                "bodyText":"A jump in the oil price has fuelled a rise in European markets, which had previously been looking rather uncertain. Hopes of an agreement at the imminent meeting of oil producers in Doha, specifically suggestions that Russia and Saudi Arabia had agreed a freeze, sent crude prices to new highs for the year. Brent is currently 3.7% higher at $44.43 a barrel, having touched $44.73, while West Texas Intermediate - the US benchmark - is up 3.1% at $41.61. Oil has also been lifted by the weakness in the dollar, as investors bet there would not be an imminent rise in US interest rates. Meanwhile, optimism that the Chinese economy may be stabilising helped other commodities and pushed mining shares higher. The gloomy news from the International Monetary Fund, which cut its global growth forecasts, was pushed to one side. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished up 42.27 points or 0.68% at 6242.39 Germany\u2019s Dax added 0.81% to 9761.47 France\u2019s Cac climbed 0.77% to 4345.91 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended 0.57% higher at 8546.3 But Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB bucked the trend, falling 1.57% to 17,444.80 as the country\u2019s banks slipped back after recent gains on confirmation of a plan to restructure bad loans In Greece, the Athens market dipped 1.34% to 553.43 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently 157 points or 0.9% higher. On that note, it\u2019s time to close for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. The IMF\u2019s growth forecasts still look too optimistic even though they have been downgraded, says Capital Economics: Despite being revised down yet again, we think the IMF\u2019s latest projections for global growth are still too high. This is partly because the IMF appears to be constrained by the official, government forecasts for China and India, but its projections for the US and the euro-zone also look too optimistic. Among advanced economies, the key differences [between the IMF and our forecasts] are that we are less optimistic about both the US and the euro-zone. With first-quarter growth in the US now likely to be only around 1.0%, the risks to our US forecast are to the downside. And for the euro-zone, the generally disappointing first-quarter data have supported our view that activity is likely to slow this year. Among emerging economies, we think growth in China will be around 5.5%. Note that although this is lower than official and IMF estimates, it would be an improvement compared to last year. For India, too, the difference between our projections and those of the IMF is partly due to uncertainty surrounding the official national accounts data. Finally, although Brazil and Russia\u2019s recessions both look set to continue this year, we expect them to be slightly less severe than is projected by the IMF. (A reminder that there were hopes of an agreement over the weekend.) More on the Greek situation: Oil prices were always going to be influenced by reports ahead of the producers\u2019 meeting, said Joshua Mahony, market analyst at IG, but in practice, any output freeze at January levels may not bring the benefits expected. He said: Rumours of a deal between Russia and Saudi Arabia for a production freeze provided further gains for crude today amid a four-month high for Brent. This week was always likely to see market positioning in advance of the meeting, which has driven substantial gains across the energy sector. However, given that many of the world producers are pumping less than they did in January, a freeze could even increase the amount of crude being produced. Greek finance minister Euclid Tsakalotos has said that two bills on pensions and taxes - sticking points in the discussions with the country\u2019s creditors - will be presented to parliament next week, Reuters in reporting. And - something to look forward to - he has also suggested there may be an extra Eurogroup meeting on 25 or 26 April. Earlier senior German government officials told Reuters that there could be no decision on any debt measures for Greece until the bailout review has been completed. The oil price increase is giving some support to stock markets, with the FTSE 100, Germany\u2019s Dax and France\u2019s Cac all climbing around 0.5% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average up 110 points or 0.6%. The positive moves come despite the gloomy noises coming from the International Monetary Fund which has cut its global growth forecasts again. Oil continues to strengthen, now helped by another report that key producers might agree a deal to tackle the supply glut, this time from news agency Interfax: Here\u2019s Reuters on the IMF\u2019s latest comments on Greece: The International Monetary Fund\u2019s chief economist said on Tuesday that Europe will need to show some flexibility towards Greece as it deals with a refugee crisis and negotiates a new bailout package. \u201cThere\u2019s certainly going to be a need for more flexibility to tackle the refugee crisis and some support from the broader European community,\u201d IMF chief economist Maurice Obstfeld said in a news conference. \u201cIt\u2019s a European problem, it\u2019s actually a global problem.\u201d He said the IMF has during its negotiations with Athens called for some debt relief, coupled with fiscal adjustments by the Greek government that would put the country on a path towards debt sustainability. The talks are on hold for the IMF-World Bank spring meetings this week in Washington. \u201cWe\u2019re not taking a stand on each particular component. But we need a program that adds up,\u201d Obstfeld said. Here\u2019s a list of the recent Brexit polls: After its earlier strength on the back of higher than expected UK inflation figures, sterling has now fallen back as a new survey shows the campaign for Britain to leave the EU is in the lead. The pound is down almost half a cent to $1.431 as an ICM poll put leave on 45% and remain on 42%. The European Commission has now unveiled its tax proposals for large corporations. Jennifer Rankin writes: Multinational companies will be forced to disclose profits earned and taxes paid in Europe and the world\u2019s shadiest fiscal havens, under proposals announced on Tuesday by EU regulators. The European commission wants all large companies to publish a country-by-country breakdown of profits, taxes, employees and turnover in all 28 member states of the EU, as well as some of the most problematic tax havens. American and Chinese companies with a subsidiary in Europe would also be subject to the transparency drive, as the rules would hit all global corporations with a large presence in Europe. If agreed, the new disclosure requirements would shine a spotlight on some of the world\u2019s most powerful companies, including Apple, Google and Starbucks, which have been caught up in a public furore over their tax bills. Lord Hill, the European commissioner for financial services, said the new rules would give the public \u201ca clear idea of whether a large multinational is paying tax where they make their profits\u201d. The proposals would be good for competition, he said, by levelling the playing field between large corporations and smaller firms. \u201cBy using complicated tax arrangements, some multinationals can pay nearly a third less tax than companies that only operate in one country.\u201d The full story is here: The US should wait until inflation is stronger before raising rates, according to Philadelphia Federal Reserve president Patrick Harker. And negative interest rates, although legally and technically difficult, should not be taken off the table, he said, echoing comments earlier this year from Fed chair Janet Yellen. Harker told a local business group: Although I remain confident that inflation will return to the Committee\u2019s 2 percent target, my outlook sees it doing so only gradually... global headwinds point to some downside risks to my economic outlook. These considerations make me a bit more conservative in my approach to policy, at least in the very near term. Although I cannot give you a definitive path for how policy will evolve, it might prove prudent to wait until the inflation data are stronger before we undertake a second rate hike. So, I am approaching near-term policy more cautiously than I did a few months ago. That is part of being data dependent. And attentiveness to the data will be a key factor in all of my future policy recommendations as well. If financial headwinds dissipate quickly and inflation picks up a bit more aggressively, it will require a slightly more aggressive approach to policy. [But] it will take fewer rate hikes to attain neutrality in policy than it would have 15 years ago. By historical standards, that in itself implies a somewhat shallower path for interest rates than was typical of past recoveries. The IMF\u2019s economic counsellor Maurice Obstfeld has said there is a need for more flexibility between Europe and Greece to handle the refugee crisis and the debt situation. Bruce Springsteen, Paypal and now Deutsche Bank. The bank has added its name to the list of those protesting a controversial anti-LGBT law in North Carolina. It has frozen plans to create 250 new jobs at its Cary, North Carolina, operation after the state became the first in the US to enact legislation requiring people to use public bathrooms or locker rooms that match the gender on their birth certificate rather than their gender identity. John Cryan, co-chief executive officer of Deutsche Bank, said: \u201cWe take our commitment to building inclusive work environments seriously. We\u2019re proud of our operations and employees in Cary and regret that as a result of this legislation we are unwilling to include North Carolina in our US expansion plans for now. We very much hope that we can re-visit our plans to grow this location in the near future.\u201d The bank currently employs 900 people at Cary and said it was \u201ccommitted to sustaining that existing presence.\u201d Last week Springsteen cancelled a concert in North Carolina because of the new law, which critics say legalises discrimination. Bank of America and American Airlines, which are based in Charlotte, have condemned the law, while PayPal cancelled plans to open a new operation center in Charlotte. The IMF is worried about a new phase of the financial crisis, but its proposals to remedy the situation do not go far enough, writes Larry Elliott: The prospect of Brexit clearly scares the IMF. A vote to leave would, it says, have serious consequences not just for Britain and its EU partners but for the whole of the global economy. The Fund is twitchy. It can identify a number of different triggers that might possibly bring about a new, dangerous phase of the crisis \u2013 such as a sharper than expected slowdown in China, a collapse in emerging markets or a pandemic. But with little more than two months to go before the referendum, Brexit is the most immediate threat. But if the Fund is right in its assessment, something will trigger the crisis sooner or later even if Britain decides to remain a member of the EU. The IMF says global growth has been too slow for too long, and proposes a mix of expansionary monetary policy (low interest rates and quantitative easing), higher spending on infrastructure and research and development, and structural reforms to boost productivity. This, though, seems a bit timid if the Fund is right in its analysis that globalisation benefits the few not the many and that a rising tide no longer lifts all boats. In that case, the remedy would not be more R&amp;D spending but checks on financial speculation and more aggressive redistribution. Global growth has indeed been too slow for too long. The Fund\u2019s remedy is too little too late. His full analysis is here: Ahead of its spring meeting the International Monetary Fund has, as expected, cut its forecasts for global growth, at the same time as warning on the risks of Britain leaving the European Union. Katie Allen and Anushka Asthana write: A British vote to leave the EU risks causing severe economic and political damage to Europe that will spill over into an already febrile world economy, the International Monetary Fund has warned. Cutting its forecasts for global growth and for the UK and other advanced economies, the IMF listed a potential Brexit vote in June\u2019s EU referendum as a key risk in its latest World Economic Outlook (WEO)... The IMF now predicts global GDP growth will edge up only slightly this year, to 3.2%, from growth of 3.1% in 2015. That compared with a 2016 forecast of 3.4% in a January update and of 3.6% in the last WEO in October. The 2017 forecast was cut to 3.5% from, 3.6% in January... The IMF cut its forecast for UK GDP growth this year. After growing 2.2% in 2015, the economy was now expected to expand 1.9% in 2016, down from a forecast of 2.2% made by the Fund in January. That compares with 2.0% growth predicted for 2016 by the government\u2019s independent forecasters, the Office for Budget Responsibility. The IMF left its forecast for 2017 growth unchanged at 2.2%. The full story is here: US import prices rose in March by 0.2% after a revised 0.4% drop in the previous month. The increase came following a rise in the cost of petroleum products, but it was less than the 1% expected by analysts. Brent crude has climbed above $43 a barrel on hopes that next week\u2019s meeting of oil producers can agree to freeze output to tackle the current supply glut. Iraqi oil official Falah Alamri said he was confident that the meeting with Opec and other producers in Doha would reach an agreement. Oil is also being supported by hopes that the Chinese economy is stabilising after a rise in vehicle sales. On top of that, the weak dollar is helping commodities. The gap between UK inflation and average earnings is narrowing: MPs are about to start an emergency debate on the crisis in the UK steel industry. My colleague Andrew Sparrow will be following proceedings in the politics live blog: The dollar has fallen to an eight month low against a basket of currencies as investors continue to bet that the Federal Reserve is in no hurry to raise US interest rates. Meanwhile sterling has climbed to its highest level in more than a week after the higher than expected UK inflation figures. The pound is up around half a percent at $1.4313 after the data, which suggested that UK rates could rise more quickly than people had been expecting. Greece\u2019s inability to wrap up negotiations with creditors last night has fuelled fears that the talks could drag on until the early summer, potentially coinciding with Britain\u2019s referendum on EU membership. Our correspondent in Athens, Helena Smith, reports: Another deadline marked; another deadline missed. Tortuous talks to complete the first review under debt-stricken Greece\u2019s third international bailout are beginning to resemble the momentum that triggered crunch time in 2015. Despite the positive face put on by finance minister Euclid Tsakalotos, who emerged in the early hours to say that progress had been made, there is no hiding the divide that still exists between Athens and the foreign lenders keeping the country afloat. As the straight-talking Oxford-educated finance minister himself admitted: \u201cbecause there are many other small [issues] we did not have the time to discuss it became obvious to all of us that it was not possible to have a staff level agreement by day break today.\u201d Disagreement over non performing loans and pension reforms still linger but beyond discord over Athens\u2019 ability to achieve a primary surplus of 3.5 % by 2018, it is the much bigger disagreement over debt relief that has come to cloud the talks. The inability of Berlin and the International Monetary Fund to see eye-to-eye on the matter is unlikely to be resolved soon. Even if Greek officials manage to put the final touches to a deal that would effectively conclude the process later this week at the IMF\u2019s spring meetings in Washington DC, in Athens almost no one believes in a similar breakthrough on the crucial issue of debt relief. Without debt forgiveness, few have faith in the shattered Greek economy ever recovering. While the IMF continues to advocate a debt haircut, EU member states led by Berlin have hinted that, at most, a reduction would come in the form of longer maturities and grace periods. In private, leading members of the leftist led government are holding out the hope that Europe\u2019s refugee emergency \u2013 and Greece\u2019s frontline role \u2013 will help cut it some slack. \u201cBut that line of thought could backfire in so many ways,\u201d says Aristides Hatzis, associate professor of law and economics at the University of Athens. \u201cFirst of all from the far right that will exploit anti-immigrant sentiment while the trade off of less reforms for more refugees will, quite rightly, never be accepted by the IMF.\u201d If the talks aren\u2019t concluded by May, Greece, will, once again, face a ferocious liquidity problem just when it confronts \u20ac5bn worth of debt repayments in June and July (money it does not have) and the UK is gearing up for its in-out EU referendum. Newsflash: Saudi Arabia\u2019s credit rating has just been cut by one notch, to AA-, by Fitch. Fitch also left Saudi Arabia with a negative outlook, meaning further cuts are possible. It cited the \u201cnegative implications\u201d of cheaper oil on the country\u2019s fiscal stability, and also pointed to rising tensions with Iran. Has peace broken out at the European Central Bank, between president Mario Draghi and his more hawkish colleague Jens Weidmann? Weidmann, who heads up Germany\u2019s central bank, has leapt to Draghi\u2019s defence against critics - including many Germans \u2013 who oppose his monetary easing and record low interest rates. Speaking to the Financial Times, Weidmann argues (persuasively) that it\u2019s too simplistic to just talk about \u2018savers\u2019 suffering from low borrowing costs. Employees, taxpayers, and anyone with debts are benefitting from the current situation. Weidmann is understood to have opposed some of Draghi\u2019s attempts to stimulate growth and inflation in the euro area. But he\u2019s adamant that politicians should keep their noses out: \u201cIt\u2019s not unusual for politicians to have opinions on monetary policy, but we are independent,\u201d \u201cThe ECB has to deliver on its price stability mandate and thus an expansionary monetary policy stance is appropriate at this juncture regardless of different views about specific measures.\u201d More here: Bundesbank\u2019s Weidmann rebukes Draghi critics in Berlin This might ruffle some feathers in Berlin. Last Friday, German finance minister Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble blamed Draghi for the rise of the eurosceptic AfD party, and declared that central banks should raise interest rates..... British house continue to outpace both the headline inflation rate and average earnings. New figures show that UK house prices increased by 7.6% in the year to February 2016. That\u2019s down from 7.9% in the year to January 2016: Once again, strong demand in London (+9.7%) and the South East (+11.4%) drove the market, while other regions were more subdued. House price annual inflation was 8.2% in England, 2.8% in Wales, -0.8% in Scotland and 2.4% in Northern Ireland. Here\u2019s our news story about the rise in UK inflation in March: The recent weakness in the pound, which has fallen 6% since last October, has also pushed inflation higher (by driving up the cost of imports). Dimitris Hiotis, partner at pricing experts Simon-Kucher &amp; Partner, reckons this trend could continue ahead of June\u2019s EU referendum. With the judgement day on Brexit looming, the sterling has continued to depreciate in recent months, which has increased the cost of imports to the country. As we move closer to the referendum on June 23rd, and with the latest polls showing it to be a close run race, we expect sterling to depreciate further and therefore cause additional inflationary pressures in the coming months. The Institute of Directors (whose members largely oppose Brexit) agrees. IoD chief economist Michael Martins argues: \u201cThe slight rise in inflation is likely connected to depreciation of the pound as uncertainty surrounding the EU referendum increases and international investors begin to sell off sterling. This is not a one-month phenomenon \u2013 core inflation, which strips out volatile factors like energy and food, increased to 1.5% in March, after averaging 1.1% over the last 8 months. \u201cWhile the Bank of England has been keen to see prices rising as a spur to economic growth, if pay rises do not shadow increased inflation, real wages will decline, putting pressure on people\u2019s wallets and holding back increases in productivity. Real wage increases are now under 2% (1.9%), running just ahead of core inflation. This rise in inflation doesn\u2019t mean that the UK economy is healed, argues TUC General Secretary Frances O\u2019Grady: \u201cDespite a small rise, the overall picture is still of very low inflation. It indicates that the economy is still not at full strength, with too much underemployment and too little wage growth. \u201cWith the global economy slowing down, the government cannot just sit by. We need investment in skills, infrastructure and public services to promote growth for the long term.\u201d Mike Cherry, National Chairman at the Federation of Small Businesses (FSB), has urged the Bank of England to resist any temptation to raise interest rates at this week\u2019s meeting. He reckons his members have enough on their collective plates: \u201cSmall firms are currently dealing with a raft of challenges, including the National Living Wage which came into effect this month, driving up costs and driving down modest profit. A recent FSB survey showed small business confidence hovering at its lowest level since 2013. Despite inflation edging up last month, our members welcome this ongoing period of low inflation which has helped to keep other operating costs manageable. Economists are split over when the Bank of England might take the plunge and raise interest rates, now that inflation is creeping towards its 2% target. Ian Stewart, chief economist at Deloitte, reckons the BoE is \u201cmiles away from raising rates\u201d, given the state of the UK economy. Stewart argues: The Bank\u2019s big problem is sustaining growth and getting inflation up. \u201cInflation may have bottomed, but the mounting risks in the global economy, and the continued risk of deflation, means that interest rates are likely to stay on hold until next year.\u201d But Kallum Pickering of German bank Berenberg reckons the first hike could come in November - unless Britain votes to leave the EU, of course. Looking ahead, we expect the headline rate to increase to 1.6% by the final quarter of the year. Beyond the modest dent to GDP growth in the first half of this year as a result of the financial market rout and Brexit uncertainty, underlying fundamentals point to robust growth at around trend (0.5% qoq) in the second half of the year driven by strong consumer spending and recovering business investment. The on-going acceleration in inflation, alongside consumer credit growth at a decade high, household saving at a historic low and the labour market at full employment begs the question if near-zero rates are still appropriate. Indeed, data for household spending, borrowing and saving point to some overheating in the domestic economy. Therefore, as long as the UK votes to stay in the EU we expect the Bank of England to hike rates by 25 bps in November. We see a 35% chance of a Brexit. Confused about how inflation is calculated? Or wondering why some economists have been fretting about deflation? Our video explainer has the answers... You can see the inflation report here, on the Office for National Statistics website. Today\u2019s rise in inflation may undermine the notion that UK interest rates could stay on hold until 2020. Samuel Tombs at Pantheon Macroeconomics certainly thinks so, saying: Inflation pressures are continuing to build, challenging the consensus view in the markets that the MPC will leave interest rates on hold until the end of the decade. The rise in the headline rate entirely reflected an increase in core inflation to 1.5%, from 1.2% in February. About half this increase came from airfares, the rest from stronger inflation in the clothing and restaurant sectors. Airfares were reportedly boosted by Easter in late March, but we have our doubts that all of their rise is temporary. Ben Brettell, senior economist at financial services group Hargreaves Lansdown, also believes the Bank of England will sit tight at this week\u2019s monetary policy meeting. Naturally policymakers will need to remain mindful of the risk that inflation overshoots at some point. However, the UK economy is battling a number of significant headwinds at present. Consumer spending, aided by low inflation, low unemployment and rising wages, has been the engine of economic growth lately. But recent surveys suggest consumers reined in their spending in March - perhaps the first sign of nerves ahead of June\u2019s EU referendum. All in all, the economic picture remains highly uncertain and I expect no action from Threadneedle Street for some time yet. Britain\u2019s inflation rate is still far too low to prompt an interest rate rise, says Maike Currie, investment director for personal investing at Fidelity International: Today\u2019s increase is unlikely to spur the Bank of England into considering raising interest rates on Thursday with widespread consensus that this week will see the 85th consecutive month that the bank keeps interest rates on hold at their emergency level of 0.50%. Bloomberg columnist Mark Gilbert is struck by the surge in air fares last month. Here\u2019s some details from today\u2019s UK inflation report: Transport: prices, overall, rose by 1.7% between February and March this year compared with a rise of 0.7% between the same 2 months a year ago. By far the largest upward effect came from air transport where the timing of Easter contributed to fares rising by 22.9% between February and March 2016. Fares rose by 2.7% between the same 2 months in 2015. There was also a smaller upward effect from rail passenger transport with fares rising this year but falling a year ago. These upward effects were partially offset by a downward contribution from motor fuels with petrol prices rising by 0.9 pence per litre this year compared with a larger rise of 3.8 pence per litre a year ago. Clothing and footwear: prices, overall, rose by 1.0% between February and March this year compared with a fall of 0.1% between the same 2 months a year ago. Last year was the first time that prices had fallen between February and March since the CPI started in 1996. Normally they rise as they continue to recover following the January sales period. The upward contribution this year came from price movements across a range of women\u2019s outerwear. Restaurants and hotels: prices, overall, rose by 0.5% between February and March 2016 compared with a rise of 0.2% between the same 2 months a year ago. The upward effect came principally from restaurant and caf\u00e9 prices rising by more than a year ago. After falling into negative territory last year, Britain\u2019s inflation rate has now moved towards the Bank of England\u2019s 2% target: And this chart confirms that higher air fares cancelled out the impact of cheaper fuel. The pound has jumped by over half a cent against the US dollar, to around $1.43. Traders are calculating that higher-than-expected inflation figures could mean UK interest rates rise earlier than expected. Britain\u2019s core inflation rate, which strips out energy, food, alcohol and tobacco, has hit 1.5%. That\u2019s the highest rate since October 2014, indicating that inflationary pressures are building. The early Easter holiday has helped to push inflation up. Holiday air fares rose in March compared to 2015 (when Easter was later). This is the highest UK inflation rate since December 2014, as measured by the Consumer Prices Index anyway. Breaking: Britain\u2019s annual inflation rate has jumped to 0.5% for March, up from 0.3% in February. That beats forecasts of a smaller rise, to 0.4%. More to follow..... The IMF has already cut its forecasts for growth this year several times, as RBS\u2019s economist team point out. Today\u2019s World Economic Outlook, due at 2pm BST, may include further gloom. Hopes that Greece and its creditors could make a breakthrough have been dashed overnight, probably to no-one\u2019s great surprise. Talks between the two sides were adjourned early this morning, and will resume next week once the IMF\u2019s Spring Meeting has concluded. Finance Minister Euclid Tsakalotos told reporters that: \u201cThe Greek government and the four institutions agreed there was progress,\u201d But clearly not enough progress to allow the first review of Greece\u2019s bailout to be wrapped up. There are still significant differences between the two sides, on issues such as pension reform and how to tackle bad loans. Tsakalotos says they\u2019re hoping for a deal by April 22nd. Endless talks. Delays. Postponements. It\u2019s all sounding a bit 2015.... Tax avoidance by multinational corporations will be forced into the open under proposals to be unveiled by European regulators later today following the Panama Papers revelations. The European commission will put forward legislation requiring large multinationals operating in Europe to disclose where they make profits and where they pay tax on a country by country basis. Companies trading in Europe, including large subsidiaries of non-European businesses, would also have to publish how much tax they pay outside the EU with specific information about tax paid in problematic jurisdictions..... Here\u2019s the full story: Shares in luxury goods makers are sliding across Europe this morning, following disappointing results from France\u2019s LVMH Mo\u00ebt Hennessy Louis Vuitton SE. Last night, LVMH warned that last November\u2019s terrorist attacks in Paris had hit sales in the last quarter. It reported a 4% rise in sales to \u20ac8.62bn; analysts had expected \u20ac8.73bn. LVMH, which owns champagne house Mo\u00ebt &amp; Chandon and cognac label Hennessy, as well as Louis Vuitton, told shareholders: \u201cThe U.S. market is strong and Europe remains well oriented except for France which is affected by a fall in tourism.\u201d LVMH\u2019s shares have fallen by 3.5% this morning, while Hermes has lost 1.5% and Burberry has shed 1.7%. Troubled UK supermarket chain Tesco has cut back one of its overseas ventures, as it looks to bolster its position back home. Tesco has sold an 8.6% stake in southeast Asian online retailer Lazada to China\u2019s Alibaba Group, raising just over \u00a390m (and giving Alibaba a controlling stake). That could give CEO Dave Lewis a little more firepower for price cuts, in his battle against discount supermarkets. The City isn\u2019t too impressed, though - Tesco\u2019s shares are down 1.6%. London\u2019s stock market has opened cautiously, with the FTSE 100 index dropping by 8 points in early trading. Mining shares are up, partly helped by the weaker dollar. But retailers are falling after a new survey showed that sales fell last month, as wet weather put shoppers off. Jack Lew, the US treasury secretary, has turned the tables on the International Monetary Fund by arguing that it must do more to help the global economy recover. Lew called out the IMF in a speech last night, saying it must be \u2018modernised\u2019. He urged it to: ...intensify scrutiny of critical issues like exchange rates, current account imbalances, and shortfalls in global aggregate demand In other words, he wants the Fund to criticise countries who fuel currency wars or destabilise the global economy by running large trade deficits [such as Britain] or surpluses [Germany, perhaps]. Quite a challenge to the IMF, which likes to use its Spring Meetings to tell everyone else whet they\u2019re doing wrong. IMF chief Christine Lagarde has poured cold water on hopes that a global tax authority could be introduced, to combat tax evasion. Speaking in Washington overnight, she warned that the idea of an intergovernmental UN tax body \u2013 promoted by Oxfam \u2013 faced major obstacles from governments. Lagarde argues: \u201cWe need to be aware of the massive hurdles and obstacles along the way because taxation for the last century or so has been defined, conceptualised, designed, implemented on a purely territorial sovereign basis. And if anything, levying taxation is considered as an attribute of sovereignty, and anything that takes away from that is going to be very strongly opposed by many countries in the world, many forces.\u201d Having said that, Lagarde concedes that the current situation really won\u2019t do. \u201cI think it\u2019s an area where we all have to think outside the box because there are too many boxes in that tax field and thinking outside the box might be of great interest.\u201d More here: Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. It\u2019s an important week for the global economy, as policymakers head to Washington for the Spring meetings of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. The IMF will be setting the scene today, with its latest World Economic Outlook (at 2pm London time) \u2013 and it\u2019s likely to warn that economic conditions have weakened again. Economists expect the Fund to downgrade its growth forecasts, along with another warning that governments must do more to improve economic conditions. We also get the latest UK inflation figures at 9.30am BST. Inflation remains a rare and illusive beast in advanced economies, but analysts reckon the UK consumer prices index could rise to 0.4%, from 0.3%. A stronger reading might give the pound a lift. We\u2019ll also be watching Italy, where the government has just hammered out a \u20ac5bn fund to support its weaker banks. It also committed to improving bankruptcy rules, to make it quicker and easier to resolve a failing business. Officials are hoping that the plan will ease concerns over the stability of the Italian banking sector, following sharp declines in bank shares recently. And tax is also on the agenda. The European Commission is expected to announce plans to force multinational companies in Europe to reveal all their profits, and tax bills, filed in offshore havens. The plan, which has been in the works for months, has been given renewed impetus by the recent Panama Papers revelations. Here\u2019s a preview:",
