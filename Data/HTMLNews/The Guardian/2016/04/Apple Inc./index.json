The iPhone supplier, which has been hit recently by concerns of a slowdown in smartphone sales, said royalties had risen 15% year on year but down 2% quarter on quarter. It has moved into servers to boost growth, and should also benefit from the move to <strong><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_of_Things\">the Internet of Things</a></strong>.</p> <p>The positive results have seen Arm shares jump 2.8% to 990.5p. Analysts at Investec said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The outlook is intact, underpinned by a strong licences pipeline and continued shift to a higher royalty rate mix, yet valuation remains at the lower end of the historic range. This we believe supports our positive investment view based on the long-term attraction of Arm\u2019s business model and underpinned cash generation in the many years ahead. We retain our buy and a 1200p 2020 royalty driven target price.</p> </blockquote> <p>Liberum, a consistent seller of the shares, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Don\u2019t expect much change to consensus estimates for 2016 - sterling revenue may nudge up (weaker pound) and operating expenditure is also likely to increase broadly offsetting each other.</p> <p>Hard to call the stock today. Typically sentiment towards Arm has been driven by royalty momentum which is soft. However the stock has been weak into results.</p> </blockquote> <p>Overall the <strong>FTSE 100</strong> has dipped 18.28 points to 6387.07, although mining shares have recovered some of their earlier losses in the wake of the fall in the Chinese stock market despite a 2% fall in Brent crude.</p> <p><strong>Rio Tinto</strong> has risen 84.5p to 2417.5p, helped by positive comments from RBC, Investec and JP Morgan.</p> <p>A wave of upgrades from Investec has also given some support to other mining shares, including <strong>Antofagasta</strong>, up 17.2p to 510p and <strong>Anglo American</strong>, ahead 22.4p at 774.9p. Investec said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The rally during the first quarter of 2016 caught many observers off-guard, ourselves included. Fundamentals in China have mildly improved, but not to the extent that equity price moves can be fully justified. The rally can largely be explained by dollar weakness and improved sentiment on the China growth outlook - hence we expect commodity prices to be primarily driven by these factors in the near term...</p> <p>[We have] a mild positive bias toward the sector, although we caution that the industry still faces some serious challenges: primarily on-going balance sheet concerns. Our recommendation is to buy whenever prices dip below value points. The bottom of the market appears to have been tested and found, but we do not see this as the beginning of a renewed bull market.</p> </blockquote> <p>Among the fallers, <strong>BT</strong> is down 10.05p at 441.05p as Jefferies cut from buy to hold. It said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>BT\u2019s outlook appears increasingly uncertain, with more elements outside management control. The positive view we established in 2010 was founded on benign regulation (helping BT regain consumer retail momentum) and substantial cost-cutting. With neither support looking so reliable now and valuation no longer cheap, we downgrade to hold.</p> </blockquote> <p>Lower down the market home shopping group <strong>N. Brown</strong> has dropped 40.6p to 27i5p following a 2% drop in full year profits to \u00a384.5m and a cautious outlook for the current year, with margins hit by exchange rates and the clearance of old inventory. Peel Hunt analysts said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>N Brown\u2019s transformation programme is now two years in and our forecast pretax profit for next year sits 20% below where we started from. The scale of investment and change required has been significant, arguably greater than management or the market realised two years ago. However, as we downgrade forecasts again, we have little confidence that the business will show meaningful traction and we cut to reduce [from hold] noting better recovery opportunities elsewhere. </p> </blockquote> <p>Meanwhile Stifel said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Full year results are in line, but trading weakened significantly in the tail end of the year and has remained weak, with sales declines to date in the new financial year.

                "bodyText":"Leading shares have slipped back after hitting new four month highs on Tuesday, hit by a drop in crude prices now the Kuwait oil strike is over, prompting renewed fears of oversupply amid falling demand. A slump in the Chinese market on fears of a clampdown by the authorities on excessive borrowing has not helped sentiment. But chip designer Arm is bucking the trend after better than expected first quarter figures, despite news overnight that semiconductor group Intel planned to slash 12,000 jobs worldwide and reported lower than expected earnings. Arm has reported a 14% rise in profits to \u00a3137.5m, and it said it expected full year results to be in line with expectations. The iPhone supplier, which has been hit recently by concerns of a slowdown in smartphone sales, said royalties had risen 15% year on year but down 2% quarter on quarter. It has moved into servers to boost growth, and should also benefit from the move to the Internet of Things. The positive results have seen Arm shares jump 2.8% to 990.5p. Analysts at Investec said: The outlook is intact, underpinned by a strong licences pipeline and continued shift to a higher royalty rate mix, yet valuation remains at the lower end of the historic range. This we believe supports our positive investment view based on the long-term attraction of Arm\u2019s business model and underpinned cash generation in the many years ahead. We retain our buy and a 1200p 2020 royalty driven target price. Liberum, a consistent seller of the shares, said: Don\u2019t expect much change to consensus estimates for 2016 - sterling revenue may nudge up (weaker pound) and operating expenditure is also likely to increase broadly offsetting each other. Hard to call the stock today. Typically sentiment towards Arm has been driven by royalty momentum which is soft. However the stock has been weak into results. Overall the FTSE 100 has dipped 18.28 points to 6387.07, although mining shares have recovered some of their earlier losses in the wake of the fall in the Chinese stock market despite a 2% fall in Brent crude. Rio Tinto has risen 84.5p to 2417.5p, helped by positive comments from RBC, Investec and JP Morgan. A wave of upgrades from Investec has also given some support to other mining shares, including Antofagasta, up 17.2p to 510p and Anglo American, ahead 22.4p at 774.9p. Investec said: The rally during the first quarter of 2016 caught many observers off-guard, ourselves included. Fundamentals in China have mildly improved, but not to the extent that equity price moves can be fully justified. The rally can largely be explained by dollar weakness and improved sentiment on the China growth outlook - hence we expect commodity prices to be primarily driven by these factors in the near term... [We have] a mild positive bias toward the sector, although we caution that the industry still faces some serious challenges: primarily on-going balance sheet concerns. Our recommendation is to buy whenever prices dip below value points. The bottom of the market appears to have been tested and found, but we do not see this as the beginning of a renewed bull market. Among the fallers, BT is down 10.05p at 441.05p as Jefferies cut from buy to hold. It said: BT\u2019s outlook appears increasingly uncertain, with more elements outside management control. The positive view we established in 2010 was founded on benign regulation (helping BT regain consumer retail momentum) and substantial cost-cutting. With neither support looking so reliable now and valuation no longer cheap, we downgrade to hold. Lower down the market home shopping group N. Brown has dropped 40.6p to 27i5p following a 2% drop in full year profits to \u00a384.5m and a cautious outlook for the current year, with margins hit by exchange rates and the clearance of old inventory. Peel Hunt analysts said: N Brown\u2019s transformation programme is now two years in and our forecast pretax profit for next year sits 20% below where we started from. The scale of investment and change required has been significant, arguably greater than management or the market realised two years ago. However, as we downgrade forecasts again, we have little confidence that the business will show meaningful traction and we cut to reduce [from hold] noting better recovery opportunities elsewhere. Meanwhile Stifel said: Full year results are in line, but trading weakened significantly in the tail end of the year and has remained weak, with sales declines to date in the new financial year. While management is confident that some of the trading weakness can normalise, it is clear that market conditions are tough. This is further reflected in guidance of a significant product gross margin decline for 2017, impacted by foreign exchange and the need to invest in price to gain share. Systems investments are on track but will see big changes this year and management warns of potential \u201cbumps in the road\u201d.

                "bodyText":"There aren\u2019t many things upon which Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump agree, especially as they court very different Delaware voters ahead of a primary on Tuesday. But the candidates for president share an affinity for the same nondescript two-storey office building in Wilmington. A building that has become famous for helping tens of thousands of companies avoid hundreds of millions of dollars in tax through the so-called \u201cDelaware loophole\u201d. The receptionist at 1209 North Orange Street isn\u2019t surprised that a journalist has turned up unannounced on a sunny weekday afternoon. \u201cYou know I can\u2019t speak to you,\u201d she says. A yellow post-it note on her computer screen reads \u201cMEDIA: Chuck Miller\u201d with the phone number of the company\u2019s director of corporate communications. Miller can\u2019t answer many questions either, except to say that the company does not advise clients on their tax affairs. The Guardian is not the first media organisation to turn up at the offices of Corporation Trust Centre, and it\u2019s unlikely to be the last. This squat, yellow brick office building just north of Wilmington\u2019s rundown downtown is the registered address of more than 285,000 companies. That\u2019s more than any other known address in the world, and 15 times more than the 18,000 registered in Ugland House, a five-storey building in the Cayman Islands that Barack Obama called \u201ceither the biggest building in the world, or the biggest tax scam on record\u201d. Officially, 1209 North Orange is home to Apple, American Airlines, Coca-Cola, Walmart and dozens of other companies in the Fortune 500 list of America\u2019s biggest companies. Being registered in Delaware lets companies take advantage of strict corporate secrecy rules, business-friendly courts and the \u201cDelaware loophole\u201d, which can allow companies to legally shift earnings from other states to Delaware, where they are not taxed on non-physical incomes generated outside of the state. The loophole is said to have cost other states more than $9bn in lost taxes over the past decade and led to Delaware to be described as \u201cone of the world\u2019s biggest havens for tax avoidance and evasion\u201d. But it\u2019s not just big corporations that have chosen to make 1209 North Orange their official home. Both the leading candidates for president \u2013 Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump \u2013 have companies registered at 1209 North Orange, and have refused to explain why. Clinton, who has repeatedly promised that as president she will crack down on \u201coutrageous tax havens and loopholes that super-rich people across the world are exploiting in Panama and elsewhere\u201d, collected more than $16m in public speaking fees and book royalties in 2014 through the doors of 1209, according to the Clintons\u2019 tax return. Just eight days after stepping down as secretary of state in February 2013, Clinton registered ZFS Holdings LLC at CTC\u2019s offices. Bill Clinton set up WJC LLC, a vehicle to collect his consultation fees, at the same address in 2008. A spokesman for Clinton said: \u201cZFS was set up when Secretary Clinton left the State Department as an entity to manage her book and speaking income. No federal, state, or local taxes were saved by the Clintons as a result of this structure.\u201d The Clintons\u2019 companies share the office with several of Trump\u2019s companies.

I don\u2019t feel at all guilty, OK?\u201d Among them are 40 Wall Street Corporation, Trump\u2019s 72-storey downtown tower that was the tallest building in the world for two months in 1930, and the Trump Carousel in Central Park. The Trump campaign did not respond to questions about whether Trump was using Delaware in order to avoid taxes in New York. It is not unusual for rich individuals and companies to register their business in Delaware due to the ease of company formation in the state, but the Clintons\u2019 and Trump\u2019s companies in the state are likely to come under greater scrutiny as the US presidential primary roadshow rolls into the state on Tuesday.

                "bodyText":"After Apple\u2019s disappointing sales figures overnight, a number of iPhone suppliers have felt some of the backlash. Arm, a weak market of late is an exception, recovering from an early fall to 915p to add 7.5p to 935p. But Imagination Technologies is down 5p or 3% at 157.75p and Laird is 4.4p or 1.2% lower at 354p. After 13 years of revenue growth the US technology group reported a 13% decline in quarterly sales, with the iPhone suffering its worst ever quarterly drop in sales. It also warned it expected sales in the next quarter to be lower than the forecast $47bn, sending its shares 6% lower in after hours trading. Liberum analysts said: Amongst the UK suppliers, Imagination is most exposed ( around 50% of revenue from Apple), followed by Laird (17%) and Arm (above 10%) We already forecast a 25% year on year decline in Imagination\u2019s graphics royalties in the second half of 2016 (ended April 2016) and believe new management set guidance conservatively when numbers were reduced. We also believe investors should focus on Imagination\u2019s design wins with MediaTek and Spreadtrum which ramp in 2017 and should be very material to revenue (hundreds of millions of incremental royalty units versus Imagination\u2019s graphics royalties of 458m at present). On the call Apple also said they were increasingly looking at M&amp;A and we believe Imagination could be a target once again in time. Regarding Laird we believe the expected rebound in the second half may now be at risk and investors could start to focus on Laird\u2019s leverage - 2.3 times net debt/EBITDA which is high for a business with consumer electronics exposure. Regarding ARM, Apple\u2019s results show that the smartphone market is slowing rapidly and around 65% of ARM\u2019s royalty revenue comes from smartphones. Given Arm reports in arrears it also sees the weakness a quarter after its customers. [We] would sell Arm, be increasingly cautious on Laird and use weakness to buy Imagination ahead MediaTek and Spreadtrum ramps.

By division, Argos EBIT of \u00a383.1m was around 5% ahead of consensus expectations owing to better opex while Homebase EBIT of \u00a323.5m missed consensus expectations of \u00a328m. The year-end cash balance was \u00a3623m while the underlying financing net cash position, excluding the impact of the Homebase transaction, was broadly flat year on year at around \u00a3309m.",
