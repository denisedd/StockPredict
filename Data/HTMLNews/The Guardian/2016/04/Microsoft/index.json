As with the Scottish Referendum, we will communicate as much as is prudent about those plans in advance of any risk materialising and as comprehensively as possible once risks have dissipated. </p> <p>The Bank published a detailed, comprehensive report last year which reviewed the how EU membership affects the Bank of England\u2019s ability to achieve its objectives.</p> </blockquote> <p>And he added that there are risks:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Some elements of these risks may be beginning to manifest.</p> <p>Since November, the trade-weighted value of sterling has fallen 10%, with more than half of that occurring since the MPC\u2019s last forecast in February. </p> <p>The cost of buying protection against a marked depreciation of sterling has risen notably, with sterling risk reversals falling to their lowest level in over a decade.</p> </blockquote> <p>He added: <br></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>A vote to leave the EU might result in an extended period of uncertainty about the economic outlook, including about the prospects for export growth.

He said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Buy-to-let mortgages increased by 11.5% last year and now account for 17% of the stock of total secured lending, twice the proportion of a decade ago. The PRA has just reviewed the plans of the 31 top lenders in the industry, representing over 90% of total buy-to-let lending. The Review revealed that some banks were applying weaker standards and highlighted the risk that more might do so to meet aggressive growth plans. In response, the PRA has clarified its expectations for buy-to-let underwriting standards and introduced new guidelines for minimum stressed interest rates to be used when lenders test affordability. </p> <p>Given the combination of this prudent reinforcement of underwriting standards and major tax changes now coming into force, the FPC has decided to take no further action at this stage but will continue to monitor potential threats to financial stability from buy-to-let. </p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-04-19T14:45:29.470Z\">at

downturn in March raises some questions, says Rob Carnell of ING:</p> <blockquote> <p>With talk of recession in the US economy beginning to gain traction again ahead of what will probably be a very weak first quarter GDP release next week (just after the April Federal Reserve Open Markets Committee meeting), we are looking for evidence on either side of the argument to help us update our forecasts and confirm or deny the recession argument.</p> <p>We feel the evidence for recession is quite circumstantial, with both weak and strong patches within the US economy. But one of those stronger patches has been the US home building sector, and this has taken a big dent in March. </p> <p>Housing starts fell by 8.8% month on month in March, with permits falling 7.7% month on month. Both single family and multifamily home starts were down sharply, though thanks to strong growth in January and February, this will merely dampen the boost to first quarter GDP growth from residential construction, not overturn it.</p> <p>But with permits providing a forward indication for weak second quarter residential construction, our conviction that what we are seeing is just one of the usual soft-patches in US data, not anything more alarming, is coming under pressure.</p> <p>We have been consistently below the recently cut consensus forecasts for US GDP growth (2.0% for 2016) and remain so even now (ING forcast 1.9%for 2016). But the likelihood of a really weak first quarter 2016 GDP forecast means that we will almost inevitably have to trim our figures further. Something closer to 1.5% for the full-year would be more consistent with the sorts of numbers published for first quarter GDP by the NowCasters, even assuming a recovery to the 2-2.5% range for the rest of the year. </p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5716299de4b057c2bbe00b2d\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-04-19T13:07:43.877Z\">2.07pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"48de6419de9c55feb4f546d1e3d873da494252b2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/48de6419de9c55feb4f546d1e3d873da494252b2/0_0_2000_1250/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Argentina flag\" width=\"1000\" height=\"625\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p><strong>Argentina is about to make a triumphant return to the bond markets, 15 years after defaulting on its debts.</strong></p> <p>After being swamped with interest, Buenos Aires has bumped up its new sale of three, five, 10 and 30-year bonds. </p> <p>It initially planned to raise $15bn, but is now going to sell<strong> $16.5bn</strong> of debt after receiving $65bn of bids from investors hungry for returns.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/BTabrum/status/722406306565472256\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">That Argentine deal &#39;capped at $15bn&#39; is in fact going to be $16.5bn</p>&mdash; Burnett Tabrum (@BTabrum) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BTabrum/status/722406306565472256\">April 19, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>It\u2019s a victory for Argentine President Mauricio Macri, who has worked hard to reach a deal with the country\u2019s lenders - such as vulture funds who bought Argentinian debt after its defaulted.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.yahoo.com/news/argentina-reaches-deal-debt-vulture-funds-mediator-155544401.html?ref=gs\">Cutting a deal with such predatory investors can\u2019t be pleasant</a>, but it does allow Argentina to borrow from the markets again. </p> <p><strong>Mihir Kapadia, CEO at Sun Global Investment, argues it\u2019s an important development:</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\u201cThe success of the issue is seen as an endorsement of new president Macri, as it is a huge step forwards with regards to improving Argentina\u2019s financial credibility.\u201d</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57162559e4b0585020da6e19\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-04-19T12:43:31.406Z\">1.43pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Oh dear.

                "bodyText":"As oil prices continued to climb, as the strike in Kuwait outweighed concerns that the weekend meeting of producers failed to agree a cap on output, stock markets moved sharply higher once more. Commodity companies were among the leading risers, and positive results from the likes of L\u2019Oreal also helped sentiment. Silver soared as Chinese buyers moved in, dragging gold along with it. Joe Rundle, head of trading at ETX Capital, said: Gold\u2019s rally this year is finally feeding through to silver, which jumped to a 10-month high today. It\u2019s partly a correction in the usual gold-silver trading ratio, as silver has been lagging gold a bit this year and investors feel it needs to catch up. This could be a trend that continues. Longer term silver ought to outperform gold through better fundamentals as it has more industrial uses. The FTSE 100 hit a new fourth month high, reaching its best level since early December, while the MSCI All World index hit a similar peak. French and German markets remained strong, despite some less convincing gains on Wall Street. The final scores in Europe showed: The FTSE 100 finished up 51.83 points or 0.82% at 6405.35 Germany\u2019s Dax jumped 2.27% to 10,349.59 France\u2019s Cac closed 1.32% higher at 4566.48 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB rose 0.49% to 18,447.98 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended 1.01% better at 8971.3 In Greece, the Athens market added 0.78% to 578.85 On Wall Street the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently 23 points or 0.13% higher. Meanwhile Brent crude is up 2.54% at $44 a barrel. On that note, it\u2019s time to close for the evening. Thanks for your comments, and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. To sum up, Bank of England governor Mark Carney has warned in a Lords committee that leaving the EU could lead to lower economic growth. He defended the Bank commenting on the referendum, saying it was its duty to weigh up the implications of Britain\u2019s membership, but that did not mean it was getting involved in politics. He said UK interest rates could get closer to zero, but said he had no appetite for negative rates. He played down fears of a new round of complex financial instruments similar to those which caused the crash, but said the bank continued to monitor the risks. [And not everything on the original topics for discussion appeared to come up.....] And with that the session ends. Q: How will you pursue climate change agenda [after Paris agreement]? The most important aspect for the Bank is we are regulator of insurance, re-insurance sector. Climate change is one of most important things they have to manage, and they do it well. As regulator, we have to make sure they are on top of it. The bigger risk for financial system is the transition of regulatory environment to move to low carbon environment, and whether it is smooth or abrupt. We will not tell banks to have larger capital requirements if you lend to a larger carbon emitter, we will not put price on carbon. But if there is a prospect of meeting Paris agreement, there will be an adjustment for businesses. The basis point is there needs to be a market in transitions, appropriate disclosure by companies what there strategy is and what their carbon footprint is. Whatever your view, we are agnostic, but you can\u2019t express those views across broader financial world because you don\u2019t have the information Q: How high could interest rates go without doing damage? We do surveys on this. The good news is indebtedness is down. It would have an impact, it\u2019s been a long time since interest rates have moved up. But the position has undoubtedly improved. And when banks are making mortgage decisions, they have affordability tests, including if interest rates go up. Q: Any forward guidance on when we\u2019ll hit 2%? No. [laughs] Q: On the housing market, lenders are edging up to higher loan to value lending, are you still concerned about housing market. The indebtedness of British households has gone down but it still high. It is one of the major risks we watch at MPC, and we watch higher loan to value. Q: what is the risk of house prices coming down in London. We don\u2019t look at housing prices, we look at indebtedness, says Carney. At the higher end [of the London housing market] there has been a move, in terms of negative interest [in property], which could feed through to prices. But I [repeat] there is a degree of uncertainty ahead of EU vote. On productivity Carney says a lack of confidence in future growth is an increasing drag on productivity and investment in the UK and other major countries. Q: Are economic statistics fit for purpose? I commend Charlie Beans review of ONS. It addresses a number of everyday issues where ONS could improve. We work closely with ONS. The most interesting thing of the review is where it draws attention to the undermeasurement of the digital economy. 30 basis points of growth could be missed because of mismeasurement. One of the components of the report is to give ONS greater access to the data we have, subject to confidentiality. Q: So is the CPI an accurate reflection of inflation? We had concerns of move to CPIH, housing move, because we had concerns about rental market. We have to continue to update the inflation basket, he says, but we do have confidence CPI is representative of inflation facing British households. Q: Hasn\u2019t QE caused some of these problems? Is there a danger you will move bubbles elsewhere? This economy has needed monetary stimulus for some time, since the crisis, says Carney. The degree of stimulus has often been less than it appeared; relative to where interest rates needed to go, stimulus has been modest. [With low interest rates] this is an environment where risk can build, in housing market, in infrastructure. We have to act to take out risk where we can. On buy to let, we decided not to take additional action. Tax changes have been considerable, and we want to see how that plays out. These risks build up, we have to be nimble about them. Q: Before the crash banks were issuing very complex instruments. Are you concerned there are trillions of dollars worth of very similar instruments backed by corporate loans in last few years? Instruments which were most problematic were securitisations of securitisations, Carney says. Single securitisation is a reasonable financial instrument But any time something in finance grows rapidly, we should look at it. That\u2019s why we are looking at buy to let because its growing rapidly. Are you confident its not a repeat [of previous problems]? More likely to relate to underlying creditworthiness of issuing entities. Q: Your predecessor said regulation has become too complex. It has become enormous, what is your view. UK is one of most advanced economies in world, a highly complex economy. This isn\u2019t a simple world of barter and agrarian economies, and we shouldn\u2019t go back to that. Banks need to perform functions [which are complex]. The question with regulation whether we blend it with simpler cross checks and take out complexity where we can and with judgement [rather than box ticking]. Part of this process of addressing too complex to fail, is about making sure the institution itself is resolvable - ringfencing is one example. Q: So does regulation make common sense? The common sense elements are the decisive elements. There are some unhelpful and complex regulations, but we have to strip them out. Question: What challenges to financial stability do you see from integration of euro area? What is your assessment of negative interest rates? What do you think of helicopter money? There is a risk is that the process of deepening integration [could] restrict our ability to do our job and deliver financial stability. Crucial to recognise this is a multi-currency union, there must be different degrees of integration, national authorities must have flexibility. We think we could move base rate closer to zero but have not said we have an appetite for negative interest rates. I am not a believer in concept of helicopter money. In effect a central bank cancels debt that is purchased [from government], it puts a hole in its bank sheet. Government never has to recapitalise bank. We create a fundamental problem with reserves on which we have to pay interest, which is not a problem when rates are low, but becomes one when take away stimulus. We do not have an asset on the other side, you end up with a compounded ponzi scheme. Q: are you saying London would be less dominant financial centre if we left the EU. Depends on the negotiations, says Carney, but it is less likely London would remain as a pre-eminent financial centre [if UK left]. City of London unlikely to be enhanced [by Brexit]. Q: Do you agree with Chancellor that Brexit would lead to higher mortgages? Did he consult with Bank? Chancellor did not consult, he is not a member of the MPC, says Carney. There are scenarios where we could have lower GDP and higher inflation, which has implications in terms of higher bank rate, he says. A second factor is bank funding costs, which are passed on to consumers. Risk premium could increase after vote, he says, which would increase funding costs. So two factors which could have an effect and point in the direction of higher mortgage rates. Question: you said Chinese slowdown was greater risk to economy than EU referendum. Still agree? Yes, in medium term the issues are considerable, it depends how they are handled by Chinese authorities. Question: having a complicated financial system is inviting problems, but there is no real attempt to reduce complexity, is there? There are a series of reforms that have sought to reduce complexity, including ringfencing banking, says Carney. With Lehman and Bear Stearns it was not clear how they were linked, Carney indicates. Settling trades through central counterparties helps [with clarity]. On migration, Carney says that older workers staying longer in the workforce has swamped the effect of higher migration to the the UK. Net migration was likely to become more important as the effect of the increase in older workers is exhausted. The effects of migration on wage levels are not material for the Bank of England. More Carney on the uncertainties around the referendum: We will comment on these risks when we have a policy meeting and they come up, but we will not comment through the purdah period of the EU referendum campaign. A reminder: more on Carney\u2019s EU comments in the politics live blog: Carney says there is no intention for the Bank to provide a commentary on that or any other EU analysis. Lord Hollick asks his view on Monday\u2019s Treasury assessment. Carney says it is an analysis of a specific event rather than a Bank economic forecast. The Bank did not take part and it is up to the Treasury to discuss the analysis. But it is a sound analysis, the broad approach makes sense. Carney: Whatever the outcome of the Referendum, the MPC would use its tools to achieve its inflation remit, and, more broadly, the Bank\u2019s policy committees will work in concert, as One Bank, to promote monetary and financial stability. On the EU referendum, Carney says the Bank has not made and will not make any overall assessment of the economics of the UK\u2019s membership of the EU. But he added: At the same time, the Bank must assess the implications of the UK\u2019s EU membership for our ability to achieve our core objectives of maintaining monetary and financial stability. The Bank has a duty to report our evidence-based judgments to Parliament and to the public. That is the fundamental standard of an open and transparent central bank. Assessing and reporting major risks does not mean becoming involved in politics; rather it would be political to suppress important judgments which relate directly to the Bank\u2019s remits and which influence our policy actions. These policy actions include developing, and if necessary implementing, contingency plans. As with the Scottish Referendum, we will communicate as much as is prudent about those plans in advance of any risk materialising and as comprehensively as possible once risks have dissipated. The Bank published a detailed, comprehensive report last year which reviewed the how EU membership affects the Bank of England\u2019s ability to achieve its objectives. And he added that there are risks: Some elements of these risks may be beginning to manifest. Since November, the trade-weighted value of sterling has fallen 10%, with more than half of that occurring since the MPC\u2019s last forecast in February. The cost of buying protection against a marked depreciation of sterling has risen notably, with sterling risk reversals falling to their lowest level in over a decade. He added: A vote to leave the EU might result in an extended period of uncertainty about the economic outlook, including about the prospects for export growth. This uncertainty would be likely to push down on demand in the short run. Carney is talking about the housing market, and says growth in mortgage lending is driven solely by the buy to let market. He said: Buy-to-let mortgages increased by 11.5% last year and now account for 17% of the stock of total secured lending, twice the proportion of a decade ago. The PRA has just reviewed the plans of the 31 top lenders in the industry, representing over 90% of total buy-to-let lending. The Review revealed that some banks were applying weaker standards and highlighted the risk that more might do so to meet aggressive growth plans. In response, the PRA has clarified its expectations for buy-to-let underwriting standards and introduced new guidelines for minimum stressed interest rates to be used when lenders test affordability. Given the combination of this prudent reinforcement of underwriting standards and major tax changes now coming into force, the FPC has decided to take no further action at this stage but will continue to monitor potential threats to financial stability from buy-to-let. The session is underway. My colleague Andrew Sparrow will be following Bank of England governor Mark Carney\u2019s comments on Brexit at the Lords committee in the politics live blog: Carney\u2019s appearance before the Lords can be seen live here. Mark Carney is up before the House of Lords economic affairs committee this afternoon in its annual meeting with the Bank of England governor. Here\u2019s a quick look at what is expected to be on the agenda: US markets have made a mixed start in early trading, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average up 31 points or 0.18% following the positive lead from Europe and Asia. But Nasdaq has dipped 21 points or 0.47%. Meanwhile Goldman Sachs, which has just reported a drop in revenues and earnings, is up nearly 1%. Gold and silver continue to gain ground, mainly driven by a weak dollar and Chinese buying. Gold is up 2% to a one week high of $1255 an ounce while silver - the main beneficiary of Chinese demand - has jumped 5% to a ten month high of $17.07 an ounce. US housing has been one of the stronger areas of the economy, so a downturn in March raises some questions, says Rob Carnell of ING: With talk of recession in the US economy beginning to gain traction again ahead of what will probably be a very weak first quarter GDP release next week (just after the April Federal Reserve Open Markets Committee meeting), we are looking for evidence on either side of the argument to help us update our forecasts and confirm or deny the recession argument. We feel the evidence for recession is quite circumstantial, with both weak and strong patches within the US economy. But one of those stronger patches has been the US home building sector, and this has taken a big dent in March. Housing starts fell by 8.8% month on month in March, with permits falling 7.7% month on month. Both single family and multifamily home starts were down sharply, though thanks to strong growth in January and February, this will merely dampen the boost to first quarter GDP growth from residential construction, not overturn it. But with permits providing a forward indication for weak second quarter residential construction, our conviction that what we are seeing is just one of the usual soft-patches in US data, not anything more alarming, is coming under pressure. We have been consistently below the recently cut consensus forecasts for US GDP growth (2.0% for 2016) and remain so even now (ING forcast 1.9%for 2016). But the likelihood of a really weak first quarter 2016 GDP forecast means that we will almost inevitably have to trim our figures further. Something closer to 1.5% for the full-year would be more consistent with the sorts of numbers published for first quarter GDP by the NowCasters, even assuming a recovery to the 2-2.5% range for the rest of the year. Argentina is about to make a triumphant return to the bond markets, 15 years after defaulting on its debts. After being swamped with interest, Buenos Aires has bumped up its new sale of three, five, 10 and 30-year bonds. It initially planned to raise $15bn, but is now going to sell $16.5bn of debt after receiving $65bn of bids from investors hungry for returns. It\u2019s a victory for Argentine President Mauricio Macri, who has worked hard to reach a deal with the country\u2019s lenders - such as vulture funds who bought Argentinian debt after its defaulted. Cutting a deal with such predatory investors can\u2019t be pleasant, but it does allow Argentina to borrow from the markets again. Mihir Kapadia, CEO at Sun Global Investment, argues it\u2019s an important development: \u201cThe success of the issue is seen as an endorsement of new president Macri, as it is a huge step forwards with regards to improving Argentina\u2019s financial credibility.\u201d Oh dear. The number of new US house-building projects fell by almost 9% in March, new data shows. Residential housing starts decreased 8.8% to an annual rate of 1.09 million, the lowest since October, according to the Commerce Department. And the number of permits to build a new house also fell, by almost 8%, suggesting America\u2019s construction sector suffered falling demand last month. Traders are selling the US dollar as a result, on the grounds that an early US interest rate rise is less likely. The last three months certainly weren\u2019t a vintage quarter for Goldman Sachs: Lloyd Blankfein, chairman and CEO of Goldman Sachs, says the last three months have been pretty tough. He told shareholders that profits fell over 50% because: \u201cThe operating environment this quarter presented a broad range of challenges, resulting in headwinds across virtually every one of our businesses. \u201cLooking ahead, we will continue to focus on delivering superior service to our clients and managing our business efficiently, which remain essential to generating shareholder value over the long term.\u201d Those \u201cchallenges\u201d includes a drop-off in deal-making (bad for investment bankers), and less demand for share trading from clients due to recent economic uncertainty. This is the fourth consecutive quarterly fall in Goldman\u2019s profits, as its bond traders and investment bankers suffer from tough market conditions. Here\u2019s some instant reaction to Goldman Sachs\u2019 big fall in revenues and profits in the last quarter. https://twitter.com/MattCampbel/status/722390203634159616 Here come Goldman Sachs\u2019 financial results for the last quarter! Goldman has post a big drop in revenues, down from $10.6bn last year to $6.34bn. That\u2019s weaker than the $6.73bn which analysts had expected. And earnings have more than halved during the quarter, at $2.68 per share compared to $5.94 per share in January-March 2015. That beats expectations of $2.45 per share. Goldmand\u2019s income from investment banking income fell by almost a quarter, to $1.46bn. Equities trading suffered a similar decline, to $1.78bn. And CEO Lloyd Blankfein is blunt about market conditions, given market volatility and the lack of big merger deals. Blankfein says Goldman faced a \u201cbroad range of challenges\u201d, with headwinds in almost every one of its business areas. Global stock markets have hit their highest level since last December. The rally in Europe and Asia today, and on Wall Street last night, has pushed MSCI\u2019s All-Country World Stocks index to a four-month high. It\u2019s gained around 12% since early February, when investors were panicking about the slowdown in China and the stability of some European banks. Quite a turnaround, and vindication for those commentators who argued that shareholders should sit tight. The European Commission is gearing up to hit Google with fresh anti-competitive charges, over its Android mobile phone operating system, it appears. The word in Brussels is that European Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager could unveil formal antitrust charges on Wednesday. She\u2019s likely to accuse Google of abusing Android\u2019s dominance to give its own apps an unfair advantage against rivals. The case could echo the clashes with Microsoft more than a decade ago, when Brussels took issue with the software giant\u2019s domination of the desktop PC business. The German stock market is roaring ahead today, jumping by 220 point or 2.2%. Traders in Frankfurt were spurred into action by this morning\u2019s ZEW index, showing a leap in German economic confidence. German manufacturers are leading the rally, such as skincarer maker Beiersdorf (+3.8%), chipmaker Infineon Technologies (+3.3%), and chemicals firm BASF (+2.6%). And Europe\u2019s rally is likely to feed through to New York in a few hours time, potentially pushing the Dow Jones index to a new nine-month high. Connor Campbell of SpreadEx sums up the morning: Doha what? After Monday\u2019s rather tentative trading following the lack of oil action over the weekend the markets have leapt into life this Tuesday, hitting a bevy of fresh highs in the process. The main thrust of the morning\u2019s growth came from the Eurozone, the catalyst for this surge being the day\u2019s ZEW economic sentiment figures. With the German number coming in at 11.2 (against 8.2 expected and 4.3 last month) and the region-wide data at 21.5 (vastly higher than the 13.9 forecast and the 10.6 seen last month) confidence is picking up, despite the very real threat of a Brexit AND a worsening assessment of the German economy. This was the green light the DAX needed to roar in to life, jumping by over 200 points to 10350, within a 150 leap away from a fresh 2016 peak. Greece\u2019s government is resuming talks with its lenders this afternoon over its economic reforms, as the Greek debt crisis threatens to heat up. It\u2019s the first meeting since the International Monetary Fund pushed for Greece\u2019s bailout to be rewritten, to remove unachievable fiscal targets. Greece hasn\u2019t yet convinced its creditors that it has done enough to quality for debt relief, as they wrangle over bad debt rules and pension reforms. The creditors are understood to be pushing for Greece to sign up to extra austerity, in case the bailout programme goes off course. The Wall Street Journal explains: The package would be triggered only if Greece falls short of targets over the next three years. But the proposals, which come on top of a list of austerity measures already being negotiated, would have to be passed into law now\u2014posing a stiff test for the governing coalition of Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras, which has a majority of only three seats in parliament. Economic expectations in German has smashed forecasts, despite worries about Britain\u2019s EU referendum. The ZEW Institute\u2019s German economic sentiment index has surged to 11.2 this month, up from just 4.3 in March. Analysts had expected economic expectations (or Konjunkturerwartungen) to rise to 8. ZEW says recent \u201csurprisingly positive economic news\u201d from China has given investors more confidence about future prospects [Chinese exports surged in February, while the economy grew by a decent 6.7% in the last quarter]. However, German investors are less optimistic about their domestic economy. ZEW says: The assessment of the economic situation in Germany worsened. The index has fallen by 3.0 points and now stands at 47.7 points. And ZEW\u2019s Professor Dr. Sascha Steffen remains cautious, especially with Britain\u2019s Brexit referendum looming. The bottom line, however, the continuing weak growth in China and other key emerging markets remain a burden on the German export industry. The concern about a possible withdrawal from the EU Britain is likely to affect burdensome.\u201d Niels Christensen, foreign exchange strategist at Nordea, says the recovery in oil has sent confidence gushing through the markets: He says (via Reuters) \u201cIt is quite amazing how oil prices have recovered from Monday\u2019s lows. That is shoring up risk appetite and pushing up commodity-linked currencies. \u201cAs long as oil remains above $43 a barrel we think commodity currencies will remain supported.\u201d Brent is currently trading at $43.24 per barrel.... That \u2018party on, dudes\u2019 feeling has driven European stock markets to three-month highs. Consumer goods firms are leading the way after France\u2019s L\u2019Oreal posted solid sales and profit figures this morning. Miners are also up, reflecting the weaker US dollar, while banks are benefitting from more optimism about emerging market economies. This has sent the Stoxx 600 index, the broad measure of European shares, to its highest level since January. And the FTSE 100 is still at its highest level since December, as the City shows some sunny optimism. Mike van Dulken, head of research at Accendo Markets, explains why: \u201cEquity markets are handsomely positive this morning, still benefiting from the oil price rebound as supply disruption from a Kuwaiti strike helps offsets the (misplaced) weekend disappointment from Doha. A weak US dollar following dovish Fed commentary is also keeping commodities and their miners bid while a Dow Jones back at 9-month highs 18,000 and a decent US earnings season so far is maintaining risk appetite. Equities continue to extend their gains from 2016 lows taking headwinds in the stride and preferring to focus on the positives. The workers\u2019 strike that has halved Kuwait\u2019s oil output looks terribly civilised, judging by these photos from Sunday: The oil workers are protesting against cuts to pay and benefits, which Kuwait is enforcing after the slump in oil revenues played havoc with its budget. The Kuwaiti government has urged workers to return to duty, and threatened legal action against the \u201cinstigators\u201d of the walkout. But analysts predict that a compromise will be found. Consultancy group Eurasia says: \u201cSensitive to union pressure, the government is likely to compromise on most of striking oil workers\u2019 pay demands. In the coming days oil production is likely to partially recover from its initial drop as non-striking staff is redistributed and inventories drawn upon. Two of Europe\u2019s better known lager brands are changing hands, as part of the latest mega-deal in the brewing industry. Budweiser brewer Anheuser-Busch InBev is selling Peroni and Grolsch to Japan\u2019s Asahi (the firm behind Super Dry beer), to help smooth its takeover of SAB Miller. London craft brewer Meantime is also being sold to Asahi, less than a year after SAB snapped up the fast-growing company... More here: Sterling crisis, what sterling crisis? The pound has gained almost half a cent this morning to $1.4319, a one-week high. This follows a new opinion poll, giving the Remain campaign a nine point lead in June\u2019s in-out EU referendum. It\u2019s a telephone poll too, which are seen as more accurate (or possibly \u2018less inaccurate\u2019 would be safer) The FTSE 100 has just hit its highest level of the year, up 42 points at 6395. Precious metal prices are rising this morning too. Gold has gained 1% to $1,246 per ounce, while silver has jumped by 3% to a 10-month high. Again, that\u2019s partly due to the weakening US dollar. It has lost ground against most commodity-linked currencies today, reflecting the recovery in the oil price. European stock markets are rising at the start of trading, following Asia\u2019s lead. In London the FTSE 100 has gained 23 points, or 0.4%, to 6377 points. Mining stocks are packing the list of top risers, with Anglo American up 4% and Fresnillo and Glencore both gaining 3%. That\u2019s partly because the US dollar is weaker this morning, which pushes up commodity prices. Investors are also welcoming today\u2019s recovery in the oil price, as Kit Juckes of French bank Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale explains: Brent crude at $40 per baarrel has done a good job of rejecting the notion that without production cuts it\u2019s going to hell in a hand basket. Unless we can un-invent the technology gains of the last few years we won\u2019t see dramatic upside and if the upshot is that oil prices settle into a range and better still, the correlation between non oil-producing countries currencies and the price of oil falls away, then that\u2019s even better. In the meantime, the oil market\u2019s willingness to get back to business as usual has been greeted by a loud cry of \u2018Party On, Dudes\u2019 in equity markets. An \u2018excellent\u2019 film reference from Kit... Yesterday\u2019s oil price slide has been completely wiped out: The recovery in the oil price has helped to drive stock markets higher in Asia. Japan\u2019s Nikkei led the way with a 3.7% rally, helped by the yen weakening against the US dollar (good news for Japanese exporters). That wipes out yesterday\u2019s selloff, when investors sold heavily following the huge earthquakes that killed at least 42 people and shuttered factories. Australia\u2019s S&amp;P/500 index gained 1%, Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng finished 0.8% higher, and there were small gains in Shanghai too. This pushed the MSCI index of Asian markets to its highest level since last November. Asian investors were also cheered by the sight of the US stock market rallying last night. Hiroki Allen, of Superfund Securities Japan says: \u201cThe effects of the Dow reaching a nine-month high created a buying trend that helped lift the Nikkei today.\u201d The oil price is rallying this morning as world markets put the debacle of Sunday\u2019s Opec meeting behind them. Brent crude has risen to $43.23, up 0.75%, adding to last night\u2019s late rally. US crude oil is up almost 1%, back over $40. The rally appears to be driven by industrial action in Kuwait, where oil workers have been on strike since Sunday in a protest against public sector reforms which will cut their earnings. The walkout has slashed Kuwait\u2019s output by 60%, or 1.7 million barrels per day -- effectively eliminating the surplus crude in world markets. This has taken traders\u2019 minds off the deadlock between Iran and Saudi Arabia, which scuppered attempts to freeze output last weekend. Ironically, Kuwait\u2019s oil workers have done what the oil ministers and governors of Opec failed to achieve. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Today, we get a new healthcheck on economic confidence in Europe\u2019s largest economy, and hear from the UK\u2019s top central banker. Germany ZEW index, released at 10am BST, is expected to show that economic sentiment among German investors and analysts rose this month, following the recent recovery in the markets. That will help set the scene for the European Central Bank meeting on Thursday. Mark Carney, governor of the Bank of England, will give his own view of the general economic outlook this afternoon. He\u2019s testifying to the House of Lords Economic Affairs Committee from 3.30pm. On the agenda: China\u2019s econony, the risks posed by Britain\u2019s EU referendum, and the revelations in the Panama Papers. On the corporate front, we\u2019ll get results from Goldman Sachs at 12.30pm BST. The Wall Street titan is tipped to post lower revenues and profits, as IB Times explains: The bank, which recently agreed to pay out over $5 billion to settle allegations related to the sale of subprime mortgage to investors between 2005 and 2007, is also forecast to report a 36.6 percent year-on-year drop in revenue, to $6.73 billion in the first three months of 2016 from $10.6 billion. Goldman\u2019s pretax profit is also expected to take a hit and is likely to drop to $1.87 billion from $3.93 billion in the first quarter of 2015. We also get some new US construction data at 1.30pm. That\u2019ll show how many new housing permits were granted last month, and how many actually started being built. We\u2019ll be tracking all the main events through the day....",

The idea that individuals could be asked to find up to \u00a310,000 to help fund a deal is alarming. The buyout plan was rejected by Tata on commercial grounds. Other potential backers may take a more optimistic view but any purchase would be high risk; it could hardly be otherwise. This is not suitable territory for a whip-round among non-management employees. In any case, such sums would be a pittance in the context of the required capital. If the financial backing exists, great; if it doesn\u2019t, don\u2019t ask staff to risk any part of their savings. Let\u2019s hope Sir Terry Matthews, the Welsh billionaire helping the MBO consortium, appreciates the point. His hero status would evaporate in an instant if workers\u2019 cash were lost in a perilous adventure. If the government eventually ends up chipping in cash or loans to support an MBO \u2013 still a very big if \u2013 it should insist the \u00a310,000 idea is dropped immediately. A mixture of taxpayers\u2019 cash and steelworkers\u2019 life savings just isn\u2019t sensible. Shareholders are not holding back We\u2019ve seen shareholder rebellions over pay in the past \u2013 2012 was the last vintage crop \u2013 but one old-hand FTSE 100 chairman reports that something is different this time. First, fund managers are giving less feedback to pay committees on what they think. Second, unhappy institutional shareholders are no longer registering their disapproval with an abstention and are instead going straight to the \u201cagainst\u201d box. Both factors seemed to play a part at BP last Thursday. At the start of the week, the old company was braced for a 25% rebellion, not the 59% it got. And formal abstentions were few: just 464m votes versus 6.8bn against. The mining firm Anglo American holds its annual meeting on Thursday and the chief beef is the number of share options granted to executives at a price that may turn out to be the bottom of the commodities market. The whisper suggests a rebellion of about a third of Anglo shareholders. If the figure is higher, the mood has definitely changed. Fund managers\u2019 new behaviour \u2013 if that\u2019s what it is \u2013 makes life harder for boards but is very welcome. Companies\u2019 traditional pre-vote tactic of softening up fund managers behind the scenes was always an unedifying game of calling in favours. Better to get the decisions right at the outset. And, if fund managers have decided abstentions are a waste of time, it\u2019s about time. Votes like BP\u2019s last week are merely advisory. If you can\u2019t form a definite opinion in a poll that obliges a company to do precisely nothing, you don\u2019t deserve to be managing other people\u2019s money.",
