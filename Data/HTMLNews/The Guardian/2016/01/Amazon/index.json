It added that the two businesses had complementary product offers which they would be able to deliver to shoppers at home or for pick-up in stores. It is understood that Sainsbury\u2019s is interested in Argos\u2019s delivery network and IT systems which it believes will help it take on Amazon, the US online retailer which is increasing its presence in the UK grocery market. Home Retail, which is scheduled to release trading figures next Thursday, said it had rejected Sainsbury\u2019s approach because it \u201cundervalued Home Retail Group and its long-term prospects\u201d. Sainsbury\u2019s bid comes at a time when all the UK\u2019s major supermarket chains are under pressure as people increasingly buy their weekly shop online or pick up groceries from small neighbourhood stores.

Rumours of a bid for Home Retail have been circulating since November after the company issued a profit warning ahead of the Black Friday discount day. Shares dived 16%, wiping \u00a3200m off the value retailer in October as Home Retail said it could not be sure whether the millions it had invested in a new same-day delivery service for Argos, including new vans and a high-profile advertising campaign, would bear fruit. Since then, Argos has faced heavy criticism from shoppers as its distribution network and website struggled to cope with demand in the run up to Christmas. A number of private equity firms were thought to be considering an offer for the Argos and Homebase owner. French DIY chain Leroy Merlin and a former boss of the Garden Centre Group, Nicholas Marshall, were both said to be eyeing a bid for Homebase alone.

He said Rowe had a \u201cunifying, collegiate approach\u201d and was a \u201cwelcome change\u201d. \u201cHe is an old school, down to earth, merchant,\u201d said Hyman. But he added: \u201cHe inherits a damaged fashion brand in the toughest market we have ever seen.\u201d Rowe will be paid a salary of \u00a3810,000, less than Bolland\u2019s last disclosed salary of \u00a3975,000 for 2014-15. The new CEO will receive the same variable financial incentives as his predecessor but all other terms, including his pension allowance, remain unchanged. Clive Black at Shore Capital described Bolland as \u201c a distinguished commercial statesman\u201d, who had done a lot of work behind the shopfronts to modernise the M&amp;S business.",

                "body":"<p>Genius or madness? That\u2019s what one City analyst wondered when news of Sainsbury\u2019s bid approach to Home Retail Group, owner of Argos and Homebase, broke last week. Madness \u2013 or, at the very least, an unnecessary distraction \u2013 concluded most observers.</p> <p>Isn\u2019t Argos in mortal danger from the relentless march of Amazon? Isn\u2019t Sainsbury\u2019s itself trying to keep its ahead above water in a grocery market suffering deflation, discounting and maybe disruption from the same Amazonian monster?</p> <p>As for Homebase, Sainsbury\u2019s doesn\u2019t seem to want to own it anyway. It might flip the DIY chain to a new owner as quickly as it can, introducing another uncertainty into the arithmetic of the deal.</p> <p>In other words, Mike Coupe, Sainsbury\u2019s chief executive, faces a tough task convincing his own shareholders of the wisdom of paying \u00a31bn-plus to build what the supermarket chain called \u201can integrated multi-channel proposition\u201d spanning food and non-food lines. It was only the target\u2019s shareholders (if not their board \u2013 yet) who seemed outright enthusiastic \u2013 but any takeover bid at a half-decent premium will feel like sweet relief after last year\u2019s halving of Home Retail\u2019s share price.</p> <p>But is the logic of a Sainsbury\u2019s/Argos combo really so daft, though? Actually, probably not. There are two arguments \u2013 one short-term, one long-term \u2013 for why Coupe may be on to something and why the inevitable upheaval for his staff may prove to be worth the risk.</p> <p>The short-term appeal is that 40% of Argos leases expire in the next four years. That presents an early opportunity to close those shops and open a replacement Argos unit within the nearest Sainsbury\u2019s supermarket, many of which have surplus space. There could be about 350 such units within a few years. If all Argos punters stay loyal, there are two benefits: you make a big saving on rent but keep all the custom; and some of the Argos punters may pick up a few groceries while they collect their toasters, toys and gadgets. Ten experimental Argos concessions within Sainsbury\u2019s stores are said to have traded well in the past year.</p> <p>The long-term benefit is woollier \u2013 but perhaps more significant if Sainsbury\u2019s analysis is correct. It is the idea that, in the \u201cmulti-channel\u201d age, speed and ease of delivery are retailers\u2019 best weapons.</p> <p>Facing up to the Amazon threat, Argos has developed a same-day delivery service, albeit not without hiccups. If those deliveries could be diverted to a Sainsbury\u2019s store, if the customer wishes, another 1,300 pick-up points would join the network. The philosophy clearly works for the John Lewis Partnership, the department store and Waitrose group.</p> <p>Do such advantages amount to genius? Not without hard numbers to support them. Sainsbury\u2019s shareholders should demand several details before they support any takeover terms Coupe and chairman David Tyler can agree with the Home Retail board. What is the real size of the rental saving from closing Argos stores? How quickly could it be secured? How many Argos stores would have to be closed in addition? What is the uplift in sales at those 10 Sainsbury\u2019s stores with Argos units? How much would Homebase fetch, realistically? Can Sainsbury\u2019s balance sheet stand the strain of a takeover funded partly in cash? And, most importantly, how much extra investment would be required to integrate IT systems and back-office logistics?</p> <p>If Coupe can provide credible answers on all those points, investors should support the adventure. The merger between Dixons and Carphone Warehouse, which has enjoyed a successful first year, is one concrete example of mutually beneficial piece of deal-making.</p> <p>A Sainsbury\u2019s/Argos combination sounds more unlikely on paper \u2013 the customer stereotypes are miles apart \u2013 but it might just work. Indeed, if it had been proposed a decade ago, it would have laughed out of court but, as it turns out, it would been exactly in tune with shifting shopping habits in the 21st century.</p> <h2>Wind of change in Saudi Arabia?</h2> <p>The Saudi government has lobbed a hand grenade into the debate on the future of oil prices by proposing the stock market flotation of its corporate crown jewel, Saudi Aramco.</p> <p>The possibility that a multitrillion-dollar oil and gas giant could be prepared for an initial public offering will have western investment bankers booking air tickets to Riyadh 10 to the dozen as they vie for a potential bonanza of advice work.

                "bodyText":"Genius or madness? That\u2019s what one City analyst wondered when news of Sainsbury\u2019s bid approach to Home Retail Group, owner of Argos and Homebase, broke last week. Madness \u2013 or, at the very least, an unnecessary distraction \u2013 concluded most observers. Isn\u2019t Argos in mortal danger from the relentless march of Amazon? Isn\u2019t Sainsbury\u2019s itself trying to keep its ahead above water in a grocery market suffering deflation, discounting and maybe disruption from the same Amazonian monster? As for Homebase, Sainsbury\u2019s doesn\u2019t seem to want to own it anyway. It might flip the DIY chain to a new owner as quickly as it can, introducing another uncertainty into the arithmetic of the deal. In other words, Mike Coupe, Sainsbury\u2019s chief executive, faces a tough task convincing his own shareholders of the wisdom of paying \u00a31bn-plus to build what the supermarket chain called \u201can integrated multi-channel proposition\u201d spanning food and non-food lines. It was only the target\u2019s shareholders (if not their board \u2013 yet) who seemed outright enthusiastic \u2013 but any takeover bid at a half-decent premium will feel like sweet relief after last year\u2019s halving of Home Retail\u2019s share price. But is the logic of a Sainsbury\u2019s/Argos combo really so daft, though? Actually, probably not. There are two arguments \u2013 one short-term, one long-term \u2013 for why Coupe may be on to something and why the inevitable upheaval for his staff may prove to be worth the risk. The short-term appeal is that 40% of Argos leases expire in the next four years. That presents an early opportunity to close those shops and open a replacement Argos unit within the nearest Sainsbury\u2019s supermarket, many of which have surplus space. There could be about 350 such units within a few years. If all Argos punters stay loyal, there are two benefits: you make a big saving on rent but keep all the custom; and some of the Argos punters may pick up a few groceries while they collect their toasters, toys and gadgets. Ten experimental Argos concessions within Sainsbury\u2019s stores are said to have traded well in the past year. The long-term benefit is woollier \u2013 but perhaps more significant if Sainsbury\u2019s analysis is correct. It is the idea that, in the \u201cmulti-channel\u201d age, speed and ease of delivery are retailers\u2019 best weapons. Facing up to the Amazon threat, Argos has developed a same-day delivery service, albeit not without hiccups. If those deliveries could be diverted to a Sainsbury\u2019s store, if the customer wishes, another 1,300 pick-up points would join the network. The philosophy clearly works for the John Lewis Partnership, the department store and Waitrose group. Do such advantages amount to genius? Not without hard numbers to support them. Sainsbury\u2019s shareholders should demand several details before they support any takeover terms Coupe and chairman David Tyler can agree with the Home Retail board. What is the real size of the rental saving from closing Argos stores? How quickly could it be secured? How many Argos stores would have to be closed in addition? What is the uplift in sales at those 10 Sainsbury\u2019s stores with Argos units? How much would Homebase fetch, realistically? Can Sainsbury\u2019s balance sheet stand the strain of a takeover funded partly in cash? And, most importantly, how much extra investment would be required to integrate IT systems and back-office logistics? If Coupe can provide credible answers on all those points, investors should support the adventure. The merger between Dixons and Carphone Warehouse, which has enjoyed a successful first year, is one concrete example of mutually beneficial piece of deal-making. A Sainsbury\u2019s/Argos combination sounds more unlikely on paper \u2013 the customer stereotypes are miles apart \u2013 but it might just work. Indeed, if it had been proposed a decade ago, it would have laughed out of court but, as it turns out, it would been exactly in tune with shifting shopping habits in the 21st century. Wind of change in Saudi Arabia? The Saudi government has lobbed a hand grenade into the debate on the future of oil prices by proposing the stock market flotation of its corporate crown jewel, Saudi Aramco. The possibility that a multitrillion-dollar oil and gas giant could be prepared for an initial public offering will have western investment bankers booking air tickets to Riyadh 10 to the dozen as they vie for a potential bonanza of advice work. Western oil majors and Asian state-owned energy groups likewise will wet their lips at possibly gaining access to some of the world\u2019s cheapest and largest oil and gas reserves. Shell would surely have kept the $7bn it wasted on high-cost and high-risk Arctic exploration had it known there might be a possibility of spending it on a chunk of Aramco, which has 650bn barrels of reserves (10 times those of ExxonMobil). Meanwhile, oil traders wonder what it means for future oil prices given that the Saudis have been instrumental in driving down global crude values by refusing to countenance a cut in Opec production targets. Will that strategy change? Certainly you would not choose to sell a commodity-based business at a time when prices have fallen 70% in 18 months and with stock market valuations for the sector on the floor. At least part of the rationale of an IPO is to raise cash for the Saudi exchequer at a time when the country has seen a rising national budget deficit due to the collapse in its vital oil revenues. Or is it designed to show that the state is prepared to make its sacrifices as it has recently cut subsidies in domestic fuel prices? Or are the Saudis preparing to battle it out with US shale producers long-term by keeping Aramco production high? As with all things Saudi, there is scant information, just a clear statement of intent and backing from the king\u2019s powerful son, Prince Mohammed bin Salman, that an IPO is being seriously considered for a company previously thought one of the least likely to be put into private hands. But if an IPO is to attract western investors, the Saudis will have to share decision-making and break an addiction to secrecy. Can they do that?

However, Sainsbury\u2019s looks set to return with a new offer after it gave an extensive presentation to the City on Wednesday on why a tie-up with Argos made sense. The supermarket is trying to persuade its shareholders to back a cash-and-shares deal before 2 February. Under Takeover Panel rules it must make a new offer or walk awayby that deadline. Shares in Home Retail rose nearly 5% on Wednesday to 148p on improved hopes for a Sainsbury\u2019s deal while the supermarket\u2019s shares slipped 1.4% to 248p as investors remained sceptical about the benefits of a merger. Sainsbury\u2019s plans were given a boost as it revealed that sales over Christmas were better than expected in the latest sign that Britain\u2019s supermarkets are starting to fight back against the German discounters Aldi and Lidl. Sales at Britain\u2019s second largest supermarket chain were still lower than the previous year, falling by 0.4% in the 15 weeks to 9 January, but ahead of analysts\u2019 expectations of 0.7% slide. Reporting the figures, the company\u2019s chief executive, Mike Coupe, insisted Sainsbury\u2019s relatively strong performance showed its management team would not be distracted by the group\u2019s \u00a31bn bid approach for Home Retail. As he laid out the logic of the potential bid, Coupe predicted improvement in the grocery market, saying there were \u201cunderlying signs of better news for the supermarket sector\u201d and that \u201cthe tide has gone out as far as it is going\u201d. Sainsbury\u2019s said its third-quarter performance meant the group expected sales at established stores to be better in the second half of the year than in the first. Industry figures on Tuesday suggested the big grocers were doing better against Aldi and Lidl, which have increased their market share in recent years. Morrisons announced a surprise sales increase at established stores over Christmas. Coupe said feedback from shareholders on the potential bid for Home Retail had so far had been \u201cvery balanced\u201d \u2013 suggesting the supermarket does not have full support for the bid. Sainsbury\u2019s biggest shareholder, the Qatari Investment Authority, is understood to be uneasy about any share-based offer. Coupe said that investors had not yet seen all the financial details of any bid and so were not in a position to make a final judgment. John Rogers, Sainsbury\u2019s finance director, said: \u201cWe think this is a strategically compelling opportunity and, if it is at the right price, financially compelling.\u201d He and Coupe said Sainsbury\u2019s would walk away if it could not get a deal at a price it considered affordable. Coupe said the tie-up would create a \u00a36bn non-food business of the same scale as John Lewis, Marks &amp; Spencer or Amazon in the UK with the ability to shop in stores, online or via mobile, with delivery to home or for pickup at stores. Sainsbury\u2019s wants to move hundreds of Argos outlets from the high street into its supermarkets, leaving the group with about 2,000 outlets in total. In a 22-page presentation supporting its plans for a bid, the company revealed it had already begun to test out collection points for Argos goods in two of its convenience stores and one small supermarket in addition to the 10 Argos concessions it has opened in large Sainsbury\u2019s outlets. Coupe said extending pick-up points into its small Sainsbury\u2019s stores would take Argos into many more locations than its current 840 outlets.

When GoPro floated its shares on Wall Street in June 2014, there seemed to be no limit to how high they might go. Snapped up at $24 a share by an eager investing public, the shares rocketed to $94 as investors backed the US company\u2019s vision of fun videos and fast-growing revenues. The company was valued at $3bn (\u00a32.1bn) on flotation and its chief executive, Nick Woodman, scooped $86m by selling part of his stake in the deal. This week, the group\u2019s shares lurched dramatically downwards.

                "bodyText":"The like-for-like sales figures used by retailers to outline their performance at Christmas could be masking the financial problems they face and should not be used in isolation, leading auditors have warned. Auditors from the UK\u2019s six largest accountancy firms believe the figures are \u201cnot the best guide to retail success\u201d, according to a report compiled by trade body ICAEW. They said like-for-like sales ignore the cost to retailers of adapting to the online shopping revolution, introducing the \u201cnational living wage\u201d, and sharp currency fluctuations over the past year. The comments are the latest criticism of like-for-like sales, which have become the benchmark in the City for judging the performance of retailers. Like-for-like sales strip out the effects of adding new stores and space over the prior year, meaning a retailer only measures stores that were open a year ago.

Some retailers, most notably Next, do not report like-for-like sales at all. The debate about like-for-like sales is more pronounced in January because it is when retailers reveal details about their performance during the vital Christmas season, normally with no reference to margins or profits. For example, Tesco has been heralded as one of the winners of Christmas after returning to like-for-like sales growth for the first time in four years, but its profit margins have been heavily eroded due to the price war with the discounters Aldi and Lidl. The ICAEW has called for new standards to be introduced for like-for-like sales.

Marching the markets up to the top of the interest rate hill only to march them down again has become a bit of a habit.</p> <p>For all that, the governor\u2019s caution is justified.

It also warned that a \u201ctide of refugees\u201d was putting the EU under strain and that action was needed to ensure that migrants could find jobs.</p> </blockquote> <p>Full story here:</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jan/19/imf-cuts-global-growth-forecasts\">IMF cuts global growth forecasts</a> </p> </aside> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-01-19T10:01:39.170Z\">at 10.01am GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-569e08bbe4b0cb645dc30430\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-01-19T10:00:08.530Z\">10.00am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The inflation figures, along higher than expected, should not put pressure on the Bank of England to raise rates, said James Knightley at ING Bank:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>December UK headline consumer price inflation has come in at 0.2% year on year, up from 0.1% in November and is the fastest rate of price increase since January 2015. Meanwhile the core rate of inflation (excluding food and fuel) rose 1.4% year on year versus a consensus forecast of 1.2%. This was also the highest inflation rate since January last year.</p> <p>The details show air fares contributed positively (up 26.8% year on year! Sea fares were up 20.3%) \u2013 note that the transportation component was the only one of 12 CPI sub components to actually increase. It showed transport prices swinging from -2.1% year on year to -0.2%. However, food prices saw intensifying deflation, as did clothing, furniture, recreation and culture. Therefore, today\u2019s pick-up in inflation (particularly core) can\u2019t really be viewed as suggesting the story regarding inflation has changed much. After all, transportation prices will fall back again next month given what has happened to fuel costs.<br></p> <p>Given that inflation remains so soft and with tomorrow\u2019s UK labour report set to show a further slowing in the pace of wage growth, the Bank of England is under no pressure to respond. Moreover, the Brexit uncertainty poses clear risks for growth, particularly through the investment and hiring channels, which will more than offset concerns about inflation risks from sterling\u2019s recent falls. As such we see little prospect of BoE action ahead of the EU referendum, which seems set for June/July. We continue to have November as the probable start point for UK rate hikes, assuming the UK votes to remain an EU member state.<br></p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-569e0841e4b03e04102e173d\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-01-19T09:57:57.006Z\">9.57am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"bbf656ba8ba91f2cfe7b7818b541ca1f2e852f89\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bbf656ba8ba91f2cfe7b7818b541ca1f2e852f89/0_0_746_527/500.jpg\" alt=\"UK inflation contribution\" width=\"500\" height=\"353\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">UK inflation contribution</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Office for National Statistics</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-569e0788e4b06544a9da911f\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-01-19T09:55:06.043Z\">9.55am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The pound has moved to its day\u2019s highs against the dollar and euro, as the UK inflation figures came in higher than expected.</p> <p>Sterling touched $1.4340, up from $1.4320 before the data, while against the euro it strengthened from 76p to 75.82p.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-569e06ffe4b0cdd2b1e0ce2f\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-01-19T09:53:00.115Z\">9.53am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/FOREXcom/statuses/689380128820838400\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Other measures of UK inflation were also stronger than expected with RPI rising 1.2% vs. 1.0% expected and HPI +7.7% vs. 7.3% y/y <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/FX?src=hash\">#FX</a> ^FR</p>&mdash;

Instead, there is a rapidly different business environment forming in China.

                "bodyText":"PS: If you\u2019d like to learn more about Mark Pollock, please start here: And that is all from us for tonight. Back in the morning. GW Davos isn\u2019t just about greedy bankers and scheming politicians. Tonight, the press pack are hearing from Mark Pollock, who became the first blind man to reach the South Pole in 2009. The next year, he fell from a second floor window, broke his back, and is paralysed. He\u2019s currently explaining how he\u2019s been working with pioneering doctors who are working on spinal cord injuries and seeking a cure for paralysis. Impossible? Not if you listen to Pollock, whose resolve and optimism is quite, quite gripping. He believes a cure is possible, saying: The next big step for mankind is to take the first step after paralysis. And he\u2019s shown us videos of how he has worked with scientists to get his own body working again (we just saw him bend his left leg, thanks to an array of wiring). Pollock\u2019s message is that, in the 4th industrial revolution, biotechnology and genetic engineering could help a new wave of pioneers to redefine what it means to be human (I\u2019m paraphrasing him). Google him, please, and find out more about what he\u2019s doing. It sounds pretty important. An intriguing theme has emerged around this year\u2019s Davos - the Falklands Islands. Argentina\u2019s new president, Mauricio Macri, has declared that he wants to rebuild his country\u2019s relationship with the UK, more than thirty years after the Falklands War. Macri is going to meet with David Cameron at Davos; we\u2019ll be poised for that. The awards ceremony is over, and delegates are fanning out across the Congress Centre, and beyond, ready for tomorrow\u2019s action. DiCaprio announces that his foundation is making a new \u00a315m donation to help protect fragile ecosystems. This includes rainforests in Sumatro, and protecting other rainforsts from the palm oil industry. And finally, Leonardo DiCaprio is picking up a Crystal Award for his work on environmental issues and climate change. The Hollywood actor tells delegates at Davos thatworld leaders took an important first step in Paris with their agreement to reduce carbon emissions. But there\u2019s much more to do. The Paris agreement was a call to action, but it falls to all of us to help fight against the \u201cirreversible damage\u201d that climate change will cause. We simply cannot afford the greed of the oil industry to determine the future of humanity. Enough is enough, you know better, the world knows better. History will put the blame for this devastation firmly at their feet. And DiCaprio insists that fossil fuel reserves must be left where they are. Climate change cannot be stopped unless fossil fuels are left in the ground. The next Crystal award goes to Chinese actor Yao Chen. She\u2019s known as the Queen of Weibo, with 78 million followers on the social media site (there\u2019s an audible gasp in the audience). Chen is being recognised for her work raising awareness of the refugee crisis, visiting migrant communities in countries such as Philippines, Thailand, Ethiopia, Lebanon and Pakistan. Chen thanks aid organisations, the UN, and her husband for his support, and talks about how helping other people is important; it helps to meet the needs of the helper too. America\u2019s poorest communities could be changed forever if they could spawn the next technology giant, will.i.am continues. That\u2019s the long-term goal of his foundation. Hilde Schwab, who co-founded WEF with her husband Klaus, has the floor in Davos. She\u2019s announcing the winners of the Crystal Awards - WEF\u2019s annual prizes for people who have gone the extra mile to make the world better (no, they don\u2019t give them to Wall Street bankers) This year\u2019s winners are actors Yao Chen and Leonardo DiCaprio, artist Olafur Eliasson, and musician and entrepreneur will.i.am. Hilde explains that Eliasson has helped create and strengthen communities by building large-scale installations and designs. Next comes Will.i.am (of the Black Eyed Peas, younger readers) is being recognised for his work bringing educational opportunist to the underpriviliged. His I am Angel foundation has helped keep young people in education and out of Will.i.am is now on stage, joking that he grew up near gangs in the ghettos of America but he was more scared of his mother than the gangs so he kept out. But turning serious, he says he wants kids to aspire to be the next Steve Jobs, the next Bill Gates, and fix the world\u2019s problems rather than waiting for governments to do it for them. One of Davos\u2019s many curious traditions is a habit of ringing cowbells when a keynote session is about to start. And that ding-ding noise in the distance means the opening ceremony is getting underway. Back at the cancer moonshot talk, Joe Biden has called on the public to do their bit to help tackle the illness. It won\u2019t be easy, or cheap. As well as warning about the impact of automation, Axel Weber, chairman of UBS, is discussing today\u2019s latest downgrade of global growth forecasts by the IMF. It was like groundhog day, he say, as the IMF had downgraded its forecasts nine times. \u201cIt\u2019s a sign we have moved to a lower growth economy.\u201d Weber adds that the problem isn\u2019t so much cyclical as structural. The low growth, low inflation and low interest environment was likely to remain, he said. UBS chairman Axel Weber says politicians need to address the rising inequality that the robot revolution will cause: Jill is tweeting the details: While Biden was demanding more progress on cancer, Swiss bank UBS has been presenting a new report into the fourth industrial revolution. And you may be unsurprised to hear that UBS reckons the richest will benefit most from new technologies such as robots, AI, 3D printing, and all those cutting-edge systems. Why? Because firms will be able to use robots to squeeze out low-paid workers, boosting their profit margins at the expense of the poorest. Here\u2019s the story, by Jill Treanor: Joe Biden is now challenging the experts on the panel, who includes top cancer researchers from the US and beyond, to share their data better. Big data, he insists, is the key to this moonshot. What would happen if I asked all of you who have data..... to get together in one room. Could that make sense, to talk to each other?... No-one dares to object. Well, in that case I\u2019m going to do it, Biden grins. Not for the cameras, but for my own knowledge, and to make faster progress. Some reaction to Joe Biden\u2019s words: Here\u2019s another photo from the cancer moonshot talk: Data is absolutely crucial to Joe Biden\u2019s cancer moonshot: When Joe Biden talks about a cancer moonshot, he is harking back to the Apollo landings, and John F Kennedy\u2019s declaration that America would put a man on the moon before the end of the 1960s. This battle is different, though, partly because Biden doesn\u2019t think the Federal government can do all the work. Part of our role is to get out of the way, so the real experts can make the progress we need, the vice-president tells his audience at Davos. But we will also do everything we can at the federal level to help. Cancer has touched nearly all of us in some way, Joe Biden points out - few families have avoided experiencing it. And every year, 14 billion people are diagnosed with cancer, 8 million die from it. That total, of course, includes Beau Biden, the vice-president\u2019s son who died of brain cancer last year. Hello from Davos, where this year\u2019s World Economic Forum is getting underway. Not without a few hitches, though. It\u2019s bumper-to-bumper traffic out there, as business leaders, politicians, policy advocates and the media make the annual trek to WEF. And even the vice-president of the United States, Joe Biden, got caught in the jam; it made him around 30 minutes late for a meeting with top scientists to push for a \u2018moonshot\u2019 to find a cure for cancer. The vice-president apologises profusely and charmingly - but he doesn\u2019t need to; everyone here knows how Davos is a logistical nightmare this time of year. And his mission is so important that it\u2019s well worth waiting a few minutes.....\uf70f And then it\u2019s down to business, with Biden explaining why he believes the world can make huge progress in the next few years. President Obama and I don\u2019t want small change, he insists - we want a Quantum Leap. Biden says: We are at an inflection point - a lot has been achieved in the last decade or less. We have seen amazing advances in science, immunology. Genomics is being leveraged in ways that weren\u2019t possible even six years ago. VP Biden adds that it\u2019s vital to ensure that researchers have access to all the data available, as every cancer centre keeps a record of its own data. Tapping this treasure trove is vital to speeding the process towards finding a cure for cancer. The session is being streamed here. On a busy day and ahead of the start of the Davos conference, here\u2019s a quick recap of events: Chinese GDP shows a slowdown.... ...but markets move higher on hopes for further central bank stimulus UK inflation hits an 11 month high ... but Bank of England governor Mark Carney rules out early rate rise ....which sends the pound sharply lower Meanwhile the IMF cuts its global growth forecasts The oil market could drown in oversupply says the International Energy Agency On that note, we\u2019ll close for the moment. But Graeme Wearden will be back later with the first reports from this year\u2019s Davos gathering. US markets have followed the example of Europe, and are moving sharply higher in early trading. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently 148 points or 0.9% higher, while the S&amp;P 500 has climbed around 1%. Chinese GDP figures prompted talk of further stimulus measures to support the world\u2019s second largest economy, while positive results from Bank of America and Morgan Stanley added to the upbeat mood. Here\u2019s a horrifying thought. There could be more plastic in the sea than fish in just over three decades. Ahead of Davos, Graeme Wearden reports: As a record-breaking yachtswoman, Dame Ellen MacArthur has seen more of the world\u2019s oceans than almost anyone else. Now she is warning that there will be more waste plastic in the sea than fish by 2050, unless the plastics industry cleans up its act. According to a new report issued by the Ellen MacArthur Foundation at the World Economic Forum on Tuesday, new plastics will consume 20% of all oil production within 35 years, up from an estimated 5% today. Plastics production has increased by twentytimes since 1964, reaching 311m tonnes in 2014, the equivalent of more than 900 Empire State Buildings, the report says, and it is expected to double again in the next 20 years, and almost quadruple by 2050. Despite this growing demand, just 5% of plastic goods are actually recycled effectively, while 40% end up in landfill and a third leak into fragile ecosystems such as the world\u2019s oceans. The full story is here: Mark Carney\u2019s caution on interest rates is justified, says our economics editor Larry Elliott: Mark Carney is half way through his five-year term as governor of the Bank of England. Judging by his latest remarks on the state of the economy he could go back to Canada in the summer of 2018 and still not have raised interest rates. The governor\u2019s speech was notable for its dovish tone. Six months ago, in a speech in Lincoln, he said the decision on whether to increase the cost of borrowing would come into sharper relief around the turn of the year. That was seen as an indication that a tightening of policy would be announced sooner rather than later. Well, the turn of the year has arrived, Carney has decided that the time is not yet ripe for a rate rise. Marching the markets up to the top of the interest rate hill only to march them down again has become a bit of a habit. For all that, the governor\u2019s caution is justified. Carney said a \u201cpowerful set of forces\u201d - some domestic, some global, some long-lasting, some cyclical - had combined to keep interest rates at their record low rates since the Great Recession ended in 2009. Read the full analysis here: On the pound\u2019s decline today, David Lamb, head of dealing at the forex group Fexco, said: The prospect of a UK interest rate rise hasn\u2019t been kicked into the long grass. The Governor hoofed it right out of the park. Mark Carney\u2019s prediction - made last summer - that we would have greater clarity on interest rates at the start of 2016 has been completely overtaken by events. Six months on, the prospects for UK interest rates remain as clear as mud. Even though UK inflation crept up a notch to a paltry 0.2% in December, tumbling oil prices will continue to drag down prices. Against a backdrop of extreme Chinese volatility and slipping rates of both growth and wages in the UK, none of the stars are aligned for a rate rise any time soon. With a UK rate hike now receding into the distance once again, monetary policy in London and Washington will continue to move in opposite directions. As a result the pound has tumbled against the dollar, and it is even slumping against the euro too. The combination of skittish equity markets and the vanishing prospect of a rate hike means investor appetite for sterling is eroding - and as a result the pound\u2019s gradual slide is likely to continue. And the pound is still falling: Answering questions, Carney said the Bank was picking up uncertainty around political events, but investment intentions remained robust. He also indicated that rates could rise before the consumer price index hit 2%: Spot in this chart of today\u2019s movement of the pound against the dollar when Carney started speaking and suggesting now is not the time to raise rates: The governor of the Bank of England has warned that the UK faces \u201ca powerful set of forces\u201d preventing policymakers from raising interest rates and the date of the first rise is still uncertain, writes Phillip Inman. Mark Carney said the plunge in oil prices had dragged down inflation and postponed the date of a rise from the current 0.5%, though he refused to indicate when the central bank would make its first move. Carney said: \u201cMonetary policy will continue to depend on economic prospects and not the calender.\u201d But his gloomy outlook, which also highlighted the rapid slowdown in China and the recent turmoil in global markets, is likely to be seen as delaying the first increase in rates since 2008 until at least the end of this year or possibly 2017. This will force many of the City\u2019s investment banks to tear up their own forecasts, which have pencilled in a rise in the summer or Autumn. Bank of England governor Mark Carney wants to see faster growth and stronger inflation before raising interest rates, with no set timetable for an increase. In a speech at the Queen Mary University of London, he said global and domestic growth had proved weaker than he expected in the middle of last year, when he predicted a decision on rates would come into sharper relief by early 2016. He said: Well the year has turned, and, in my view, the decision proved straightforward: now is not yet the time to raise interest rates. This wasn\u2019t a surprise to market participants or the wider public. They observed the renewed collapse in oil prices, the volatility in China, and the moderation in growth and wages here at home since the summer and rightly concluded that not enough cumulative progress had been made to warrant tightening monetary policy. You can follow his speech live here. And now oil is back over $30 a barrel, despite the International Energy Agency warning of continuing oversupply. Brent crude has jumped 5.7% to $30.18, helped by strong oil demand from China. There is also the hope of more stimulus from the Chinese authorities following the latest GDP figures, which showed a slowdown in growth. Stock markets continue to move higher following the Chinese GDP data, and despite higher than expected UK inflation and the IMF cutting its global growth forecasts. The FTSE 100 is currently up nearly 1.9%, while Germany\u2019s Dax is 2% higher and France\u2019s Cac has climbed 2.3%. In the US the futures are showing a 250 rise on the Dow Jones Industrial Average. As a reminder the US markets were closed on Monday, and fell sharply in the previous session on the tumbling oil price. Crude is now up 4.7% at $29.9 a barrel. And here are the IMF comments on markets and China, courtesy of Reuters: Global financial markets seem to be overreacting to falling oil prices and China, the chief economist of the International Monetary Fund said on Tuesday. Maurice Obstfeld also said it was critical that China is clear about its overall policy strategy, including its currency. \u201cIt\u2019s not a stretch to suggest that (markets) may be reacting very strongly to rather small bits of evidence in an environment of volatility and risk aversion,\u201d Obstfeld said in a news conference held after the IMF cut its global growth forecasts for the third time in less than a year. The IMF has commented on the prospect of Britain leaving the EU: Here\u2019s the UK Treasury welcoming the day\u2019s inflation figures: The IMF is giving more details of its global outlook. Its chief economist Maurice Obstfeld said there were clearly deflationary pressures in the eurozone, and he expected the European Central Bank to ease further as further data comes in. He added that the US recovery appeared to be weaker than the Federal Reserve was expected when it raised interest rates in December. And he played down the recent market turmoil: He said the IMF did not see some of the extreme negative scenarios that the markets seemed to be anticipating. He added that a falling oil price would help consumers, so it was not an unmitigated negative. UK house prices are at a 10 month high, according to the Office for National Statistics: Meanwhile the ZEW confidence index showed a downbeat mood among German analysts and investors in the wake of the recent market turmoil. With any slowdown in China likely to knock the German export market, the ZEW think tank said economic sentiment fell from 16.1 in December to 10.2 in January. But this was higher than a Reuters estimate of 8.2. In the eurozone, inflation has come in at 0.2% year on year in December, in line with expectations. The month on month figure was flat. November\u2019s year on year figure was revised down from 0.2% to 0.1%. That is a long was short of the European Central Bank\u2019s 2% target despite the stimulus package the central bank has instituted. Dennis de Jong, managing director at UFX.com, said: Today\u2019s inflation figures suggest that ECB President Mario Draghi\u2019s renewed stimulus plan isn\u2019t yet having the desired effect, and the two per cent target is still a long way off. Record low oil prices, alongside volatility in China and elsewhere, have taken their toll on major economies the world over and the Eurozone is no different. With a stimulus programme in effect and no real room to manoeuvre interest rates further, Draghi is running out of options. Draghi must hope that any extra cash in the pockets of consumers due to low oil prices goes straight back into the economy to spur growth. Back with UK inflation, and Howard Archer at IHS Global Insight expects a UK rate rise in August: With consumer price inflation still only 0.2% in December, there is certainly little immediate pressure on the Bank of England to start raising interest rates. We believe it is pretty unlikely that the Bank of England will raise interest rates (from 0.50% to 0.75%) until at least August \u2013 given the increased probability that inflation will stay lower for longer and a current more uncertain growth outlook. Indeed, there is a very real chance that the Bank of England could delay raising interest rates until the fourth quarter of 2016. Our current belief that the Bank of England will most likely edge interest rates up from 0.50% to 0.75% in August is based on the assumption that economic growth will be reasonable over the first half of 2016, earnings growth sees some renewed pick-up amid a tightening labour market and consumer price inflation trends gradually up. Even if the Bank of England does delay interest rates beyond August, we doubt it will delay acting until 2017 - barring a major slowdown in UK growth. The International Monetary Fund has reduced its growth forecasts in its latest update on the global economy. Our economics editor Larry Elliott reports: [The IMF] has added to concerns about the health of the global economy by cutting its growth forecasts for the next two years and warning that recovery from the financial crisis could be derailed altogether if key challenges are mishandled. The Washington-based body said world output would be 0.2 points lower in 2016 and 2017 compared with forecasts made just three months ago \u2013 and that the risks to its predictions were to the downside. In an update to its World Economic Outlook, the IMF said growth was put at 3.4% this year and 3.6% in 2017. It said central banks should continue to boost growth and that finance ministries should bolster investment spending where possible. It also warned that a \u201ctide of refugees\u201d was putting the EU under strain and that action was needed to ensure that migrants could find jobs. Full story here: The inflation figures, along higher than expected, should not put pressure on the Bank of England to raise rates, said James Knightley at ING Bank: December UK headline consumer price inflation has come in at 0.2% year on year, up from 0.1% in November and is the fastest rate of price increase since January 2015. Meanwhile the core rate of inflation (excluding food and fuel) rose 1.4% year on year versus a consensus forecast of 1.2%. This was also the highest inflation rate since January last year. The details show air fares contributed positively (up 26.8% year on year! Sea fares were up 20.3%) \u2013 note that the transportation component was the only one of 12 CPI sub components to actually increase. It showed transport prices swinging from -2.1% year on year to -0.2%. However, food prices saw intensifying deflation, as did clothing, furniture, recreation and culture. Therefore, today\u2019s pick-up in inflation (particularly core) can\u2019t really be viewed as suggesting the story regarding inflation has changed much. After all, transportation prices will fall back again next month given what has happened to fuel costs. Given that inflation remains so soft and with tomorrow\u2019s UK labour report set to show a further slowing in the pace of wage growth, the Bank of England is under no pressure to respond. Moreover, the Brexit uncertainty poses clear risks for growth, particularly through the investment and hiring channels, which will more than offset concerns about inflation risks from sterling\u2019s recent falls. As such we see little prospect of BoE action ahead of the EU referendum, which seems set for June/July. We continue to have November as the probable start point for UK rate hikes, assuming the UK votes to remain an EU member state. The pound has moved to its day\u2019s highs against the dollar and euro, as the UK inflation figures came in higher than expected. Sterling touched $1.4340, up from $1.4320 before the data, while against the euro it strengthened from 76p to 75.82p. Our report on inflation, from Patrick Collinson: There was a surprise rise in the UK\u2019s inflation rate to 0.2% in December, the first month since January 2015 in which the rate has exceeded 0.1% according to the Office for National Statistics. Transport costs, particularly air fares, and to a lesser extent motor fuels, were the main contributors to the rise, said the ONS. These were partly offset by downward pressure on prices for alcohol and tobacco along with food and non-alcoholic beverages partially offset the rise. Monthly inflation has been between -0.1% and 0.1% for the past eleven months, helped by plunging commodity prices. More here: And here\u2019s the trend for CPI: Here\u2019s a breakdown of the inflation data: This is also the first time the rate has exceeded 0.1% since January 2015, according to the Office for National Statistics. It said: Movements in transport costs, particularly air fares and to a lesser extent motor fuels, were the main contributors to the rise in the rate. Downward pressures from prices for alcohol and tobacco along with food and non-alcoholic beverages partially offset the rise. The UK consumer price index has risen 0.1% in December on a month on month basis, in line with forecasts. But the year on year figure of 0.2% is the highest since January 2015, and higher than expectations of a 0.1% rise. The crude oil market will continue to be oversupplied until at least late 2016, according to the International Energy Agency. It said the market \u201ccould drown in oversupply.\u201d With unseasonably warm weather and rising supply - not least from Iran now sanctions have been lifted - will continue to put pressure on crude prices. The IEA said global oil demand fell to a one year low of 1m barrels a day in the fourth quarter of 2015, down from 2.1m in the previous three months. In its latest monthly report the IEA left its estimate of global demand growth for 2016 at 1.2m barrels a day. The IEA said (quote courtesy Reuters): We conclude that the oil market faces the prospect of a third successive year when supply will exceed demand by 1m barrels a day and there will be enormous strain o the ability of the oil system to absorb it efficiently. Brent crude, which was earlier up 3%, is now 2.5% higher at $29.29 a barrel. A couple of positive comments on the Chinese GDP figures. Rain Newton-Smith, CBI director of economics, said: These figures paint a picture of a Chinese economy which is slowing and rebalancing, but still making a huge contribution to the global economy. In recent weeks, financial markets have struggled to digest this situation, alongside further weakness in oil prices. While direct links between the UK and China are relatively small, the spill-over effects from China\u2019s economic slowdown, alongside continued volatility in financial markets, amplify the downside risks to growth in the UK. Nevertheless, it\u2019s important not to be too downbeat about China or emerging markets more generally. With household incomes up by 7%, and online retails sales growing by 33% last year, China represents a lucrative market for British business. Meanwhile James Sinclair at corporate finance house Clearwater International said: Much will be made of the fact that this is China\u2019s weakest growth in a quarter of a century: Intense volatility in the stock market and the cycle of industrial overcapacity and sluggish external demand have had policymakers looking over their shoulder for a good while. But we don\u2019t see this as the toppling of an economic giant. Instead, there is a rapidly different business environment forming in China. The overall trend for consumer spending is far from grim, and the surging middle class is at the heart of this consumption boom. While consumers are boosting demand for imported goods, there are Chinese companies working in the opposite direction, and redefining what Chinese exporters look like. With the growth of entrepreneurism and innovation in the country, we can expect to see many other Chinese companies both threaten existing industry structures and open up new spaces. By the end of the decade, we still expect China to be one of the leading cross-border investors, and given the patterns we have seen, this is a trend we see no sign of stopping. More on UK inflation. lya Spivak, currency strategist at DailyFX, said: The core year-on-year inflation rate is expected to register at 1.2% in December, unchanged from the prior month. Leading survey data hints downward price pressures may have waned however, opening the door for an upside surprise. Such an outcome may breathe a big of life into rate hike speculation, offering a lift to the British pound. Follow-on comments from Bank of England governor Mark Carney represent a bit of wild card and may either amplify or undermine the initial post-CPI response, depending on the central bank chief\u2019s tone. Despite Bank of England governor Mark Carney saying in the middle of last year that it should be clearer by now when UK interest rates should be increased, that is not at all the case. Recent weak data and the current market turmoil that many analysts do not expect any move until much later this year, if at all. Bank of England policymaker Gertjan Vlieghe seemed to concur on Monday, saying ultra low rates could be here to stay for some years. So Carney\u2019s speech later at the University of London will be closely watched for any hints as to the timing of any rate rise. Still on the corporate front, one of the day\u2019s biggest gainers in the UK market so far is Ocado. The online grocer is up 11% following a revival of talk that Amazon could be interested in a takeover to boost its own fledgling food business. Unilever, which makes everything from Dove soap to Pot Noodle, is expecting trading condtions to be tougher and more volatile this year. The company beat analysts forecasts with full year sales up 4.1%, despite negligible growth in developmed markets and weakness in emerging markets. Full story here: As the markets hold onto their early gains, analyst Tony Cross at Trustnet Direct said: A shortfall in Chinese GDP data for 2015 \u2013 and accompanying hopes that this will be the catalyst for further stimulus measures from Beijing \u2013 is the key driver here, and it\u2019s the natural resources stocks that are leading the charge. Whilst some upside is probably warranted \u2013 not least given the protracted falls we\u2019ve accrued of late \u2013 the question as always is just how sustainable these gains will prove to be. The news of weak growth has obviously done nothing to lend support to oil prices, but bargain hunting and a mounting belief that Opec\u2019s over supply of the market will now reign in higher cost production is also helping crude edge higher. A break back above $30/barrel here could prove instrumental in cementing a degree of confidence in the wider market. David Morrison at Spreadco said it will be key to see if markets can maintain their earlyi momentum: How this now plays out could be very instructive. If equities can hold on to early gains then we could finally build some upside momentum and reverse last year\u2019s losses. But if this rally fades, as did all the attempts last week, then that could signal that we\u2019re entering a fully blown bear market. Ahead of the latest EU inflation number and the ZEW confidence figures, Germany has reported a 0.2% year on year rise in its consumer price index. Following a move below $28 a barrel on Monday in the wake of Iran\u2019s promise to increase exports now sanctions have been lifted, crude prices have regained some ground. Brent is now up 3% at $29.44 a barrel, following strong oil data from China where demand in 2015 was at a record 10.32m barrels a day, up 2.5% from the previous year. Following on from Asia, European stock markets have moved higher in early trading. The FTSE 100 has jumped 1.7% or 102 points to 5881.92 while Germany\u2019s Dax is up 2.1%, France\u2019s Cac 1.9% and Spain\u2019s Ibex 1.7%. The Chinese data is behind the moves. With the GDP figure was just shy of the government\u2019s targets, investors are betting on more stimulus from the central bank to give the world\u2019s second largest economy a lift. So mining shares are among the leading risers, with Glencore and Anglo American both up around 8%. Ahead of the World Economic Forum\u2019s annual conference which begins this evening, my colleague Graeme Wearden has looked at the eight key themes, ranging from the rise of the robots to market turmoil and medicine: For UK inflation, most analysts expect the CPI figure to come in at 0.1% but RBC Capital Markets goes a little higher: RBC forecasts CPI inflation at 0.3% year on year in December 2015, up from 0.1% year on year in November. However, as last time, we acknowledge that the risk to the forecast is to the downside as the continued decline in the petrol price has reduced the base effects that were due to kick in on the back of oil price declines at the end of 2014. For RPI inflation, we look for the annual rate to hold at 1.1% year on year. Beyond the monthly print, the message remains that even if inflation does get near 1% year on year soon, there are limited prospects in 2016 for it taking another leg up from there and moving towards the 2% target. As well as China\u2019s stock markets moving higher, the Nikkei and Hang Seng are also in positive territory, up 0.5% and 1.75% respectively. So Europe is expected to follow suit: Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. On a busy day for economic news, China has kicked things off with news of the slowest GDP growth in 25 years. The figure of 6.9% growth for the year was not far from the government target but prompted talk of new stimulus measures, and gave some support to the Chinese stock market. The CSI300 index rose 2.95% while the Shanghai composite was 3.2% higher. Here is our report on the Chinese GDP numbers: Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK, said: This morning\u2019s latest Chinese economic data hasn\u2019t really shed any new light on an economy that we know is slowing down. The latest fourth quarter GDP data came in at 6.8%, the slowest pace in 25 years and slightly below consensus expectations, while December industrial production slid back to 5.9% from 6.2% in November, no real surprise given recent weak PMI readings. Retail sales were slightly disappointing coming in at 11.1%, slipping back from 11.2% and breaking a sequence of consecutive monthly improvements since last March. While these numbers are slightly disappointing they don\u2019t point to a sharp slowdown, however it does raise the question as to what further steps to stimulate the economy policymakers will take in the coming weeks. Elsewhere in the run up to Davos, the International Monetary Fund releases its latest growth forecasts. There are also UK and EU inflation figures, as well as a speech from Bank of England governor Mark Carney.

Technically, the major indices formed a topping pattern as they failed to make fresh highs after the China-inspired summer sell-off. Stress in the high yield bond market was becoming apparent even before the Fed hiked rates. That hike now looks as if it will go down as one of the worst-timed rate rises in history, even crowning the ECB\u2019s classic efforts in 2011.

Perhaps not yet - in a statement and press conference in Frankfurt. After last month, when the measures announced proved a disappointment, and the more hawkish elements on the ECB clearly prevented the bank from doing more, Draghi\u2019s comments will be widely watched. Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Today\u2019s focus is likely to shine on the first ECB rate meeting of 2016, against a continuing backdrop of weak inflation in the euro area.</p> <p>With last month\u2019s December disappointment still fresh in the memory ECB President Mario Draghi will have to convince the markets that the ECB has a plan, and the ammunition to cope with the further slide in inflationary pressures that are likely to ripple across Europe in the coming weeks.</p> <p>It is clear that the hawks won out last month preventing the ECB from acting in a much stronger fashion, and in the process giving the ECB President a bloody nose, after he had indicated the prospect of much stronger action. How Mr Draghi navigates these divisions will be particularly pertinent given how they were revealed in the most recent minutes, especially given that the next projections in March are likely to see inflation expectations guided lower.</p> <p>This is because since last month\u2019s December meeting oil prices have slid another 35%, which means that while the ECB President might come across as dovish later today, after last month\u2019s disappointment markets may not necessarily take him at his word.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f2494b2fe927581f6e47d8b56b40c51998ee852c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f2494b2fe927581f6e47d8b56b40c51998ee852c/0_0_3252_1951/1000.jpg\" alt=\"ECB President Draghi.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">ECB President Draghi.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Francois Lenoir/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Economists at Unicredit said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>ECB president Mario Draghi will likely sound dovish today, but we expect him to strike a reasonable balance. Mr. Draghi will be careful to avoid fuelling too much speculation about further action to avoid a repetition of the December experience, when the announcement of QE2 fell short of high expectations.</p> <p>At the time, the market\u2019s disappointed reaction resulted in a 3% rally in euro-dollar exchange rate. Today, we do not expect the meeting to cause any major move in exchange rates, as the market seems prepared for a relatively balanced debate.

                "bodyText":"George Soros then went on to launch an astonishing attack on Donald Trump, saying that he was doing \u201cthe work of Isis\u201d. He added: \u201cBy fearmongering he and (Ted) Cruz are doing the work of Isis. They want people to turn against the Muslim community and make the Muslim community think there is no alternative to terrorism. It turns the Muslim community into a breeding ground for Isis. Last month, Donald Trump called for a \u201ctotal and complete shutdown\u201d on Muslims entering the US. This prompted a huge petition to have the businessman and presidential candidate banned from the UK, which MPs debated earlier this week. During the debate, Trump was labelled (among other things) a \u201cridiculous xenophobe\u201d. Soros said Vladimir Putin was making the crisis worse by his bombing of civilians in Syria. \u201cHe wants the EU to collapse.\u201d Soros then warned that European countries were in crisis, due to the number of people who have fled to the region: \u201cWe have reached a tipping point where the influx reduces the capacity of receiving countries assimilate or integrate the refugees and we have a panic. It is like a cinema on fire without exit signs.\u201d Soros said 2016 was going to be a difficult year. There would be no further rate rises from the Federal Reserve and the ECB would ease policy in March, he predicted (as Mario Draghi hinted today). George Soros, the billionaire financier turned philanthropist, has warned the World Economic Forum tonight that the migration crisis is putting the European Union in jeopardy. Larry Elliott was at the event, and reports: George Soros said: \u201cThe EU is in an existential crisis as a result of migration. The EU is falling apart.\u201d Backing the idea of a Marshall Plan, Soros said: \u201cMost people know that something has gone terribly wrong. It has to be put right.\u201d As we covered in this liveblog this morning, Germany\u2019s finance minister Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble has called for billions to be spent helping the troubled countries in the Middle East, to stem the flood of refugees into Europe. Soros added that the same conditions were in place as caused the crisis in 2008. \u201cThere is a financial crisis and a bear market. The source of the disequilibrium is different. In 2008 it was US sub prime. Today it is China where a hard landing is practically unavoidable.\u201d The Greek government says the talks between Lagarde and Tsipras were \u201csincere\u201d. Helena Smith has the details: The Greek government has just issued one of its famous briefing papers calling Tsipras\u2019 talks with IMF chief Christine Lagarde \u201csincere.\u201d The Greek PM \u201cunderlined that time is a critical parameter for the successful conclusion of the Greek programme and the first evaluation [of the economy\u2019s performance,]\u201d the paper said. Both agreed that from now on there should be \u201cdirect communication\u201d between the Greek government and the IMF \u201cso that each side has a clear view of the positions of the other,\u201d it noted. After saying it would be preferable if the IMF did not participate in Greece\u2019s latest bailout, Athens reluctantly agreed last week to the Washington-based body remaining amongst the lenders. Christine Lagarde, head of the IMF, has met with Alexis Tsipras at the sidelines of the World Economic Forum. It was a good meeting, one insider says. And the IMF has now issued a statement, reiterating that Greece needs significant debt relief, as well as pension reforms which are causing such anger in Athens. \u201cThe managing director reiterated that the IMF stands ready to continue to support Greece in achieving robust economic growth and sustainable public finances through a credible and comprehensive medium-term economic program. \u201cSuch a program would require strong economic policies, not least pension reforms as well as significant debt relief from Greece\u2019s European partners to ensure that debt is on a sustainable downward trajectory.\u201d While the Greek prime minister Alexis Tsipras was addressing delegates in Davos earlier today, opposition against the policies his government is being forced to apply intensified as thousands took to the streets. Our correspondent, Helena Smith, reports from Athens. Opposition to the pension and tax measures set as the price of further bailout funds mounted today as thousands of protestors \u2013mostly from the professions \u2013 joined farmers and fishermen and public sector unionists in denouncing the policies. As Tsipras hob-nobbed in Davos, around 10,000 demonstrators took to the streets \u2013 following up farmer blockades that also expanded - in further evidence that after months (some might say years) of being relatively inactive, the protest movement is once again gaining steam. For the most part, lawyers, doctors and engineers, many said they belonged to Greece\u2019s vast sector of self-employed who stood to be hard hit by the reforms. \u201cA lot of us here voted for the left and feel really betrayed,\u201d Baltis Kapopoulos, an Athenian engineer, told me. \u201cIt\u2019s terrible that the left should be tainted by such policies,\u201d he said in front of the Greek parliament, a placard emblazoned with the words \u2018You won\u2019t kick us out of the country\u2019 above his head. At 29, Kapopoulos said he had no desire to leave Greece but like many might be forced to by the measures. \u201cIf they go through, pensions will drop, contributions will soar and taxes will double. There\u2019ll be a lot of black market work with no insurance. And it\u2019ll be the end of small firms.\u201d \u201cI think the reason there has been such a delay in protest is because people have been shocked. We voted \u2018no\u2019 in the referendum [last July] and 48 hours later, Tsipras went and accepted everything,\u201d he said of the leftist\u2019s spectacular surrender to creditors\u2019 demands under threat of Greece\u2019s ejection from the euro zone. \u201cEither we react now or we never will. It\u2019s the last chance if we don\u2019t want to be forced to leave our country.\u201d Felix Salmon, the sharp-as-a-very-sharp-tack financial columnist, has delivered his verdict on this year\u2019s Davos. And it\u2019s a zinger, surpassing Felix\u2019s earlier criticism of the annual shindig in the mountains. He argues that the excitement and chatter behind the scenes about Donald Trump (the antithesis of the spirit of Davos), shows that WEF\u2019s vision of an open, inclusive approach to solving the world\u2019s problems is failing. Especially as we seem to be collecting more problems, not fewer, from stock market turmoil and oil, to the Middle East. Over to Felix: This year, then, is proving itself to be the Davos of denial, the year that the disconnect between rhetoric and reality became more obvious than ever. The founder of the World Economic Forum, Klaus Schwab, is on some level a plutocratic power-broker just like many other rich and powerful men, but his dream of bringing the world together in the service of peace and prosperity is, or was, a genuine one. It has even been bought into by leftist critics who complain that Davos is \u201cincreasingly where global decisions are being taken and moreover is becoming the default form of global governance.\u201d The truth, however, is that with the exception of a few public-health initiatives, the Davos model of \u201cmulti-stakeholder initiatives\u201d and \u201cglobal redesign\u201d has utterly failed in its stated aims. The grandiloquence is as lofty as ever, but the world has not come together; instead, it is fracturing, and the World Economic Forum\u2019s manifold Leaders are reduced to the status of impotent spectators. Some men just want to watch the world burn; Davos Man wants nothing less. But, right now, that\u2019s all he can realistically do. In the financial markets, ECB president Mario Draghi has provided some respite today with his assurances that the central bank will review policy in March - hinting fresh stimulus could come sooner than many investors had been expecting. London\u2019s bluechip FTSE 100 index rebounded from a three-year low on Draghi\u2019s remarks, which followed assurances from his Bank of England counterpart Mark Carney this week that UK interest rates would stay at their record low amid turmoil on global markets and signs that the domestic economy had softened. The FTSE 100 closed up 100 points, or 1.8%, at 5,773.8 but it is still down more than 7% from the start of the year having sold off with other leading bourses around the world on worries over global growth and China\u2019s downturn. The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index closed up 2% and on Wall Street the Dow Jones industrial average was up 1.2% and the S&amp;P 500 was up 0.8% at the time of the London close. Analysts cautioned that while Draghi\u2019s words had soothed markets for now, they would need to be followed with real action. Many recalled December\u2019s disappointment when ECB action was deemed much less aggressive than Draghi\u2019s prior promises had led investors to believe. \u201cECB president Draghi once again saw the equity markets confirm his \u2018super\u2019 status as they jumped almost as soon as he started his speech,\u201d said Alastair McCaig, analyst at online trading company IG. \u201cAll in all it was very impressive, especially when you consider he didn\u2019t actually promise anything, but he was convincing enough to get JP Morgan, RBS and Barclays to bring forward their calls for further easing from June to March.\u201d Ranko Berich, head of market analysis at Monex Europe, commented: \u201cAlthough equity markets have lapped up the prospect of additional easing like manna from heaven, any euphoria derived from promises of central bank action may prove to be fleeting. Despite Draghi\u2019s assurances, it\u2019s still not clear if the ECB is willing to commit to the sort of massive, unconditional and open-ended QE programmes that we have seen from the Bank of Japan and the Fed.\u201d Now here\u2019s a turn-up. Davos attendees have voted that the answer to inequality lies more in wealth distribution than greater opportunity, we hear. At the start of the debate, the audience were split 65%-35% in favour of opportunity. But after a spirited debate, the vote was switched, reports Philip Jennings of the UNI Global union. George Osborne has denied that the EU renegotiations are hurting the UK economy, and claimed that the recent market volatility is actually a good thing: Speaking to CNBC here in Davos, he said: \u201cInternationally we need a big of a sense of perspective which is, underlying all this volatility are some transformations and transitions which are fundamentally good for the world \u2013 China becoming a more consumption based economy, energy being cheaper\u2026in the European Union and the euro zone, the European Central Bank ready to\u2026step in and support the euro zone.\u201d \u201cBecause of the very sharp falls in the oil price the markets are unstable\u2026but fundamentally for most western economies\u2026the fall in the price of energy is a good thing.\u201d This rather sums Davos up: Businesses at Davos are being urged to provide more financial assistance to help the world prepare for the next major pandemic. Jeremy Farrar, director of the Wellcome Trust, has warned that we are simply not ready for another serious outbreak, similar to the Ebola crisis that struck Africa last year. Speaking at Davos he says: Pandemics are not that rare, we have had a dozen in the last decade. He cites Sars, bird flu, Mers, influenza and the Zika virus as examples of diseases which could create a new pandemic. At the moment, vaccines do not exist for any of these viruses. This leaves the world very vulnerable, and we need to address it at the time between epidemics. As well as life-saving drugs, Farrar says countries also need to prepare their response plans, so they are not caught out when a pandemic begins. A new report, from the Commission on Creating a Global Health Risk Framework for the future, estimated that epidemics and pandemics cost the global economy $60 billion annually. Victor Dzau, who oversaw the commission, says: \u201cThe report calls the attention globally that this isn\u2019t just a health issue, it\u2019s a global security issue\u201d The report called for the World Health Organisation to be strengthened, and for more money for R&amp;D. In total, Farrar tells me, just 60 cents or 40p per person would make a dramatic difference in fighting pandemics. That\u2019s $4.5bn, which could come from governments and philanthropic groups as well as business. As Farrar puts it: If we did that, we could go a long way to avoiding another Ebola, or worse. Dr Zia Khan of the Rockefeller Foundation says businesses must do their bit: \u201cWe are looking to the business community, as well as G7 and others, to take up as a call to action. It is directly relevant to them\u201d. If you\u2019re just tuning in, please click here to see our earlier summary of the comments made by the French and Dutch PMs today. Our politics liveblog had rounded up Cameron\u2019s speech - here. In brief, they are that: Cameron said that he was \u201cnot in a hurry\u201d to get an EU deal by February (really, prime minister?) Cameron said there would still be many \u201cimperfect\u201d things about the EU even if he got the reform package he wanted. He urged business to start campaigning now for Britain to stay in a reformed EU. He said Britain could have \u201cthe best of both worlds\u201d in a reformed EU. Lets get back to Davos. And Carlos Ghosn, the CEO of Renault-Nissan, just told me that his company will cope fine if Britain chooses to leave the EU. Asked about the possibility of Brexit, Ghosn said: I\u2019m not worried. Whatever is the decision of the UK we will adapt to it. We will adapt to it. If the UK stays, we will continue what we\u2019re doing. If the UK decides to move out, we will adapt to the situation. I don\u2019t think there is a reason to worry. We knew for many years that this was possible. So we\u2019ll deal with it. But might you be forced to move jobs out of the UK, if we leave the EU? Frankly it\u2019s too early to talk about that. To sum up, ECB president Mario Draghi said the ECB would review and may reconsider its monetary policy in March, and that interest rates were likely to stay at low levels for some time. That hint of further stimulus was enough to send the euro lower against the pound and dollar, and give markets a boost. He also dismissed suggestions the ECB\u2019s governing council was split over December\u2019s decision to cut the deposit rate and extend the length of the QE programme. Last minutes showed governing council was divided, how confident are you you can get a majority for more easing measures. On the 2% target, ex-chief economist of ECB said target should be in longer term not medium because it harms ECB credibility. Disagree that minutes show such divisions. Today\u2019s line of communication was unanimous. We have got a majority over last four years, so should have no doubts the council has the willingness and cohesion necessary to take actions needed. On second point, when people say it should be lower than 2% while others say above, camps are divided. [Economist] confirmed validity of the target. The horizon of reaching this objective is his argument. View of council is we should reject any suggestion we may do less than what\u2019s necessary, in order to achieve target without undue delay. There are global events which could adversely affect objective, but not reason to give up. And with that, it\u2019s all over. Could markets get ahead of themselves as before December meeting? I abstained from blaming markets as such. Communication is a two way affair, hard to put blame of some disappointment on one side only. The council is open to use all necessary instruments to cope with the situation which is materially different from what it was at the beginning of December. In October, said you would re-examine in December and there was action. Is there any difference now? How worried are you about recent drop in inflation expectations? All inflation expectations have declined, and more worryingly, their correlation with inflation has increased. The council has the power, the willingness to act. What is message for countries like Spain whose disinflation is less effective. Is there a need for fiscal change in eurozone. Spain has achieved one of most significant progress in reform, country is now on its way to continue recovery and structural reforms. With very low inflation rates, the internal revaluations become more difficult. One of reasons inflation at 2% makes even more sense in a monetary union like ours. No disagreement on fiscal policy between ECB and EC. We are not the guardians, that is the EC. Fiscal consolidation should be growth friendly based on tax cuts, government spending control and possibly investment. There has been a wave of stock market selling, especially bank shares and Italian bank shares. You more or less gave a clean bill of health to banks, markets seem to disagree with your assessment. On non performing loans, you have asked for information so what is the purpose of this action? This allows me to clarify a confused perception. The NPLs were fully assessed in comprehensive assessment. Nothing new. The provisioning for these was fully determined. So no new unexpected provisioning or requests for more capital will be made by banking supervisor. On Italy, its banks have a level of provision similar to that prevailing in eurozone area, and a level of collatoral. European supervisor is aware it takes years to deal with NPLs, cannot be resolved with short period of time. Good example is Ireland - successful in terms of recovery and they are dealing with NPLs gradually. The questionaire was sent to several banks, not only Italy. It is an enquiry on how banks are managing NPLs. The purpose is to look at different national practices to get one best practice in time. Not an initiative to get banks to deal with NPLs urgently. Don\u2019t think markets disagree but there has been confusion. Hope this helps. Causes of movements in markets? Difficult to assess. Whether it will be transient or not, whether market adjust to a different level, better question for market analysts to answer. Regarding the fall in the oil price - wouldn\u2019t it be better to ignore effect of that. History suggests they will rise again for sure [and lift inflation], why not wait? When we have dramatic movement in commodities we look at three factors: persistence of these changes, if it was a short term effect we would look through it but this has not been our experience. Materiality, the size. Since December oil fell by 40%. Look at second round effects - low commodity prices do feed into other prices and that could generate what we want to avoid, spiralling down phenomona. So far don\u2019t have that, but have to be vigilent. We have to take seriously that low commodity prices for a long period may have second round effects that we want to take action against. Comment on China risks. On refugees, chancellor Merkel is taking a big risk and if situation worsens she could leave, was there a discussion on this domestic German crisis. On China, there have been three main developments - weaker PMI, situation in forex market, situation in stock market. All this generated sizeable capital outflows. We are monitoring. So far indicators suggest there is a gradual deceleration in line with our expectations. But outlook for eurozone area after these developments has been revised downwards. There has been a renewed decline in commodity and oil prices since December. On oil, supply and demand factors and what is happening in China is contributing to demand side. What do we expect? Chinese authorities have reputation for acting responsibly. In last two weeks they have been regaining control of policy. On refugees, can\u2019t talk about one country. Large change but could become opportunity. One of constraints on purchases is political. On financial turmoil have you seen signs of stress among investors, customers. If there were constraints, we will have technical work so we can use all instruments. On second point, best answer to recent developments is to make sure banking sector is resilient. Is a factual statement that all the actions taken have produced a much stronger banking sector than it was before the crisis. But should be cautious about not being too self congratulatory. The commodity volatility we are seeing would previously have tested banking system, but we have seen, they stand pretty resilient. Are you concerned about banking system and financial stability in light of what\u2019s happening in world. We are constantly monitoring financial sector, banking sector, trying to see whether central banks\u2019 monetary policies could become a source of financial instability. So far we have not seen signs of the potential financial instability of the like we have seen in the pre-crisis times. Not our mandate to protect banks\u2019 profitability but we are aware of consequences. Best answer is to ensure economy returns to growth, stable growth. Best answer for banking sector as well. You said no limits to what you could do, could you extend purchases to other classes of assets such as equities, lower other rates not just deposit. On refugee issue, are you concerned of effects of border closures on economy? I can only reiterate there are no limits. If we are to decide about a specific policy we want to be confident there are no technical limits to the size of its deployment. On refugees, this is an extraordinary development which is and will be changing the face of our society in Europe. It is in our hands, the opportunity, the ability to transform this development into an opportunity for future growth in Europe. We are not surrendering in front of these global actions. Our mandate is to reach a level of inflation at if not below 2%, even more determined in face of adverse events. Last month, you said monetary policy was adequate, now reviewing. Does this harm credibility. Inflation could fall below zero despite everything, do central banks not have as much control. Monetary policy has been quite effective - improvement in all financial conditions, now translated into real economic improvements. In December measures we decided were appropriate. But based on prevailing circumstances. We looked at exchange rate, price of oil, growth prospects of emerging markets. Since then, these circumstances have changed. Oil fallen by 40%, exchange rate fallen, and you can see situation of financial and commodity markets. Those measures in December were quite significant (NB one criticsim was the measures were watered down) The credibility of ECB would be harmed if we did not review and reconsider monetary policy stance when we have the full information. We have the determination to act and there are no limits within our mandate. The governing council was unanimous on this line of communication. (there was talk of a split) Now for questions. You will reconsider monetary policy stance in March, what measures do you have left and what can they do? Could you clarify position on Portugals Novo Banco where ECB not said to be involved in the bail in? Draghi: On second question, we are not the resolution authority. On monetary policy: In a speech in New York I said there are no limits to deploying instruments to reach objective of inflation at 2%. Don\u2019t want to discuss specifics of instruments. The euro is dropping as Draghi speaks, on the prospect of further action including perhaps further rate cuts: But European markets seem to like the talk, with Germany\u2019s Dax up 1.2% and France\u2019s Cac climbing 1.3%. ECB president Mario Draghi said the bank had decided to keep key interest rates unchanged, and it expected them to remain at present or lower levels for an extended period of time. He said the asset purchases under the QE programme were proceeding smoothly. He said it was clear that its monetary policies were working. Developments in the real economy, financing conditions have improved, strengthened the eurozone\u2019s resilience recent global market shocks. Extension of QE until March 2017 was appropriate, there was a significant addition of liquidity to the banking system. But he added: \u201cYet as we start the new year, downside risks have increased again amid heightened uncertainty about emerging market prospects, commodity markets, geopolitical risks. Eurozone inflation dynamics are also weaker than expected in December. It is necessary to review and reconsider our monetary policy stance in early March, when new economic projections become available.\u201d He said the fall in the oil price should help consumers and businesses, but the risks to eurozone growth remained to the downside. Inflation expectations will be low in coming months, and pick up only later in 2016. Here\u2019s the full text of the European Central Bank rate decision ahead of president Mario Draghi\u2019s press conference: At today\u2019s meeting the governing council of the ECB decided that the interest rate on the main refinancing operations and the interest rates on the marginal lending facility and the deposit facility will remain unchanged at 0.05%, 0.30% and -0.30% respectively. And here\u2019s a comment from David Katimbo-Mugwanya, a fund manager at EdenTree Investment Management: The ECB will be keen to take stock in the coming weeks, preferring to appraise the effectiveness of its December policy actions rather than easing further in the immediate future. The central bank will have taken note, nevertheless, of persistent disinflationary pressures stemming from oil and commodity price weakness. Crowds are gathering in the Congress Hall for David Cameron\u2019s speech on Britain\u2019s Place in the World. As covered this morning, we expect the PM to call on business leaders to back him over the EU renegotiations. As it\u2019s a massive UK political story, my colleague Andy Sparrow is going to live blog it himself, here: You can watch the session live here: Just bumped into Jamie Dimon, boss of JP Morgan, whose bank is planning to back the In campaign on the UK EU referendum. He would not say how much the bank is spending - \u201cWe\u2019ve just started doing (it)...Wish we didn\u2019t have to do it at all\u201d. Q: So will JP Morgan stay if there is a no vote? That will depend on how Brexit happens, and which operations the bank could and couldn\u2019t keep in Britain, Dimon replies. He continues: \u201cBritain\u2019s been a great home for financial companies and it\u2019s benefited London quite a bit. We\u2019d like to stay there but if we can\u2019t, we can\u2019t. I can\u2019t tell the British people what to do, it\u2019s up to them\u201d Time for a quick recap. Britain\u2019s future in, or out, of Europe has dominated the morning of the second day of the World Economic Forum in Davos. A series of European politicians have urged the UK not to quit the European Union. Dutch PM Mark Rutte said Europe needs Britain\u2019s \u201coutward looking , trade oriented, growth oriented\u201d approach, and urged UK business and community leaders to speak out. French PM Manuel Valls said Brexit would be a tragedy, while German finance minister Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble called it a disaster for Britain, and the EU. Valls also suggested that David Cameron will not succeed in completing his renegotiations next month. The migration crisis has also loomed large: Sch\u00e4uble called for a new Marshall Plan to tackle Europe\u2019s refugee crisis, saying billions must be spent. Rutte said that the Dublin agreement, under which migrants seek residency in the first EU country they register in, must be reformed. Otherwise the Schengen agreement allowing free movement across most EU countries will collapse. And Greek PM Alexis Tsipras said the EU needs to do more to help \u201ctransit countries\u201d such as Greece and devise a properly thought-out and paid-for relocation and resettlement plan. Tsipras also clashed with Sch\u00e4uble over Europe\u2019s approach to growth and austerity. The Greek PM wants more help; Germany\u2019s finance minister wants more competitiveness. Elsewhere in Davos... US Treasury secretary Jack Lew has hinted that markets have over-reacted to the oil price slump and China\u2019s slowdown. The chief economist of Brazil\u2019s biggest bank has warned its economic woes could last until 2018 A top Chinese official has defended Beijing\u2019s handling of the crisis.... ...after Christine Lagarde said China has a communication problem. The boss of HSBC has warned that it is hard to raise money for green energy right now The European Central Bank has kept its interest rates unchanged, as expected. After December\u2019s cut, it has left the deposit rate at -0.3%. Its benchmark refinancing rate is steady at 0.05%. The euro has inched up to $1.0915 following the news. Now for ECB president Mario Draghi\u2019s press conference, due shortly. Italy hopes to agree a plan with the EU to help its struggling banks by next week at the latest, Reuters is reporting. The report says the idea is to set up vehicles to help banks sell bad loans, with a disposal price equivalent to between 20% and 30% of the nominal value of the loan. The latest proposal submitted by Italy is being discussed with a technical meeting due on Friday. Yesterday, there were reports that some customers were withdrawing savings from Monte Paschi bank, with its chief executive saying said the fall in deposits was \u201climited\u201d and that the bank could cope with it.. Jack Lew managed to crack a joke; things can\u2019t be that bad. The US Treasury secretary, Jack Lew, is discussing the state of the US economy, and the wider globe. Lew begins by warning that the world economy isn\u2019t strong enough: I look around the world and there are a lot of headwinds. We\u2019ve seen very slugging growth in demand for some years now, and that\u2019s led to a not-strong-enough global economy. And now that things are developing in parts of the global economy that are disruptive, people are reacting to it. And he argues that people are being too negative over recent developments, such as the slump in crude oil. For anyone consuming oil, lower oil is a tax cut. And on China, Lew says the situation isn\u2019t dramatically different than last year. They are in a long and difficult transition, from an export-driven economy to a consumer one. That\u2019s a tough and disruptive process. The big issue in China is whether it can stick to its own economic reform plan, and deliver the growth that it, and the world economy, needs. He said it was important to see how China handled its currency - which was deprecated last summer - and called for \u201can orderly transition\u201d with the exchange rate, and for the Chinese to allow industrial capacity to \u201cright size. \u201cThese are big ifs\u201d, Lew said. And Lew also hints that investors may be getting too jumpy. I know it\u2019s been bumpy days in the market, but I try to look beyond the hour to hour, day to day, to what the big trends are. I\u2019m not minimising that it\u2019s been choppy in the markets, but I think you do need to look at some of these underlying trends in a long-term way. Ilan Goldfajn, chief economist at Brazil\u2019s biggest bank, Ita\u00fa Unibanco, says that his country\u2019s economic malaise is unlikely to be tackled until 2018. Goldfajn warned that : \u201cBrazil has a fiscal problem, it has an external problem and it has a political problem.\u201d The impeachment proceedings against Brazil\u2019s president Dilma Rousseff meant there had \u201cbeen a lame duck government from day one\u201d. Congress was blocking any attempts to resolve Brazil\u2019s economic problems, in part caused by the collapse in commodity prices and in part by mismanagement. Every country in South America had seen its growth rate halved since the end of the commodity super-cycle, Goldfajn said, but Brazil had done much worse than that. It had gone from growth of 4% a year to contraction of 4% a year. The political impasse would last until the next presidential election in 2018, he fears, saying: \u201cThe most likely scenario is that the economic problems are not going to be resolved until then. The economy will eventually not be in recession but there won\u2019t be a recovery either.\u201d Germany\u2019s finance minister, Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble, warned Davos that Brexit would be disastrous for all involved: BP\u2019s chief executive Bob Dudley says the current situation in the oil market reminds him of the 1986 crisis, where oversupply led to a collapse in prices, reports Reuters. Speaking in Davos, Dudley said he expected further pressure on prices this year as Iran ramped up exports: The first and second quarter will be very difficult....It is a big shock for producing countries. It reminds me of 1986. Prices will remain low for longer but not forever. He said markets would begin to rebalance later in 2016 as the glut of oil reduces and investment falls. Brent crude is currently down 0.4% at $27.76 a barrel. Manuel Valls has also told reporters here that he doesn\u2019t think David Cameron will agree a renegotiation deal next month: French PM Manual Valls says it would be a \u201ctragedy for Europe\u201d if the UK quit the Union. He tells Davos that David Cameron is making some good points, and that a more simple and effective Europe would be good for everyone. We must find a compromise, and everyone must contribute to it. Our British friends must understand we will move forwards hand in hand, together, Valls continues. And he warns that the sight of Britain going it alone, at a time when countries need to work more closely to tackle the world\u2019s problems, would be disastrous: Nothing would be worse than to see a country like UK leave, it would lead to more populism. Dutch prime minister Mark Rutte has told Davos that Europe \u201cneeds\u201d the United Kingdom to stay within the European Union. He also called on business and community leaders at Davos to campaign for the In side in the upcoming referendum, echoing David Cameron\u2019s speech this afternoon. Rutte says: The UK is outward looking , trade oriented, growth oriented, and we do not have enough of that storyline, that tradition, that culture within the European Union. The European Union can only survive if it is relevant to its people, and it can only be relevant if it leads to economic growth, more jobs and prosperity. It is also crucial for the UK to not lose its place in Europe: I believe the United Kingdom will be worse off outside the EU. It will not have the influence it has in the world today.... Isn\u2019t it strange to even debate a Brexit at a time the world is facing all these huge issues and challenges? Rutte goes on to call Cameron \u201cinfluential\u201d and an \u201cexcellent prime minister\u201d. We would all be worse off if he left, so all 28 countries must work together to create an EU that is more competitive, more outwardd-looking, more growth-oriented. If we could achieve that, the whole episide will have a positive ending Are you optimistic about the upcoming summit? Rutte says he is fairly optimistic that leaders could get to an postiive outcome in February, but not certain. He\u2019s also fairly optimistic about the referendum, and urges Davos attendees to speak out. I hope that all of you, business leaders, community leaders, with influence in the United Kingdom will participate. Don\u2019t leave it all to the politicians. You should not preach, as that will never work, but to explain to the British public why it is important in your view for the UK to be part of the European Union. Music to David Cameron\u2019s ears, I expect, as he tours Davos today. Asked about the IMF\u2019s role in the Greek bailout, Sch\u00e4uble appears to admit that he was over-ruled by chancellor Merkel: And the German parliament approved the 3rd bailout on those terms: Sch\u00e4uble responds to Tsipras, saying he does agree that Europe should help countries who need it. But Europe also need to be competitive. Germany has its own problems, including demographic (its ageing population). If we want to make Europe stronger, then we should implement what we agreed to implement. We could just say implementation, stupid. Back to Alexis Tsipras. He says Greece has made great efforts to reform its economy in recent years, through an unprecedented downturn. We lost 25% of our GDP, and unemployment skyrocketed, says the Greek PM. Tsipras then inplicitly criticises Europe\u2019s approach to Greece, saying: Greece needs considerable structural reforms. We must all understand that next to balanced budget, we also have to have growth. Greece needs to tackle corruption, boost investment, and help the state to rebuild itself. And he demands more solidarity, saying: We need a co-ordinated growth strategy, and Europe must help to diminish the inequalities between North and South. We need more Europe, and show more solidarity as well. Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble refuses to say whether Germany can cope with another million refugees this year. And he says Europe must spend billions on the areas where refugees are fleeing. He agrees with Alexis Tsipras that Europe cannot become a fortress This problem will cost the European public more than expected, But it cannot be ignored. Sch\u00e4uble says, if Europe is to guarantee its security. It is a problem of and for Europe. Everything that goes wrong with these regions won\u2019t end up in Canada, it will end up in Europe. Alexis Tsipras says all European countries must share the burden of the refugee crisis. Europe must create a two-way system for migration, so people can be returned home. He also calls for much more co-operations between countries; Greece simply cannot cope alone. Next question, on migration, goes to Dutch PM Mark Rutte. Can the Schengen Agreement survive the refugee crisis? Rutte says that 35,000 people have already arrived on the shores of Europe this year. When spring comes, and the numbers quadruple, we cannot as a European Union cannot cope with the numbers any longer. This is the immediate agenda for the next few months. And the priorities include: Success of EU-Turkish union Successful hotspots in Greece and Turkey and Italy Schengen is crucial, Rutte continues. But we also have the Dublin agreement, and it isn\u2019t working. Before we kill Schengen, we have to make Dublin work.... No-one wants to kill Schengen, but if it is only a fair-weather system then it cannot survive. Manuel Valls, France\u2019s prime minister, kicks off the European session by saying security and terrorism are one of the biggest challenges faced by the continent. We are at war against terrorism. A world war. And we as Europeans need to face up to this. And European must work together to fight it, pooling resources, and also sharing more information - including a common programme of oversight of flights and airports. So could EU forces be deployed to hot spots in the Middle East? We need more Europe, not less, says Valls, as he thanks everyone who offered help and support to France after the Paris terror attacks. The Middle East is just two hours from Europe - we cannot ignore what is going on there. We must move away from this selfishness, and find the means to deal with this historic challenge. Hundreds of people are pouring into the Davos Congress Hall for the main set-piece event of the morning - the Future of Europe session. It will pit Greece\u2019s Alexis Tsipras against Germany\u2019s Wolfgang Schauble, with France\u2019s Manual Valls, the Netherland\u2019s Mark Rutte, and Eni chairman Emma Marcegaglia. You can watch it live, here: Perhaps we spoke too soon. The attempted rally in Europe seems to be petering out, with the FTSE down around 8 points and Germany\u2019s Dax off 24 points. Dow futures are also falling, now indicating a 130 point decline at the opening bell. David Morrison at Spread Co said: Equities are on the slide again as crude oil continues its relentless decline. Both WTI and Brent are trading below $28 for the usual supply/demand reasons. However, there are also concerns as speculation mounts over the possibility that Saudi Arabia may unpeg the riyal from the US dollar. The strength of the greenback combined with the low oil price is a serious drain on the Kingdom\u2019s reserves and breaking the peg would be one way of easing the pain. Looks like another topsy-turvey day. Here\u2019s our report on today\u2019s session on the Chinese economy: A senior Chinese official has defended the country\u2019s economic policies and urged investors to stop fixation on fluctuations in its stock market. Fang Xinghai, Office of the central leading group for financial and economic affairs, told the World Economic Forum that while the stock market was down 40% from its peak it was up 30% over 18 months, He also insisted that there was no basis on which to devalue the currency and said the country was commitment to moving to shadowing a basket of currencies. He declared: \u201cChina\u2019s record of honouring itss commitment is superb\u201d. He is speaking against a backdrop of countries concerned about the Chinese economy, its currency - which was devalued during the summer - and the volatility in its stock market. Gary Cohn, chief operating officer of Goldman, said most market participants believed China would devalue its currency this year. He joined Christine Lagarde, managing director of the International Monetary Fund, in calling for better communication over its polices. Lagarde said: Given the massive transitions in China, there is a communication issue - this is something that markets do not like. Uncertainty, not knowing exactly what the policy is. Not knowing exactly what the renmimni is valued against - the dollar, or a basket of currencies. Better and more communication\u201d would serve the country better, she said. Gary Cohn, chief operating officer of Goldman Sachs, agreed with Lagarde and urged the Chinese to stick its polices once they have been communicated. Fang Xinghai has also told Davos that there is need for more co-operation with global policymakers around the world,\u201dWe have to cooperate more closely to overcome this soft patch,\u201d Fang said. Taken to task by Ray Dalio of Bridgewater Associations about what this co-operation meant, Fang said it meant in all areas. More on the ECB ahead of today\u2019s meeting: Germany\u2019s finance minister, Wolfgang Schauble, has weighed in on the Brexit question, arguing Britain should stay in Europe: Italy\u2019s prime minister, Matteo Renzi, is reported to have pulled out of Davos to deal with the problems in the Italian banking sector: Yesterday, there were reports that customers were pulling funds out of the Monti Paschi bank, on concerns over its bad debts. European markets are holding onto their early gains, while US futures are suggesting a dip of around 45 points on the Dow Jones Industrial Average when Wall Street opens. David Morrison at trading company Spread Co said: The reaction to the overnight Asian Pacific slump from European equities and US stock index futures has been surprisingly muted. At the time of writing, all the major indices are in positive territory. On the face of it this is quite encouraging, particularly as crude is still trading near its 2003 lows. But once again, what looks like the beginning of a recovery in equities could easily turn out to be nothing more than a \u201cdead-cat bounce.\u201d There\u2019s no doubt there have been signs of stress in global equities for a while now. As far as the US is concerned, in the latter half of 2015 the FANG stocks (Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Google (Alphabet)) were responsible for holding up the major indices as the broader market declined. Technically, the major indices formed a topping pattern as they failed to make fresh highs after the China-inspired summer sell-off. Stress in the high yield bond market was becoming apparent even before the Fed hiked rates. That hike now looks as if it will go down as one of the worst-timed rate rises in history, even crowning the ECB\u2019s classic efforts in 2011. To top it all, China suffered a second melt-down just as we began the New Year. The Dutch finance minister, Jeroen Dijsselbloem, has admitted that Europe blundered by not dealing with its banks faster. A group of demonstrators have been spotted in Davos. They\u2019re protesting against China\u2019s activities in the Pakistani territory of Balochistan, where Beijing is developing a large new economic zone. Rough translation: Protests in Davos are not so large now. And that\u2019s because of the huge security presence in this ski resort, which clamps down on any signs of dissent. Top Chinese official Fang Xinghai has hit back at Christine Lagarde\u2019s complaint about communications failings (see earlier post) Fang is the vice chairman of the China Securities Regulatory Commission, and a senio advisor to the premier Li Keqiang. With markets in turmoil, oil sliding to new lows, concerns about Chinese growth and worries about whether central bankers have run out of ammunition to support the global economy, the president of the European Central Bank will be on the spot later to spell out where he thinks we go from here. Mario Draghi will unveil the ECB\u2019s latest measures - more QE? Perhaps not yet - in a statement and press conference in Frankfurt. After last month, when the measures announced proved a disappointment, and the more hawkish elements on the ECB clearly prevented the bank from doing more, Draghi\u2019s comments will be widely watched. Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK, said: Today\u2019s focus is likely to shine on the first ECB rate meeting of 2016, against a continuing backdrop of weak inflation in the euro area. With last month\u2019s December disappointment still fresh in the memory ECB President Mario Draghi will have to convince the markets that the ECB has a plan, and the ammunition to cope with the further slide in inflationary pressures that are likely to ripple across Europe in the coming weeks. It is clear that the hawks won out last month preventing the ECB from acting in a much stronger fashion, and in the process giving the ECB President a bloody nose, after he had indicated the prospect of much stronger action. How Mr Draghi navigates these divisions will be particularly pertinent given how they were revealed in the most recent minutes, especially given that the next projections in March are likely to see inflation expectations guided lower. This is because since last month\u2019s December meeting oil prices have slid another 35%, which means that while the ECB President might come across as dovish later today, after last month\u2019s disappointment markets may not necessarily take him at his word. Economists at Unicredit said: ECB president Mario Draghi will likely sound dovish today, but we expect him to strike a reasonable balance. Mr. Draghi will be careful to avoid fuelling too much speculation about further action to avoid a repetition of the December experience, when the announcement of QE2 fell short of high expectations. At the time, the market\u2019s disappointed reaction resulted in a 3% rally in euro-dollar exchange rate. Today, we do not expect the meeting to cause any major move in exchange rates, as the market seems prepared for a relatively balanced debate. The euro has held up well since the 3 December meeting, and it would take a strong (unexpected) dovish signal of imminent action to change this pattern. Mic Mills at Capital Index said: All eyes today will be on the ECB with the interest rate decision at 12:45 [GMT] followed by Draghi giving the post meeting press conference at 13:30, which after last month will need to persuade the markets that there is more in the cupboard, as there seems to be no respite in sight when it comes to deflationary pressure. FXTM analyst Lukman Otunuga said: For an extended period falling commodity prices have left the Eurozone engaged in an ongoing one-sided battle against stubbornly low inflation levels, while stalling domestic economic growth continues to test the European Central Bank\u2019s credibility. It is widely expected that the ECB will remain on standby today and keep rates unchanged, but Mario Draghi may reiterate his dovish mantra and threaten further QE in an attempt to talk down the value of the Euro. At an HSBC breakfast on climate change, the bank\u2019s chief executive Stuart Gulliver has said the current state of the financial markets is not exactly conducive to raising private funds to tackle global warming. \u201cThe markets are showing signs of quite significant distress and it is not a high priority for fund managers to set up a green fund\u201d, Gulliver says. He also says that the crash in oil prices may have the \u201cunintended consequence\u201d of deterring investment in alternative energy sources because the R&amp;D costs will be considered too high. Gulliver says that following the Paris climate change conference governments and the private sector had to raise $5tn a year over the next two decades. \u201cIt is a vast financing challenge\u201d, he says. Despite the falls in Asia, European markets have made a positive start, if not a totally convincing one. The FTSE 100 is up 31 points or 0.5%, while France\u2019s Cac has climbed 0.1%, Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB is 0.5% better and Spain\u2019s Ibex has added 0.5%. Germany\u2019s Dax, despite Deutsche Bank saying it expected to report a record loss of \u20ac6.7bn for 2015, is ahead by 0.2%. IMF chief Christine Lagarde has warned that Beijing needs to improve the way it communicates with the markets. Currently, investors are being spooked as they watch China embark on a huge economic rebalancing. She tells today\u2019s discussion on China that: Given the massive transitions in China, there is a communication issue - this is something that markets do not like. Uncertainty, not knowing exactly what the policy is. Not knowing exactly what the renmimni is valued against - the dollar, or a basket of currencies. China\u2019s rebalancing is \u201cperfectly manageable\u201d if the right policies are taken, she adds. Ji\u0101ng Ji\u00e0nq\u012bng, the Chairman of the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, has argued that China can\u2019t be blamed for the stock market turmoil. Speaking on a panel in China\u2019s economy, Ji\u00e0nq\u012bng said a range of factors are being it. He cites the slow pace of recovery in the world economy, meaning growth is flat. The US interest rate hike, and economic policies in the EU have also created volatility. And commodity prices are under pressure. So the world all over is facing volatility. Some reasons are normal, some are abnormal. There is a certain degree of panic in the market. Policymakers must implement structural reforms to lead the world economy out of this period of low growth, and regulators should work together to reduce volatility. European markets are expected to make an uncertain start after Wednesday\u2019s rout, which saw the FTSE 100 head into bear market territory. A recovery on the Dow Jones Industrial Average from its worst levels \u2013 albeit still showing a 249 point fall \u2013 may give some support, although Asian markets lost their early gains to head into the red again. Here are the opening calls in Europe: Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK, said: Now that equity markets, both here in Europe and in the US have slipped into bear market territory the big question now is where do we go to next. That looks highly likely to depend on oil prices and a late rebound off the lows yesterday did see US markets recoup a large portion of their losses, the Dow was 566 points down at one stage, but they still finished the day below their previous lows in August. This late rebound should be enough to see European markets open higher this morning, a welcome respite after yesterday\u2019s sell-off, but it is going to need a significant turnaround in sentiment to recoup the losses seen so far this week, and prevent markets from posting their third successive weekly decline. Oil in fact is slipping back again, with Brent crude down 1% at $27.58 a barrel. David Cameron is to call on the UK\u2019s business chiefs to support him in the upcoming EU referendum to secure Britain\u2019s place in a reformed EU. The prime minister is using his trip to Davos to drum up support, ahead of a potentially decisive EU summit in February where he could secure concessions from fellow European leaders. The PM is expected to say that: \u201cThis is a once-in-a-generation moment and the stakes are high.\u201d Cameron\u2019s message to business chiefs is that if they want Britain to remain in the EU with less red tape and a more complete single market, they need to come out and back the In Campaign. He\u2019ll say: If you want a more competitive Europe, where the single market is completed, where there are more trade deals and fewer regulations: join me in making that case. \u201cIf you believe, like I do, that Britain is better off in a reformed European Union, then, when the time comes, help me make that case for Britain to stay.\u201d Business leaders in Davos have been very unwilling to talk on the record about the Brexit issue, while many international delegates have sounded more worried about the prospect of Britain leaving the EU. So Cameron will certainly be in demand today, as he holds a series of \u2018bilateral\u2019 meetings. Good morning from Davos, where the second day of the World Economic Forum is getting underway. Yesterday\u2019s stock market plunges have sent a shiver through this little ski resort, as the \u201cglobal elite\u201d gather to debate the major issues of the moment. And world leaders and business chiefs will be monitoring events in the markets closely again, following a wild day\u2019s trading in Asia overnight. Today\u2019s session will be dominated by Europe, with prime minister David Cameron giving a big set-piece speech in the afternoon. Cameron is also due to meet with Argentina\u2019s new president, Mauricio Macri, in what could be a thawing of relations between the two countries. Greece is also in focus today, as prime minister Alexis Tsipras tries to lobby creditor nations to cut Athens some slack on austerity and debt relief. He\u2019s expected to meet with Christine Lagarde during the day. And there\u2019s also a big focus on geopolitics, with the migration crisis and the turmoil in the Middle East. Some sessions which we\u2019ll try to cover include: 8.45am CET (7.45am GMT): Where is the Chinese economy headed? Including IMF chief Christine Lagarde 10.15am CET A debate on the future of Europe, including French PM Manuel Valls, Greek PM Alexis Tsipras, Dutch PM Mark Rutte and German finance minister Wolfgang Schauble 12.30pm CET: Treasury secretary Jack Lew discusses \u201cglobal financial priorities in 2016.\u201d 2pm CET: David Cameron on Britain\u2019s place in the world 3pm: How to educate Syria\u2019s displaced children",

Moscovici said he was ready to pursue the idea, as the commission\u2019s latest approach \u201ccould reduce the reluctance of some member states\u201d. All tax plans have to be agreed by all 28 EU member states, prompting fears that they could be watered down. Moscovici expects countries will sign up to his anti-avoidance plan by the summer, far faster than the usual EU legislative process. He said he was optimistic because EU governments had already signed up to a non-binding version of the plan through the OECD. He thinks public pressure will help: \u201cMember states today are conscious of the demand from public opinion.\u201d Not everyone shares this view. Markus Ferber, a German centre-right MEP, who has campaigned against tax avoidance, said he was concerned that EU countries would dilute the tax-avoidance plan, citing an agreement on a tax transparency directive last December that he sees as limited. \u201cThey adopted something to say they did something, but in reality it does not change anything at all,\u201d he said. \u201cThat is my experience, so I am pessimistic [about the latest proposals].\u201d",

                "body":"<p>Remember when the future of retail was online? Now it seems that online retailers have decided they can\u2019t get by without bricks and mortar.</p> <p>Amazon raised eyebrows in November when it <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/jan/21/amazon-books-opens-seattle-independent-bookstores\">opened its first brick and mortar extension</a> \u2013 a bookstore in Seattle\u2019s University Village. The online giant\u2019s rise, after all, is blamed for laying waste to independent bookshops across the country.<br></p> <p>But Amazon is only among the latest, if largest, e-commerce players to take a stab at traditional retail after starting life online.<br></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/nov/05/amazon-book-store-seattle\">Amazon boldly goes where no internet bookseller has gone before: the real world</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In the last few years, some 20 online companies in the US have launched a physical presence to better market their wares, forge closer customer relations, and yes, boost online traffic and sales. Amazon aside, these include mostly specialty and clothing stores such as Warby Parker, Bonobos, Birchbox and Casper.<br></p> <p>The trend also reflects the broader industry imperative around \u201comni-channel\u201d retailing, where merchants aim to provide customers with a seamless experience whether shopping online via desktop or mobile device or at a traditional retail store. <br></p> <p>Underscoring that point, the National Retail Federation\u2019s annual \u201cBig Show\u201d conference in New York earlier this month featured half a dozen sessions that included the term in their titles.<br></p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s very hard to launch a brand these days that\u2019s just online-only. It\u2019s an incredibly difficult and crowded e-commerce environment,\u201d said Sucharita Mulpuru, a retail analyst at Forrester Research. She noted there are more than 800,000 online stores, all vying to attract customers through the gateway of Google.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Online real estate has become crowded and expensive. Bidding on keywords against the likes of Amazon and large traditional retailers to land on the first page of search results is a costly game.<br></p> <p>Macy\u2019s and Nordstrom, for example, spent an estimated $6.4m and $4m, respectively, in paid search listings for the top 1,000 apparel-related keywords in the first quarter of 2015, according to a study this month from <a href=\"http://www.l2inc.com\">L2 Inc</a>, a research firm that tracks digital brands. <br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>\u201cClicks disproportionately go to the highest-placed search ads, with little room for differentiation,\u201d states the L2 report, which examines what it calls \u201cevolved retailers\u201d \u2013 online merchants that have opened brick and mortar storefronts.</p> <p>By opening physical stores, they aim to increase awareness and draw customers in a realm where the retail options aren\u2019t infinite or influenced by an all-powerful gatekeeper. And for purveyors of tactile and personal products like clothing, eyewear and jewelry, selling stuff in person has an obvious appeal.</p> <p>For many, the offline foray has started with a trial pop-up shop before launching flagship stores in high-profile shopping districts like New York\u2019s SoHo neighborhood or Chicago\u2019s Michigan Avenue. Encouraged by the results, some have since expanded quickly.</p> <p>\u201cThe big benefit of the flagship stores is that they\u2019re terrific marketing vehicles,\u201d said Jason Goldberg, senior vice-president of commerce and content at digital agency Razorfish. \u201cNot only do those stores tend to be economically successful on their own but they generate a huge lift in incremental shopping to the online store.\u201d</p> <p>That\u2019s been the case for Warby Parker, which has created a popular brand by selling stylish eyeglass frames for under $100. After starting online in 2010, it opened its Soho flagship three years later and now has 20 stores nationwide, with plans to add another 20 this year.<br></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/apr/30/warby-parker-eyewear-valuation-funding-t-rowe-price\">Eyewear upstart Warby Parker valued at $1.2bn after latest round of funding</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Co-founder and co-chief executive Dave Gilboa said Warby Parker stores that have been open at least two years are already profitable. \u201cWe also see a halo effect where stores themselves become a great generator of awareness for our brand and drive a lot of traffic to our website, as well and accelerate our e-commerce sales,\u201d he added. <br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Gilboa declined to disclose actual sales figures but the company\u2019s rapid ascent hasn\u2019t been lost on investors. T Rowe Price last spring led a $100m round of funding in Warby Parker at a reported $1.2bn valuation, making it a so-called unicorn.</p> <p>While someone can leave a Warby Parker store sporting a new pair of glasses, other e-tailers have opened what are essentially showrooms. This approach allows customers to size and sample products while minimizing real estate and other traditional retail costs.</p> <p>Among the best-known brands adopting this model is menswear shop Bonobos. Billed as \u201cguideshops\u201d, its 20 stores let customers try on clothing while orders are placed online for home delivery.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>The concept is that men want to shop in stores, but don\u2019t necessarily want to leave toting shopping bags. \u201cThis supported our idea of using Bonobos.com as the place to fulfill orders, so we didn\u2019t have to worry about stocking inventory in a location and we could focus more on the customer experience,\u201d said Erin Ersenkal, Bonobos\u2019 chief revenue officer. </p> <p>The average order size in Bonobos\u2019 stores has proven to be twice that of online, with a higher proportion of new customers also coming through the guideshops.</p> <p>Similarly, jewelry e-tailer Blue Nile last year opened its first standalone outpost in the Roosevelt Field mall on Long Island for similar reasons to Bonobos. \u201cConsumers\u2019 No 1 objection to buying [jewelry] online is not being able to see and touch and feel the product,\u201d explained CEO Harvey Kanter.</p> <p>Purchases are still made online, where the company says prices are typically 20% to 40% lower than its traditional counterparts.<br></p> <p>Unlike others embracing brick and mortar, publicly traded Blue Nile is hardly a startup. Founded in 1999, it survived the dotcom bust, and is on track this year for revenue of about $500m.

                "bodyText":"Remember when the future of retail was online? Now it seems that online retailers have decided they can\u2019t get by without bricks and mortar. Amazon raised eyebrows in November when it opened its first brick and mortar extension \u2013 a bookstore in Seattle\u2019s University Village. The online giant\u2019s rise, after all, is blamed for laying waste to independent bookshops across the country. But Amazon is only among the latest, if largest, e-commerce players to take a stab at traditional retail after starting life online. In the last few years, some 20 online companies in the US have launched a physical presence to better market their wares, forge closer customer relations, and yes, boost online traffic and sales. Amazon aside, these include mostly specialty and clothing stores such as Warby Parker, Bonobos, Birchbox and Casper. The trend also reflects the broader industry imperative around \u201comni-channel\u201d retailing, where merchants aim to provide customers with a seamless experience whether shopping online via desktop or mobile device or at a traditional retail store. Underscoring that point, the National Retail Federation\u2019s annual \u201cBig Show\u201d conference in New York earlier this month featured half a dozen sessions that included the term in their titles. \u201cIt\u2019s very hard to launch a brand these days that\u2019s just online-only. It\u2019s an incredibly difficult and crowded e-commerce environment,\u201d said Sucharita Mulpuru, a retail analyst at Forrester Research. She noted there are more than 800,000 online stores, all vying to attract customers through the gateway of Google. Online real estate has become crowded and expensive. Bidding on keywords against the likes of Amazon and large traditional retailers to land on the first page of search results is a costly game. Macy\u2019s and Nordstrom, for example, spent an estimated $6.4m and $4m, respectively, in paid search listings for the top 1,000 apparel-related keywords in the first quarter of 2015, according to a study this month from L2 Inc, a research firm that tracks digital brands. \u201cClicks disproportionately go to the highest-placed search ads, with little room for differentiation,\u201d states the L2 report, which examines what it calls \u201cevolved retailers\u201d \u2013 online merchants that have opened brick and mortar storefronts. By opening physical stores, they aim to increase awareness and draw customers in a realm where the retail options aren\u2019t infinite or influenced by an all-powerful gatekeeper. And for purveyors of tactile and personal products like clothing, eyewear and jewelry, selling stuff in person has an obvious appeal. For many, the offline foray has started with a trial pop-up shop before launching flagship stores in high-profile shopping districts like New York\u2019s SoHo neighborhood or Chicago\u2019s Michigan Avenue. Encouraged by the results, some have since expanded quickly. \u201cThe big benefit of the flagship stores is that they\u2019re terrific marketing vehicles,\u201d said Jason Goldberg, senior vice-president of commerce and content at digital agency Razorfish. \u201cNot only do those stores tend to be economically successful on their own but they generate a huge lift in incremental shopping to the online store.\u201d That\u2019s been the case for Warby Parker, which has created a popular brand by selling stylish eyeglass frames for under $100. After starting online in 2010, it opened its Soho flagship three years later and now has 20 stores nationwide, with plans to add another 20 this year. Co-founder and co-chief executive Dave Gilboa said Warby Parker stores that have been open at least two years are already profitable. \u201cWe also see a halo effect where stores themselves become a great generator of awareness for our brand and drive a lot of traffic to our website, as well and accelerate our e-commerce sales,\u201d he added. Gilboa declined to disclose actual sales figures but the company\u2019s rapid ascent hasn\u2019t been lost on investors. T Rowe Price last spring led a $100m round of funding in Warby Parker at a reported $1.2bn valuation, making it a so-called unicorn. While someone can leave a Warby Parker store sporting a new pair of glasses, other e-tailers have opened what are essentially showrooms. This approach allows customers to size and sample products while minimizing real estate and other traditional retail costs. Among the best-known brands adopting this model is menswear shop Bonobos. Billed as \u201cguideshops\u201d, its 20 stores let customers try on clothing while orders are placed online for home delivery. The concept is that men want to shop in stores, but don\u2019t necessarily want to leave toting shopping bags. \u201cThis supported our idea of using Bonobos.com as the place to fulfill orders, so we didn\u2019t have to worry about stocking inventory in a location and we could focus more on the customer experience,\u201d said Erin Ersenkal, Bonobos\u2019 chief revenue officer. The average order size in Bonobos\u2019 stores has proven to be twice that of online, with a higher proportion of new customers also coming through the guideshops. Similarly, jewelry e-tailer Blue Nile last year opened its first standalone outpost in the Roosevelt Field mall on Long Island for similar reasons to Bonobos. \u201cConsumers\u2019 No 1 objection to buying [jewelry] online is not being able to see and touch and feel the product,\u201d explained CEO Harvey Kanter. Purchases are still made online, where the company says prices are typically 20% to 40% lower than its traditional counterparts. Unlike others embracing brick and mortar, publicly traded Blue Nile is hardly a startup. Founded in 1999, it survived the dotcom bust, and is on track this year for revenue of about $500m. So why hit the mall now? Compared with other e-commerce categories, jewelry still has low penetration online, said Kanter. Venturing offline is a way to spur higher growth. Since opening last June, Blue Nile has seen a lift in traffic and sales in the region around its initial Long Island location. As such, it plans to open another three or four \u201cWebrooms\u201d in the first six months of 2016. As Blue Nile and other e-tailers branch out, though, don\u2019t expect them to pop up on Main Street. Given the focus on marketing, marquee locations in select cities are more likely to be their turf. \u201cTheir economic future isn\u2019t tied to opening a store in Montana or Idaho or some of those smaller markets,\u201d said Razorfish\u2019s Goldberg. Even so, Claude de Jocas, research lead on the L2 study, said the benefits of economies of scale could lead to adding more locations. \u201cSome are also beefing up their physical retail teams with senior-level hires, suggesting aggressive expansion plans are in the works,\u201d she said.
