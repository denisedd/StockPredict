The problems are centred on GoPro\u2019s Hero4 Session \u2013 a new camera released last year small enough to fit in the palm of a hand. But buyers balked at the $399 launch price. GoPro cut the price to $299, and then again to $199 (about \u00a3170 in the UK ) in a bid to boost sales. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/jan/14/tech-company-stock-fall-apple-alphabet-twitter-facebook-gopro\">Stock market's 2016 rout has tech firms reeling \u2013 and may prove fatal for some</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Cheap Chinese competition, from firms like Xiaomi, is another headache. And spooking investors further, the group said it would cut its workforce by around 7%, costing it between $5-10m in restructuring expenses.<br></p> <p>The statement was more bad news for investors who have been disappointed time and again in recent months. The shares dropped below the issue price of $24 for the first time in November. Over the whole of 2015 they were down 70% . </p> <p>Citi analyst Jeremy David slashed his price target last month from $75 to $22, saying the GoPro novelty may be wearing off: \u201cWe are becoming worried that poor sell thru could be a reflection of diminishing consumer interest in new GoPro devices.\u201d After this week\u2019s news, he\u2019s reduced his target further, to $12.</p> <p>Woodman dreamed up the idea for GoPro during a surfing trip after the digital marketing firm he started after college became a casualty of the dot-com collapse. At the time of the float his GoPro shareholding was valued at around $1.3bn. Now it\u2019s worth around half that.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eS8uanVc6k8\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/eS8uanVc6k8?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption>Compilation of GoPro videos</figcaption> </figure>   <p>Needless to say, shareholders have been left unimpressed and are reaching for their lawyers. At least one law firm has started legal action, claiming that the company\u2019s management has been too slow to warn investors about its deteriorating sales prospects.<br></p> <p>Glancy, Prongay and Murray, a Los Angeles-based law firm, alleges in its class action lawsuit that GoPro\u2019s management statements since July 2015 have been false and misleading \u2013 specifically with reference to sales of the group\u2019s Hero camera range.</p> <p>For others, the extreme market reaction to problems in the delivery of one product is a very good reason to remain in the private sector and not float.</p> <p>Suranga Chandratillake, a partner at Balderton, an investor in companies such as Betfair, Wonga and The Hut, said the huge share price reaction was down to one product not working out as expected: \u201cWhile that is not a good thing, the reaction seems extreme and is typical of public markets \u2013 extreme enthusiasm/pessimism around technology companies.\u201d</p> <p>That overreaction, he says, \u201cis one of the big drivers of why many big tech companies, such as Uber and AirBnb, are choosing to stay private. It allows them to stay agile, build for the long term,\u201d he says.</p> <p>GoPro\u2019s statement came in the middle of a difficult week for US technology stocks. Over the last week both Fitbit, the exercise monitor, and Etsy, the digital crafts marketplace, have sunk to all-time share price lows. <br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Shares in the larger technology companies are also well down on their three-month highs. Facebook was trading at $95 on Friday afternoon, compared with $107 at the end of December. Netflix is down from $130 to around $103, and Amazon\u2019s shares are trading at around $570 compared with $694 at the end of 2015.</p> <p>GoPro\u2019s management and investors will be hoping its next products can revitalise its flagging stock. The company is expected to launch a new line of products in the first half of 2016, including a flying camera. Should that catch on, investors could return.</p> <p>Woodman tried to remain optimistic, when he addressed employees by email after the news of the revenue shortfall. \u201cToday isn\u2019t the type of day we\u2019re used to at GoPro. But from the looks of things \u2026 tomorrow is looking pretty damn good.\u201d</p> <h2>How the tech giants have fared</h2> <p>All the major US technology groups have suffered from share price falls, along with the market, so far this year.</p> <h2>Facebook</h2> <p>Shares in Facebook performed strongly in 2016, finishing the year 33% up. But, in common with its peers, 2016 has been a different story so far and its shares are down 6%. Still they\u2019re trading around $98, which is way above the social media group\u2019s $38 issue price at the time of its Wall Street flotation in 2012.</p> <h2>Amazon</h2> <p>Amazon shares, which finished 2015 122% up on the previous year, have also been losing ground in the first few days of 2016. The Amazon share price, which has touched $700 in the past three months, has now dived under $600 as investors worry that founder Jeff Bezos might ramp up investment in the group again rather than restrict it in order to boost profitability.</p> <h2>Netflix</h2> <p>Netflix shares, which have hovered around $130 in the past three months, have come perilously close to dropping below $100 this week. The nervousness comes in line with the sector but also reflects nervousness over subscriber numbers. Netflix recently announced an earlier-than-expected expansion into 130 new countries, including India and Russia.</p> <h2>Alphabet (formerly known as Google)</h2> <p>Alphabet, the company created last year to become the parent for Google\u2019s search engine and several other companies it owns, is also seeing some weakness, with its shares trading at just under $700 after being around $750 towards the end of last year. Its market capitalisation, though, at $482bn, is fast catching up with Apple.</p> <h2>Twitter</h2> <p>Twitter\u2019s share price has been hitting all-time lows of around $18, well below the $26 price at the time of its flotation in November 2013. Investors are worried about the messaging platform\u2019s slowing user growth and they aren\u2019t yet sold on the idea of adding a service that would adapt its 140 character model.<br></p> <h2>Apple</h2> <p>Apple\u2019s shares have drifted down from around $120 to $96 since November last year as concerns have grown over iPhone sales. The technology giant is scaling back orders for its previously hot-selling device. But it remains the world\u2019s biggest company by market capitalisation, at about $550bn.</p>",

This week, the group\u2019s shares lurched dramatically downwards. On Wednesday, they plunged 28% to just more than $12 as the group said sales were not meeting targets and it would miss revenue projections by around 14%for the calendar year. The problems are centred on GoPro\u2019s Hero4 Session \u2013 a new camera released last year small enough to fit in the palm of a hand. But buyers balked at the $399 launch price. GoPro cut the price to $299, and then again to $199 (about \u00a3170 in the UK ) in a bid to boost sales. Cheap Chinese competition, from firms like Xiaomi, is another headache. And spooking investors further, the group said it would cut its workforce by around 7%, costing it between $5-10m in restructuring expenses. The statement was more bad news for investors who have been disappointed time and again in recent months. The shares dropped below the issue price of $24 for the first time in November. Over the whole of 2015 they were down 70% . Citi analyst Jeremy David slashed his price target last month from $75 to $22, saying the GoPro novelty may be wearing off: \u201cWe are becoming worried that poor sell thru could be a reflection of diminishing consumer interest in new GoPro devices.\u201d After this week\u2019s news, he\u2019s reduced his target further, to $12. Woodman dreamed up the idea for GoPro during a surfing trip after the digital marketing firm he started after college became a casualty of the dot-com collapse. At the time of the float his GoPro shareholding was valued at around $1.3bn. Now it\u2019s worth around half that. Needless to say, shareholders have been left unimpressed and are reaching for their lawyers. At least one law firm has started legal action, claiming that the company\u2019s management has been too slow to warn investors about its deteriorating sales prospects. Glancy, Prongay and Murray, a Los Angeles-based law firm, alleges in its class action lawsuit that GoPro\u2019s management statements since July 2015 have been false and misleading \u2013 specifically with reference to sales of the group\u2019s Hero camera range. For others, the extreme market reaction to problems in the delivery of one product is a very good reason to remain in the private sector and not float. Suranga Chandratillake, a partner at Balderton, an investor in companies such as Betfair, Wonga and The Hut, said the huge share price reaction was down to one product not working out as expected: \u201cWhile that is not a good thing, the reaction seems extreme and is typical of public markets \u2013 extreme enthusiasm/pessimism around technology companies.\u201d That overreaction, he says, \u201cis one of the big drivers of why many big tech companies, such as Uber and AirBnb, are choosing to stay private. It allows them to stay agile, build for the long term,\u201d he says. GoPro\u2019s statement came in the middle of a difficult week for US technology stocks. Over the last week both Fitbit, the exercise monitor, and Etsy, the digital crafts marketplace, have sunk to all-time share price lows. Shares in the larger technology companies are also well down on their three-month highs. Facebook was trading at $95 on Friday afternoon, compared with $107 at the end of December. Netflix is down from $130 to around $103, and Amazon\u2019s shares are trading at around $570 compared with $694 at the end of 2015. GoPro\u2019s management and investors will be hoping its next products can revitalise its flagging stock. The company is expected to launch a new line of products in the first half of 2016, including a flying camera. Should that catch on, investors could return. Woodman tried to remain optimistic, when he addressed employees by email after the news of the revenue shortfall. \u201cToday isn\u2019t the type of day we\u2019re used to at GoPro. But from the looks of things \u2026 tomorrow is looking pretty damn good.\u201d How the tech giants have fared All the major US technology groups have suffered from share price falls, along with the market, so far this year. Facebook Shares in Facebook performed strongly in 2016, finishing the year 33% up. But, in common with its peers, 2016 has been a different story so far and its shares are down 6%. Still they\u2019re trading around $98, which is way above the social media group\u2019s $38 issue price at the time of its Wall Street flotation in 2012. Amazon Amazon shares, which finished 2015 122% up on the previous year, have also been losing ground in the first few days of 2016. The Amazon share price, which has touched $700 in the past three months, has now dived under $600 as investors worry that founder Jeff Bezos might ramp up investment in the group again rather than restrict it in order to boost profitability. Netflix Netflix shares, which have hovered around $130 in the past three months, have come perilously close to dropping below $100 this week. The nervousness comes in line with the sector but also reflects nervousness over subscriber numbers. Netflix recently announced an earlier-than-expected expansion into 130 new countries, including India and Russia. Alphabet (formerly known as Google) Alphabet, the company created last year to become the parent for Google\u2019s search engine and several other companies it owns, is also seeing some weakness, with its shares trading at just under $700 after being around $750 towards the end of last year. Its market capitalisation, though, at $482bn, is fast catching up with Apple. Twitter Twitter\u2019s share price has been hitting all-time lows of around $18, well below the $26 price at the time of its flotation in November 2013. Investors are worried about the messaging platform\u2019s slowing user growth and they aren\u2019t yet sold on the idea of adding a service that would adapt its 140 character model. Apple Apple\u2019s shares have drifted down from around $120 to $96 since November last year as concerns have grown over iPhone sales. The technology giant is scaling back orders for its previously hot-selling device. But it remains the world\u2019s biggest company by market capitalisation, at about $550bn.",

Biden told U.S. executives including Nathan Blecharczyk, co-founder of apartment-sharing firm Airbnb, Muhtar Kent, chairman and CEO of The Coca Cola Company, and Anthony Scaramucci, founder of hedge fund SkyBridge Capital, to push for change. \u201cYou can change the terms of debate,\u201d he said. \u201cYou actually put governments on notice.\u201d He said he and President Barack Obama privately raise the issue of repression of the LGBT community when they meet political leaders. \u201cI have had some run-ins with at least four heads of state already on this,\u201d said Biden More here: Biden urges U.S. business in Davos to lean on anti-gay states Joe Biden is giving quite a progressive speech tonight at Davos. He\u2019s telling the heads of the world\u2019s biggest businesses that they need to ensure basic protection for workers are the world economy embraces the 4th industrial revolution. Joe Biden also cited one of the statistics of the week - the continued concentration of wealth among the very richest. Joe Biden, the vice-president of the United States, has given the final keynote speech of the day. He started by joking with Christine Lagarde in the audience, saying that he might need some money. Not for a bailout deal (things aren\u2019t that bad today!), but for his own purposes: Whenever I see you, Christine, you say \u201cI know, Greece. I know, Ukraine\u201d. But this time I need a personal loan. But then he turns to the issue of the 4th industrial revolution. It is creating new jobs, and even creating new industries. But will it actually transform the global economy? And will it be for better, or worse? Those who think we must get used to the new normal of slower growth are mistaken, Biden says. Technology is improving productivity, and it can create employment - he cites ride-sharing companies are taking on more staff. And \u201castounding\u201d breakthroughs in science will save lives. But there are dangers, and we must be pro-active. Biden says: How will the warehouse worker who used to ship your order, or the salesman who used to take it, make a living when they are no longer needed? And he goes on to warn that the old relationship between work and wages has been broken, and employees aren\u2019t getting a fair deal: \u201cThe Dow Jones industrial average is down over 500 points\u201d, whispers one Davos attendee. And they\u2019re right. The Dow has shed 536 points, or 3.3%, right now to leave it at 15,475 points. Alexis Tsipras, the Greek prime minister, just whisked through the Davos conference room with a hall entourage. He wasn\u2019t taking press questions, alas, but did share a quick, friendly handshake with Finland\u2019s finance minister, Alex Stubb. I guess relations are warmer than last year, during the months of debt negotiations. Tsipras is meeting with several top officials during his visit, including Christine Lagarde of the IMF. He\u2019s hoping to make persuade them that Athens is making progress, and should be given some leeway on austerity and debt relief. But there is concern that the IMF will take a tough line on pension reform, threatening to reignite the debt crisis again.... US oil prices crashed below $27 for the first time since 2003 after the International Energy Agency warned on Tuesday that the oil market could \u201cdrown in oversupply\u201d. Venezuela requested an emergency Opec meeting to discuss steps to shore up oil prices, but other delegates dismissed the idea. New York light crude tumbled 5.5% to $26.89 a barrel on Wednesday, while Brent crude, the global benchmark, lost 4.2% to $27.56. Plunging oil prices piled further pressure on global stock markets. London\u2019s leading index, the FTSE 100, slid 203.22 points, or 3.5%, to 5673.58. Germany\u2019s Dax tumbled 272.57 points, or 2.8%, to 9391.64 and France\u2019s CAC lost 147.31 points, or 3.5%, to 4124.95. On Wall Street, the Dow Jones has plunged more than 400 points to 15,62.42, a 2.6% drop. The Nasdaq shed 115 points to 4361.53, also a 2.6% fall. Back to Davos, and the Pope has sent a message to politicians and business leaders attending WEF - don\u2019t forget the poorest in society. Pope Francis warned that \u201csoulless machines\u201d should not be allowed to muscle humans out of work, saying: \u201cTo all of you I appeal once more: \u2018Do not forget the poor!\u2019 He continued: Weeping for other people\u2019s pain does not only mean sharing in their sufferings, but also and above all realising that our own actions are a cause of injustice and inequality. Once we realise this, we become more fully human, since responsibility for our brothers and sisters is an essential part of our common humanity. Do not be afraid to open your minds and hearts to the poor. In this way, you will give free rein to your economic and technical talents, and discover the happiness of a full life, which consumerism of itself cannot provide.\u201d Chris Beauchamp, senior market analyst at IG, has summed up the action on financial markets: FTSE bears have been enjoying themselves today, as the index touches levels not seen since late 2012. The UK market has not been alone, as Europe and now the US join in with the panic of January 2016. Bond yields are heading lower too as investors shun risky assets and stash their money in any safe place going. The main driver of the falls continues to be oil, which has pushed onwards to fresh lows, taking oil stocks with it. A fresh downgrade to IMF growth forecasts underlines what stock markets are telling investors \u2013 that things are looking gloomy across the board.\u201d While we were quizzing Ken Rogoff, Adam Posen, et al, Iranian officials have been taking a pop at Saudi Arabia. Foreign minister Javad Zarif argued that the Saudi\u2019s are to blame for the crisis in the Middle East. The Telegraph has the details. Zarif claimed that: \u201cSaudi Arabia has tried to keep the old staus quo in our region because they don\u2019t think change is in their interest. They unnecessarily panicked and created a lot of mess in our region. And Mohammad Agha Nahavandian, the chief of staff to Iranian prime minister Rouhani, has apparently said Iran will \u2018certainly\u2019 raise oil exports to the levels before sanctions were imposed (they were lifted last week, of course). That\u2019s likely to further inflame tensions within Opec, and keep pressure on the oil price. The sell-off in global market is gathering pace. The Dow Jones is now down more than 400 points, or 2.6%, at 15,593.72. The FTSE 100 index in London has tumbled nearly 230 points, or 3.9%, to 5649.55. Germany\u2019s Dax has lost 335 points, or 3.5%, falling to 9329.09, while France\u2019s CAC is down nearly 180 points to 4087.42, a 4.2% fall. Spot US crude oil futures have dropped below $27 a barrel, the lowest since September 2003, following a warning from the world\u2019s energy watchdog that the oil market could \u201cdrown in oversupply\u201d. Adam Posen, the Peterson Institute director who used to set UK interest rates, has also discussed the crisis with us. He\u2019s not desperately alarmed: \u201cI don\u2019t think we are on the edge of another financial crisis. I don\u2019t even think we are on the edge of another crash. The idea that things are as over-valued as they were last time is false.\u201d Posen said governments should be taking advantage of low interest rates to improve public infrastructure, called on China to boost the economy by creating a social safety net and said central banks should avoid making mistakes. \u201cAt the margin I am not sure the Federal Reserve did the right thing by raising rates last month but I am not sure it was a big mistake. But if the Bank of England or the ECB raised rates, that would be a big mistake.\u201d We\u2019ve now grabbed some time with Ken Rogoff, former IMF chief economist and now economics professor at Harvard, to discuss the market turmoil, and the global economy. Rogoff reckons the problems were concentrated in emerging markets. Asked whether the world was on the edge of another crisis, Rogoff said: \u201cIt feels to me that there is a panic in the markets that doesn\u2019t necessarily translate into the real economy.\u201d Rogoff said that emerging markets would suffer in 2016, but that the US and Europe were \u201csolid\u201d. He added: \u201cIf China goes from 7% growth to minus 2% growth then everybody will be in recession. If it goes to 3-4% growth it will probably not be enough to cause a recession in the developed world. But it is definitely a very precarious situation for emerging markets.\u201d Rogoff said it would help if Chinese policy makers won back the credibility they had lost by their \u201cfoolish\u201d attempts trying to control the stock market and the exchange rate. \u201cIt\u2019s like trying to control the weather. They should let the exchange rate and the stock market find their own level. This is the third leg of the debt super-cycle. First is was the US, then it was Europe, now it is China.\u201d Bob Diamond\u2019s concerns about liquidity (see earlier post) have also been echoed by a top IMF official earlier today: Speaking on a panel, deputy director Min Zhu said: \u201cThe key issue is that liquidity could drop dramatically, and that scares everyone.\u201d \u201cIf everybody is moving together we don\u2019t have any liquidity at all. We have to be ready to act very fast.\u201d Hat-tip to AEP... Canada\u2019s new prime minister, Justin Trudeau, has urged Davos attendees to invest more in his country, in one of his first appearances on the international stage since winning power. Trudeau jokes that while Davos is lovely, business leaders should really check out Whistler (the Canadian ski resort). And on the big issue of WEF, the rise of the robots, Trudeau warns that technology needs to serve the cause of human progress, and growth only succeeds if everyone benefits from it. He also argues that Canada can ride out the oil price slump: We\u2019ve also collared Dennis Nally, chairman of PricewaterhouseCoopers, to talk about the turmoil in the markets. \u201cI don\u2019t know whether we are heading for another crash but unquestionably the environment is clearly having an effect on markets, on everything that is going on here and on the attitudes that exist here in Davos. Confidence levels are down, the volatility we are seeing, There are more threats today than ever. How bad could it get? Who knows. Some people are speculating oil could reach $10 a barrel. I don\u2019t think any of us know. All of this uncertainty has a direct impact on confidence levels\u201d. What should be done? \u201cThere needs to be more dialogue about how [bring] to stability back into the system. I believe there is a disconnect between government, regulators and business\u201d. Bob Diamond, the banker who was forced out of Barclays during the Libor rigging crisis, says there\u2019s no comparison between the situation today and in 2008. Diamond, who has now founded a banking operation called Altas Mara which is expanding across Africa, says: \u201cIt Is a correction, a heathy correction. A lot of people are trying to compare it to 2008, but during the last quarter of 2008 and the first quarter of 2009 we probably had the deepest economic correction I have seen. I don\u2019t see us going into that position. The US economy is still strong, Europe is doing surprising well - the easier monetary policy led by governor [of the European Central Bank Mario] Draghi has sown some positives. There is a correction in China.. If china slows down to 6 or 7% (growth) is that a success? That\u2019s fine\u201d He also suggests that new regulations brought in since 2008 aren\u2019t helping to calm the markets: \u201cA lot of people are taking about where is the liquidity, where are the buyers? Basel three, Volcker rule, ring fenced banks, buffer upon buffer of capital. Are we surprised there is less liquidity from the banks?\u201d Here\u2019s one jot of good news, Nouriel Roubini, Davos\u2019s own doctor doom and the economist who predicted the last crash doesn\u2019t think it is going to be that bad this time. \u201cIt is not going to be like 2008-09. There is not the excessive leverage in the financial system that there was last time.\u201d But 2016 is going to be a bumpy year until central banks respond, Roubini warns. \u201dThe big thing that should happen is China should stop kicking the can down the road and get on with some serious structural reforms\u201d. Roubini is also concerned about the impact of smarter technology: To no one\u2019s great surprise, the US markets have followed the rest of the world and moved sharply lower in early trading. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 271 points or 1.7% while the S&amp;P 500 has fallen more than 1% and Nasdaq has lost 1.5%. Sir Roger Carr, chairman of BAE Systems, said: I think we\u2019re witnessing a collision of events which has provoked an immediate sense of crisis. Whether it\u2019s commodities, China, oil prices, terrorism, geopolitical turbulence, all have landed particularly in the month of January and there is an immediate impact which is reflected in the stock market. At the moment what is being discounted are some of the positives that come out of low oil prices in economic terms. It is only being looked at in the lens of bad news. It is too early to say whether this is a crisis of lasting proportion but I think we should certainly continue to focus on addressing the challenges that are there for all. China may have slowed down but it\u2019s not stopped. Europe is fragile but is focused on improvement and with the UK\u2019s engagement in encouraging a more competitive Europe. America still has the fundamentals of an entrepreneurial spirit, self sufficiency in energy. When you look to the positive, while things are far from perfect, we are not at the point of absolute crisis. Back in Davos and Gavin Patterson, chief executive of BT, was asked if we were on the brink of another crisis. He replied: On the balance of probabilities no, but it is very finely balanced. It is an unstable environment. In terms of doing business, I\u2019ve just been at a lunch and most of the CEOs there say most of the underlying businesses are pretty good. If there is contagion in financial markets into the business markets that is going to affect confidence and that\u2019s when we could see a slow down. How bad? We\u2019ve got to be used to a period of time when the world is just more volatile and we have to be able to live and manage through those sort of conditions. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to go away. There could be quite significant swings but the underlying number when it\u2019s evened out will be fine. What can be done? We need the financial markets to settle down and hope that confidence remains strong and that it doesn\u2019t affect people\u2019s underlying desire to do business. What is really going in China is a big [concern], elections and referendum around the world is an issue and the state of things in the Middle East which have a knock on effect. The US inflation figures suggest there may only be one Federal Reserve rate rise this year, says Rob Carnell of ING Bank: US CPI for December fell 0.1% month on month versus a consensus 0.0% month on month expectation. Energy prices were down 2.4% month on month, and food prices also fell for a second consecutive month. But it is the weakness in the service sector inflation component that probably caught the consensus out the most. At only +0.1% month on month, this was down on the trend 0.2-0.3% growth in service sector prices over recent months, and may reflect a slightly weaker growth profile in residential rents, though it has to be said that the weakness in services was not confined to rentals, and was reflected also in areas such as recreation and education. Goods (commodities prices) were as ever, very weak (down 0.1% month on month excluding food and energy, down 2.1% year on year). At this stage, with the market looking for no further Fed rate hikes until the second half of 2016, and only one rate hike in total this year, it is our own forecasts with two further rate hikes, one in June, and another in the fourth quarter of 2016, that look more in need of amendment than the market view. The Fed dot diagram suggestion for four further hikes this year looks utterly out of touch with reality, if anyone was still paying any attention to this. In the US, the consumer price index fell 0.1% month on month in December after being unchanged the previous month. Analysts had been expected the index to also remain flat in December, but the falling oil price helped push it lower. But the year on year figure rose 0.7%, following a 0.5% gain in November. The core CPI, which strips out energy and food costs, rose 0.1% month on month after rising 0.2% for the previous three months, and 2.1% year on year. Meanwhile US housing starts fell 2.5% in December, adding to worries about the strength of the US economy. Goldman Sachs has reported a drop in profits for the fourth straight quarter, hit by a $5bn settlement related to sales of mortgage bonds during the financial crisis. The bank\u2019s fourth quarter earnings fell 71.8% to $574m, with its results also affected by the plunge in oil prices, the slowdown in the Chinese economy and US rate rises. The slump in oil prices has sent the rouble to a new record low. The Russian currency fell to 80.92 to the dollar before recovering to 80.85, still down 2.8% on the day. The fall comes amid fears that the commodity-dependent Russian economy could be further hit by the continuing slide in crude prices. London\u2019s leading index has fallen into bear market territory, defined as 20% below its recent peak. The FTSE 100 has fallen to 5688, down more than 3% as the oil price continues to slide amid concerns about oversupply and lack of demand. Worries about the outlook for China have rattled global markets, not helped by gloomy comments from the World Economic Forum in Davos. The leading index has now fallen more than 20% from its intra-day peak of 7122, reached in April last year. Meanwhile Germany\u2019s Dax is down 2.9% and France\u2019s Cac has fallen 3.4%. Brent crude is currently 2.7% lower at $27.98 a barrel. Just grabbed a word with Philip J. Jennings, general secretary of UNI Global Union, about the turmoil in the markets. Are we heading into a crash? Yes, we are heading for a crash, I\u2019m worried about it. Emerging markets were meant to pull us through this crisis. but China is slowing, and the impact will ripple out across the developing economy. And the jobs situation across the global economy will not improve How bad could it get? We are worried abut the economic climate - how deep the crash will be. Those RBS analysts [who said to sell everything] may be right - \u201ccataclysm\u201d could be the right word to use. What should be done? We need leadership. The G20 needs to fulfil the promise they made at the last financial crisis, to not just save the banking sector but to also put the economy back on track. The private sector need to understand that lack of investment isn\u2019t helping, and we need to push wages higher. The G20 needs to put demand back in the economy. Some customers at Italy\u2019s Monte dei Paschi bank have started withdrawing their savings, according to its chief executive. The bank is struggling with its bad loans and has seen its stock market value have this year. Reuters reports: Chief executive Fabrizio Viola did not say how much money savers had withdrawn, or when the outflow began, though he said the fall in deposits was \u201climited\u201d and that the bank could cope with it as he sought to reassure customers and investors. Italian bank shares have lost 20% so far this year as investors, already rattled about global economic growth, have sold out of a sector with low profitability and about 200 billion euros ($218 billion) of loans that are unlikely to be repaid. Monte Paschi - Italy\u2019s third-biggest bank - has lost the most ground as it is perceived to be the most vulnerable; it has the highest level of bad loans as a proportion of assets and was the worst performer in a health check of eurozone lenders in 2014. The Tuscan-based bank\u2019s stock, which had plunged 15% on Monday and 14.4% on Tuesday, was suspended from trading several times after falling 18.2% on Wednesday. The plunge helped dragged down all other Italian banking stocks, with Carige shedding 12.7% and Banco Popolare falling more than 6%. Viola said the plunge in Monte Paschi shares was not a reflection of the bank\u2019s fundamentals, which he said had improved in the last quarter of 2015. \u201cOf course clients turning to our local branches are worried about what they read,\u201d Viola said in a statement. \u201cAt present the size of the funding lost due to clients who decided to move part of their savings elsewhere is limited and anyway below levels seen during the previous crisis the bank faced in February 2013 which was overcome brilliantly.\u201d The 2013 crisis he was referring to was when the world\u2019s oldest bank, already badly weakened by the euro zone debt crisis, was hit by a scandal about loss-making derivatives trades... \u201cOver the past few days many have been wondering about the pace at which people closed their accounts and sold bank bonds,\u201d said Giuseppe Sersale, a fund manager at Anthilia Capital Partners. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t call it a bank run but there are definitely outflows,\u201d he added. Meanwhile, there are reports of Italian government meetings to discuss the problems in the country\u2019s banking sector: Here\u2019s some words of comfort amid the gloom. European economics commissioner Pierre Moscovici does not believe there will be a repeat of the financial crisis, nor does he think the eurozone\u2019s growth outlook will be changed in the next EC forecasts. And he says central banks still have actions they can take to tackle any further slowdown, even if interest rates are at record lows and plenty of stimulus measures have already been taken. Reuters reports from an interview with Moscovici: Central banks still have more firepower they can use to counter a slowdown in global growth, which does not change the outlook for recovery in the eurozone, European Economics Commissioner Pierre Moscovici said on Wednesday. In an interview with Reuters Television at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Moscovici said he did not believe there would be any return to an international financial crisis, despite turmoil in world markets during the first few weeks of 2016 triggered by China\u2019s slowdown and low oil prices. Asked whether the world\u2019s main central banks had run out of ammunition to revive the global economy after years of record low interest rates and quantitative easing, he said: \u201cThey have got guns and they can act.\u201d Moscovici said he did not expect any major change in the euro zone\u2019s growth outlook when the European Commission issues an updated forecast in early February, despite the sharp slowdown in China and tumbling stock and commodity markets. The EU executive last forecast in November that the euro zone would grow by 1.8 percent this year and 1.9 percent in 2017 after an estimated 1.6 percent last year. \u201cAs I see it today I see no change, no major change in our forecast... for Europe. But of course we\u2019ve got to take into account those downside risks. We don\u2019t need to change our policy stance but to reinforce it,\u201d he said. On global market turbulence and falling commodity prices, Moscovici said: \u201cI don\u2019t feel that the financial crisis is coming back. We don\u2019t feel that we are facing the risk of a breakdown in world growth, but there are downsides that we need to address. The IMF has also weighed in on migration, saying it can be positive. A new report predicts a short-term boot to GDP in countries who take refugees in, and long-term benefits if migrants are integrated well. IMF chief Christine Lagarde has also tried to crush worries that migrants will drive wages down: More on capital flows. The amount of money flowing out of emerging markets, especially China, was much worse than expected last year, according to a report from the Institute of International Finance. In October the finance industry group forecast net outflows from emerging markets of $540bn. Now it says the figure was $735bn, with $676bn from China, as investors pulled out of emerging markets and Chinese companies hurried to pay off overseas loans as the country\u2019s currency depreciated. The institute said: Net capital outflows from emerging markets in 2015 were even larger than we previously thought. We now estimate total net capital outflows (including unrecorded flows captured by net errors and omissions) at $735 billion, up from outflows of $111 billion in 2014. The bulk of these outflows relate to China, driven in part by repayment of corporate foreign currency liabilities in the face of concerns about a weakening currency. We estimate total capital outflows from China amounted to $676 billion in 2015\u2014including $216 billion in unrecorded outflows in errors and omissions. Other emerging markets also experienced net capital outflows, as non-resident inflows slumped on broader concerns about emerging market growth performance and corporate indebtedness. For 2016, we expect continued net capital outflows albeit at a somewhat more moderate pace. The impact of the Fed\u2019s shift to a tightening cycle may be limited as long as it is gradual, but flows to emerging markets will continue to face headwinds from growth and debt concerns. HSBC CEO Stuart Gulliver spoke to reporters after he had finished talking about climate change. Asked about the financial market turmoil, he said that part of the movement was \u201cself fulfilling\u201d as investors liquidated positions to make margin calls on positions. \u201cYou always get an overshoot in times of significant sell offs\u201d. He also warned there could be more sell-offs. \u201cI think we will see further adjustments before we hit equilibrium. We\u2019ll see a little more sell offs before we see equilibrium but we\u2019re closer equilibrium than we were a couple of weeks ago, we\u2019re towards the end of this sort of sell off\u201d. He indicated that growth in China was strong and that yesterday\u2019s figures were 30% of the entire Chinese economy in 2005. The bank is currently deciding whether to keep its headquarters in the UK. Gullliver said an update would be made by the time of the results of February 22. Nariman Behravesh, chief economist of IHS, has some interesting thoughts on China, where he thinks policy makers in Beijing will respond to pressure on the yuan by quietly bringing back capital controls. \u201cThere has been a massive amount of capital flight - around $1 trillion since last summer\u201d Behravesh said. \u201cThat puts huge downward pressure on the exchange rate. The question is what happens next.\u201d \u201cThe first thing that policy makers could do is to let the currency go. That would result in a devaluation of 15-20%. That would have horrible consequences. It could trigger a global currency war and a global recession.\u201d The second thing they could do is keep using foreign currency reserves, but there are limits to that.\u201d Finally, either explicitly or implicitly, they could bring back capital controls\u201d. Behravesh said the third approach would run counter to the reform agenda of China\u2019s leaders, who have expressed a desire for greater financial liberalisation. \u201cBut there are no good options. The least bad option would be capital controls.\u201d Behravesh said there were already signs that China was making it harder for people to take money out of the country. He said the credibility of the Chinese leadership had been undermined by their handling of the financial turbulence since last summer. \u201cThe scary thing has been the ineptitude of Chinese policy makers, who panicked when the stock market fell last August and panicked again at the beginning of this year. They want reform but they don\u2019t really trust markets.\u201d Joachim Gauck, the president of Germany, is addressing the Davos Congress Hall now. He begins by touching on the migration crisis, which is a growing domestic issue in Germany after chancellor Angela Merkel\u2019s liberal refugee policy. Almost 60 million are trying to escape war and conflict, and it is presenting the European Union with its biggest ever test, he says. Migration isn\u2019t a new problem, it\u2019s been around for decades as people try to escape from peril, find a better life. He then quotes JK Galbraith, who said that migration was the oldest action against poverty. A look at the list of American Nobel laureates and Oscar price winners shows just how much a country can benefit from migrants\u2019 creativity, Gauck says. Migration, and integration, must be thought of in tandem, he says. But it is our \u201chumanitarian responsibility\u201d to take in people who are fleeing the refugee crisis. He also explains that Germany feels a moral obligation to help, having \u2018fallen so low\u2019 in the past (a reference to the second world war). This may not calm the rebellion within her own party, from those who believe Germany needs to cut the number of migrants entering the country: Update: Gauck goes on to warn that limits may need to be set. Associated Press has a good take: The president of Germany says that limiting the number of refugees entering Europe is necessary and \u201cmorally acceptable\u201d if the continent is to continue to provide help to those in need. While stressing the \u201chumanitarian responsibility\u201d of taking in victims of persecution, Joachim Gauck told a conference in Davos, Switzerland, that Germany and European countries must limit the numbers of people who want to come in to avoid being overwhelmed. My colleague Jill Treanor has spoken to HSBC\u2019s CEO Stuart Gulliver - he has admitted that the bank may not have a decision on whether it is moving its bank out of the UK by next month\u2019s financial results. Al Gore, former US vice-president, says last month\u2019s Paris agreement showed that the world is prepared to do what\u2019s needed to tackle climate change. 195 nations said yes, we will change. The direction of travel has been established....and that message has been received by the World Economic Forum. In Paris, countries committed to keeping global warming down to 1.5 degrees celsius. But there is also disappointment that even more wasn\u2019t achieved. Christiana Figueres, UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, says the Paris talks did not end with an agreement on the carbon price because of the lack of unanimity. \u201cThe Paris agreement had to be unanimous, if there was one country that didn\u2019t agree with the carbon price in 2015 had that been rammed down the throat we would not have had a Paris agreement.\u201d A fixed carbon price would encourage investment in solar and other alternative energy sources, she explains. The stock market sell off is getting worse. The FTSE 100 is now down 170 points or 2.8% at 5706 - only around 20 points off a bear market (20% off its peak). Germany\u2019s Dax is down more than 3% and France\u2019s Cac has fallen 3.3%. The US is unlikely to be much help. Ahead of results from Goldman Sachs and the latest US inflation figures, the Dow Jones Industrial Average futures are showing a 329 point decline. Sir Martin Sorrell, chairman of advertising giant WPP, has added his voice to those warning that the world faces slowing growth. The new normal is a low-growth world. Inflation is under too much control, we could do with a bit more of it. That scenario will continue. The system couldn\u2019t sustain pre-Lehman growth rates because it blew up in September 2008. Ken Rogoff, former IMF chief economist and Harvard professor, blamed China for the recent market turbulence. It wasnt due to the Federal Reserve\u2019s \u2018microscopic increase\u2019 in interest rates. He also sees trouble ahead in the developing world: For the next year there is going to be a lot of risk in China and the emerging markets, but not such elevated risks for Europe and the US. Climate change is a big theme at Davos, especially after Leonardo DiCaprio attacked the greed of the energy industry last night. Stuart Gulliver, boss of HBSC, has told one panel that the bank sets tougher lending criteria for coal-fired power stations in emerging markets than those in developed economies. He is also optimistic, he said, about funding alternative energy despite the low oil price. \u201c The public wants to do this,\u201d he said, when asked about funding alternative energy and while the cost of financing for such companies currently high he expected it to fall. He also had a warning about suddenly withdrawing all financing for fossil fuels. There would be \u201cunintended consequences\u201d he said as these companies were major employers and paid tax used by governments to pay for health care etc. Gulliver admitted that HSBC\u2019s annual meeting faced protesters from activists trying to end any investment in fossil fuels. Christiana Figueres, UN expert on climate, insisted she was not one of the activities calling for all carbon fuels to be left in the ground. Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, former Nigerian finance minister, has backed the ebola agreement between Gavi and Merck announced today. There was a \u201cshared terror\u201d in Africa last year, she says, during the ebola outbreak in which more than 11,000 people died. Amira Yahyaoui, the Tunisian journalist who is co-chairing this year\u2019s meeting, says the rise of smarter machines (the 4th industrial revolution), should spur humans to understand what makes them human. Speaking on a panel, she says humans are no longer in a monopoly on planet Earth. We are in competition with things that might be better than we are. We are the ones destroying the planet, we are the ones killing humans. So this 4th industrial revolution should maybe be a revolution of values. Yahyaoui also challenged WEF for not achieving gender parity at the forum (although there are three male and three female co-chairs this year, including General Motors boss Mary Barra and International Trade Union chief Sharan Burrow). Eighteen percent of this forum are women, 18 is nothing. I come from a country supposed to be very anti-woman and we are more than 33% women in parliament and we have parity in every election. [WEF has made some efforts on this issue, and offers an extra place to businesses who send at least one female delegate] She\u2019s also concerned that the percentage of people under 30 here is \u201cway less than 18%\u201d. Every generation has been driven by youth, and this one will be too, Yahyaoui continues. Unfortunately, older people love progress, but they hate change, and revolutions are all about change, she concludes. It\u2019s not by improving the candle that we created electricity, and it\u2019s time to create electricity. Geraint Johnes, professor of economics at Lancaster University, said: All regions except London experienced a fall in the unemployment rate, suggesting that the recovery is now well and truly being felt nationwide. The construction industry has continued to play a leading part in the recovery - the number of jobs in this sector has increased by some 77000. Administrative and business support functions have also seen considerable growth - of 50000 jobs - over the latest period. The role played by construction is accentuated further by the continuing high rates of pay increase in that sector. Compared with a year earlier, pay in this sector in November amounted to some 5.6% higher. Taking the economy overall, pay growth remains comparatively muted, at 2.0% - though with negligible price inflation, workers are now experiencing noticeable increases in their real wages. So long as productivity gains can be restored, there is no reason to believe that the increase we are now seeing in pay levels should become inflationary. We should not therefore be expecting an interest rate hike any time soon. And here\u2019s chancellor George Osborne on the day\u2019s data: On the jobs data, James Knightley at ING Bank said: The UK labour data looks pretty decent with employment growth in the three months to November rising 267,000 and the unemployment rate falling to 5.1%, both are better than the 235,000 and 5.2% consensus predictions. However, wage growth did slow close to expectations (ex bonus the three month average is now 1.9% year on year although the single month reading did rise to 2.1% from 1.6%). Consequently, it is an encouraging report that should keep consumer confidence and spending running at healthy levels. However, with Bank of England Governor Mark Carney suggesting there is little appetite for a rate hike any time soon and with the prospect of a Brexit vote set to weigh on activity it looks as though November remains the earliest possible opportunity for a rate rise. Still, sterling has come off its lows following the figures. After hitting a seven year low of $1.4125 it has recovered to $1.4162. Here\u2019s are the average earnings: The government\u2019s plans to cut back the public sector show through in the jobs data. For September 2015, 17.1% of people in employment worked in the public sector, the lowest proportion since comparable records began in 1999. Here\u2019s the Reuters take on the UK data: Wage growth in Britain in the three months to November was its slowest since February, official data showed on Wednesday, the latest sign the Bank of England will take its time before raising interest rates. The slowing in wage growth came even as Britain\u2019s unemployment rate unexpectedly fell to 5.1 percent, its lowest since early 2006, from 5.2 percent in the three months to October. The BoE is keeping a close eye on wage growth as it considers when to raise interest rates at a time when inflation has hovered near zero for months and weakness in the global economy is hurting British output. The unemployment rate of 5.1% was below forecasts of a 5.2% figure. Total weekly earnings rose 2%, compared to expectations of 2.1%. This is also the weakest growth since February. On the wages front, average weekly earnings excluding bonuses rose 1.9% in the three months to November, compared to expectations of a 1.8% rise. This was the weakest growth since February last year. The November figure was 2.1% year on year. For September to November 2015, 74% of people aged from 16 to 64 were in work, the highest employment rate since comparable records began in 1971, according to the Office for National Statistics. The UK December claimant count has fallen 4,300 compared to expectations of a 2,500 rise. The jobless numbers fell 99,000 to 1.675m in the three months to November, meaning the unemployment rate is 5.1%, its lowest since the three months to January 2006. Employment rose by 267,000, the third biggest increase on record. With crude still tumbling - Brent is now down 2.8% at $27.88 a barrel - Shell has spelled out the damage the slump in oil prices is doing to its business. Our energy editor Terry Macalister reports: Shell has warned that its fourth-quarter profits may be 50% lower than last time with full year write-offs as high as $7bn (\u00a35bn), underlining the damage being wreaked on the industry by low crude prices. In the first preliminary results to be reported this year by any of the large oil companies, Shell said it expected earnings to come in at between $1.6bn and $1.9bn and full-year numbers as low as $10.4bn. Further losses will be taken in the last three months of the year, bringing the total amount of writedowns on the sale of assets and other one-off losses to as high as $7bn. The dismal figures ramp up the pressure on Shell\u2019s chief executive, Ben van Beurden, who is trying to justify the \u00a335bn takeover of rival BG which must be agreed by more than 50% of Shell shareholders next week. The full story is here: Gavi, the vaccine group, is announcing a new deal with drugs company Merck to get access to its ebola vaccine. Under the scheme, Merck will make 300,000 doses of the vaccine available in the next few months, for clinical trials and in case there is another outbreak. The vaccine not been fully licenced yet, but testing last year found it was 100% effective in providing protection against ebola. Seth Berkley, the head of Gavi, says there was initially a \u201ccomplete market failure\u201d with ebola, as there was no commercial demand for a vaccine. But the outbreak in 2015, in which more than 11,000 people died, has helped force a rethink. Merck\u2019s product, called VSV-ZEBOV live attenuated Ebola Zaire vaccine, is the most promising available, Berkley says. The suffering caused by the Ebola crisis was a wake-up call to many in the global health industry,\u201d Berkley told an audience at Davos. This agreement means we will be \u201cahead of the curve\u201d next time. The deal will also help Merck to get the vaccine win approval from the World Health Organisation, he added. Gavi is providing $5m to help Merck submit the drug for licensing by the end of 2017. Julie Gerberding, vice-president for public health at Merck, says her company is committed to getting their ebole vaccine fully licenced. She says: The scale and speed of the firestorm in Africa reminded us that mother nature is the best terrorist. It showed that we need to prepare in advance, and also respond quickly when a crisis occurs. And when we have a licenced ebola vaccine, we will make it available at the lowest possible not-for-profit price, Gerberding pledges. Anand Mahindra, director of Indian company Mahinda and Mahindra, is one of the speakers on a panel about the transformation of tomorrow. \u201cI was scared\u201d he said when having dinner in New York and the young girls sitting next to him didn\u2019t talk to each other for 15 minutes while they used their phones. His daughter told him that they would be posting imagines on instagram. \u201cIt was some kind of ghost world,\u201d he said. Sheryl Sandberg of Facebook is sitting alongside him, making the point that tomorrow won\u2019t be transformed while men keep ruling the world. \u201cMen still run the world and I\u2019m not sure it\u2019s going that well\u201d. She conducted a poll of audience - how many women had been told they were too aggressive at work and asked if they should be working. Hands went up. She talked about Facebook\u2019s civil courage initiative to try to end hate on he social network. \u201cThere is no place for hate and intolerance on our platform,\u201d she said. Facebook\u2019s CEO, Sheryl Sandburg, is discussing the future of technology now: In the wake of falls on Asian markets, investors in Europe are seeing heavy losses at the start of trading. The FTSE 100 is down 110 points or 1.8% 5766, its lowest level since November 2012 and less than 100 points off a bear market (down 20% from its all time high last April). Germany\u2019s Dax is down 2.3% while France\u2019s Cac has fallen 2.4% and Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB is down 2.6%. The head of Swiss banking giant UBS, Axel Weber, has added to the angst in Davos by warning that we are stuck in an era of low growth. He pointed out that the International Monetary Fund has consistently been downgrading its short-term growth forecasts, as hopes for a strong recovery have consistently been dashed. Weber says: \u201cLast year the forecast of the IMF for that year was 2% lower than the forecast three years out. It\u2019s just a sign of the fact we are and have moved to a lower growth environment, where the rebound of growth rates we\u2019ve seen in the past we are unlikely to see again soon. We are coming out of biggest global crisis in many decades and it will take time to heal\u201d. Weber also argues that something fundamental has changed - this isn\u2019t just a cyclical phenomenon. And that has left central bankers struggling: As he put it: One of the reasons why growth cannot be reignited is the central banks also have a difficulty to reignite inflation rates. Most of the central banks tell you (their target) is to have inflation rate of around 2%, quantitative easing and massively expanding the balance sheet does not lead to an uptick of inflation close to target at least on the time horizon of one to two years out\u201d. \u201cWe are seeing a low growth, low interest rate environment with low interest rates. We will have to get used to the lower growth environment and low interest rate environment\u201d. Tuesday\u2019s market rally has proved shortlived, with Asian markets down sharply and Europe forecast to follow suit. After rising on talk of growing Chinese demand for oil and hopes of more central bank stimulus to boost the world\u2019s second largest economy, crude is falling back once more. That appears to be a belated reaction to the International Energy Agency saying the market could \u201cdrown in oversupply.\u201d Brent crude is now down nearly 2% at $28.19 a barrel, while WTI is down 3.3% at $27.52. Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK, said the respite from recent negative sentiment has gained little traction: The inability of US markets to hold onto most of its gains was the first clue as oil prices slipped back off their highs once again. Furthermore it is this inability to sustain rebounds for any length of time that continues to gnaw away at investor sentiment in the short term, and keep the pressure on the downside. Here\u2019s our story on the falling Asian markets, with Japan now technically in a bear market: Business leaders in Davos are rather gloomier this year, according to a new report from PricewaterhouseCoopers last night. Terrorism, oil, and China, mean bosses are more worried than at any time in the last 5 years: Good morning from Davos, Switzerland, where the 2016 Annual Meeting of the World Economic Forum is getting underway. There\u2019s a bit of snow in the air this morning, and more than a bit of anxiety as global leaders, business chiefs, campaigners, celebrities and the media converge on the small ski resort. This year\u2019s WEF is racked with fears. For example: Will robots devour millions of jobs? How bad is the Chinese economy really? When will the rout in the stock markets end, and does it herald a wave of defaults? Is oil going to hit $20 per barrel, or even $10, and what will that means for petr-exporters? Can the turmoil in the Middle East be tamed? Will Europe sink under the pressure of the refugee crisis? Delegates have a lot on their plates this year, whether they\u2019re mingling in the congress centre or holding top-level meetings behind closed doors. There\u2019s a lot happening today, but here\u2019s a few key events we\u2019ll try to cover: 9am Davos time (8am GMT): Facebook\u2019s Sheryl Sandberg and Microsoft\u2019s Satya Nadella debate the 4th industrial revolution 9.30am: Vaccine group GAVI and Merck announce an ebola vaccine deal 10.30: A session on preventing future shocks in the financial markets, 11.20am: German president Joachim Gauck discusses the migration crisis 3.20pm: Canada\u2019s new PM Justin Trudeau 3.45pm: A session on the refugee crisis, including Queen Rania of Jordan, Peter Maurer of the Red Cross, and Hamdi Ulukaya of Chobani 5.45pm: US vice-president Joe Biden discusses geopolitical security. The full programme is online here. We also get the latest UK unemployment report this morning (9.30am GMT) and US inflation data this afternoon. And while all that\u2019s going on, the stock markets are expected to suffer another bad day. There\u2019s already been a heavy selloff in Asia, and we\u2019re expecting the FTSE 100 to tumble at the open. Here\u2019s the opening calls: UK FTSE: 5767 -110 points German DAX: 9438 -221 French CAC: 4176 -96 Spanish IBEX: 8401 -154 Angus Nicholson of IG says that concerns over China\u2019s slowing economy are building. The somewhat mystifying 3%+ rally in Mainland equities yesterday has proved short-lived and this is likely to punish commodities on European and US exchanges. Some more of the Chinese GDP data has filtered out today and concerns about Chinese economic growth seeing a very weak Q1 in 2016 are growing. So it could be a dramatic day....",

At the time of writing, all the major indices are in positive territory. On the face of it this is quite encouraging, particularly as crude is still trading near its 2003 lows.

As far as the US is concerned, in the latter half of 2015 the FANG stocks (Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Google (Alphabet)) were responsible for holding up the major indices as the broader market declined. Technically, the major indices formed a topping pattern as they failed to make fresh highs after the China-inspired summer sell-off. Stress in the high yield bond market was becoming apparent even before the Fed hiked rates. That hike now looks as if it will go down as one of the worst-timed rate rises in history, even crowning the ECB\u2019s classic efforts in 2011.

Perhaps not yet - in a statement and press conference in Frankfurt. After last month, when the measures announced proved a disappointment, and the more hawkish elements on the ECB clearly prevented the bank from doing more, Draghi\u2019s comments will be widely watched. Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Today\u2019s focus is likely to shine on the first ECB rate meeting of 2016, against a continuing backdrop of weak inflation in the euro area.</p> <p>With last month\u2019s December disappointment still fresh in the memory ECB President Mario Draghi will have to convince the markets that the ECB has a plan, and the ammunition to cope with the further slide in inflationary pressures that are likely to ripple across Europe in the coming weeks.</p> <p>It is clear that the hawks won out last month preventing the ECB from acting in a much stronger fashion, and in the process giving the ECB President a bloody nose, after he had indicated the prospect of much stronger action. How Mr Draghi navigates these divisions will be particularly pertinent given how they were revealed in the most recent minutes, especially given that the next projections in March are likely to see inflation expectations guided lower.</p> <p>This is because since last month\u2019s December meeting oil prices have slid another 35%, which means that while the ECB President might come across as dovish later today, after last month\u2019s disappointment markets may not necessarily take him at his word.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f2494b2fe927581f6e47d8b56b40c51998ee852c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f2494b2fe927581f6e47d8b56b40c51998ee852c/0_0_3252_1951/1000.jpg\" alt=\"ECB President Draghi.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">ECB President Draghi.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Francois Lenoir/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Economists at Unicredit said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>ECB president Mario Draghi will likely sound dovish today, but we expect him to strike a reasonable balance. Mr. Draghi will be careful to avoid fuelling too much speculation about further action to avoid a repetition of the December experience, when the announcement of QE2 fell short of high expectations.</p> <p>At the time, the market\u2019s disappointed reaction resulted in a 3% rally in euro-dollar exchange rate. Today, we do not expect the meeting to cause any major move in exchange rates, as the market seems prepared for a relatively balanced debate. The euro has held up well since the 3 December meeting, and it would take a strong (unexpected) dovish signal of imminent action to change this pattern.</p> </blockquote> <p>Mic Mills at Capital Index said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>All eyes today will be on the ECB with the interest rate decision at 12:45 [GMT] followed by Draghi giving the post meeting press conference at 13:30, which after last month will need to persuade the markets that there is more in the cupboard, as there seems to be no respite in sight when it comes to deflationary pressure.</p> </blockquote> <p>FXTM analyst Lukman Otunuga said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>For an extended period falling commodity prices have left the Eurozone engaged in an ongoing one-sided battle against stubbornly low inflation levels, while stalling domestic economic growth continues to test the European Central Bank\u2019s credibility. It is widely expected that the ECB will remain on standby today and keep rates unchanged, but Mario Draghi may reiterate his dovish mantra and threaten further QE in an attempt to talk down the value of the Euro.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8d6da6384bd05914d2eb086e464d9e446b2bf2e5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8d6da6384bd05914d2eb086e464d9e446b2bf2e5/0_0_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"ECB rate and QE decision due.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">ECB rate and QE decision due.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kai Pfaffenbach/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-01-21T08:58:02.662Z\">at 8.58am GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-56a091ebe4b08d8673c97361\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/larryelliott\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-01-21T08:11:36.547Z\">8.11am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">HSBC boss warns over green financing</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"60c1e45493bfa16c021d9905dee6f6ef601ed854\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/60c1e45493bfa16c021d9905dee6f6ef601ed854/0_0_3000_2037/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Gulliver looks on at a panel discussion during the Asian Financial Forum in Hong Kong<br>Stuart T Gulliver, Group Chief Executive of HSBC Holdings plc, looks on at a panel discussion during the Asian Financial Forum in Hong Kong, China January 18, 2016.

                "bodyText":"George Soros then went on to launch an astonishing attack on Donald Trump, saying that he was doing \u201cthe work of Isis\u201d. He added: \u201cBy fearmongering he and (Ted) Cruz are doing the work of Isis. They want people to turn against the Muslim community and make the Muslim community think there is no alternative to terrorism. It turns the Muslim community into a breeding ground for Isis. Last month, Donald Trump called for a \u201ctotal and complete shutdown\u201d on Muslims entering the US. This prompted a huge petition to have the businessman and presidential candidate banned from the UK, which MPs debated earlier this week. During the debate, Trump was labelled (among other things) a \u201cridiculous xenophobe\u201d. Soros said Vladimir Putin was making the crisis worse by his bombing of civilians in Syria. \u201cHe wants the EU to collapse.\u201d Soros then warned that European countries were in crisis, due to the number of people who have fled to the region: \u201cWe have reached a tipping point where the influx reduces the capacity of receiving countries assimilate or integrate the refugees and we have a panic. It is like a cinema on fire without exit signs.\u201d Soros said 2016 was going to be a difficult year. There would be no further rate rises from the Federal Reserve and the ECB would ease policy in March, he predicted (as Mario Draghi hinted today). George Soros, the billionaire financier turned philanthropist, has warned the World Economic Forum tonight that the migration crisis is putting the European Union in jeopardy. Larry Elliott was at the event, and reports: George Soros said: \u201cThe EU is in an existential crisis as a result of migration. The EU is falling apart.\u201d Backing the idea of a Marshall Plan, Soros said: \u201cMost people know that something has gone terribly wrong. It has to be put right.\u201d As we covered in this liveblog this morning, Germany\u2019s finance minister Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble has called for billions to be spent helping the troubled countries in the Middle East, to stem the flood of refugees into Europe. Soros added that the same conditions were in place as caused the crisis in 2008. \u201cThere is a financial crisis and a bear market. The source of the disequilibrium is different. In 2008 it was US sub prime. Today it is China where a hard landing is practically unavoidable.\u201d The Greek government says the talks between Lagarde and Tsipras were \u201csincere\u201d. Helena Smith has the details: The Greek government has just issued one of its famous briefing papers calling Tsipras\u2019 talks with IMF chief Christine Lagarde \u201csincere.\u201d The Greek PM \u201cunderlined that time is a critical parameter for the successful conclusion of the Greek programme and the first evaluation [of the economy\u2019s performance,]\u201d the paper said. Both agreed that from now on there should be \u201cdirect communication\u201d between the Greek government and the IMF \u201cso that each side has a clear view of the positions of the other,\u201d it noted. After saying it would be preferable if the IMF did not participate in Greece\u2019s latest bailout, Athens reluctantly agreed last week to the Washington-based body remaining amongst the lenders. Christine Lagarde, head of the IMF, has met with Alexis Tsipras at the sidelines of the World Economic Forum. It was a good meeting, one insider says. And the IMF has now issued a statement, reiterating that Greece needs significant debt relief, as well as pension reforms which are causing such anger in Athens. \u201cThe managing director reiterated that the IMF stands ready to continue to support Greece in achieving robust economic growth and sustainable public finances through a credible and comprehensive medium-term economic program. \u201cSuch a program would require strong economic policies, not least pension reforms as well as significant debt relief from Greece\u2019s European partners to ensure that debt is on a sustainable downward trajectory.\u201d While the Greek prime minister Alexis Tsipras was addressing delegates in Davos earlier today, opposition against the policies his government is being forced to apply intensified as thousands took to the streets. Our correspondent, Helena Smith, reports from Athens. Opposition to the pension and tax measures set as the price of further bailout funds mounted today as thousands of protestors \u2013mostly from the professions \u2013 joined farmers and fishermen and public sector unionists in denouncing the policies. As Tsipras hob-nobbed in Davos, around 10,000 demonstrators took to the streets \u2013 following up farmer blockades that also expanded - in further evidence that after months (some might say years) of being relatively inactive, the protest movement is once again gaining steam. For the most part, lawyers, doctors and engineers, many said they belonged to Greece\u2019s vast sector of self-employed who stood to be hard hit by the reforms. \u201cA lot of us here voted for the left and feel really betrayed,\u201d Baltis Kapopoulos, an Athenian engineer, told me. \u201cIt\u2019s terrible that the left should be tainted by such policies,\u201d he said in front of the Greek parliament, a placard emblazoned with the words \u2018You won\u2019t kick us out of the country\u2019 above his head. At 29, Kapopoulos said he had no desire to leave Greece but like many might be forced to by the measures. \u201cIf they go through, pensions will drop, contributions will soar and taxes will double. There\u2019ll be a lot of black market work with no insurance. And it\u2019ll be the end of small firms.\u201d \u201cI think the reason there has been such a delay in protest is because people have been shocked. We voted \u2018no\u2019 in the referendum [last July] and 48 hours later, Tsipras went and accepted everything,\u201d he said of the leftist\u2019s spectacular surrender to creditors\u2019 demands under threat of Greece\u2019s ejection from the euro zone. \u201cEither we react now or we never will. It\u2019s the last chance if we don\u2019t want to be forced to leave our country.\u201d Felix Salmon, the sharp-as-a-very-sharp-tack financial columnist, has delivered his verdict on this year\u2019s Davos. And it\u2019s a zinger, surpassing Felix\u2019s earlier criticism of the annual shindig in the mountains. He argues that the excitement and chatter behind the scenes about Donald Trump (the antithesis of the spirit of Davos), shows that WEF\u2019s vision of an open, inclusive approach to solving the world\u2019s problems is failing. Especially as we seem to be collecting more problems, not fewer, from stock market turmoil and oil, to the Middle East. Over to Felix: This year, then, is proving itself to be the Davos of denial, the year that the disconnect between rhetoric and reality became more obvious than ever. The founder of the World Economic Forum, Klaus Schwab, is on some level a plutocratic power-broker just like many other rich and powerful men, but his dream of bringing the world together in the service of peace and prosperity is, or was, a genuine one. It has even been bought into by leftist critics who complain that Davos is \u201cincreasingly where global decisions are being taken and moreover is becoming the default form of global governance.\u201d The truth, however, is that with the exception of a few public-health initiatives, the Davos model of \u201cmulti-stakeholder initiatives\u201d and \u201cglobal redesign\u201d has utterly failed in its stated aims. The grandiloquence is as lofty as ever, but the world has not come together; instead, it is fracturing, and the World Economic Forum\u2019s manifold Leaders are reduced to the status of impotent spectators. Some men just want to watch the world burn; Davos Man wants nothing less. But, right now, that\u2019s all he can realistically do. In the financial markets, ECB president Mario Draghi has provided some respite today with his assurances that the central bank will review policy in March - hinting fresh stimulus could come sooner than many investors had been expecting. London\u2019s bluechip FTSE 100 index rebounded from a three-year low on Draghi\u2019s remarks, which followed assurances from his Bank of England counterpart Mark Carney this week that UK interest rates would stay at their record low amid turmoil on global markets and signs that the domestic economy had softened. The FTSE 100 closed up 100 points, or 1.8%, at 5,773.8 but it is still down more than 7% from the start of the year having sold off with other leading bourses around the world on worries over global growth and China\u2019s downturn. The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index closed up 2% and on Wall Street the Dow Jones industrial average was up 1.2% and the S&amp;P 500 was up 0.8% at the time of the London close. Analysts cautioned that while Draghi\u2019s words had soothed markets for now, they would need to be followed with real action. Many recalled December\u2019s disappointment when ECB action was deemed much less aggressive than Draghi\u2019s prior promises had led investors to believe. \u201cECB president Draghi once again saw the equity markets confirm his \u2018super\u2019 status as they jumped almost as soon as he started his speech,\u201d said Alastair McCaig, analyst at online trading company IG. \u201cAll in all it was very impressive, especially when you consider he didn\u2019t actually promise anything, but he was convincing enough to get JP Morgan, RBS and Barclays to bring forward their calls for further easing from June to March.\u201d Ranko Berich, head of market analysis at Monex Europe, commented: \u201cAlthough equity markets have lapped up the prospect of additional easing like manna from heaven, any euphoria derived from promises of central bank action may prove to be fleeting. Despite Draghi\u2019s assurances, it\u2019s still not clear if the ECB is willing to commit to the sort of massive, unconditional and open-ended QE programmes that we have seen from the Bank of Japan and the Fed.\u201d Now here\u2019s a turn-up. Davos attendees have voted that the answer to inequality lies more in wealth distribution than greater opportunity, we hear. At the start of the debate, the audience were split 65%-35% in favour of opportunity. But after a spirited debate, the vote was switched, reports Philip Jennings of the UNI Global union. George Osborne has denied that the EU renegotiations are hurting the UK economy, and claimed that the recent market volatility is actually a good thing: Speaking to CNBC here in Davos, he said: \u201cInternationally we need a big of a sense of perspective which is, underlying all this volatility are some transformations and transitions which are fundamentally good for the world \u2013 China becoming a more consumption based economy, energy being cheaper\u2026in the European Union and the euro zone, the European Central Bank ready to\u2026step in and support the euro zone.\u201d \u201cBecause of the very sharp falls in the oil price the markets are unstable\u2026but fundamentally for most western economies\u2026the fall in the price of energy is a good thing.\u201d This rather sums Davos up: Businesses at Davos are being urged to provide more financial assistance to help the world prepare for the next major pandemic. Jeremy Farrar, director of the Wellcome Trust, has warned that we are simply not ready for another serious outbreak, similar to the Ebola crisis that struck Africa last year. Speaking at Davos he says: Pandemics are not that rare, we have had a dozen in the last decade. He cites Sars, bird flu, Mers, influenza and the Zika virus as examples of diseases which could create a new pandemic. At the moment, vaccines do not exist for any of these viruses. This leaves the world very vulnerable, and we need to address it at the time between epidemics. As well as life-saving drugs, Farrar says countries also need to prepare their response plans, so they are not caught out when a pandemic begins. A new report, from the Commission on Creating a Global Health Risk Framework for the future, estimated that epidemics and pandemics cost the global economy $60 billion annually. Victor Dzau, who oversaw the commission, says: \u201cThe report calls the attention globally that this isn\u2019t just a health issue, it\u2019s a global security issue\u201d The report called for the World Health Organisation to be strengthened, and for more money for R&amp;D. In total, Farrar tells me, just 60 cents or 40p per person would make a dramatic difference in fighting pandemics. That\u2019s $4.5bn, which could come from governments and philanthropic groups as well as business. As Farrar puts it: If we did that, we could go a long way to avoiding another Ebola, or worse. Dr Zia Khan of the Rockefeller Foundation says businesses must do their bit: \u201cWe are looking to the business community, as well as G7 and others, to take up as a call to action. It is directly relevant to them\u201d. If you\u2019re just tuning in, please click here to see our earlier summary of the comments made by the French and Dutch PMs today. Our politics liveblog had rounded up Cameron\u2019s speech - here. In brief, they are that: Cameron said that he was \u201cnot in a hurry\u201d to get an EU deal by February (really, prime minister?) Cameron said there would still be many \u201cimperfect\u201d things about the EU even if he got the reform package he wanted. He urged business to start campaigning now for Britain to stay in a reformed EU. He said Britain could have \u201cthe best of both worlds\u201d in a reformed EU. Lets get back to Davos. And Carlos Ghosn, the CEO of Renault-Nissan, just told me that his company will cope fine if Britain chooses to leave the EU. Asked about the possibility of Brexit, Ghosn said: I\u2019m not worried. Whatever is the decision of the UK we will adapt to it. We will adapt to it. If the UK stays, we will continue what we\u2019re doing. If the UK decides to move out, we will adapt to the situation. I don\u2019t think there is a reason to worry. We knew for many years that this was possible. So we\u2019ll deal with it. But might you be forced to move jobs out of the UK, if we leave the EU? Frankly it\u2019s too early to talk about that. To sum up, ECB president Mario Draghi said the ECB would review and may reconsider its monetary policy in March, and that interest rates were likely to stay at low levels for some time. That hint of further stimulus was enough to send the euro lower against the pound and dollar, and give markets a boost. He also dismissed suggestions the ECB\u2019s governing council was split over December\u2019s decision to cut the deposit rate and extend the length of the QE programme. Last minutes showed governing council was divided, how confident are you you can get a majority for more easing measures. On the 2% target, ex-chief economist of ECB said target should be in longer term not medium because it harms ECB credibility. Disagree that minutes show such divisions. Today\u2019s line of communication was unanimous. We have got a majority over last four years, so should have no doubts the council has the willingness and cohesion necessary to take actions needed. On second point, when people say it should be lower than 2% while others say above, camps are divided. [Economist] confirmed validity of the target. The horizon of reaching this objective is his argument. View of council is we should reject any suggestion we may do less than what\u2019s necessary, in order to achieve target without undue delay. There are global events which could adversely affect objective, but not reason to give up. And with that, it\u2019s all over. Could markets get ahead of themselves as before December meeting? I abstained from blaming markets as such. Communication is a two way affair, hard to put blame of some disappointment on one side only. The council is open to use all necessary instruments to cope with the situation which is materially different from what it was at the beginning of December. In October, said you would re-examine in December and there was action. Is there any difference now? How worried are you about recent drop in inflation expectations? All inflation expectations have declined, and more worryingly, their correlation with inflation has increased. The council has the power, the willingness to act. What is message for countries like Spain whose disinflation is less effective. Is there a need for fiscal change in eurozone. Spain has achieved one of most significant progress in reform, country is now on its way to continue recovery and structural reforms. With very low inflation rates, the internal revaluations become more difficult. One of reasons inflation at 2% makes even more sense in a monetary union like ours. No disagreement on fiscal policy between ECB and EC. We are not the guardians, that is the EC. Fiscal consolidation should be growth friendly based on tax cuts, government spending control and possibly investment. There has been a wave of stock market selling, especially bank shares and Italian bank shares. You more or less gave a clean bill of health to banks, markets seem to disagree with your assessment. On non performing loans, you have asked for information so what is the purpose of this action? This allows me to clarify a confused perception. The NPLs were fully assessed in comprehensive assessment. Nothing new. The provisioning for these was fully determined. So no new unexpected provisioning or requests for more capital will be made by banking supervisor. On Italy, its banks have a level of provision similar to that prevailing in eurozone area, and a level of collatoral. European supervisor is aware it takes years to deal with NPLs, cannot be resolved with short period of time. Good example is Ireland - successful in terms of recovery and they are dealing with NPLs gradually. The questionaire was sent to several banks, not only Italy. It is an enquiry on how banks are managing NPLs. The purpose is to look at different national practices to get one best practice in time. Not an initiative to get banks to deal with NPLs urgently. Don\u2019t think markets disagree but there has been confusion. Hope this helps. Causes of movements in markets? Difficult to assess. Whether it will be transient or not, whether market adjust to a different level, better question for market analysts to answer. Regarding the fall in the oil price - wouldn\u2019t it be better to ignore effect of that. History suggests they will rise again for sure [and lift inflation], why not wait? When we have dramatic movement in commodities we look at three factors: persistence of these changes, if it was a short term effect we would look through it but this has not been our experience. Materiality, the size. Since December oil fell by 40%. Look at second round effects - low commodity prices do feed into other prices and that could generate what we want to avoid, spiralling down phenomona. So far don\u2019t have that, but have to be vigilent. We have to take seriously that low commodity prices for a long period may have second round effects that we want to take action against. Comment on China risks. On refugees, chancellor Merkel is taking a big risk and if situation worsens she could leave, was there a discussion on this domestic German crisis. On China, there have been three main developments - weaker PMI, situation in forex market, situation in stock market. All this generated sizeable capital outflows. We are monitoring. So far indicators suggest there is a gradual deceleration in line with our expectations. But outlook for eurozone area after these developments has been revised downwards. There has been a renewed decline in commodity and oil prices since December. On oil, supply and demand factors and what is happening in China is contributing to demand side. What do we expect? Chinese authorities have reputation for acting responsibly. In last two weeks they have been regaining control of policy. On refugees, can\u2019t talk about one country. Large change but could become opportunity. One of constraints on purchases is political. On financial turmoil have you seen signs of stress among investors, customers. If there were constraints, we will have technical work so we can use all instruments. On second point, best answer to recent developments is to make sure banking sector is resilient. Is a factual statement that all the actions taken have produced a much stronger banking sector than it was before the crisis. But should be cautious about not being too self congratulatory. The commodity volatility we are seeing would previously have tested banking system, but we have seen, they stand pretty resilient. Are you concerned about banking system and financial stability in light of what\u2019s happening in world. We are constantly monitoring financial sector, banking sector, trying to see whether central banks\u2019 monetary policies could become a source of financial instability. So far we have not seen signs of the potential financial instability of the like we have seen in the pre-crisis times. Not our mandate to protect banks\u2019 profitability but we are aware of consequences. Best answer is to ensure economy returns to growth, stable growth. Best answer for banking sector as well. You said no limits to what you could do, could you extend purchases to other classes of assets such as equities, lower other rates not just deposit. On refugee issue, are you concerned of effects of border closures on economy? I can only reiterate there are no limits. If we are to decide about a specific policy we want to be confident there are no technical limits to the size of its deployment. On refugees, this is an extraordinary development which is and will be changing the face of our society in Europe. It is in our hands, the opportunity, the ability to transform this development into an opportunity for future growth in Europe. We are not surrendering in front of these global actions. Our mandate is to reach a level of inflation at if not below 2%, even more determined in face of adverse events. Last month, you said monetary policy was adequate, now reviewing. Does this harm credibility. Inflation could fall below zero despite everything, do central banks not have as much control. Monetary policy has been quite effective - improvement in all financial conditions, now translated into real economic improvements. In December measures we decided were appropriate. But based on prevailing circumstances. We looked at exchange rate, price of oil, growth prospects of emerging markets. Since then, these circumstances have changed. Oil fallen by 40%, exchange rate fallen, and you can see situation of financial and commodity markets. Those measures in December were quite significant (NB one criticsim was the measures were watered down) The credibility of ECB would be harmed if we did not review and reconsider monetary policy stance when we have the full information. We have the determination to act and there are no limits within our mandate. The governing council was unanimous on this line of communication. (there was talk of a split) Now for questions. You will reconsider monetary policy stance in March, what measures do you have left and what can they do? Could you clarify position on Portugals Novo Banco where ECB not said to be involved in the bail in? Draghi: On second question, we are not the resolution authority. On monetary policy: In a speech in New York I said there are no limits to deploying instruments to reach objective of inflation at 2%. Don\u2019t want to discuss specifics of instruments. The euro is dropping as Draghi speaks, on the prospect of further action including perhaps further rate cuts: But European markets seem to like the talk, with Germany\u2019s Dax up 1.2% and France\u2019s Cac climbing 1.3%. ECB president Mario Draghi said the bank had decided to keep key interest rates unchanged, and it expected them to remain at present or lower levels for an extended period of time. He said the asset purchases under the QE programme were proceeding smoothly. He said it was clear that its monetary policies were working. Developments in the real economy, financing conditions have improved, strengthened the eurozone\u2019s resilience recent global market shocks. Extension of QE until March 2017 was appropriate, there was a significant addition of liquidity to the banking system. But he added: \u201cYet as we start the new year, downside risks have increased again amid heightened uncertainty about emerging market prospects, commodity markets, geopolitical risks. Eurozone inflation dynamics are also weaker than expected in December. It is necessary to review and reconsider our monetary policy stance in early March, when new economic projections become available.\u201d He said the fall in the oil price should help consumers and businesses, but the risks to eurozone growth remained to the downside. Inflation expectations will be low in coming months, and pick up only later in 2016. Here\u2019s the full text of the European Central Bank rate decision ahead of president Mario Draghi\u2019s press conference: At today\u2019s meeting the governing council of the ECB decided that the interest rate on the main refinancing operations and the interest rates on the marginal lending facility and the deposit facility will remain unchanged at 0.05%, 0.30% and -0.30% respectively. And here\u2019s a comment from David Katimbo-Mugwanya, a fund manager at EdenTree Investment Management: The ECB will be keen to take stock in the coming weeks, preferring to appraise the effectiveness of its December policy actions rather than easing further in the immediate future. The central bank will have taken note, nevertheless, of persistent disinflationary pressures stemming from oil and commodity price weakness. Crowds are gathering in the Congress Hall for David Cameron\u2019s speech on Britain\u2019s Place in the World. As covered this morning, we expect the PM to call on business leaders to back him over the EU renegotiations. As it\u2019s a massive UK political story, my colleague Andy Sparrow is going to live blog it himself, here: You can watch the session live here: Just bumped into Jamie Dimon, boss of JP Morgan, whose bank is planning to back the In campaign on the UK EU referendum. He would not say how much the bank is spending - \u201cWe\u2019ve just started doing (it)...Wish we didn\u2019t have to do it at all\u201d. Q: So will JP Morgan stay if there is a no vote? That will depend on how Brexit happens, and which operations the bank could and couldn\u2019t keep in Britain, Dimon replies. He continues: \u201cBritain\u2019s been a great home for financial companies and it\u2019s benefited London quite a bit. We\u2019d like to stay there but if we can\u2019t, we can\u2019t. I can\u2019t tell the British people what to do, it\u2019s up to them\u201d Time for a quick recap. Britain\u2019s future in, or out, of Europe has dominated the morning of the second day of the World Economic Forum in Davos. A series of European politicians have urged the UK not to quit the European Union. Dutch PM Mark Rutte said Europe needs Britain\u2019s \u201coutward looking , trade oriented, growth oriented\u201d approach, and urged UK business and community leaders to speak out. French PM Manuel Valls said Brexit would be a tragedy, while German finance minister Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble called it a disaster for Britain, and the EU. Valls also suggested that David Cameron will not succeed in completing his renegotiations next month. The migration crisis has also loomed large: Sch\u00e4uble called for a new Marshall Plan to tackle Europe\u2019s refugee crisis, saying billions must be spent. Rutte said that the Dublin agreement, under which migrants seek residency in the first EU country they register in, must be reformed. Otherwise the Schengen agreement allowing free movement across most EU countries will collapse. And Greek PM Alexis Tsipras said the EU needs to do more to help \u201ctransit countries\u201d such as Greece and devise a properly thought-out and paid-for relocation and resettlement plan. Tsipras also clashed with Sch\u00e4uble over Europe\u2019s approach to growth and austerity. The Greek PM wants more help; Germany\u2019s finance minister wants more competitiveness. Elsewhere in Davos... US Treasury secretary Jack Lew has hinted that markets have over-reacted to the oil price slump and China\u2019s slowdown. The chief economist of Brazil\u2019s biggest bank has warned its economic woes could last until 2018 A top Chinese official has defended Beijing\u2019s handling of the crisis.... ...after Christine Lagarde said China has a communication problem. The boss of HSBC has warned that it is hard to raise money for green energy right now The European Central Bank has kept its interest rates unchanged, as expected. After December\u2019s cut, it has left the deposit rate at -0.3%. Its benchmark refinancing rate is steady at 0.05%. The euro has inched up to $1.0915 following the news. Now for ECB president Mario Draghi\u2019s press conference, due shortly. Italy hopes to agree a plan with the EU to help its struggling banks by next week at the latest, Reuters is reporting. The report says the idea is to set up vehicles to help banks sell bad loans, with a disposal price equivalent to between 20% and 30% of the nominal value of the loan. The latest proposal submitted by Italy is being discussed with a technical meeting due on Friday. Yesterday, there were reports that some customers were withdrawing savings from Monte Paschi bank, with its chief executive saying said the fall in deposits was \u201climited\u201d and that the bank could cope with it.. Jack Lew managed to crack a joke; things can\u2019t be that bad. The US Treasury secretary, Jack Lew, is discussing the state of the US economy, and the wider globe. Lew begins by warning that the world economy isn\u2019t strong enough: I look around the world and there are a lot of headwinds. We\u2019ve seen very slugging growth in demand for some years now, and that\u2019s led to a not-strong-enough global economy. And now that things are developing in parts of the global economy that are disruptive, people are reacting to it. And he argues that people are being too negative over recent developments, such as the slump in crude oil. For anyone consuming oil, lower oil is a tax cut. And on China, Lew says the situation isn\u2019t dramatically different than last year. They are in a long and difficult transition, from an export-driven economy to a consumer one. That\u2019s a tough and disruptive process. The big issue in China is whether it can stick to its own economic reform plan, and deliver the growth that it, and the world economy, needs. He said it was important to see how China handled its currency - which was deprecated last summer - and called for \u201can orderly transition\u201d with the exchange rate, and for the Chinese to allow industrial capacity to \u201cright size. \u201cThese are big ifs\u201d, Lew said. And Lew also hints that investors may be getting too jumpy. I know it\u2019s been bumpy days in the market, but I try to look beyond the hour to hour, day to day, to what the big trends are. I\u2019m not minimising that it\u2019s been choppy in the markets, but I think you do need to look at some of these underlying trends in a long-term way. Ilan Goldfajn, chief economist at Brazil\u2019s biggest bank, Ita\u00fa Unibanco, says that his country\u2019s economic malaise is unlikely to be tackled until 2018. Goldfajn warned that : \u201cBrazil has a fiscal problem, it has an external problem and it has a political problem.\u201d The impeachment proceedings against Brazil\u2019s president Dilma Rousseff meant there had \u201cbeen a lame duck government from day one\u201d. Congress was blocking any attempts to resolve Brazil\u2019s economic problems, in part caused by the collapse in commodity prices and in part by mismanagement. Every country in South America had seen its growth rate halved since the end of the commodity super-cycle, Goldfajn said, but Brazil had done much worse than that. It had gone from growth of 4% a year to contraction of 4% a year. The political impasse would last until the next presidential election in 2018, he fears, saying: \u201cThe most likely scenario is that the economic problems are not going to be resolved until then. The economy will eventually not be in recession but there won\u2019t be a recovery either.\u201d Germany\u2019s finance minister, Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble, warned Davos that Brexit would be disastrous for all involved: BP\u2019s chief executive Bob Dudley says the current situation in the oil market reminds him of the 1986 crisis, where oversupply led to a collapse in prices, reports Reuters. Speaking in Davos, Dudley said he expected further pressure on prices this year as Iran ramped up exports: The first and second quarter will be very difficult....It is a big shock for producing countries. It reminds me of 1986. Prices will remain low for longer but not forever. He said markets would begin to rebalance later in 2016 as the glut of oil reduces and investment falls. Brent crude is currently down 0.4% at $27.76 a barrel. Manuel Valls has also told reporters here that he doesn\u2019t think David Cameron will agree a renegotiation deal next month: French PM Manual Valls says it would be a \u201ctragedy for Europe\u201d if the UK quit the Union. He tells Davos that David Cameron is making some good points, and that a more simple and effective Europe would be good for everyone. We must find a compromise, and everyone must contribute to it. Our British friends must understand we will move forwards hand in hand, together, Valls continues. And he warns that the sight of Britain going it alone, at a time when countries need to work more closely to tackle the world\u2019s problems, would be disastrous: Nothing would be worse than to see a country like UK leave, it would lead to more populism. Dutch prime minister Mark Rutte has told Davos that Europe \u201cneeds\u201d the United Kingdom to stay within the European Union. He also called on business and community leaders at Davos to campaign for the In side in the upcoming referendum, echoing David Cameron\u2019s speech this afternoon. Rutte says: The UK is outward looking , trade oriented, growth oriented, and we do not have enough of that storyline, that tradition, that culture within the European Union. The European Union can only survive if it is relevant to its people, and it can only be relevant if it leads to economic growth, more jobs and prosperity. It is also crucial for the UK to not lose its place in Europe: I believe the United Kingdom will be worse off outside the EU. It will not have the influence it has in the world today.... Isn\u2019t it strange to even debate a Brexit at a time the world is facing all these huge issues and challenges? Rutte goes on to call Cameron \u201cinfluential\u201d and an \u201cexcellent prime minister\u201d. We would all be worse off if he left, so all 28 countries must work together to create an EU that is more competitive, more outwardd-looking, more growth-oriented. If we could achieve that, the whole episide will have a positive ending Are you optimistic about the upcoming summit? Rutte says he is fairly optimistic that leaders could get to an postiive outcome in February, but not certain. He\u2019s also fairly optimistic about the referendum, and urges Davos attendees to speak out. I hope that all of you, business leaders, community leaders, with influence in the United Kingdom will participate. Don\u2019t leave it all to the politicians. You should not preach, as that will never work, but to explain to the British public why it is important in your view for the UK to be part of the European Union. Music to David Cameron\u2019s ears, I expect, as he tours Davos today. Asked about the IMF\u2019s role in the Greek bailout, Sch\u00e4uble appears to admit that he was over-ruled by chancellor Merkel: And the German parliament approved the 3rd bailout on those terms: Sch\u00e4uble responds to Tsipras, saying he does agree that Europe should help countries who need it. But Europe also need to be competitive. Germany has its own problems, including demographic (its ageing population). If we want to make Europe stronger, then we should implement what we agreed to implement. We could just say implementation, stupid. Back to Alexis Tsipras. He says Greece has made great efforts to reform its economy in recent years, through an unprecedented downturn. We lost 25% of our GDP, and unemployment skyrocketed, says the Greek PM. Tsipras then inplicitly criticises Europe\u2019s approach to Greece, saying: Greece needs considerable structural reforms. We must all understand that next to balanced budget, we also have to have growth. Greece needs to tackle corruption, boost investment, and help the state to rebuild itself. And he demands more solidarity, saying: We need a co-ordinated growth strategy, and Europe must help to diminish the inequalities between North and South. We need more Europe, and show more solidarity as well. Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble refuses to say whether Germany can cope with another million refugees this year. And he says Europe must spend billions on the areas where refugees are fleeing. He agrees with Alexis Tsipras that Europe cannot become a fortress This problem will cost the European public more than expected, But it cannot be ignored. Sch\u00e4uble says, if Europe is to guarantee its security. It is a problem of and for Europe. Everything that goes wrong with these regions won\u2019t end up in Canada, it will end up in Europe. Alexis Tsipras says all European countries must share the burden of the refugee crisis. Europe must create a two-way system for migration, so people can be returned home. He also calls for much more co-operations between countries; Greece simply cannot cope alone. Next question, on migration, goes to Dutch PM Mark Rutte. Can the Schengen Agreement survive the refugee crisis? Rutte says that 35,000 people have already arrived on the shores of Europe this year. When spring comes, and the numbers quadruple, we cannot as a European Union cannot cope with the numbers any longer. This is the immediate agenda for the next few months. And the priorities include: Success of EU-Turkish union Successful hotspots in Greece and Turkey and Italy Schengen is crucial, Rutte continues. But we also have the Dublin agreement, and it isn\u2019t working. Before we kill Schengen, we have to make Dublin work.... No-one wants to kill Schengen, but if it is only a fair-weather system then it cannot survive. Manuel Valls, France\u2019s prime minister, kicks off the European session by saying security and terrorism are one of the biggest challenges faced by the continent. We are at war against terrorism. A world war. And we as Europeans need to face up to this. And European must work together to fight it, pooling resources, and also sharing more information - including a common programme of oversight of flights and airports. So could EU forces be deployed to hot spots in the Middle East? We need more Europe, not less, says Valls, as he thanks everyone who offered help and support to France after the Paris terror attacks. The Middle East is just two hours from Europe - we cannot ignore what is going on there. We must move away from this selfishness, and find the means to deal with this historic challenge. Hundreds of people are pouring into the Davos Congress Hall for the main set-piece event of the morning - the Future of Europe session. It will pit Greece\u2019s Alexis Tsipras against Germany\u2019s Wolfgang Schauble, with France\u2019s Manual Valls, the Netherland\u2019s Mark Rutte, and Eni chairman Emma Marcegaglia. You can watch it live, here: Perhaps we spoke too soon. The attempted rally in Europe seems to be petering out, with the FTSE down around 8 points and Germany\u2019s Dax off 24 points. Dow futures are also falling, now indicating a 130 point decline at the opening bell. David Morrison at Spread Co said: Equities are on the slide again as crude oil continues its relentless decline. Both WTI and Brent are trading below $28 for the usual supply/demand reasons. However, there are also concerns as speculation mounts over the possibility that Saudi Arabia may unpeg the riyal from the US dollar. The strength of the greenback combined with the low oil price is a serious drain on the Kingdom\u2019s reserves and breaking the peg would be one way of easing the pain. Looks like another topsy-turvey day. Here\u2019s our report on today\u2019s session on the Chinese economy: A senior Chinese official has defended the country\u2019s economic policies and urged investors to stop fixation on fluctuations in its stock market. Fang Xinghai, Office of the central leading group for financial and economic affairs, told the World Economic Forum that while the stock market was down 40% from its peak it was up 30% over 18 months, He also insisted that there was no basis on which to devalue the currency and said the country was commitment to moving to shadowing a basket of currencies. He declared: \u201cChina\u2019s record of honouring itss commitment is superb\u201d. He is speaking against a backdrop of countries concerned about the Chinese economy, its currency - which was devalued during the summer - and the volatility in its stock market. Gary Cohn, chief operating officer of Goldman, said most market participants believed China would devalue its currency this year. He joined Christine Lagarde, managing director of the International Monetary Fund, in calling for better communication over its polices. Lagarde said: Given the massive transitions in China, there is a communication issue - this is something that markets do not like. Uncertainty, not knowing exactly what the policy is. Not knowing exactly what the renmimni is valued against - the dollar, or a basket of currencies. Better and more communication\u201d would serve the country better, she said. Gary Cohn, chief operating officer of Goldman Sachs, agreed with Lagarde and urged the Chinese to stick its polices once they have been communicated. Fang Xinghai has also told Davos that there is need for more co-operation with global policymakers around the world,\u201dWe have to cooperate more closely to overcome this soft patch,\u201d Fang said. Taken to task by Ray Dalio of Bridgewater Associations about what this co-operation meant, Fang said it meant in all areas. More on the ECB ahead of today\u2019s meeting: Germany\u2019s finance minister, Wolfgang Schauble, has weighed in on the Brexit question, arguing Britain should stay in Europe: Italy\u2019s prime minister, Matteo Renzi, is reported to have pulled out of Davos to deal with the problems in the Italian banking sector: Yesterday, there were reports that customers were pulling funds out of the Monti Paschi bank, on concerns over its bad debts. European markets are holding onto their early gains, while US futures are suggesting a dip of around 45 points on the Dow Jones Industrial Average when Wall Street opens. David Morrison at trading company Spread Co said: The reaction to the overnight Asian Pacific slump from European equities and US stock index futures has been surprisingly muted. At the time of writing, all the major indices are in positive territory. On the face of it this is quite encouraging, particularly as crude is still trading near its 2003 lows. But once again, what looks like the beginning of a recovery in equities could easily turn out to be nothing more than a \u201cdead-cat bounce.\u201d There\u2019s no doubt there have been signs of stress in global equities for a while now. As far as the US is concerned, in the latter half of 2015 the FANG stocks (Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Google (Alphabet)) were responsible for holding up the major indices as the broader market declined. Technically, the major indices formed a topping pattern as they failed to make fresh highs after the China-inspired summer sell-off. Stress in the high yield bond market was becoming apparent even before the Fed hiked rates. That hike now looks as if it will go down as one of the worst-timed rate rises in history, even crowning the ECB\u2019s classic efforts in 2011. To top it all, China suffered a second melt-down just as we began the New Year. The Dutch finance minister, Jeroen Dijsselbloem, has admitted that Europe blundered by not dealing with its banks faster. A group of demonstrators have been spotted in Davos. They\u2019re protesting against China\u2019s activities in the Pakistani territory of Balochistan, where Beijing is developing a large new economic zone. Rough translation: Protests in Davos are not so large now. And that\u2019s because of the huge security presence in this ski resort, which clamps down on any signs of dissent. Top Chinese official Fang Xinghai has hit back at Christine Lagarde\u2019s complaint about communications failings (see earlier post) Fang is the vice chairman of the China Securities Regulatory Commission, and a senio advisor to the premier Li Keqiang. With markets in turmoil, oil sliding to new lows, concerns about Chinese growth and worries about whether central bankers have run out of ammunition to support the global economy, the president of the European Central Bank will be on the spot later to spell out where he thinks we go from here. Mario Draghi will unveil the ECB\u2019s latest measures - more QE? Perhaps not yet - in a statement and press conference in Frankfurt. After last month, when the measures announced proved a disappointment, and the more hawkish elements on the ECB clearly prevented the bank from doing more, Draghi\u2019s comments will be widely watched. Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK, said: Today\u2019s focus is likely to shine on the first ECB rate meeting of 2016, against a continuing backdrop of weak inflation in the euro area. With last month\u2019s December disappointment still fresh in the memory ECB President Mario Draghi will have to convince the markets that the ECB has a plan, and the ammunition to cope with the further slide in inflationary pressures that are likely to ripple across Europe in the coming weeks. It is clear that the hawks won out last month preventing the ECB from acting in a much stronger fashion, and in the process giving the ECB President a bloody nose, after he had indicated the prospect of much stronger action. How Mr Draghi navigates these divisions will be particularly pertinent given how they were revealed in the most recent minutes, especially given that the next projections in March are likely to see inflation expectations guided lower. This is because since last month\u2019s December meeting oil prices have slid another 35%, which means that while the ECB President might come across as dovish later today, after last month\u2019s disappointment markets may not necessarily take him at his word. Economists at Unicredit said: ECB president Mario Draghi will likely sound dovish today, but we expect him to strike a reasonable balance. Mr. Draghi will be careful to avoid fuelling too much speculation about further action to avoid a repetition of the December experience, when the announcement of QE2 fell short of high expectations. At the time, the market\u2019s disappointed reaction resulted in a 3% rally in euro-dollar exchange rate. Today, we do not expect the meeting to cause any major move in exchange rates, as the market seems prepared for a relatively balanced debate. The euro has held up well since the 3 December meeting, and it would take a strong (unexpected) dovish signal of imminent action to change this pattern. Mic Mills at Capital Index said: All eyes today will be on the ECB with the interest rate decision at 12:45 [GMT] followed by Draghi giving the post meeting press conference at 13:30, which after last month will need to persuade the markets that there is more in the cupboard, as there seems to be no respite in sight when it comes to deflationary pressure. FXTM analyst Lukman Otunuga said: For an extended period falling commodity prices have left the Eurozone engaged in an ongoing one-sided battle against stubbornly low inflation levels, while stalling domestic economic growth continues to test the European Central Bank\u2019s credibility. It is widely expected that the ECB will remain on standby today and keep rates unchanged, but Mario Draghi may reiterate his dovish mantra and threaten further QE in an attempt to talk down the value of the Euro. At an HSBC breakfast on climate change, the bank\u2019s chief executive Stuart Gulliver has said the current state of the financial markets is not exactly conducive to raising private funds to tackle global warming. \u201cThe markets are showing signs of quite significant distress and it is not a high priority for fund managers to set up a green fund\u201d, Gulliver says. He also says that the crash in oil prices may have the \u201cunintended consequence\u201d of deterring investment in alternative energy sources because the R&amp;D costs will be considered too high. Gulliver says that following the Paris climate change conference governments and the private sector had to raise $5tn a year over the next two decades. \u201cIt is a vast financing challenge\u201d, he says. Despite the falls in Asia, European markets have made a positive start, if not a totally convincing one. The FTSE 100 is up 31 points or 0.5%, while France\u2019s Cac has climbed 0.1%, Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB is 0.5% better and Spain\u2019s Ibex has added 0.5%. Germany\u2019s Dax, despite Deutsche Bank saying it expected to report a record loss of \u20ac6.7bn for 2015, is ahead by 0.2%. IMF chief Christine Lagarde has warned that Beijing needs to improve the way it communicates with the markets. Currently, investors are being spooked as they watch China embark on a huge economic rebalancing. She tells today\u2019s discussion on China that: Given the massive transitions in China, there is a communication issue - this is something that markets do not like. Uncertainty, not knowing exactly what the policy is. Not knowing exactly what the renmimni is valued against - the dollar, or a basket of currencies. China\u2019s rebalancing is \u201cperfectly manageable\u201d if the right policies are taken, she adds. Ji\u0101ng Ji\u00e0nq\u012bng, the Chairman of the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, has argued that China can\u2019t be blamed for the stock market turmoil. Speaking on a panel in China\u2019s economy, Ji\u00e0nq\u012bng said a range of factors are being it. He cites the slow pace of recovery in the world economy, meaning growth is flat. The US interest rate hike, and economic policies in the EU have also created volatility. And commodity prices are under pressure. So the world all over is facing volatility. Some reasons are normal, some are abnormal. There is a certain degree of panic in the market. Policymakers must implement structural reforms to lead the world economy out of this period of low growth, and regulators should work together to reduce volatility. European markets are expected to make an uncertain start after Wednesday\u2019s rout, which saw the FTSE 100 head into bear market territory. A recovery on the Dow Jones Industrial Average from its worst levels \u2013 albeit still showing a 249 point fall \u2013 may give some support, although Asian markets lost their early gains to head into the red again. Here are the opening calls in Europe: Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK, said: Now that equity markets, both here in Europe and in the US have slipped into bear market territory the big question now is where do we go to next. That looks highly likely to depend on oil prices and a late rebound off the lows yesterday did see US markets recoup a large portion of their losses, the Dow was 566 points down at one stage, but they still finished the day below their previous lows in August. This late rebound should be enough to see European markets open higher this morning, a welcome respite after yesterday\u2019s sell-off, but it is going to need a significant turnaround in sentiment to recoup the losses seen so far this week, and prevent markets from posting their third successive weekly decline. Oil in fact is slipping back again, with Brent crude down 1% at $27.58 a barrel. David Cameron is to call on the UK\u2019s business chiefs to support him in the upcoming EU referendum to secure Britain\u2019s place in a reformed EU. The prime minister is using his trip to Davos to drum up support, ahead of a potentially decisive EU summit in February where he could secure concessions from fellow European leaders. The PM is expected to say that: \u201cThis is a once-in-a-generation moment and the stakes are high.\u201d Cameron\u2019s message to business chiefs is that if they want Britain to remain in the EU with less red tape and a more complete single market, they need to come out and back the In Campaign. He\u2019ll say: If you want a more competitive Europe, where the single market is completed, where there are more trade deals and fewer regulations: join me in making that case. \u201cIf you believe, like I do, that Britain is better off in a reformed European Union, then, when the time comes, help me make that case for Britain to stay.\u201d Business leaders in Davos have been very unwilling to talk on the record about the Brexit issue, while many international delegates have sounded more worried about the prospect of Britain leaving the EU. So Cameron will certainly be in demand today, as he holds a series of \u2018bilateral\u2019 meetings. Good morning from Davos, where the second day of the World Economic Forum is getting underway. Yesterday\u2019s stock market plunges have sent a shiver through this little ski resort, as the \u201cglobal elite\u201d gather to debate the major issues of the moment. And world leaders and business chiefs will be monitoring events in the markets closely again, following a wild day\u2019s trading in Asia overnight. Today\u2019s session will be dominated by Europe, with prime minister David Cameron giving a big set-piece speech in the afternoon. Cameron is also due to meet with Argentina\u2019s new president, Mauricio Macri, in what could be a thawing of relations between the two countries. Greece is also in focus today, as prime minister Alexis Tsipras tries to lobby creditor nations to cut Athens some slack on austerity and debt relief. He\u2019s expected to meet with Christine Lagarde during the day. And there\u2019s also a big focus on geopolitics, with the migration crisis and the turmoil in the Middle East. Some sessions which we\u2019ll try to cover include: 8.45am CET (7.45am GMT): Where is the Chinese economy headed? Including IMF chief Christine Lagarde 10.15am CET A debate on the future of Europe, including French PM Manuel Valls, Greek PM Alexis Tsipras, Dutch PM Mark Rutte and German finance minister Wolfgang Schauble 12.30pm CET: Treasury secretary Jack Lew discusses \u201cglobal financial priorities in 2016.\u201d 2pm CET: David Cameron on Britain\u2019s place in the world 3pm: How to educate Syria\u2019s displaced children",

Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>A sharp rebound in crude oil as well as some warm words from ECB President Mario Draghi turned out to be the perfect ingredients to prompt a sharp snapback in equity markets yesterday after Wednesday\u2019s rout, and this rebound has spilled over into the Asia session with crude oil recovering above the $30 level. The big question now is whether this marks a medium term base, or just a minor relief rally before another leg lower. Given yesterday\u2019s rebound and the subsequent positive session in Asia there now remains the very real possibility that we could well finish the week in positive territory, and if that happens it would be a remarkable turnaround after Wednesday\u2019s carnage.</p> </blockquote> <p>The opening calls for Europe from IG show an upbeat start:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/IGSquawk/statuses/690421720482762752\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Our European opening calls:&#10;&#10;<a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%24FTSE&amp;src=ctag\">$FTSE</a> 5821 up 47&#10;$DAX\u00a09671 up 97&#10;$CAC\u00a04246 up 39&#10;<a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%24IBEX&amp;src=ctag\">$IBEX</a> 8515 up 71&#10;<a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%24MIB&amp;src=ctag\">$MIB</a> 18887 up 164</p>&mdash; IGSquawk (@IGSquawk) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/IGSquawk/status/690421720482762752\">January 22, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-01-22T07:45:46.390Z\">at 7.45am GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-56a1d156e4b0de2cb0bfba25\" class=\"block is-summary\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/graemewearden\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-01-22T07:23:28.684Z\">7.23am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Davos 2016: Draghi, Kerry, Macri to speak</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Good morning from Davos, where the third day of the World Economic Forum is getting underway.</strong></p> <p>There\u2019s a big focus on geopolitics today, with US secretary of state John Kerry giving a big keynote address.</p> <p>The migration crisis is also in focus, as Europe braces for another inflow of refugees from the turmoil in the Middle East.</p> <p>Overnight, France\u2019s prime minister, Manuel Valls, has warned that the crisis is destabilising Europe.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jan/22/french-pm-manuel-valls-says-refugee-crisis-is-destabilising-europe\">French PM Manuel Valls says refugee crisis is 'destabilising' Europe</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But there\u2019s no escape from economic worries - European Central Bank chief Mario Draghi is due to address Davos shortly.</p> <p>Investors around the world will be watching closely; yesterday, Draghi hinted that the ECB could take fresh action in March.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/Brenda_Kelly/statuses/690433101676335104\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">SuperMario due to speak at the World Economic Forum, in Davos at 7.45am</p>&mdash; Brenda Kelly (@Brenda_Kelly) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Brenda_Kelly/status/690433101676335104\">January 22, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>Meanwhile, UK prime minister David Cameron and chancellor George Osborne will be going round Davos, trying to stir British businesses into supporting them in the EU referendum.</p> <p>And Argentina\u2019s president, Mauricio Macri, is in town.

                "bodyText":"This liveblog is creaking under the weight of another day of Davos, so here\u2019s a round-up of the main events. On Migration.... ECB chief Mario Draghi has said the refugee crisis can be good for the European economy, as long as there is determination and confidence. Secretary of State John Kerry has called for a 30% boost in aid spending, and insisted that countries can resettle refugees without endangering national security. David Miliband of International Rescue has said it\u2019s vital to distinguish between refugees and economic migrants, to stop the whole system collapsing On UK matters... Chancellor George Osborne has said Britain will not panic over the turbulence in the markets. Osborne also predicted that the Brexit debate will \u201cget interesting\u201d once voters learn the different options on the table. On gender equality Canadian PM Justin Trudeau has urged delegates not to be afraid to call themselves feminists. While Facebook\u2019s Sheryl Sandberg has warned that gender bias starts in the home, when children get their first pocket money for helping out. On the global economy.... Harvard professor Ken Rogoff said 2016 will be a rough year for emerging markets The head of the WTO has told us he\u2019s optimistic about making progress on trade liberalisation. Christine Lagarde has thrown her hat into the ring to remain as IMF chief for a second term. And in the markets.... Stocks have surged back, on hopes that policymakers will deliver more stimulus if needed to keep the world economy on track. And that may well be all for tonight..... If so, we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. Guet Nacht! GW Global stock markets have bounced back at the end of a tumultuous week, as oil prices recovered and the European Central Bank president, Mario Draghi, raised hopes of morefurther stimulus measures. It was a week that saw panic selling in global markets, pushing several of them, including London and Japan, into bear market territory, as oil prices tumbled to fresh 13-year lows below $28 a barrel. On Friday, however, European markets rebounded, following a heavy hint from Draghi that the ECB was ready to inject fresh stimulus into the eurozone at the March meeting \u2013 sooner than many investors expected. Here is how things look at Friday\u2019s close: The FTSE 100 index in London has rallied 2.2%, or 126 points, to 5900.01. It is still down 5.5% since the start of 2016. Germany\u2019s Dax is up 2.3%, France\u2019s CAC added 3.3% and Spain\u2019s Ibex added 3.5%. Brent crude is up 7.6%, or $2.24, at $31.48 per barrel. It started the year at $37.85. On Wall Street, stock markets have followed their European counterparts higher. The Dow Jones industrial average is up 0.8% at 16,005 and the S&amp;P 500 is up 1.4% at 1,895. Draghi\u2019s hints had kicked off a \u201cfull-on relief rally\u201d said Jasper Lawler, market analyst at CMC Markets. He adds: \u201cGlobal stocks rebounded strongly on Friday, capping a massive two-day about turn that erased sharp declines early in the week. The rally was aided by a surging oil price and talk of stimulus from both the European Central Bank and the Bank of Japan. The FTSE 100 has seen its first weekly gain this year. The gain is all the more impressive after Britain\u2019s main stock index fell into bear market territory with a 20% decline to the lowest levels since 2012 on Wednesday.\u201d Canadian PM Justin Trudeau is living up to his reputation as a 21st century leader (complete with a gender-balanced cabinet). Trudeau tells Davos that: \u201cLet\u2019s start rewarding politicians and companies who aren\u2019t driven by a macho approach.\u201d He also says feminism isn\u2019t anything to be afraid of: Melinda Gates has told the panel session that she always made sure there were science projects for her husband Bill to do with the children on Saturdays. Their two daughters have ended up interested in maths and science. Chinese businesswomen Zhang Xin, who set up property company SOHO with her husband, says she in favour of quotas to address gender balance. She tells Davos: \u201cI think quotas are an effective way of breaking old habits and bias.\u201d Sheryl Sandberg is less convinced, pointing out that Norway introduced 40% quotes for boardrooms but only 3.4% of companies are run by women. \u201cIt\u2019s not trickling down,\u201d she said. There\u2019s a toddler wage gap in the US, and different expectations between boys and girls, Sheryl Sandberg declares. Gender inequality starts that early, she believes, because: Little boys in home do fewer chores at home and get paid more. We assign our chores to our children in the United States so that the boys are taking out the trash, it takes less time than cleaning the dishes and they get higher allowances. So we start out with different expectations in our home, and the time spent on these different tasks is incredibly important, she adds. Melinda Gates says companies need to have proper family leave policies, not just maternity leave policies. Paternity leave is a way of distributing the burden, as men who take it will spend more time at home helping with the children and the household tasks. America is particularly poor, she adds - just two states have proper family leave policies. Sheryl Sandberg of Facebook started the session on gender parity with the same polling method that she started a session earlier in the week, asking women if they had been asked whether they should be working and if had been described as being too aggressive at work. She said that women were expected to nurturing roles in the office. The irony of the boss of recruitment agency Manpower being on the panel has not be lost on the BBC reporter Lyse Doucet who has tried to convince Jonas Prising to change the name. He appears to have rejected the idea - a brand in 80 countries for 70 years, he says. Sheryl Sandberg, Facebook\u2019s COO, says that the big problem with gender parity is the expectations of what is appropriate for woman. Culturally we are so different around the world, but there\u2019s a really deep cultural similarity, says Sandberg, namely: Men are expected to lead, to provide, to be decision makers. And women are expected to nurture. So women end up doing the \u2018housework\u2019 in the office, and almost all of the housework at home. And we also have an expectations that women won\u2019t lead, says Sandberg. She asks the men in the audience to put their hands up if they\u2019ve ever been told they\u2019ve been too aggressive at work. A couple of hands rise. Now for the women, put your hands up if you\u2019ve ever been told you were too aggressive at work.... and a lot of hands go up: Sandberg then asks \u201cMen, have you been asked whether you should be working?\u201d I can\u2019t see many hands at all. Now the women.... Again, plenty of hands go up. That\u2019s the issue, Sandberg concludes. A debate on gender equality is kicking off in the Congress Hall now, including Melinda Gates, Facebook\u2019s Sheryl Sandberg, and Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau. You can watch it here. Jonas Prising of Manpower Group is also on the panel - the moderator jokes that he\u2019s only allowed if he promises to change the name to Humanpower Group. Melinda Gates speaks first, saying she\u2019s encouraged that women and girls are at the heart of the new sustainable development goals. We\u2019ve all come to recognise that, if you want this increase in equity, if you want this increase in GDP, you\u2019ve got to get the other half working. And politicians are learning that you need to ensure your women and girls have health, and have education. More from the UK chancellor: US manufacturing has performed more strongly than expected at the start of 2016. The Markit manufacturing PMI for January rose from 51.2 in December to 52.7 in January, better than the dip to 51.1 which had been expected. The global rally prompted by hopes of further stimulus from the European Central Bank, as well as a surge in the oil price, is continuing in the US. On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has started the last day of a tumultuous week with a rise of 180 points or 1.1%. Like other markets it is now in positive territory since Monday. The S&amp;P 500 is up 1% and Nasdaq has opened 1.8% higher. Meanwhile Brent crude is now up 8% at $31.6 a barrel, helped by comments from Saudi Arabia that $30 oil is irrational and a rebound is likely, as well as the current cold spell boosting demand. In Europe the FTSE 100 is up 2%, Germany\u2019s Dax is 2.2% better and France\u2019s Cac has climbed 3.4%. Christine Lagarde has just spoken to the press, confirming that she will run for a second term as managing director of the International Monetary Fund. In a brief statement, the IMF MD says she has pushed through \u201cquite a few initiatives\u201d and \u201cmoved the institution on, together with a fantastic team of staff\u201d. And I\u2019m prepared to serve the membership longer. So I\u2019m full of energy and enthusiasm to do so. Lagarde first told French TV this morning that she would run again, having been nominated by several finance ministers including the UK\u2019s George Osborne. George Osborne says that the referendum debate in Britain will get \u201cinteresting\u201d when voters learn what the alternatives are. Answering a question after his speech in Davos on what contingency plans the Government has for Brexit, the chancellor said the civil service, the foreign office and the Treasury were currently \u201c100% focused\u201d on the negotiations.\u201d When it comes to the debate the Government will be required publish alternatives to membership of the EU and what arrangements we will have with our neighbours\u201d, Osborne says. \u201cThat\u2019s going to be one of the most interesting aspects of the referendum debate\u201d. Osborne did not spell out the choices, but they include the Norwegian, Swiss and WTO options. The Norwegian and Swiss options provide access to the European single market on payment of a fee but without any say in how the rules are made. The WTO option means Britain would get the same access to the EU market as any other country that was party to global free trade deals. The chancellor played a straight bat when asked about Brexit, saying it was important the talks succeeded and that Britain had the right sort of relationship. He placed special emphasis on how the UK would co-exist with a eurozone that was going to become more integrated due to necessity. But he seemed to be suggesting that the staying in camp would get a boost when the alternatives are laid out. The Telegraph\u2019s James Quinn helpfully tweeted some key points from the lunch too: Elsewhere in Davos, the new Canadian prime minister has been chatting to the boss of Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba. We hear that it might have been a lunch of economic policy leaders - with the Archbishop of Canterbury thrown in for good measure. Anyway, Christine Lagarde and entourage just breezed past at speed, and Bono came the other way, warbling happily (I don\u2019t think *he* was in this lunch). So normal service is restored. Mark Carney has now emerged from this lunchtime meeting, and we believe that George Osborne may have nipped into. We don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything particularly unusual about this gathering - probably just a chance for all the key players to catch up. It appears that some of the heavy hitters in Davos have held a lunchtime meeting. A few have just left, including Kofi Annan, Ukranian president Poroshenko, Former US vice-president Al Gore, OECD chief Angel Gurria, and the Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby. Japan\u2019s central bank chief, Haruhiko Kurodo, also emerged. A big crowd has gathered, to see who is next. After a weary time at Davos, UK reporters are resting their legs, tucking into a good lunch, and listening to George Osborne talk to business leaders (the things we go through for you.....) It\u2019s a typically business-friendly speech from the chancellor; he\u2019s telling CEOs that his door is always open to them. He\u2019s also sounding relaxed about the turmoil in the markets, saying that Britain won\u2019t panic because China has hit a few bumps in the road. The two countries are partners for the long term. There\u2019s a few curious quotes too: Former UK prime minister Tony Blair is also in Davos (you\u2019ll be unsurprised to hear), and has spoken about the UK\u2019s upcoming EU referendum. Blair doesn\u2019t think Brexit would be sensible - again, not a shock given the man once rather fancied being president of Europe. The big issue is how we compete with emerging markets like India and China, rather than quitting the largest commercial market and biggest political union in the world. In the end, Blair thinks, and hopes, David Cameron will get a \u201cperfectly good deal from Europe\u201d. But he also predicts that there will be \u201cmore and more uncertainty\u201d as the vote nears. A quick look at the markets, which are continuing their rebound. The FTSE 100 is now up 135 points or 2.3%, Germany\u2019s Dax has added 197 points or 2% and France\u2019s Cac has climbed 132 points or 3%. All three indices are in positive territory for what has been a tumultuous week. On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is expected to open around 190 points higher. Oil is also rising again, buoyed by comments from Saudi Arabia that prices could rebound later this year and also by the recent cold snap which is expected to have lifted demand. Brent crude is now up nearly 6% at $30.95 a barrel. Secretary of state John Kerry turns to the refugee crisis, saying President Obama will host a summit at the UN this autumn to rally the world community. The aim is to: Increase by 30% the response to humanitarian funding appeals, Increase the number of humanitarian donors. To a least double the number of refugees resettled or given other safe channels. Expand by 10 the number of countries taking refugees Get a million children into school and a million people working legally. The private sector, civil society, religious groups will be called on to integrate refugees and give them access to employment. And Kerry insists that this isn\u2019t a security threat, saying: I know we can do it in a way that protects the security of our countries. That sounds like a rebuttal to Donald Trump\u2019s promise to impose a ban on Muslims from entering the US, if he become president, which caused such outrage. Last year, people were claiming that Ebola would claim a million lives by last Christmas, Kerry continues. But with international co-operation, including US soldiers sent in by President Obama, the outbreak was stemmed (it killed around 11,000 people). The US and Cuba still have differences, but we are much closer and able to discuss how to close then and \u201cmarch down his road\u201d, says Kerry. John Kerry\u2019s relentlessly upbeat message to Davos is not to give up, there is a lot of positivity in the world too. Between 1990 and 2015 - child mortality has halved. Life expectancy has increased dramatically. The number in extreme poverty has more than halved. And progress is being made on getting more girls into education. The nuclear deal with Iran is also vital, Kerry says, bringing the world back from the brink of war. We were on the cusp of confrontation. I can\u2019t tell you how many leaders, as I travelled through certain areas, told me \u2018you\u2019ve got to bomb it\u2019. Every one of Iran\u2019s pathway to a bomb is now blocked, due to the 98% cut in its uranium stocks and reductions in its ability to refine then. US secretary of state John Kerry is giving his keynote address to Davos. He reminds delegates of the terrible scenes of 2015, from the tiny boy found drowned on a Turkish beach to the Jordanian pilot burned alive by ISIS. I can\u2019t think of a time in my life when I have seen so much atrocity live, thrown at us so relentlessly. Some people wonder if we are trapped in an irreversible decline, a new normal. And if that were true, no politician could fight it. I do not believe that is where we find ourselves. We are not the victims of a pre-destined future, Kerry continues. We feel frustration, because we want to change it. People don\u2019t fly to Davos to celebrate the status quo. You\u2019ve come here to change the world for the better, and define the future. Away from Davos for a moment. Bundesbank president Jens Weidmann, a notable hawk on the European Central Bank\u2019s governing council, is thought to be one of the committee members who helped temper the bank\u2019s stimulus programme in December. The meeting disappointed markets by taking less action than analysts had expected. On Thursday ECB president Mario Draghi hinted at further measures at the bank\u2019s meeting in March, and played down suggestions of splits on the council. And there may be a sign that his dovish words could be followed through: The only time Syrian refugees smile, if you meet them in Jordon or Lebanon or Greece, is when you ask them if they\u2019ll ever go home, David Miliband continues. They say \u2018Inshallah\u2019, God Willing. I want to go home. And they\u2019re not fleeing for economic reasons, they\u2019re fleeing out of utter desperation that if Assad\u2019s barrel bombs don\u2019t get them, and ISIS don\u2019t get them, the Russians will get them. If we fail to see this as problem of monumental political failure inside Syria, we\u2019ll never get to the source of it. Miliband also hits back at suggestions that Europe could tighten its borders to stem the flow from the Middle East. \u201cLet\u2019s get real about this\u201d, the International Rescue chief says (channelling his old boss, Tony Blair?) If any of us were in Syria, or in Lebanon where the average monthly paymen for refugee is $13 per month, we would be trying to get into Europe And equally, all our experiences around the world shows that the higher you build the wall, the more you empower the smugglers. Desperate people will always get around walls - the solution must be to fix the problems in their homeland. Europe is playing catch-up, says David Miliband. The Syria war started in 2011. And you\u2019ve got to act at the source and in Europe, with a proper relocation process. Germany is showing leadership here, with its promise to screen asylum seekers. And this might sound surprising from the head of a refugee agency, Miliband adds, but: It\u2019s right not just that people are screened, but it\u2019s also right that those who don\u2019t qualify for refugee status shouldn\u2019t stay. It\u2019s absolutely vital to the integrity of the system that the distinction between a refugee, which is someone fleeing persecution, and someone on the other hand who is simply an economic immigrant, needs to be maintained. In the US, where Miliband\u2019s International Rescue charity is based, it has the geographical ability to set up a screening pipeline, and work with the UN to bring people over from the Middle East. Relocation is part of the answer in Europe, but not the whole answer, he concludes. Federica Mogherini, high representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, is arguing that Europe has now woken up to the migration crisis, after a slow start. I don\u2019t see it as a failure that we finally have less people dying at sea. In 2013, I saw the hundreds of people dying at sea in 2013, and not even one summit. Now, we have realised it is a European problem. Yes it took too long, but finally we are doing somthing Is Europe failing on migration? Federino Mogherini argues that Europe can\u2019t afford to fail. In 2015, we learned that European Union is not luxury -- not just the Erasmus student project, a single currency, free movement to go on holiday within European. Finally, the leaders and citizens of Europe have realised that without European union we would not be able to face these challenges of migration and security. So the debate moderator, Lyse Doucet, reads out a readers\u2019 comment that EU leaders are failing and need to stop unlimited entry into Europr. Who in the audience thinks Europe is taking too long to react to this crisis, Doucet asks? There\u2019s a big show of hands. The next session, on the future of Europe, is getting underway shortly. You can watch it here. Miliband (D), Macron, and Mogherini are all on the panel, discussing migration and terrorism. It sounds like today\u2019s session on the Russian economy was quite tasty, with former finance minister Alexey Kudrin clashing with deputy PM Yury Trutnev. We\u2019ll dig the quotes out shortly. In the meantime: Roberto Azev\u00eado, the director general of the World Trade Organisation is in Davos seeking to push forward with trade liberalisation in 2016. He will host a small gathering of trade ministers tomorrow but thinks the mood is positive.\u201d I have never seen talks on trade so exciting. I have never heard the words \u201cWTO\u201d and \u201curgency\u201d in the same sentence\u201d, Azev\u00eado says. That\u2019s perhaps hardly surprising given that the WTO spent the period from November 2001 until last December fruitlessly trying to conclude the Doha round - a comprehensive package that included agriculture, services, manufactured goods, the rules of trade and special help for the poorest countries. Azev\u00eado says the WTO has had to become more flexible, seeking a multilateral deal amongst all its 160-plus members but willing to negotiate coalitions of the willing when unanimity proves impossible. \u201cThe system can work. It is working. We have learned how to live with the different views and the very strong disagreements among our members.\u201d Future areas for talks include e-commerce, investment, digital trade and data flows, Azev\u00eado says. Here\u2019s the Treasury on the UK borrowing figures: Today\u2019s figures show that borrowing is down compared to last year, as a number of one-off factors that have affected the data in recent months have unwound. But there is more to do. At a time when we face a dangerous cocktail of risks from the global economy we must continue to work through our plan to deliver a surplus and provide economic security for working people. And here\u2019s the Office for National Statistics on the disappointing retail sales numbers: Promotions during the 2015 Christmas period were more spread out compared with 2014, with retailers offering discounts over a longer period of time rather than a one day event. Clothing and footwear stores struggled in December due to the milder weather. Meanwhile Dennis de Jong, managing director at UFX.com, said: UK retail sales figures for December always had the potential to be a banana skin for Chancellor George Osborne, and he will be disappointed to see sales slide at such a critical time for the sector. The government would have hoped to see high streets up and down the country flooded with shoppers in the run up to the festive period in a bid to boost the economy, but today\u2019s figures tell a markedly different story. All eyes will now be on the UK\u2019s GDP reading next week to see how much poor retail sales figures have affected the bigger picture. UK public borrowing - excluding state controlled banks - dropped to \u00a37.4bn in December from \u00a311.7bn in December 2014. But chancellor George Osborne - who is warning at Davos of a \u201chazardous mix\u201d of risks to the global economy - will still need a big surplus in next month if he is to reach his full year target of \u00a368.9bn as laid out in the Autumn Statement. Retail sales in the UK came in weaker than expected during the crucial Christmas period. Sales volumes fell 1% in December compared to a 1.3% rise in November - itself revised down from an initial 1.7% increase - and below analysts forecasts of a 0.5% decline. That leaves them up 2.6% year on year, again below expectations of a 3.5% rise. These were the weakest figures since September 2014. UK retail spending fell 1% in December year on year compared to a 0.9% rise in November, the biggest decline since May 2009. The eurozone economy got off to a weaker than expected start to the year, according to the latest data. The Markit composite Purchasing Managers Index - which measures services and manufacturing - fell from 54.3 in December to 53.5 in January in the initial estimates. This was the weakest growth for almost a year, and follows ECB president Mario Draghi\u2019s cautious comments on the effect of the recent oil price slump and market turbulence. Price cutting and a weak euro failed to boost demand, said Markit. But its chief economist Chris Williamson, said it would be wrong to get too worried: The cooling in the pace of growth in euro area business activity at the start of 2016 is a disappointment but not surprising given the uncertainty caused by the financial market volatility seen so far this year. It would be wrong to get too worried. The survey data are consistent with GDP rising at a steady quarterly rate of 0.3-0.4% at the start of the year. Howard Archer at IHG Global Insight said: The January purchasing managers\u2019 surveys for Eurozone manufacturing and services activity are weaker than expected -showing overall expansion moderating to an 11-month low - and raise concerns that heightened global economic uncertainty and financial market turmoil are weighing down on a relatively fragile Eurozone cyclical upturn. Global economic uncertainties and problems are clearly a significant threat to Eurozone growth prospects not only through limiting exports but also potentially weighing down appreciably on business confidence, which could affect employment and investment decisions. Further constraints to Eurozone growth comes from high debt levels in some countries and structural limitations. Nevertheless, the Eurozone January purchasing managers\u2019 surveys are far from disastrous, and they still show reasonable new business growth, rising backlogs of work and decent employment growth. Furthermore, confidence in the services sector was at the highest level since May 2011... However, there are likely to be questions about just how much extra stimulus the ECB is likely to deliver in March having been disappointed in December Here\u2019s our story on the recovery in stock markets: European and Asian stock markets bounced back at the end of a tumultuous week, as oil prices recovered and the European Central Bank president, Mario Draghi, raised hopes of further stimulus measures. It was a week that involved panic selling in global markets, pushing several of them, including London and Japan, into bear market territory, as oil prices tumbled to 13-year lows below $28 a barrel and further intensified fears over the health of the global economy. On Friday, however, Japan\u2019s Nikkei rallied nearly 6%, its biggest one-day gain in four and a half months, helped by a weaker yen and speculation that the Bank of Japan could unveil new stimulus measures at its meeting next week. In Europe, Draghi hinted that the ECB was ready to inject fresh stimulus into the eurozone at the March meeting \u2013 sooner than many investors had been expecting. The comments pulled European markets off their lows on Thursday afternoon, and gave them a further boost on Friday, with the FTSE 100 index in London gaining nearly 100 points, or 1.7%, to 5872.74 in early trading. Germany\u2019s Dax and France\u2019s CAC were both up 1.8% and Spain\u2019s Ibex rose 2%. Earlier came more signs of uncertainty in the eurozone\u2019s economy, confirming ECB president Mario Draghi\u2019s concerns. In France, the manufacturing sector stalled in January although the services sector picked up after the November terror attacks in Paris. Markit\u2019s initial reading for January showed the French manufacturing Purchasing Managers\u2019 Index falling from 51.4 in December to 50 in January. But the services index rose from 49.8 to a better than expected 50.6, so the composite index - which tracks both sectors - climbed from 50.1 to 50.5 in January. Over in Germany, Markit\u2019s composite Purchasing Managers\u2019 Index fell from 55.5 in December to 54.5 in the preliminary reading for January. This was slightly below expectations. But Markit economist Oliver Kolodseike said the index still suggested growth in the country\u2019s economy, and it appeared unfazed by recent turbulence: Germany\u2019s private sector economy was largely unaffected by the recent stock market turmoil and intensifying uncertainty stemming from the so-called migrant crisis at the beginning of the year, according to latest survey results. Although the headline index (which measures the combined output of manufacturing and service sector firms) fell to a three- month low, the latest reading was higher than the 2015 average and indicative of robust, although unspectacular, growth of the German economy. Is France\u2019s next president at Davos today? Elsewhere in Davos, Harvard professor Ken Rogoff has warned that 2016 is a \u201crough year\u201d for emerging markets, due to the concentration of problems. We don\u2019t quite know what\u2019s happening in China, it\u2019s slowed down significantly. There\u2019s Russia, where the central bank governor did a \u201cwonderful job\u201d letting the ruble flow. They would have been in crisis otherwise. Then there\u2019s Brazil\u2019s huge political problems. Brazil\u2019s recession might be its worse in 100 years. I\u2019m very happy about what\u2019s happening in Argentina, though, Rogoff adds, to his fellow panelist Alfonso Prat-Gay, the new Argentina\u2019s finance minister. Prat-Gay clenches his fists in triumph. But Prat-Gay then warns that Argentina has \u201cunacceptable and immoral\u201d poverty rates of 30%, with 10 million people who cannot make ends meet. So, nothing sensational from Draghi on monetary policy -- but a level-headed argument that Europe could ride out the migration crisis, and a warning that it cannot afford to fail. Q: Is Draghi worried that the \u2018linear\u2019 push towards ever-closer European union is faltering? Draghi isn\u2019t convinced by this argument. I don\u2019t think it was ever meant to be a linear process. The founders of the EU, because they were pretty intelligent, they expected some bumps on the way. On Greece, Mario Draghi says Europe is in a much better situation than last June. The Greek government has made progress on reforms, and fiscal consolidation. Negotiations are taking place right now [between Greek officials and its creditors] There are three areas of interest: The fiscal targets for 2018-19 Pension reforms - which seems to be a \u2018key point\u2019, Draghi says. Financial sector reforms . There are still a high-level of non-performing loans in Greek banks. So we need a process by which these loans can be sold. I\u2019m pretty sure that an agreement will be found, so that the first review can be swiftly concluded, Draghi conclu The sooner it\u2019s concluded, the sooner the Greek economy can go back to normal, Draghi concludes. As ECB president Mario Draghi speaks in Davos, his comments on Thursday suggesting there may be further stimulus measures at the bank\u2019s meeting in March continue to give a boost to markets. At the open in Europe, the FTSE 100 has jumped 100 points or 1.7%, while Germany\u2019s Dax is up 1.8%, France\u2019s Cac has climbed more than 2% and Spain\u2019s Ibex is up nearly 2%. The refugees heading to Europe are a challenge and an opportunity for Europe, says Mario Draghi. Our society will be changed by this. In which direction, we can only guess. It is also premature to know how long it till take to transform this challenge into an opportunity. But if there is determination, and confidence. that\u2019s the most important thing, because the size of the challenge could actually undermine the confidence and make fear prevail over any other consideration. And the challenge is lost. Right now, we are all working to make it into an opportunity, the ECB president adds. But we mustn\u2019t underestimate the scale of the crisis - the education levels of the refugees, their age, and the willingness of the European countries themselves to invest and co-operate. Draghi says he\u2019s also confident that a way will be found to share the financial burden of the refugee crisis across Europe. Not to co-operate would be to ignore the challenge, and that would not make it disappear. Mario Draghi, head of the European Central Bank, is discussing the European economy now. He has warned that Euro governments will have to spend more to tackle the refugee crisis. In economic terms, that works out as a fiscal stimulus that could actually push up Europe\u2019s anaemic growth rate. Draghi is also blaming the slump in the oil price, and problems in the emerging markets, for pushing Europe\u2019s inflation outlook even lower. Having made her announcement, Christine Lagarde is now being congratulated by fellow Davos delegates while she snatches a quick breakfast. Two security guards just made it very clear that she\u2019s not speaking to the press right now. Lagarde\u2019s term of office ends in July. Yesterday, Osborne said she was an \u2018outstanding leader\u2019, who would take the world economy forward. But she does also face the prospect of trial in a French court over the Tapie Affair, so there could be a few twists in this tale yet. Breaking news from Davos- Christine Lagarde, managing director of the IMF, has said she will run for a second term. She made the announcement on French TV a few minutes ago, having already been nominated by several finance ministers, including George Osborne. Lagarde said: \u201cI am candidate to a new mandate. I was honoured to receive from the start of the process the backing of France, Britain, Germany, China, Korea.\u201d Super Mario Draghi seems to have done it again. Ahead of his speech to Davos the ECB president has lifted markets with his hints of further stimulus at the bank\u2019s March meeting. Also helping was talk from Saudi Arabia of a recovery in oil prices later this year, which has pushed Brent Crude more than 5% higher to $30.81 a barrel. So on Wall Street the Dow Jones Industrial Average jumped... while in Asia the Nikkei soared nearly 6% and the Hang Seng 3%. A tumultuous week looks set for a positive end. That even applies to the Shanghai Composite, which is up 1.3% on the day and 0.5% on the week - a surprising outcome given the chaos in the markets over the past few days. Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK, said: A sharp rebound in crude oil as well as some warm words from ECB President Mario Draghi turned out to be the perfect ingredients to prompt a sharp snapback in equity markets yesterday after Wednesday\u2019s rout, and this rebound has spilled over into the Asia session with crude oil recovering above the $30 level. The big question now is whether this marks a medium term base, or just a minor relief rally before another leg lower. Given yesterday\u2019s rebound and the subsequent positive session in Asia there now remains the very real possibility that we could well finish the week in positive territory, and if that happens it would be a remarkable turnaround after Wednesday\u2019s carnage. The opening calls for Europe from IG show an upbeat start: Good morning from Davos, where the third day of the World Economic Forum is getting underway. There\u2019s a big focus on geopolitics today, with US secretary of state John Kerry giving a big keynote address. The migration crisis is also in focus, as Europe braces for another inflow of refugees from the turmoil in the Middle East. Overnight, France\u2019s prime minister, Manuel Valls, has warned that the crisis is destabilising Europe. But there\u2019s no escape from economic worries - European Central Bank chief Mario Draghi is due to address Davos shortly. Investors around the world will be watching closely; yesterday, Draghi hinted that the ECB could take fresh action in March. Meanwhile, UK prime minister David Cameron and chancellor George Osborne will be going round Davos, trying to stir British businesses into supporting them in the EU referendum. And Argentina\u2019s president, Mauricio Macri, is in town. Might he mention the Falklands Islands? Here\u2019s some of the things we\u2019ll try to cover: 8.45am CET (7.45am GMT): Mario Draghi discusses the outlook for the eurozone economy 10.30am: Securing the Middle East and North Africa, with Iraqi prime minister Ha\u00efdar Al Abadi and Lebanon\u2019s Tammam Saeb Salam. 11am CET : Europe at a tipping point: with French economy Emmanuel Macron, EU foreign affairs chief Federica Mogherini, and David Miliband, President, International Rescue Committee 11.30am CET: John Kerry\u2019s special address 1.15pm CET: Press conference with the President of Argentina, Mauricio Macri, 4.45pm CET: Preparing for the next pandemic, including Bill Gates and Jim Kim, head of the World Bank.",

In Google\u2019s case, of course, the algorithms and software were invented in the US.</p> <p>That point is easy to understand, but it is hardly a full explanation of why Google pays so little tax in the UK. The software may be American in origin but it is blindingly obvious, from the fact of 2,500 Google employees in the UK, that quite a lot of activity still takes place here. Equally, HMRC must have applied certain principles when attributing costs and profits between Ireland and the UK.

Google and Osborne were happy to publish selected highlights of HMRC\u2019s settlement \u2013 the former to appear a good corporate citizen, the latter to try to appear a muscular chancellor.

In theory, that would represent a big leg-up for a company that made \u00a3675m last year.</p> <p>In practice, you can understand why Kingfisher\u2019s share fell 6%. The cash cost of the restructuring is put at a hefty \u00a3800m, indicating the challenge of rebooting 1,000 stores across 10 countries. And, as with any builder\u2019s quotation, estimates should be treated with care. In a five-year overhaul, there is a danger that some savings slip between the cracks.

He offered the example of a UK car manufacturer exporting to the US; the UK would expect profits on at least part on those sales to be taxed in the UK, not where customers bought the cars. In Google\u2019s case, of course, the algorithms and software were invented in the US. That point is easy to understand, but it is hardly a full explanation of why Google pays so little tax in the UK. The software may be American in origin but it is blindingly obvious, from the fact of 2,500 Google employees in the UK, that quite a lot of activity still takes place here. Equally, HMRC must have applied certain principles when attributing costs and profits between Ireland and the UK. Let HMRC explain those principles, rather than respond with the tired plea of \u201ctaxpayer confidentiality\u201d. The confidentiality card is particularly weak in this case. Google and Osborne were happy to publish selected highlights of HMRC\u2019s settlement \u2013 the former to appear a good corporate citizen, the latter to try to appear a muscular chancellor. If limited disclosure is OK, both parties should be able to agree full disclosure for the sake of wider understanding. Let\u2019s hope Andrew Tyrie makes that point when his Treasury select committee opens its inquiry into UK tax policy and the tax base. Tyrie is right that Google is a symptom, not a cause, of complex tax laws that are \u201cturning what should be a straightforward principle \u2013 that everybody should pay the correct amount of tax \u2013 into a piece of elastic\u201d. In these circumstances, it is ridiculous for the chancellor to proclaim a major triumph and then retreat when asked to explain his numbers. A \u201cmajor success\u201d would be a tax system for multinationals that is transparent and fair. The Google settlement fails on both counts. Kingfisher hunts profit Kingfisher has banged on for so many years about the advantage of being a pan-European retailer that you would think it would have tried to bank some of the benefits before now. Instead, it seems, the group is a collection of fiefdoms \u2013 B&amp;Q (UK); Screwfix (UK and Germany); Castorama (France, Poland, Russia); Brico D\u00e9p\u00f4t (France, Spain, Portugal and Romania); and Ko\u00e7ta\u015f (Turkey). A year after becoming chief executive, V\u00e9ronique Laury thinks it\u2019s finally time to get serious about the \u201cunified\u201d lark. Products will be sourced centrally, the way Ikea does it. Product lines will be cut from 400,000 to 200,000. The group will no longer buy 1,000 varieties of gardening glove. It sounds like a dose of common sense, especially if profits will be boosted by \u00a3500m in 2021 versus a business-as-usual approach. In theory, that would represent a big leg-up for a company that made \u00a3675m last year. In practice, you can understand why Kingfisher\u2019s share fell 6%. The cash cost of the restructuring is put at a hefty \u00a3800m, indicating the challenge of rebooting 1,000 stores across 10 countries. And, as with any builder\u2019s quotation, estimates should be treated with care. In a five-year overhaul, there is a danger that some savings slip between the cracks. Execution will be everything.",

So the statement accompanying the rate decision is likely to be scrutinised for clues as to the Fed\u2019s latest thinking.</p> <p>It must surely acknowledge the market slump and fears of a global downturn which have increased since December, and may even hint that it no longer expects three or four more rate rises this year. The wording of its comments on the current state of the global economy will be key, but analysts are divided on what the Fed\u2019s tone will be.</p> <p>Simon Smith, chief economist at FXPro said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>All eyes will be back on the Federal Reserve today as they make their first interest rate decision and monetary policy statement of the year but there are no economic projections or press conference this time round, which come at the next meeting in March. We\u2019ve seen a rise in risk appetite in this final week of January which so far has been a bit of a blood bath, although the recovery from lows in many indices has softened the blow for many investors. This has come as a result of a bounce in oil prices but also a growing expectation that central banks will have to do more to support the global economy.</p> <p>Today\u2019s Fed meeting as a result is likely to see a more dovish tone to it, especially since the market consensus is that we will see fewer rate hikes this year than the Fed is currently pencilling in.</p> <p>Even though we saw a higher than expected rise in US consumer confidence yesterday a big warning shot has come from one of the world\u2019s largest companies Apple which saw its first fall in revenue since 2003.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a59eec51d6b478c60d8d80577479b838861028df\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a59eec51d6b478c60d8d80577479b838861028df/0_0_3942_2366/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Fed chair Janet Yellen.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Fed chair Janet Yellen.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Susan Walsh/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But lya Spivak, currency strategist at DailyFX, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The rate-setting FOMC committee is broadly expected to keep the benchmark lending rate unchanged this time around. Indeed, priced-in probability of an increase is a mere 14.3%. This puts the spotlight on the text of the statement accompanying the rate decision and the forward guidance contained therein.</p> <p>Investors appear positioned for a dovish outcome having scaled back 2016 tightening bets amid risk aversion since the beginning of the year...</p> <p>For its part, the Fed will have to attempt a difficult balancing act. On one hand, it will have to acknowledge recent market turmoil as well as softening US growth dynamics in the final months of 2015. On the other, it will have to re-focus investors\u2019 attention on mandate-relevant fundamentals and establish the possibility of tightening in March. This is necessary so that such a move, if deemed appropriate, does not trigger an overly violent response.</p> <p>On balance, the case for policy normalization remains compelling. Realized and expected inflation is firming: the latest readings on core year-on-year CPI and hourly earnings growth registered at multi-year highs while 2-3 year breakeven rates have trended upward since August. On the jobs front, the unemployment rate is at the lowest level since 2008 and nonfarm payrolls growth is running at a reasonably brisk pace, with the 12-month trend average at 220k.</p> <p>This means that the Fed statement will have to reassure investors that it will adjust policy if market stress infects the real economy. In the same breath, it will have to explain that as of now, the projected rate hike path has not materially changed since the first post-QE rate hike in December. </p> <p>The markets\u2019 subsequent reaction will depend on the degree of wishful thinking that traders are prepared to entertain.

                "bodyText":"And finally.... Wall Street has ended the night on the back foot, after being underwhelmed by the Federal Reserve. The Dow Jones shed 222 points, or almost 1.4%, to close at 15,944.46. The S&amp;P 500 index, which covers a wider range of companies, lost over 1% while the tech-heavy Nasdaq slid by over 2%. Investors have noted the Fed\u2019s dovish stance, and recognised that the central bank is anxious about the global economy and the market turmoil. But policymakers still see the US economy recovering, which could mean it still raises borrowing costs later this year.... Anyway, we\u2019ll back in the morning, London time, for more reaction. Good night, GW Facebook also posted some highly impressive mobile advertising revenue: Some late breaking news... Facebook appears to have smashed forecasts. The social network has posted earnings of 79 cents per share, compared to expectations of 68 cents. And Wall Street loves it, sending shares leaping in afterhours trading. David Zervos, Chief Market Strategist at Jefferies, is telling Bloomberg TV that the Fed\u2019s statement was quite comforting. But the markets are still being driven by fluctuations in the oil price, and fears over emerging markets, he adds. Zervos says: Markets are still bouncing around on oil, still bouncing around on China. So what could turn the markets around? Signs that the US economy is still doing well, and not entering recession. Our news story on the Fed decision is now live: Here\u2019s a flavour: The Federal Reserve is keeping a key interest rate unchanged while pledging to closely monitor developments in the global economy and financial markets. In December the central bank made the decision to raise rates for the first time since the recession. Stock markets have been turbulent across the world since the move, and all the US markets entered negative territory again after the announcement. The policymakers left their benchmark rate unchanged in a range of 0.25% to 0.5%. Until December, they had kept that rate at record lows. The Fed noted in its latest policy statement that economic growth has slowed since it raised rates from record lows: \u201cThe [Fed] is closely monitoring global economic and financial developments and is assessing their implications for the labor market and inflation, and for the balance of risks to the outlook.\u201d The changes in its statement signaled that the Fed could be prepared to slow future rate hikes if recent market turbulence and global weakness do not abate..... (click here for more). The selloff is picking up pace, with the Dow Jones industrial average now down over 1%. That\u2019s not all down to the Fed, though. Apple has shed 6% after last night\u2019s disappointing results showed that iPhone sales have slowed. Paul Ashworth, chief US economist at Capital Economics, also points out that the Fed is no longer willing to describe the risks to the outlook as \u201cbalanced\u201d (as covered here). He writes: As expected, the new statement acknowledged the apparent slowdown in activity growth in the fourth quarter. The growth of consumption and business investment is now described as \u201cmoderate\u201d whereas back in December it was described as \u201csolid\u201d. The slowdown in inventory investment also receives an explicit reference. At the same time, the Fed stressed that labourmarket conditions \u201cimproved further\u201d with \u201cstrong\u201d job gains. Ashworth reckons that economic data, and financial markets, may not improve in time to allow a rates to rise in March. But he still expects a string of hikes later in the year. Nevertheless, we still think that once the worst fears about China blow over and US economic growth rebounds, the Fed will end up raising interest rates more rapidly that expected in the second half of this year. We expect the fed funds rate to reach 1.50% to 1.75% by end-2016. The Fed is primarily worried about China, argues Worth Wray, chief economist at wealth management firm Evergreen GaveKal. One expert reckons the Fed\u2019s statement guarantees more market turbulence in the next six weeks: This month\u2019s Fed meeting was always going to be all about the statement, given the FOMC bit the bullet and raised borrowing costs for the first time since the crisis in December. The tone of the Fed\u2019s comments set the tone for the next few weeks -- and the statement is being taken as quite dovish. Chris Beauchamp, Senior Market Analyst at City trading firm IG, explains: Markets got the more dovish tone they were hoping for, with the Fed noting slowing economic growth and tipping its hat towards the idea that inflation won\u2019t rise towards 2% as fast as it thought in December. This doesn\u2019t mean a March move is out of the question, but the reference to global economic developments means that there will have to be plenty more improvement in the US economy before one is a definite possibility. With the risks to the economy no longer seen as \u2018balanced\u2019 this is a Fed committee drawing in its horns. It was never going to admit that December\u2019s move was a mistake, but today\u2019s statement acknowledges that it is not time to get carried away with rate hikes. Matthew Boesler of Bloomberg says the Fed is taking the recent stock market losses seriously, without panicking. Brett House, chief economist of US investment management firm Alignvest, reckons the Fed won\u2019t raise rates four times this year (as it had been expecting). Financial commentator Bobi Petrov reckons rates will remain on hold at the Fed\u2019s next meeting, in early March. The Fed also doesn\u2019t see inflation roaring away this year - hardly surprising, given the oil price tumble. Tonight\u2019s statement says: Inflation is expected to remain low in the near term, in part because of the further declines in energy prices, but to rise to 2 percent over the medium term as the transitory effects of declines in energy and import prices dissipate and the labor market strengthens further This is a useful tool, showing some of the changes to this month\u2019s statement: Note how jobs growth is now \u201cstrong\u201d after this month\u2019s blowout non-farm payroll report showed 292,000 new hirings in December. Stocks are falling on Wall Street as traders digest tonight\u2019s statement. Not immediately clear why - but investors may be concerned that the Fed has dropped that line about economic risks being balanced. There\u2019s a significant change between this statement and December\u2019s one. The Fed has dropped the line saying that the risks to economic activity and the labour market are \u201cbalanced\u201d. That suggests the Fed thinks the situation has become unbalanced.... You can read the statement online, here. The Fed is also sticking to its view that interest rates will only rise gradually, meaning borrowing costs will remain below the long-term average for some time. But it all depends on the data..... However, the actual path of the federal funds rate will depend on the economic outlook as informed by incoming data. The decision was unanimous -- all 10 members of the Federal Reserve Open Market Committee agreed to leave borrowing costs unchanged. Again, that\u2019s not a surprise. The US central bank also reckons that the American economy is continuing to heal. The statement says: Household spending and business fixed investment have been increasing at moderate rates in recent months, and the housing sector has improved further; however, net exports have been soft and inventory investment slowed. A range of recent labor market indicators, including strong job gains, points to some additional decline in underutilization of labor resources The Federal Reserve says it is keeping a close eye on the global economy, and financial markets. In tonight\u2019s statement, is says: The Committee is closely monitoring global economic and financial developments and is assessing their implications for the labor market and inflation, and for the balance of risks to the outlook. That means the Fed is considering the impact on recent market turmoil, and the fall in the oil price, on the US economy and the path of inflation. In the least surprising news of 2016, the US central bank has left borrowing costs unchanged. The policy rate remains at 0.25% to 0.5%. OK, it\u2019s nearly time for the Federal Reserve to announce this month\u2019s monetary policy decision. Remember, it\u2019s all about the Fed\u2019s statement - Wall Street is certain that Janet Yellen isn\u2019t going to raise interest rates again..... Ahead of the Federal Reserve\u2019s interest rate setting meeting, and following a rise in the oil price, European shares have ended the day on a positive note. With hopes of co-operation between oil producers - notable Opec and Russia - to tackle the issue of oversupply, Brent crude has jumped 3.6% to $32.96. The rise comes despite a jump in US crude inventories. The closing scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished 78.91 points or 1.33% higher at 5990.37 Germany\u2019s Dax added 0.59% to 9880.82 France\u2019s Cac climbed 0.54% to 4380.36 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended up 0.56% at 8741.0 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB was an exception, dipping 0.4% to 18,848.03 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently 34 points or 0.22% higher. Another reason for the day\u2019s strength in the oil price: Russia has said it discussed co-operation with Opec over crude prices. Reuters reports: Russia\u2019s energy ministry said possible coordination between Russia and the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) was discussed at a meeting with Russian oil companies on Wednesday. The ministry said the discussion was related to unfavourable oil prices. There is also talk of an emergency Opec meeting in February. Despite its share price fall, Apple is still top of the pile in value terms: Markets are moving higher on the back of the improvement in the oil price. Tony Cross, market analyst at Trustnet Direct said: The threat of the early sell-off for oil prices this morning failed to materialise with crude bouncing above the $30 mark and this has in turn lent a raft of support to equity markets on both sides of the Atlantic. Even what could at best be described as a mixed bag in terms of US oil inventory data has failed to knock sentiment so London\u2019s FTSE-100 is rounding off the day \u2013 where we tested highs not seen for two weeks \u2013 with a bullish tone. Next up however it\u2019s the latest Federal Reserve Open Market Committee meeting and anything that is interpreted as being overly hawkish here could readily unseat equity markets globally that are still clearly rattled by recent events. Elsewhere, US crude stocks rose to their highest level on record - ie back to 1930 - last week while gasoline stocks increased but inventories of distillates fell. The figure for distillates, which include heating oil, follows the cold front hitting the country in the past few days. Distillate inventories fell by 4.1m barrels compared to expectations of a near 2m fall. But crude stocks climbed by 8.4m barrels last week, well above expectations of a 3.3m increase, to 494.9m, the highest level since the Energy Information Administration began compiling records. Refinery crude runs fell by 551,000 barrels a day. Gasoline stocks climbed by 3.5m barrels compared to forecsats of a 1.5m increase. But despite the rises, Brent crude is up 0.79% at $32.05 a barrel. Joshua Mahony, market analyst at IG, said: US crude oil inventories rose by the highest level since April 2015 last week, pushing overall oil in storage to near levels not seen in 80 years for this time of year. Crucially, we did see domestic production fall ever so slightly. This distinction highlights the reaction in global trade, which has seen oil prices rise off the back of seemingly bearish headline data. With sentiment driven by record output from Iraq and Russia, alongside the entry of Iran on the mainstream oil market, any news that US output is starting to turn lower is certainly welcome for oil bulls. Here\u2019s our take on the libor verdicts: Five of the six brokers were acquitted of conspiring to rig Libor, reports Reuters. The jury also reached a not guilty verdict on one count of conspiracy to defraud for former Icap broker Darrell Read, said Reuters, but it has yet to reach a verdict on a second count. The judge has asked the jury to reach a majority verdict. The six brokers on trial were Darrell Read, Danny Wilkinson and Colin Goodman from Icap, Noel Cryan from Tullett Prebon, and Jim Gilmour and Terry Farr from RP Martin. Five out of six brokers accused of manipulating libor bank rates have been acquitted of fraud at Southwark crown court. A jury is still discussing one count against one of them, but the others have been freed. The six were accused of conspiring with Tom Hayes and others in a trial brought by the Serious Fraud Office which has lasted 15 weeks. But a jury took just a day to acquit them. The Federal Reserve is holding its first meeting since December\u2019s now-contentious decision to raise interest rates for the first time in nearly a decade. The subsequent market turmoil, focused on a slowdown in China and the tumbling oil price, has made many wonder whether the Fed was a bit premature in pulling the rate trigger. The Fed is highly unlikely to change rates at this meeting, and there is no press conference for Fed chair Janet Yellen to be quizzed about her thoughts on the aftermath of last month\u2019s move. So the statement accompanying the rate decision is likely to be scrutinised for clues as to the Fed\u2019s latest thinking. It must surely acknowledge the market slump and fears of a global downturn which have increased since December, and may even hint that it no longer expects three or four more rate rises this year. The wording of its comments on the current state of the global economy will be key, but analysts are divided on what the Fed\u2019s tone will be. Simon Smith, chief economist at FXPro said: All eyes will be back on the Federal Reserve today as they make their first interest rate decision and monetary policy statement of the year but there are no economic projections or press conference this time round, which come at the next meeting in March. We\u2019ve seen a rise in risk appetite in this final week of January which so far has been a bit of a blood bath, although the recovery from lows in many indices has softened the blow for many investors. This has come as a result of a bounce in oil prices but also a growing expectation that central banks will have to do more to support the global economy. Today\u2019s Fed meeting as a result is likely to see a more dovish tone to it, especially since the market consensus is that we will see fewer rate hikes this year than the Fed is currently pencilling in. Even though we saw a higher than expected rise in US consumer confidence yesterday a big warning shot has come from one of the world\u2019s largest companies Apple which saw its first fall in revenue since 2003. But lya Spivak, currency strategist at DailyFX, said: The rate-setting FOMC committee is broadly expected to keep the benchmark lending rate unchanged this time around. Indeed, priced-in probability of an increase is a mere 14.3%. This puts the spotlight on the text of the statement accompanying the rate decision and the forward guidance contained therein. Investors appear positioned for a dovish outcome having scaled back 2016 tightening bets amid risk aversion since the beginning of the year... For its part, the Fed will have to attempt a difficult balancing act. On one hand, it will have to acknowledge recent market turmoil as well as softening US growth dynamics in the final months of 2015. On the other, it will have to re-focus investors\u2019 attention on mandate-relevant fundamentals and establish the possibility of tightening in March. This is necessary so that such a move, if deemed appropriate, does not trigger an overly violent response. On balance, the case for policy normalization remains compelling. Realized and expected inflation is firming: the latest readings on core year-on-year CPI and hourly earnings growth registered at multi-year highs while 2-3 year breakeven rates have trended upward since August. On the jobs front, the unemployment rate is at the lowest level since 2008 and nonfarm payrolls growth is running at a reasonably brisk pace, with the 12-month trend average at 220k. This means that the Fed statement will have to reassure investors that it will adjust policy if market stress infects the real economy. In the same breath, it will have to explain that as of now, the projected rate hike path has not materially changed since the first post-QE rate hike in December. The markets\u2019 subsequent reaction will depend on the degree of wishful thinking that traders are prepared to entertain. If they emphasize the first point \u2013 a possible result considering the dovish shift in expectations in spite of the aforementioned fundamental evidence \u2013 risk appetite is likely to strengthen. This will see the stocks rising alongside sentiment-geared currencies like the Australian and New Zealand Dollars while the greenback as well as the anti-risk Euro and Yen decline. A focus on the second point will probably deliver the opposite result. As investors await the latest US oil inventory figures and the outcome of this month\u2019s Federal Reserve meeting, Wall Street is on the slide again. In early trading the Dow Jones Industrial Average has fallen 113 points or 0.7%, partly due to Apple which is down 3.8% at $96.24 following its disappointing figures. Ahead of the start of US trading, here are some opening calls: Note Apple is quoted as falling more than 3%. Oil has come back from its worst levels of the day, on renewed hopes that Opec and other producers such as Russia would act to stem the supply glut which has hit prices. Brent crude is now down 0.8% at $31.52 a barrel having fallen to $30.83 earlier. But US inventory figures due later will undoubtedly have an impact on the price, not to mention the Federal Reserve rate setting meeting and any effect the US central bank\u2019s comments have on the dollar. Meanwhile the recovery in crude has helped support stock markets. Both the FTSE 100 and Germany\u2019s Dax are marginally in positive territory after earlier falls, while France\u2019s Cac is only narrowly down. US futures are showing a 57 point decline on the Dow Jones Industrial Average after Tuesday\u2019s 282 point surge. Apple\u2019s shares will of course be in focus after its disappointing update. Ben van Beurden is upbeat about today\u2019s vote, despite the small revolt. Shell\u2019s CEO says: \u201cI am delighted with the positive shareholder vote and the confidence that shareholders have shown in the strategic logic of the combination of Shell and BG. Our immediate focus is on the successful completion of the transaction and we now await the results of tomorrow\u2019s BG shareholder vote. Assuming BG\u2019s shareholders approve the deal (they will), Shell will become the world\u2019s biggest liquefied natural gas (LNG) trader. It\u2019s worth reiterating that 17% of Shell shareholders opposed the BG merger at today\u2019s vote. That suggests that some big City investors have reservations about the deal, despite Shell chief Ben van Beurden\u2019s best efforts to persuade them of its merits. Standard Life was the only large investor to go public - their head of equities, David Cumming, reckoned the deal only made sense when oil was over $60 per barrel, not $30ish. But Standard Life owned less than 2% of the company, so others have clearly found the deal too risky. Our financial editor, Nils Pratley, reminds me that even Royal Bank of Scotland\u2019s disastrous merger with ABN Amro in October 2007 got the support of 99% of shareholders (who then suffered huge losses). So a 17% revolt may sting, a little. Thousands of workers at Shell and BG now face the axe, once the merger goes through. Shell announced last month that it will cut around 2,800 positions, or some 3% of the combined company. Newsflash from The Hague - Royal Dutch Shell shareholders have just voted in favour of its \u00a335bn merger with rival oil firm BG. That\u2019s despite pressure from some shareholders to renegotiate the tie-up, which was negotiated before the oil price slumped to just $30 per barrel. During the meeting, Shell chief executive Ben van Beurden told the meeting that the deal would be a \u201cspringboard to simplify Shell\u201d, the Evening Standard reports. Van Beurden also argued that a merger still made sense despite the cheaper oil price. The deal was approved by 83% of shareholders, with 17% opposing the plan. BG investors give their verdict tomorrow, but there\u2019s little chance that they will block the deal. RBS is helping to drag the London stock market down into the red today. As traders scoff a quick sandwich (or three courses at Gaucho), the FTSE 100 is down 22 points at 5888. RBS are the second biggest faller, down 3.8% at 251p. The only biggest faller is Anglo American, the mining company, which has shed 5.2%. Other miners are also in the red, reflecting ongoing concerns over global growth. Other European markets are also in the red, as investors wait to hear from the US Federal Reserve at 7pm GMT (when it will surely leave interest rates unchanged). Here\u2019s more reaction to RBS\u2019s latest financial woes, via Press Association: Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell, said: \u201cIt\u2019s another bitter pill, but putting legacy issues behind it is essential if Chancellor George Osborne is going to off-load the Government\u2019s stake during this parliament.\u201d But banking analyst Gary Greenwood, at Shore Capital, said that, while \u201cdisappointing\u201d, the latest financial charges are not unexpected. Over in America, traders are expecting Apple\u2019s share price to slide after it warned that revenue will fall this quarter, for the first time in 13 years. RBS isn\u2019t the only bank counting the cost of the PPI scandal today. Santander, the Spanish financial giant, has announced it is setting aside another \u00a3450m to cover compensation to customers who were missold Payment Protection Insuranace. The move will dent profits at Santander UK. It could be the bank\u2019s final bill for the scandal, but we won\u2019t know for sure until the deadline for PPI claims in 2018. A wave of \u2018challenger banks\u2019 have sprung up since the financial crisis, hoping to win business from scandal-splattered big players such as Royal Bank of Scotland. And one of them, Metro Bank, has announced plans to float on the stock market. Metro, which is losing around \u00a310m per quarter, wants to raise \u00a3500m from shareholders. Random fact: Metro encourages dogs into its branches, and even lays on water bowls and doggie toys. If only bankers had spent more time doing that before the crisis, instead of churning out toxic debt and lumbering customers with PPI contracts.... The British public had better face the truth - we\u2019ll all be shareholders in the banks for a while longer yet. So argues Chris Beauchamp, senior market analyst at City firm IG. He told clients: RBS\u2019s ability to surprise investors with fresh bad news has been one of the hardy perennials of the past six years, and yet still the news keeps coming. George Osborne\u2019s decision to sell a chunk of the government\u2019s stake last August, which was derided at the time, now looks like a sound financial decision, but it does mean any further sales are essentially off the table. Coincidentally, with Lloyds down 2% this morning in sympathy, it seems the government will remain a key asset manager when it comes to UK banks. If you\u2019re just tuning in, here\u2019s Jill Treanor\u2019s news story about the latest problems at RBS: RBS takes \u00a32.5bn hit to profits as chief executive announces bank \u2018clean-up\u2019 Royal Bank of Scotland is set to report its eighth consecutive year of full-year losses after announcing a string of charges for legal bills, compensation and a pension payment. The bank, which is more than 70%-owned by the taxpayer, said it would take a \u00a32.5bn hit to profits in 2015 as a result of a clean-up exercise, driving its share price to a three-year low in Wednesday\u2019s early trading. RBS shares fell 5% to 246p \u2013 below the 330p at which George Osborne sold off the the government\u2019s first tranche of shares in August, and less than half the 502p average price at which taxpayers pumped \u00a345bn into the bank. Issuing an unscheduled trading update on Wednesday, Ross McEwan, the chief executive of RBS, said the move was part of a continued clean-up but conceded that that the bank would make another full-year loss for 2015. It has not reported a profit since 2007. \u201cI am determined to put the issues of the past behind us, and make sure RBS is a stronger, safer bank. We will now continue to move further and faster in 2016 to clean up the bank and improve our core businesses,\u201d said McEwan. \u201cWe\u2019ve always been open about the scale of past issues facing RBS and although there is clearly much more to do, this announcement is a further step towards addressing legacy issues and building a great bank for our customers and delivering long-term value for our shareholders,\u201d he added..... Here\u2019s Jill\u2019s full story: The latest problems at RBS show that bankers need keeping on a tight leash, argues campaigners for a financial transaction tax. David Hillman, spokesperson for the Robin Hood Tax campaign, says: \u201cIt\u2019s groundhog day in the City as RBS announces yet another huge provision for dodgy dealing and fleecing its customers. \u201cTry as it might, the banking sector is incapable of shaking off its past sins. The government must take note \u2014 now is not the time for it to ease up on financial sector reform.\u201d There are signs that Britain is taking a softer line with the City. An inquiry into banking culture was curiously abandoned at the end of last year, alarming campaigners. And yesterday, Bank of England deputy governor Andrew Bailey was appointed as head of the Financial Conduct Authority - and hand-picked by George Osborne for this crucial job. Citigroup analysts have warned that RBS could suffer even more legal charges this year, points out the BBC\u2019s Kamal Ahmed: \u201cWe still see significant additional litigation charges in 2016, on top of the charges that have been announced today. A quick explanation. When RBS says it is setting aside \u00a31.5bn to cover \u201cvarious US residential mortgage-backed securities (\u201cRMBS\u201d) litigation claims\u201d, it is referring to one of the more noxious elements of the 2007-08 financial crisis. In the build-up to the crisis, milions of mortgages were sold to US citizens with shaky credit histories, who could not really afford them. Those loans were repackaged by investment banks into new financial products (the RMBSs) and sold onto investors who weren\u2019t told how dangerous they might be. Cue the credit crunch, and the collapse of the subprime market. Mortgage-backed securities plunged in value, as the borrowers behind them failed to meet their payments and handed back the key to their homes. And the smaller banks, credit unions, insurers and suchlike who had been left holding them when the music stopped (and the Big Short paid out) launched waves of legal action against Wall Street. RBS had a finger in this unsavoury pie though its US subsidiary, Greenwich Capital Markets. In 2013, the SEC accused it of \u201cmisleading investors\u201d and cutting corners, by selling loans that didn\u2019t meet underwriting guidelines. Important point: The \u00a31.5bn in new US legal charges announced by RBS this morning does not cover any potential settlements with the US Department of Justice, or various US State Attorney General investigations. Ian Gordon of Investec warns that: The timing and the cost of resolving those cases remains highly uncertain. City analysts are punting out their opinions now. And Sandy Chen of Cenkos Securities isn\u2019t too alarmed by RBS\u2019s announcement. He argues that the bank is simply cleaning up the mess of previous eras (or possibly \u2018previous errors\u2019). The new \u00a31.5bn provision against US mortgage-backed security costs brings the total bill to \u00a33.8bn - \u201ccloser to the \u00a34-6bn totals that most analysts have had in mind\u201d, Chen says. And the \u00a3500m payment protection insurance top-up should be one of the last big ones, given the FCA\u2019s consultation on a 2018/19 time-bar on PPI claims, Chen adds. His conclusion: Bad news \u2013 really? More like putting their past in their behind, as Pumba said (in the Lion King). [I think Pumba actually says \u201cyou got to put your behind in your past.\u201d -- but we get the gist] The UK government currently owns almost 73% of RBS, and at today\u2019s share price I fear we\u2019re stuck with it for some time. The taxpayer paid around 502p per share when it bailed the stricken bank out in 2008. Today, RBS shares are trading at just 250p, so we would take a stonking loss if George Osborne sells another slice of the bank. Last summer, he sold \u00a32.1bn of stock at around 320p - crystallising a \u00a31bn loss for the taxpayer. That deal was criticised, but with hindsight the hedge funds who bought the stock are now sitting on a loss themselves. RSB shares have just hit their lowest level since September 2012, I reckon. That\u2019s not good news for George Osborne, as he tried to sell the bank back to the private sector. Shares in Royal Bank of Scotland have slumped by 5% at the start of trading, shedding 12.1p to 248p. That makes RBS is the biggest faller on the FTSE 100. Bad news for shareholders - which in RBS\u2019s case is every member of the UK public, as we bailed the bank out in 2008. Q: When did RBS last make a profit, asks Jill Treanor. CEO Ross McEwan sucks through his teeth and takes a stab at 2007 -- the year before Lehman Brothers failed. We told you that 2015 and 2016 was about tidying up these legacy issues, and that\u2019s exactly what we\u2019re doing, McEwan adds. Q: How much has RBS paid out on PPI? The total bill is around \u00a34.3bn, says McEwan. Q: Do today\u2019s provisions mean RBS will declare a loss for 2015? Yes, McEwan replies. Some of these charges will hit the bottom line (not the pension changes, though) My colleague Jill Treanor asks whether today\u2019s \u00a3500m PPI provision is finally the end of the saga. We\u2019ve done the best we can, based on what we know today, to estimate what the final provision will be, McEwan replies. We think it is hopefully the end. People have until spring 2018 to file PPI claims. McEwan says PPI has been a long and torturous journey for many banks, and a reminder of how to treat consumers (or how not to mistreat them). RBS is briefing the media now, on a conference call. Chief Financial Officer Ewen Stevenson is telling reporters that \u201cunderneath it all we\u2019ve got a strong core bank\u201d. Will it ever end, wonder City journalists.... Is Ross McEwan is cleaning up RBS ahead of a sale, wonders the BBC\u2019s Kamal Ahmed. RBS has also told the City that it is putting \u00a34.2bn into its pension scheme, to cover an accounting deficit of \u00a33.3 billion. That\u2019s mainly an accelerated payment of existing committed future contributions. It follows changes in accounting practice, which have made RBS rethink whether or not it has an unconditional right to a refund of any surpluses in its employee pension funds. Royal Bank of Scotland has stunned the City with a fresh wave of provisions to cover bad behaviour and legal bills. In an unscheduled announcement, RBS announced a series of new charges. In a nutshell: The bank is setting aside $2.2 billion, or \u00a31.5bn, to cover litigation claims in the US relating to various residential mortgage-backed securities. That\u2019s a legacy of the subprime crisis. It is also setting aside an extra \u00a3500m to cover Payment Protection Insurance (\u201cPPI\u201d) claims. That\u2019s the long-running mis-selling scandal in which millions of consumers were sold insurance they didn\u2019t need (or even ask for, in some cases). RBS taking a goodwill impairment charge of \u00a3498m against its Private Banking business. More than seven years after being rescued by the taxpayer, RBS is still a work in progress..... CEO Ross McEwan insists that he is cleaning up the mess of the past: \u201cI am determined to put the issues of the past behind us and make sure RBS is a stronger, safer bank. We will now continue to move further and faster in 2016 to clean-up the bank and improve our core businesses. We\u2019ve always been open about the scale of past issues facing RBS and although there is clearly much more to do, this announcement is a further step towards addressing legacy issues and building a great bank for our customers and delivering long term value for our shareholders.\u201d Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets the eurozone, and business. Two things dominate today -- the turmoil in the stock markets, and the first US Federal Reserve interest rate decision of 2016. Traders can\u2019t take their eye off the oil price, which is lurching around the $30 per dollar mark this week. Brent crude is currently trading around $31.42 per barrel, helped by rumours that Russia and Saudi Arabia might carve up some kind of deal to cut production. It\u2019s all a bit flaky, though. Michael Hewson of CMC Markets explains: The symbiotic relationship between equity markets and oil prices continued yesterday as after a rocky start to trading saw a slide in oil prices below $30 drag equity markets lower, the lack of follow through saw a semblance of stability return and a sharp recovery back above the $30 level on vague chatter that senior OPEC officials were looking to open a dialogue and put together some form of deal with Russia in an effort to put a floor under prices. European markets are likely to be calm this morning, as investors await new from America\u2019s central bank. At 7pm GMT tonight, the Federal Reserve announces its decision on monetary policy. It will surely (surely!) leave interest rates unchanged, having made the first symbolic post-crisis hike last month. The Fed\u2019s statement will be scrutinised for its view on the global economy, and any signs of \u2018hikers\u2019 remorse\u2019, given the turmoil in the markets in recent weeks. Lots of companies reporting results today, although the biggie - Facebook - comes at 9pm GMT. The City will also be digesting Apple\u2019s results last night, which showed that the iPhone boom may finally be over: We\u2019ll be tracking all the main events through the day....",
