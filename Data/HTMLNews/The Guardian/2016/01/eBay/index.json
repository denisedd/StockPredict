But last week his crackdown pledge was left in tatters after Google confirmed it had struck a deal with HMRC that effectively allowed it to continue to route \u00a34.6bn of UK sales via an Irish company that pays no tax in Britain. Google\u2019s UK arm \u2013 which paid \u00a321m in tax according to its latest accounts \u2013 will only be required to pay slightly more to HMRC under the settlement. Critics have branded it a sweetheart deal, pointing out that the \u00a3130m in back taxes, which relates to a 10-year period, is tiny in comparison with the sums mounting up in Google\u2019s coffers in Bermuda. George Osborne has been vocal in supporting some initiatives on international tax reform, but has confused many tax experts by also slashing the UK tax rate \u2013 due to fall to 18% by 2020 \u2013 and introducing controversial tax breaks to attract multinationals to invest in Britain. Google last year stalled its plans for a big new London headquarters in King\u2019s Cross, London, insisting, according to reports, that the design proposals for a building \u2013 complete with a rooftop pool \u2013 to house 5,000 workers were \u201cboring\u201d. A new architect has since been hired, and fresh plans are now expected. In 2011, Google increased its workforce in France by half and invested heavily in a new Paris head office near the Saint-Lazare train station amid public anger about its tax payments. One French senator accused the group of running its local business as a \u201ccharity\u201d.",
