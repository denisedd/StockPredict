The news follows comments made by Deputy Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman on Thursday that he supported the trillion-dollar company being prepared for an initial public offering (IPO). If the float goes ahead it will be the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s most valuable quoted company, dwarfing Apple, Exxon and Google. The moves have astonished the oil sector and led to speculation about whether a share float would change the Saudi strategy of driving down oil prices by refusing to cut back on production. Analysts believe the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s most valuable business will attract a lot of interest from potential investors, but warn that the Saudis could underestimate western concerns about Aramco\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s traditional secrecy and the impact of falling oil prices. A statement from the oil group said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Saudi Aramco confirms that it has been studying various options to allow broad public participation in its equity through the listing in the capital markets of an appropriate percentage of the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shares and/or the listing of a bundle its downstream subsidiaries. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This proposal is consistent with the broad and progressive direction pursued by the Kingdom for reforms, including privatization in various sectors of the Saudi economy and deregulation of markets.\u00e2\u20ac\u2122\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Prince Mohammed expected a review of the business, which has reserves of 260bn barrels and 60,000 staff, to be completed within months.

The Saudis have recently introduced a raft of changes to the economy, not least has been a decision to cut subsidies on domestic energy bills and a plan to introduce VAT taxes. Both are considered risky in a conservative country with such fragile democratic credentials. Jason Tuvey, a Middle East specialist at Capital Economics, said it was difficult to value Saudi Aramco and he had come across speculative figures ranging from $1tn to $10tn. Even the lower figure means Aramco is worth three times as much as Exxon Mobil, and a 5% stake of that would easily dwarf the $25bn raised by China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Alibaba group, whose $25bn float is the largest so far. Fadel Gheit, a veteran oil analyst at Oppenheimer &amp; Co brokerage in New York, questioned how easy it would be for the Saudis to pull off a significant flotation given Aramco was used to a very low level of transparency.

                "bodyText":"Observers of the UK yacht industry might be forgiven for some confusion over whether it is riding the crest of a wave or holed below the waterline. At the London Boat Show Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s top boat manufacturers are showing off bigger, better and bolder yachts than ever before. Figures scheduled to be released on Monday are expected to show modest growth in the UK marine industry, a sector that has been pulling in revenues of close to \u00c2\u00a33bn in recent years. On the other hand, guests say the event is smaller than in previous years and it is no secret that British boat-builders have not been shipshape of late. Northamptonshire-based Fairline collapsed into administration shortly before Christmas, while Princess Yachts recently announced plans to axe 350 jobs after a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153gruelling\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd 2014 in which it lost \u00c2\u00a311.3m.

The volatility and chaos caused by disappointing Chinese data and the failed attempt to control the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock market with circuit breakers had sent investors running for the hills this week. But a 2% rise in the Chinese market earlier on Friday, following the abandonment of the circuit breakers and some support from the authorities for the yuan, gave some hope that a better day was in prospect.</p> <p>Better than expected US jobs figures put an end to that, prompting talk of further US rate rises and pushing the dollar higher, and by extension the oil price lower. With all the other geopolitical problems - North Korea\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s possible hydrogen bomb, tensions between Saudi Arabia and Iran - as well as Chinese inflation data this Saturday, traders decided to take their money off the table ahead of the weekend.</p> <p>Market analyst Tony Cross at Trustnet Direct said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>A degree of calm in Chinese markets overnight has done little to placate sentiment, whilst better than expected employment data out of the US is also adding to woes. As global growth projections are trimmed whilst the Federal Reserve eyes the next interest rate hike, across the board it seems as if the economy will now face sustained headwinds.</p> </blockquote> <p>So Brent crude is currently down 1.6% at $33.18 a barrel, pushing commodity companies lower again. </p> <p>The FTSE 100 has lost nearly \u00c2\u00a385bn in value this week, recording its biggest weekly fall (5.28%) since August last year when the Chinese (yes, them again) sent ructions through global markets by devaluing the yuan.</p> <p>According to CNBC, the global market as measured by the S&amp;P Global Broad Market Index has lost more than $2trn this week. The final scores for the day showed:</p> <ul> <li><strong>The FTSE 100 fell 41.64 points or 0.7% to 5912.44</strong></li> <li><strong>Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax dropped 1.31% to 9849.34</strong></li> <li><strong>France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac closed down 1.59% at 4333.76</strong></li> <li><strong>Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB lost 1.58% to 19,869.49</strong></li> <li><strong>Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ibex ended 1.66% down 8909.2</strong></li> <li><strong>In Greece, the Athens market is 0.81% lower at 585.98</strong></li> </ul> <p>On Wall Street the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 62 points or 0.38%.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-568fddc9e4b0600201f49473\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-01-08T16:10:29.929Z\">4.10pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>One of the reasons for the decline in markets since the initial enthusiasm for the US jobs data is the feeling that the strong figures make a rate rise more likely. The disappointing wages growth might mitigate against an early rise, but the general feeling seems to be that even dearer borrowing costs are now more likely. Chris Beauchamp, senior market analyst at IG, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Heading into the close, the FTSE 100 has given up all its gains for the day, finishing a tough week on a miserable note.</p> <p>After a passable performance overnight for the Chinese market, hopes were high that stock markets in Europe and the US could claw back some of their own losses. So far on this side of the pond, that has not been the case.</p> <p>Equity traders have been left bereft of reasons to be optimistic this week, and it looks like the China fears of the past few days will remain with us as we head into a new week. US job numbers kicked off 2016 in fine form, well ahead of estimates, but the lack of wage growth was the fly in the ointment. The fear now is that such good numbers, even with inflation worries, will encourage the Fed to continue with its planned four hikes this year, putting fresh pressure on equity markets.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-568fd732e4b0600201f49158\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/larryelliott\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-01-08T15:36:59.203Z\">3.36pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our economics editor Larry Elliott on the US jobs data:</p> <blockquote> <p>It seems just like the good old days. Almost <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jan/08/us-jobs-report-december-2015-economy-jobs\">300,000 jobs were added to payrolls in America in the last month of 2015</a>, continuing the upward trend of recent months. The US is once again living up to its reputation for being a gigantic jobs machine.</p> <p>Well, perhaps. Jobs are certainly being created at a good lick and the US has an unemployment rate \u00e2\u20ac\u201c 5% \u00e2\u20ac\u201c that the eurozone, at 10.5%, would die for. There are signs that people who had given up hope of finding work are being encouraged back into the labour market.</p> <p>Inevitably, this will lead to speculation that the Federal Reserve has left it too late to start raising interest rates and will now be forced to play catch up with a more rapid increase in the cost of borrowing than Wall Street is expecting. There is already talk of the Fed <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/dec/16/federal-reserve-us-interest-rate-rise-fed-funds-janet-yellen\">repeating December\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rate hike</a> in March.</p> <p>The markets may be getting ahead of themselves. Employment and unemployment are lagging indicators: they provide a guide to what has happened to an economy in the past rather than what is happening now or what will happen in the future.

Economist Nina Skero at the Centre for Economics and Business Research does expect a US rate rise, but perhaps not until the third quarter of the year:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p> Overall, the data add to the view that the US economic recovery steams ahead as wage gains and the unemployment rate approach long-run norms and as job creation figures, which admittedly can be rather volatile, remain high.</p> <p>In the aftermath of December\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s historic Federal Open Market Committee decision and this week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s data releases perhaps the question on the minds of many is what is the future of US monetary policy? It is important to keep in mind that as one swallow does not a summer make, one rate hike does not a normalized monetary policy make. Even with the December rise interest rates in the US remain low and although the committee has restated its intention to maintain an accommodative monetary policy, it is reasonable to expect further hikes in 2016 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c an expectation further strengthened by today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s strong labour market data.</p> <p>However, this is not to say that sources of risk which could slow down the recovery do not exist, both domestically and globally. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s labour-market release shows a participation rate of 62.6% - well below pre-crisis levels. On the global front, equity markets turmoil and the slowdown in China are among the greatest concerns.</p> <p>The exact pace and extent of further interest rate hikes is difficult to predict given that the FOMC itself maintains that it is data-dependent and that it will continue to make interest rate decisions based on a series of indicators that it is monitoring rather than on a pre-set schedule.<br></p> <p>Keeping in mind that the US economy is expected to perform strongly in 2016, but also that December minutes show that the FOMC wants to observe the potentially delayed impact of the rate rise before making further hikes, Cebr expects interest rates to rise to 0.75% in the third quarter of 2016.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-568fcb71e4b0d22ca1a4bdb9\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-01-08T14:48:50.060Z\">2.48pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s someone who thinks the Federal Reserve could raise US interest rates at its March meeting despite the uninspiring wage data</strong>. Harm Bandholz, chief US economist at UniCredit Research said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Average hourly earnings were only flat between November and December. But thanks to a positive basis effect, the year on year rate ticked up to 2.5% from 2.3%. But while the Fed has said at a number of recent occasions that it puts more emphasis on the actual development of inflation rates when determining the appropriate path for short-term interest rates, we think that the unambiguous display of strength in the labor market will continue to bolster the confidence of FOMC members that (a) consumer spending will continue to power the US economy ahead \u00e2\u20ac\u201c despite global headwinds, and (b) that faster wage gains will eventually lift domestic inflation rates. Accordingly, we continue to expect three rate hikes for 2016, with the next one coming at the March meeting.</p> </blockquote> <p>On the jobs numbers themselves he said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>To be sure, the labor market in the fourth quarter of 2015 most likely benefited from two special factors. First, there was a technical rebound in October, after the August and September numbers disappointed (in part due to seasonal adjustment issues). And in November and December, the unusually mild winter weather clearly supported employment in weather-sensitive areas, notably construction. </p> <p>There is, however, in our view no reason at all to question the underlying message of today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s and the previous couple of employment reports: The US labor market continues to be red-hot despite daily reports of global economic headwinds and financial market turmoil. The reason for this resilience \u00e2\u20ac\u201c as highlighted at several occasions \u00e2\u20ac\u201c is that most of the value added and of the job creation in the US occurs in the services sector, which is barely affected by global developments. And this trend strengthened further in 2015. After in 2014 81% of jobs were created in services, this number rose to a whopping 94% in 2015; with another 10% coming from the construction sector! That leaves a very small share of the labor market exposed to the adverse impacts of global economic headwinds and low oil prices.</p> </blockquote> <p><a><br></a><br></p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-568fc8cee4b0d22ca1a4bc94\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-01-08T14:33:55.383Z\">2.33pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/CapEconComms/statuses/685469021802754052\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Commodities?src=hash\">#Commodities</a> (even <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/gold?src=hash\">#gold</a>) unfazed by strong US jobs report: big <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/NFP?src=hash\">#NFP</a> gains suggest growth fears overdone, but wage data won&#39;t yet worry Fed.</p>&mdash; Capital Economics (@CapEconComms) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/CapEconComms/status/685469021802754052\">January 8, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-568fc80ce4b0a0fd811ab3e7\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-01-08T14:33:26.731Z\">2.33pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Wall Street opens higher</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>As expected after the better than expected US jobs figures, Wall Street has moved ahead in early trading.</p> <p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average has added 110 points or 0.6% while the S&amp;P 500 is up 0.4% and the Nasdaq 0.7%.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-568fc6c2e4b0d22ca1a4bb9e\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-01-08T14:25:24.886Z\">2.25pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our story on the US non-farm payrolls:</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jan/08/us-jobs-report-december-2015-economy-jobs\">US jobs report: economy adds 292,000 positions in strong finish to 2015</a> </p> </aside> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-568fc645e4b0600201f48961\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-01-08T14:24:01.316Z\">2.24pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>More detail on the US jobs:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ad864c704d8e6ad72788ae6d2982e0a6fbc70031\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ad864c704d8e6ad72788ae6d2982e0a6fbc70031/0_0_742_825/450.jpg\" alt=\"Job changes by sector\" width=\"450\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Job changes by sector</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bureau of Labor Statistics</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>On the mining sector, the Bureau of Labor Statistics said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Employment in mining continued to decline in December (-8,000).

The unemployment rate stood unchanged at 5.0%, still very low by any standards.</p> <p>One considerable disappointment in this survey, and perhaps a more important one as far as the pace of future fed hikes is concerned, is the wages figures. These grew at only a 2.5% year on year rise, and were flat over the month in December. Consensus had been looking for a modest 0.2% month on month increase, which would have taken wages into a range they had not inhabited since before the financial crisis. Instead, wages still seem to be struggling to rise. There was also no change in the average workweek, which tends to support the notion that wage pressures remain subdued, as increased hours frequently indicate a tight labour market and building wage pressures.</p> <p>Consequently, and even with the strong headline payrolls figure, we don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think these figures support a March rate hike, talk of which had been building over the past week following strong non-manufacturing ISM and ADP data.

The advanced economies faced similar challenges at corresponding stages in their development. But, in coping with the consequences of financial turbulence, the advanced economies often suffered significant losses of output relative to potential. The Beijing authorities are professedly seeking to change China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economic growth model from one which depends on exports and capital investment to one more firmly based on domestic consumption. But they may be over-estimating the extent to which politicians can choose how their economies grow. Since curbing growth in some sectors is usually easier than boosting it in others, the danger is that the attempt to re-orient the economy will result in overall weaker growth This is one reason, which seems to be widely acknowledged, why China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s future growth could well fall short not only of recent rates but even of the Beijing authorities\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 more conservative projections for the years to come.</p> </blockquote> <p>Then there are the demographic problems, which prompted the abolition of the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153One child per family\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd rule:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>By 2050, those aged 65 or over could well stand at 38% of the labour force, slightly less favourable even than Japan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s present ratio. There could be ameliorating circumstances for China. There may be scope for more migration from the countryside to urban centres without loss of agricultural production, though much less than there used to be. There will very likely be support to China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s GDP growth from a shift in the urban workforce from low-productivity activities to higher-productivity occupations. Further, China would perhaps be less opposed on cultural grounds than Japan to immigrant labour, though there have been no moves in that direction yet. Indeed, the ruling Communist Party\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s highly developed sense of self-preservation might be expected to resist any disturbance of the status quo. At the same time, in the nearer term, China faces a unique problem, the result of the recent abandonment of the one-child policy in favour of a two-child policy. To the extent that this measure is effective in raising the birth rate, it will temporarily boost the dependency ratio, that is, the proportion that the non-working population, old and young, bears to those of working age. Those who are working will need to increase their output merely to meet the needs of a growing non-active population. There will likely be a reduced margin of savings to finance capital investment and thereby to support future growth.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"25487dc61504e9542d3be231ab3c4fbf9e895357\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/25487dc61504e9542d3be231ab3c4fbf9e895357/0_0_2442_1616/1000.jpg\" alt=\"(FILES) This file handout picture taken and released by the Japan Coast Guard on December 22, 2015 shows a Chinese Coast Guard ship near disputed islets, known as the Senkaku islands in Japan and Diaoyu islands in China, in the East China Sea.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"662\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A photo released by the Japan Coast Guard on December 22, 2015 shows a Chinese Coast Guard ship near disputed islets, known as the Senkaku islands in Japan and Diaoyu islands in China, in the East China Sea.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Japan Coast Guard/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>And then there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the geopolitics,...</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The region is also a potential war-zone in a way that neither North America nor even Europe appears to be at the moment. Reports this week that North Korea has tested a hydrogen bomb is a reminder of the severity of the threat. Beyond the North Korean danger, both the East China Sea and the South China Sea are possible flashpoints. In the former area, there was a stand-off between Japan and China over the Senkaku (Diaoyu) islands through most of last year. But on 20 December an armed Chinese coast-guard vessel entered territorial waters that Japan claims around the islands. In response to these and other regional tensions, the Japanese government has proposed for the fiscal 2016/17 year a 1.5% increase in military spending to a highest-ever level. This is significant in view of the pressure to achieve reductions in other spending programmes. The Japanese government had been allowed, under the nation\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s post-war constitution, the right of self-defence, which would have covered operations around the Senkaku islands, but Mr Abe nevertheless pressed for, and in September secured, an amendment that would allow Japan to afford military help to allies. This strongly suggests that the Abe government foresees the possibility of Japan taking part in the resistance to what several nations in the region regard as Beijing\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s aggressive strategy in the South China Sea.</p> <p>It seems a long time since the Spratly islands first hit the headlines. It was as long ago as 1999 that a Filipino naval ship deliberately ran aground on one of those islands to establish a claim to the archipelago. Last year, in a dramatic development, it became clear that China was determinedly seeking to enforce its own title to the area when it built an artificial island on the foundation of the Mischief Reef and went on to claim, in contravention of UN rules, territorial waters around that construction. The US Navy has since sought to enforce freedom of the seas by disregarding China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pretensions, thereby precipitating low-level exchanges with China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ships.</p> <p>Vietnam also believes it has interests to defend in the South China Sea. In an ominous development, its government announced on 23 December that it would be taking delivery from Russia of two more Kilo-class submarines to supplement the four it already deploys. These vessels are reckoned to be especially effective in relatively shallow waters (the Iranian navy has three of them). Vietnam\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s army has put troop concentrations in the northern province on the border with China under \u00e2\u20ac\u02dchigh combat readiness\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. This appears to be a defensive move. But investors should note that Vietnam\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s defence doctrine is not based on attacking China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s naval forces head-on, a contest that Vietnam could hardly expect to win. Rather, in the event of hostilities, the aim of the strategists in Hanoi would be to use the submarines to prey on merchant shipping heading to and from Chinese ports through the South China Sea. Their calculation is that the resulting prohibitive cost of freight insurance, or indeed the unwillingness of insurers to provide cover at all, would cripple China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade and economic activity. It could also topple China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s financial system, an objective looking less fanciful in the light of this week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s evidence of fragility. Given Vietnam\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s record in getting the better of super-powers, this strategic view should perhaps be taken more seriously than investors seem prepared to do at the moment.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-568fa252e4b0d22ca1a4aa7d\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-01-08T12:01:06.930Z\">12.01pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s drama in the City -- high street retailer Sports Direct has issued a profits warning.</strong></p> <p>The company admitted that it could miss its target of \u00c2\u00a3420m profits by up to \u00c2\u00a340m, following weak sales since its last financial results on 10 December.</p> <p>It blamed:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\u00e2\u20ac\u0153a deterioration of trading conditions on the high street and a continuation of the unseasonal weather over the key Christmas period\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd.</p> </blockquote> <p>Shares are down around 5%, making it the biggest faller in London.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f46ae97d21919efe05fc646cb26f2acbfb880860\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f46ae97d21919efe05fc646cb26f2acbfb880860/0_0_689_367/500.jpg\" alt=\"Sports Direct share price today\" width=\"500\" height=\"266\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sports Direct share price today</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Thomson Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Several other retailers have blamed the warm weather recently - including Next and Marks &amp; Spencer.

                "bodyText":"And in Europe the FTSEurofirst 300 fell 7% over the course of the week, marking its worst weekly performance since August 2011 amid the eurozone crisis. On that, gloomy, note it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time to close the blog after what has been a tumultuous week. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be back on Monday to cover all the week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s financial developments. To add to the New Year market gloom, the FTSE 100 has made its worst weekly start to the year since 2000. The Dow Jones Industrial had already recorded its worst ever 4-day opening at the start of the year and the modest rise so far on Friday is unlikely to improve things, unless there is a major revival before the close. A poor week for global stock markets finished in negative fashion despite earlier hopes of a recovery. The volatility and chaos caused by disappointing Chinese data and the failed attempt to control the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock market with circuit breakers had sent investors running for the hills this week. But a 2% rise in the Chinese market earlier on Friday, following the abandonment of the circuit breakers and some support from the authorities for the yuan, gave some hope that a better day was in prospect. Better than expected US jobs figures put an end to that, prompting talk of further US rate rises and pushing the dollar higher, and by extension the oil price lower. With all the other geopolitical problems - North Korea\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s possible hydrogen bomb, tensions between Saudi Arabia and Iran - as well as Chinese inflation data this Saturday, traders decided to take their money off the table ahead of the weekend. Market analyst Tony Cross at Trustnet Direct said: A degree of calm in Chinese markets overnight has done little to placate sentiment, whilst better than expected employment data out of the US is also adding to woes. As global growth projections are trimmed whilst the Federal Reserve eyes the next interest rate hike, across the board it seems as if the economy will now face sustained headwinds. So Brent crude is currently down 1.6% at $33.18 a barrel, pushing commodity companies lower again. The FTSE 100 has lost nearly \u00c2\u00a385bn in value this week, recording its biggest weekly fall (5.28%) since August last year when the Chinese (yes, them again) sent ructions through global markets by devaluing the yuan. According to CNBC, the global market as measured by the S&amp;P Global Broad Market Index has lost more than $2trn this week. The final scores for the day showed: The FTSE 100 fell 41.64 points or 0.7% to 5912.44 Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax dropped 1.31% to 9849.34 France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac closed down 1.59% at 4333.76 Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB lost 1.58% to 19,869.49 Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ibex ended 1.66% down 8909.2 In Greece, the Athens market is 0.81% lower at 585.98 On Wall Street the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 62 points or 0.38%. One of the reasons for the decline in markets since the initial enthusiasm for the US jobs data is the feeling that the strong figures make a rate rise more likely. The disappointing wages growth might mitigate against an early rise, but the general feeling seems to be that even dearer borrowing costs are now more likely. Chris Beauchamp, senior market analyst at IG, said: Heading into the close, the FTSE 100 has given up all its gains for the day, finishing a tough week on a miserable note. After a passable performance overnight for the Chinese market, hopes were high that stock markets in Europe and the US could claw back some of their own losses. So far on this side of the pond, that has not been the case. Equity traders have been left bereft of reasons to be optimistic this week, and it looks like the China fears of the past few days will remain with us as we head into a new week. US job numbers kicked off 2016 in fine form, well ahead of estimates, but the lack of wage growth was the fly in the ointment. The fear now is that such good numbers, even with inflation worries, will encourage the Fed to continue with its planned four hikes this year, putting fresh pressure on equity markets. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our economics editor Larry Elliott on the US jobs data: It seems just like the good old days. Almost 300,000 jobs were added to payrolls in America in the last month of 2015, continuing the upward trend of recent months. The US is once again living up to its reputation for being a gigantic jobs machine. Well, perhaps. Jobs are certainly being created at a good lick and the US has an unemployment rate \u00e2\u20ac\u201c 5% \u00e2\u20ac\u201c that the eurozone, at 10.5%, would die for. There are signs that people who had given up hope of finding work are being encouraged back into the labour market. Inevitably, this will lead to speculation that the Federal Reserve has left it too late to start raising interest rates and will now be forced to play catch up with a more rapid increase in the cost of borrowing than Wall Street is expecting. There is already talk of the Fed repeating December\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rate hike in March. The markets may be getting ahead of themselves. Employment and unemployment are lagging indicators: they provide a guide to what has happened to an economy in the past rather than what is happening now or what will happen in the future. Some of the forward-looking indicators \u00e2\u20ac\u201c for manufacturing, for example \u00e2\u20ac\u201c have been worryingly weak. The Fed will certainly be looking closely at the rate of job creation in the US, but it is equally interested in what is happening to wages. And the story here is that pay pressures are extremely muted. Average hourly earnings were flat in December and were up by just 2.5% over the year as a whole, a much weaker outcome than Wall Street had been anticipating. His full analysis is here: Markets are flagging after the initial burst of enthusiasm following the US jobs data. On Wall Street the Dow Jones Industrial Average is now up 51 points, the FTSE 100 is just 2 points higher while Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax is down 42 points. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said: Initially buoyed by a bombastic non-farm figure the global indices couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t sustain their surge, the US open ending up not being the white knight the European markets were looking for. Perhaps the superb non-farm figure (at 292,000 against the 203,000 expected and an upwards revised 252,000 last month) was tempered by falling wage growth (at 0.0% against the 0.2% forecast) and an unchanged unemployment rate. Or perhaps investors aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t willing to take too much risk into the weekend, especially with the prospect of another awful start to Monday on the cards. Either way the Dow couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t manage to match the gains its futures were promising, at points flagging in the same way the European indices have done for much of the day. Chinese inflation figures are due over the weekend which could prompt further market ructions next week, given what has happened in the past few days. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s something to put the latest US jobs figures in context: Back with China, and here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a graphic showing all the recent intervention in the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock market: IG\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Joshua Mahony is not surprised by the fluctuations in the dollar following the non-farm payroll report: But not everyone agrees. Economist Nina Skero at the Centre for Economics and Business Research does expect a US rate rise, but perhaps not until the third quarter of the year: Overall, the data add to the view that the US economic recovery steams ahead as wage gains and the unemployment rate approach long-run norms and as job creation figures, which admittedly can be rather volatile, remain high. In the aftermath of December\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s historic Federal Open Market Committee decision and this week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s data releases perhaps the question on the minds of many is what is the future of US monetary policy? It is important to keep in mind that as one swallow does not a summer make, one rate hike does not a normalized monetary policy make. Even with the December rise interest rates in the US remain low and although the committee has restated its intention to maintain an accommodative monetary policy, it is reasonable to expect further hikes in 2016 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c an expectation further strengthened by today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s strong labour market data. However, this is not to say that sources of risk which could slow down the recovery do not exist, both domestically and globally. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s labour-market release shows a participation rate of 62.6% - well below pre-crisis levels. On the global front, equity markets turmoil and the slowdown in China are among the greatest concerns. The exact pace and extent of further interest rate hikes is difficult to predict given that the FOMC itself maintains that it is data-dependent and that it will continue to make interest rate decisions based on a series of indicators that it is monitoring rather than on a pre-set schedule. Keeping in mind that the US economy is expected to perform strongly in 2016, but also that December minutes show that the FOMC wants to observe the potentially delayed impact of the rate rise before making further hikes, Cebr expects interest rates to rise to 0.75% in the third quarter of 2016. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s someone who thinks the Federal Reserve could raise US interest rates at its March meeting despite the uninspiring wage data. Harm Bandholz, chief US economist at UniCredit Research said: Average hourly earnings were only flat between November and December. But thanks to a positive basis effect, the year on year rate ticked up to 2.5% from 2.3%. But while the Fed has said at a number of recent occasions that it puts more emphasis on the actual development of inflation rates when determining the appropriate path for short-term interest rates, we think that the unambiguous display of strength in the labor market will continue to bolster the confidence of FOMC members that (a) consumer spending will continue to power the US economy ahead \u00e2\u20ac\u201c despite global headwinds, and (b) that faster wage gains will eventually lift domestic inflation rates. Accordingly, we continue to expect three rate hikes for 2016, with the next one coming at the March meeting. On the jobs numbers themselves he said: To be sure, the labor market in the fourth quarter of 2015 most likely benefited from two special factors. First, there was a technical rebound in October, after the August and September numbers disappointed (in part due to seasonal adjustment issues). And in November and December, the unusually mild winter weather clearly supported employment in weather-sensitive areas, notably construction. There is, however, in our view no reason at all to question the underlying message of today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s and the previous couple of employment reports: The US labor market continues to be red-hot despite daily reports of global economic headwinds and financial market turmoil. The reason for this resilience \u00e2\u20ac\u201c as highlighted at several occasions \u00e2\u20ac\u201c is that most of the value added and of the job creation in the US occurs in the services sector, which is barely affected by global developments. And this trend strengthened further in 2015. After in 2014 81% of jobs were created in services, this number rose to a whopping 94% in 2015; with another 10% coming from the construction sector! That leaves a very small share of the labor market exposed to the adverse impacts of global economic headwinds and low oil prices. As expected after the better than expected US jobs figures, Wall Street has moved ahead in early trading. The Dow Jones Industrial Average has added 110 points or 0.6% while the S&amp;P 500 is up 0.4% and the Nasdaq 0.7%. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our story on the US non-farm payrolls: More detail on the US jobs: On the mining sector, the Bureau of Labor Statistics said: Employment in mining continued to decline in December (-8,000). After adding 41,000 jobs in 2014, mining lost 129,000 jobs in 2015, with most of the loss in support activities for mining. Further consideration of the wages data - and the implications for the Federal Reserve to hold fire on another rate rise - has seen the dollar lose some of its initial strength in the wake of the figures. Against the pound, the US currency is at $1.4572 compared to $1.4556 earlier. On the wages figures, Alex Lydall at Foenix Partners said: Not all components were positive in today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s payroll print with Average Hourly Earnings being a particular concern falling 0.2% below forecasts. More jobs being created can only be seen as good news, but with hourly earnings lagging, labour cost inflation is still a slight concern to Janet Yellen. The strong payrolls number has vindicated the Federal Reserve\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision to raise rates in December, said Rob Carnell at ING Bank, but the next increase may not come until June. He said: However, aside from this strong headline, there is not much else to get too excited about. The unemployment rate stood unchanged at 5.0%, still very low by any standards. One considerable disappointment in this survey, and perhaps a more important one as far as the pace of future fed hikes is concerned, is the wages figures. These grew at only a 2.5% year on year rise, and were flat over the month in December. Consensus had been looking for a modest 0.2% month on month increase, which would have taken wages into a range they had not inhabited since before the financial crisis. Instead, wages still seem to be struggling to rise. There was also no change in the average workweek, which tends to support the notion that wage pressures remain subdued, as increased hours frequently indicate a tight labour market and building wage pressures. Consequently, and even with the strong headline payrolls figure, we don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think these figures support a March rate hike, talk of which had been building over the past week following strong non-manufacturing ISM and ADP data. Our house forecast for the next hike in June is still, we think, a more likely outcome. Wages in the US were also on the rise, the figures show, but perhaps not enough for another interest rate hike at the Federal Reserve\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s next meeting. The year on year gain was 2.5% in December compares to 2.3% in November, and is expected to pick up further as employment increases. However the average hourly earnings figure dropped a cent in December. The full US jobs report is here. Here are the charts showing the US job gains and unemployment rate: The jobs data may well have vindicated the Fed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rate decision, but there is no reason to be complacent, suggests Dennis de Jong, managing director at UFX.com. He said: It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s far too soon to know definitively if Fed Chair Janet Yellen and Co. made the right decision in raising interest rates last month. However, December\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s well above expected non-farm payroll figures will confirm her assessment that the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest economy is in rude health. Despite the positive jobs figures, there are plenty of challenges on the horizon for Yellen to navigate, not least depressed oil prices and the Chinese economy playing havoc with exchanges the world over. Observers will be hoping that next week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s US retail sales figures show a bumper holiday trading period. The better than expected US jobs data could well prompt further rate rises this year, and this has pushed the dollar higher again. Sterling has hit the day\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s low of $1.4556 , down from $1.4590 beforehand, while the euro has fallen around 1%. Markets seem to like the news. The FTSE 100 is now up 47 points and is back over 6000, Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax has climbed 0.3% and France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac has come off its lows, down 0.16%. US futures are now showing a 147 point opening on the Dow Jones Industrial Average. The jobless rate however has come in line with forecasts at 5%. November\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s jobs figure has been revised up from 211,000 to 252,000 and October\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s from 298,000 to 307,000. The non-farm payroll numbers for December showed a 292,000 rise compared to expectations of 200,000. That seems to back up the Federal Reserve\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision to raise interest rates last month. Our Financial editor, Nils Pratley, has kicked the tires on Sports Direct\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s profit warning. His verdict - the City is changing its view of Mike Ashley\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s empire, fast. And can the weather really be blamed? Should a mild winter really upset trading at a sportswear chain? Sports Direct is not in the coats and jumpers business in the way that Marks &amp; Spencer and Next are. Warm temperatures, in theory, might even encourage better sales of trainers and tracksuits than freezing conditions. Doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t Sports Direct have a strong online business to capture the switch to online shopping? And surely the weather hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t changed radically since management said four weeks ago it remained confident of achieving top-line profits of \u00c2\u00a3420m in the current financial year; now it says anything between \u00c2\u00a3380m and \u00c2\u00a3420m is possible. After this turbulent week, many in the City and on Wall Street just hope the US jobs report will be undramatic: It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s nearly time for the final major piece of economic data of the week -- the latest US jobs report for December. Economists expect around 200,000 new jobs were created last month: On a normal week, the Non-Farm Payroll is the main event. Today, it feels less important compared to the ructions over China. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also slightly less dramatic, given that the Federal Reserve took the plunge and raised interest rates last month. Of course, if Non-Farm is much weaker than expected, it could fuel concerns that the Fed hiked too early. Ransquawk have helpfully rounded up the Wall Street guesstimates: Wise heads in the City say that we shouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t fixate on the exchange rate between the yuan and the US dollar. Instead, we should look at how the yuan is shaping up against a basket of other currencies (who will also have suffered from the stronger dollar too) And as these charts shows, China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s currency has been more stable on this basis:: So, the time to panic might be when the trade-weighed yuan dives, as that would suggest Beijing was struggling to handle the situation. Senior City economist Stephen Lewis has issued a long note on China today, explaining why there is such anxiety about China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s financial stability, and the consequences for the global economy if things turn very sour. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve cropped out some highlights below, as it provides some useful insight into the situation. Lewis points out that Beijing\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s attempts to rebalance its economy away from manufacturing and into consumption will inevitably hurt growth: It should be no surprise that a rapidly growing industrial economy such as China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s is drifting into choppy financial waters. The advanced economies faced similar challenges at corresponding stages in their development. But, in coping with the consequences of financial turbulence, the advanced economies often suffered significant losses of output relative to potential. The Beijing authorities are professedly seeking to change China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economic growth model from one which depends on exports and capital investment to one more firmly based on domestic consumption. But they may be over-estimating the extent to which politicians can choose how their economies grow. Since curbing growth in some sectors is usually easier than boosting it in others, the danger is that the attempt to re-orient the economy will result in overall weaker growth This is one reason, which seems to be widely acknowledged, why China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s future growth could well fall short not only of recent rates but even of the Beijing authorities\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 more conservative projections for the years to come. Then there are the demographic problems, which prompted the abolition of the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153One child per family\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd rule: By 2050, those aged 65 or over could well stand at 38% of the labour force, slightly less favourable even than Japan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s present ratio. There could be ameliorating circumstances for China. There may be scope for more migration from the countryside to urban centres without loss of agricultural production, though much less than there used to be. There will very likely be support to China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s GDP growth from a shift in the urban workforce from low-productivity activities to higher-productivity occupations. Further, China would perhaps be less opposed on cultural grounds than Japan to immigrant labour, though there have been no moves in that direction yet. Indeed, the ruling Communist Party\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s highly developed sense of self-preservation might be expected to resist any disturbance of the status quo. At the same time, in the nearer term, China faces a unique problem, the result of the recent abandonment of the one-child policy in favour of a two-child policy. To the extent that this measure is effective in raising the birth rate, it will temporarily boost the dependency ratio, that is, the proportion that the non-working population, old and young, bears to those of working age. Those who are working will need to increase their output merely to meet the needs of a growing non-active population. There will likely be a reduced margin of savings to finance capital investment and thereby to support future growth. And then there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the geopolitics,... The region is also a potential war-zone in a way that neither North America nor even Europe appears to be at the moment. Reports this week that North Korea has tested a hydrogen bomb is a reminder of the severity of the threat. Beyond the North Korean danger, both the East China Sea and the South China Sea are possible flashpoints. In the former area, there was a stand-off between Japan and China over the Senkaku (Diaoyu) islands through most of last year. But on 20 December an armed Chinese coast-guard vessel entered territorial waters that Japan claims around the islands. In response to these and other regional tensions, the Japanese government has proposed for the fiscal 2016/17 year a 1.5% increase in military spending to a highest-ever level. This is significant in view of the pressure to achieve reductions in other spending programmes. The Japanese government had been allowed, under the nation\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s post-war constitution, the right of self-defence, which would have covered operations around the Senkaku islands, but Mr Abe nevertheless pressed for, and in September secured, an amendment that would allow Japan to afford military help to allies. This strongly suggests that the Abe government foresees the possibility of Japan taking part in the resistance to what several nations in the region regard as Beijing\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s aggressive strategy in the South China Sea. It seems a long time since the Spratly islands first hit the headlines. It was as long ago as 1999 that a Filipino naval ship deliberately ran aground on one of those islands to establish a claim to the archipelago. Last year, in a dramatic development, it became clear that China was determinedly seeking to enforce its own title to the area when it built an artificial island on the foundation of the Mischief Reef and went on to claim, in contravention of UN rules, territorial waters around that construction. The US Navy has since sought to enforce freedom of the seas by disregarding China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pretensions, thereby precipitating low-level exchanges with China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ships. Vietnam also believes it has interests to defend in the South China Sea. In an ominous development, its government announced on 23 December that it would be taking delivery from Russia of two more Kilo-class submarines to supplement the four it already deploys. These vessels are reckoned to be especially effective in relatively shallow waters (the Iranian navy has three of them). Vietnam\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s army has put troop concentrations in the northern province on the border with China under \u00e2\u20ac\u02dchigh combat readiness\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. This appears to be a defensive move. But investors should note that Vietnam\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s defence doctrine is not based on attacking China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s naval forces head-on, a contest that Vietnam could hardly expect to win. Rather, in the event of hostilities, the aim of the strategists in Hanoi would be to use the submarines to prey on merchant shipping heading to and from Chinese ports through the South China Sea. Their calculation is that the resulting prohibitive cost of freight insurance, or indeed the unwillingness of insurers to provide cover at all, would cripple China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade and economic activity. It could also topple China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s financial system, an objective looking less fanciful in the light of this week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s evidence of fragility. Given Vietnam\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s record in getting the better of super-powers, this strategic view should perhaps be taken more seriously than investors seem prepared to do at the moment. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s drama in the City -- high street retailer Sports Direct has issued a profits warning. The company admitted that it could miss its target of \u00c2\u00a3420m profits by up to \u00c2\u00a340m, following weak sales since its last financial results on 10 December. It blamed: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a deterioration of trading conditions on the high street and a continuation of the unseasonal weather over the key Christmas period\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Shares are down around 5%, making it the biggest faller in London. Several other retailers have blamed the warm weather recently - including Next and Marks &amp; Spencer. So it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s very plausible that demand for Sports Direct parka coats have fallen recently. But demand for other kit might have softened the blow? A month ago, The Guardian exposed working conditions at Sports Direct, where workers are chivvied by tannoy to work faster, and underwent searches after their shift was over. With trading conditions worsening, the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shareholders have a lot to ponder... The European stock market rally is petering out. Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock market is now in the red today: Now this is interesting.. China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s centraal bank has issued a statement, pledging to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153further liberalise\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd interest rates. Reuters has more details: The central bank also said it would make the yuan more international, keep the currency basically stable, further improve the currency formation mechanism and deepen reforms of the foreign exchange management system and financial institutions. The central bank will use medium-term loans, and pledged supplementary loans and credit policies to support key areas of the economy. The central bank also said it would maintain prudent monetary policy and flexibly use monetary policy tools to keep adequate liquidity in the banking system. If you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re just tuning in, here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s what you need to know.... A sense of calm has returned to global stock markets today, following the worst start to a new year on record. But China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy remains a big fear, that could well dominate most of this year. China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s market has stabilised, closing 2% higher. Beijing authorities are thought to have been buying up shares, in an attempt to restore confidence. Traders were also encouraged that the yuan was fixed at a higher level today, easing fears of a currency war.But confidence in the Chinese authorities has been hit by this week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s drama: Christopher Balding, a professor of finance and economics at Peking University\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s HSBC business school, said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Chinese investors want very similar things that international investors want: they want clarity, they want to understand what is going on, they want to know what the policies are, they want stability and [to know] what the rules are. The constant back-and-forth and changes just don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t engender confidence that Beijing has really any idea what they are doing.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd More here: European stocks are all in the green today, ending a wild week on a stronger note. Jasper Lawler of CMC Market says: A rebound in Chinese shares and the price of oil provided some relief for shares in Europe on Friday after a brutal first week of the year. But despite the recovery, world markets have still suffered a remarkably poor start to the year. $4trn has been wiped off global shares, according to Bloomberg A handy reminder of how markets began 2016: When financial historians look back at this period, they will probably conclude that China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ill-fated and short-lived circuit breaker was not the best idea ever created. It was meant to prevent mayhem, by briefly suspending trading when the market fell 5% and closing it off for the day if it lost another 2%. But as we saw on Monday, and Thursday, it actually sparked crashes as investors rushed to sell shares at the first sign that the market was going down. So, full credit to Beijing for culling it yesterday - a move that was immortalised by the FT: Alastair McCaig of IG says the abolishment of the circuit breaker helped Chinese shares to rise today. Human psychology has had a strong hand to play in the way Chinese markets have behaved. The removal of the system that suspends the market should it fall too much has, ironically, seen the fear of entrapment reduced with Asian investors. Britain could lose almost 1% of global economic output if China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy suffers a serious hard landing, according to analysis from Oxford Economics. And that would actually mean the UK gets off relatively lightly, compared to the pain which emerging markets would suffer. Over in Hong Kong, investors are catching their breath after the worst new year week since 2000. The Hang Seng index closed higher today, up 0.6%. But heavy losses earlier this week mean it lost 6.6% so far this year. Dr Nikos Paltalidis, lecturer in Finance at Durham University Business School, also reckons fears over China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock market are overblown. He points out that shares did soar by 50% last year - a clear sign of a speculative bubble that is now deflating. However, that doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t mean that the selloff won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t cause serious consequences. Paltalidis says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The sudden wave of concern about China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s looming economic catastrophe is overblown. However, the burst of the stock market bubble, increases the concern about the knock on effect on the real-estate market. Chinese policymakers might need to respond with additional currency devaluation, and if things get worse, some form of quantitative easing, to avoid a collapse in asset prices. Despite today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s small recovery, European stock markets are on track for their worst week since last August\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rout (which was also triggered by China). Richard Hunter, Head of Equities at Hargreaves Lansdown Stockbrokers, says investors have adopted \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the brace position\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd this week:, wiping around 5% off the major indices. What should have been a perky start to 2016, with New Year optimism underpinned by portfolio positioning as investors buy stocks, has been eclipsed by ongoing concerns on global growth, the oil price and negative geopolitical developments. The general souring of sentiment had been exacerbated by the Chinese circuit breakers, along with Fed minutes which questioned the strength of belief in the December hike and sellers apparently pushing against an open door.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd One of Angela Merkel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s top allies has called for calm over China. Speaking on Bloomberg TV a moment ago, Michael Fuchs argued that the panic over China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock markets has been overdone. I do believe that China is getting back on track. It is still tracking a 7% growth rate - 7% growth is a decent number.... I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m not so pessimistic that China is going to be in a deep crisis. But Fuchs also warned that German industry, such as car markets and chemicals producers, will suffer if China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy weakens. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a sense of relief in the foreign exchange markets this morning, as emerging market currencies recover. Ilya Spivak, currency strategist at DailyFX, has the details: Investors\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 mood brightened after two days of aggressive selling after China suspended circuit-breakers that shut off stock market trade after just 14 minutes of activity yesterday and set the daily Yuan fix a bit higher. The risk-geared Australian, Canadian and New Zealand Dollars outperformed while the safety-linked Japanese Yen proved weakest on the session. In a few weeks Beijing will have a window of opportunity to take fresh steps to shore up its economy: After 30 minutes of trading, European markets are all showing small gains: This week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ructions have not improved Beijing\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s reputation for economic competence. As Marc Ostwald of ADM Investor Services puts it: As we have argued before, China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s authorities have clearly bitten far more than they can chew in their markets and economy reform efforts, with a clear sense that they are at best fumbling in the dark emerging. He also warns that the current calm in the markets is probably only \u00e2\u20ac\u0153transitory\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. The oil price is rising this morning, in another signal that markets are a little calmer this morning. Brent crude has gained 1.5% to $34.26 per barrel, having hit fresh 11-year lows yesterday. Mining stocks are recovering some ground, with commodity trader Glencore up 2.3% and Rio Tinto up 1.5%. Again, a small move - as Accendo Markets\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Mike van Dulken points out: Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock markets are open, and showing some small gains in early trading. The FTSE 100 has risen by 20 points, or 0.3%, to 5974, while Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s DAX is 0.4% higher. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pretty small potatoes, given the Footsie lost 2% yesterday while the DAX shed 3%. How much market value has been destroyed in this week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock market rout? According to CNBC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Jacob Pramuk, we have lost.....(puts on Dr Evil voice) two trillion dollars! He explains: The S&amp;P Global Broad Market Index, which tracks global stock performance, has lost $2.23 trillion in market value this year. For perspective, the total trumps estimated U.S. student loan debt of more than $1 trillion and would represent roughly 12 percent of U.S. government debt. But that might not capture the full scale of the rout. Bloomberg\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s widest measure of listed companies shows a four trillion dollar loss: The Financial Times also flags up that Beijing authorities appears to be buying shares today: By lunch time the indices were up, amid reports that China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s state-backed funds were once again buying up shares On Thursday the securities regulator said that its promulgation of permanent rules restricting stock sales by large shareholders did not indicate that the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153national team\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd is withdrawing from the market. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Its market stability function will not change,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd the agency said. The statement marks a shift in tone from late August, when the regulator said that the national team would halt regular share purchases. More here: China markets motor higher in choppy trading Good morning from London, where City traders are arriving at their desks and looking nervously at developments in Asia overnight. And the latest news is that the Chinese market has just closed up for the day. The Shanghai composite index jumped 2%, or 61 points, to finish at 3,186 points, following the wild ride which Martin has been tracking through this blog. It does appear that China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s state-backed funds have been active in the market, buying up shares and giving retail investors a little confidence. Signs that Beijing has been intervening to support the yuan have helped shore up confidence too. Yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision to abandon China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new circuit-breaker rules has also paid off (they had been fuelling the crisis, as investors were rushing ditch shares before the market fell 7% and was shut for the day). But it really has been a turbulent start to the year. China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock market has lost 10% of its value this week - the worst run since the Great Fall of China last summer. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time for me to sign off from Sydney and pass you over seamlessly to Graeme Wearden in London for what should be an interesting day. Thanks for following us. While not a great start to the year for the Japanese market. This is how the European opening looks. Still a bit of a mixed bag. Associated Press has just put together a thought-provoking three reasons for concern about the Chinese economy. A tumbling currency which has unnerved world markets but which is probably up to 8% overvalued. Transition to an economy based less on cheap manufacturing and more on consumer spending and services. Mismanagement such as poor communication and bungled execution of policies such as the ill-fated \u00e2\u20ac\u0153circuit breaker\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd have aggravated an already worsening situation. Japan has just closed down at an estimated cost this week of $320bn in market capitalisation. Ouch. Better day so far in Shanghai and Shenzen as this chart on the CSI300. While this picture of the yuan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s devaluation tells us the story from a different angle. China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u0153national team\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd appears to have steadied the economic ship after state intervention to prop up the yuan prompted a rally in Chinese stocks The bluechip CSI300 and the Shanghai Composite were up 3% in afternoon trade Elsewhere the Nikkei was down 0.45% and the Australian market finished 0.39% lower. Mixed picture from European futures trade ahead of the open Questions about sustainability of Chinese policy from Japanese finance minister Oil has risen off 12-year lows to $34.31 a barrel but key metals such as copper and nickel still suffering For a full story on the day\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s developments so far, my colleague Tom Phillips has just filed this report from Beijing: In another snippet from Tom\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s report, there are rumours that the head of the Chinese regulator, Xiao Gan, will be resigning tomorrow. IG analyst Angus Nicholson said in a note today that: Confidence in China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ability to manage their capital markets has only been further damaged after they announced the removal of their \u00e2\u20ac\u0153circuit breakers\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd after only being in place for four days (sending the market limit down 50% of the time) and rumours circulating that CSRC head Xiao Gang would be resigning tomorrow. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll try to find out more about that as the day goes on. In broader economic news, a strong jobs figure is expected from the US later today. The magnificently named non-farm payrolls are due on Friday lunchtime US time and are expected to show that employers likely maintained a fairly strong pace of hiring in December. Nonfarm payrolls probably increased by 200,000 jobs, just a slight step down from the 211,000 created in November, according to a Reuters survey of economists. That puts unemployment at around 5% and might further calm market nerves. Also to some extent justifies the Federal Reserve decision to tighten monetary policy last month. Back to the Beijing competence theme with the Wall Street Journal weighing in... The ASX/S&amp;P 200 index has closed below 5000 points after a sixth straight session in the red. The benchmark was 19.5 points, or 0.39%, lower at 4,990.8, while the broader All Ordinaries index was down 19.4 points, or 0.38 per cent, at 5,049.4, Australian Associated Press reports. My colleague in Beijing, Tom Phillips, says China has mustered the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153national team\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to fight to avoid the kind of stock market turmoil that left president Xi Jinping embarrassed last year. Tom\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s full report will be on the website soon but he quotes Christopher Balding, a professor of finance and economics at Peking University\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s HSBC Business School, saying that Beijing\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economic flip-flopping and \u00e2\u20ac\u0153wild swings in policymaking\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd had severely damaged confidence. Chinese investors want very similar things that international investors want: they want clarity, they want to understand what is going on, they want to know what the policies are, they want stability and [to know] what the rules are. The constant back-and-forth and changes just don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t engender confidence that Beijing has really any idea what they are doing. And here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a European view: A couple of hours to go before trading opens in Europe and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a mixed picture about what is going to happen there. According to IG, the FTSE 100 will open up 13 points while the Dax in Geramy looks likely to open down 19 points. Some straighter business news out of China today shows that demand for electric cars is growing. BYD, a Chinese carmaker backed by Warren Buffett\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s conglomerate Berkshire Hathaway, raised its 2015 profit estimate to a five-year high, citing strong demand for its electric and plug-in hybrid vehicles, Reuters has reported. Government policy has helped boost demand, it said. Despite a slowing economy and volatile financial markets, Chinese automakers such as BYD and Geely Automobile Holdings have flagged bumper profits for 2015, boosted by favourable government policies and consumer preferences that stoked demand for their products. BYD said late on Thursday it expects net profit attributable to shareholders to climb between 518% and 557% for 2015, compared with an earlier forecast of a rise in the range of 435% to 481%. Nerves do seem to have been settled by the PBOC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s yuan intervention/fix policy. The steps today to fix the yuan firmer and then get state-owned banks to prop up the offshore yuan value look contradictory in the light of previous days\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 actions. But in the absence of the circuit breaker it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s done the trick for now. The CSI300 and Shanghai Comp have paused for lunch up 2.75% and 2.39% respectively. The Nikkei is up a smidgeon but the ASX is still trailing at 0.53% down But Beijing\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s policy still looks a bit cack-handed to some: It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a good day for charts. Expert opinion is quite divided about the state of play in China. Tian Weidong, analyst at Kaiyuan Securities in Shanghai put what might be described as the party line: The market is back to normal Investors can buy and sell as they wish. Under the circuit breaker mechanism, the market was suffocated. But other were a little more nuanced in their assessment of a day\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trading that hs seen the Chinese markets climb back into positive territory despite the lack of circuit breaker. Mohamed El-Erian, the chief economic adviser at Allianz, said China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision to suspend a stock circuit breaker made sense, but the implementation and timing did not. China realized that it had very tight limits on the markets, he told Bloomberg, which did more harm than good. They realised this, which is good news. The bad news is they took it off at a very peculiar time and did so without a whole set of compensating measures. The mainland Chinese markets are coming up for their lunch break, so it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a good time to check on the scoreboard. Asia Pacific markets are all up, except Australia. Nikkei up 0.39% (at lunch) CSI300 up 2.8% Shanghai Composite up 2.2% ASX/S&amp;P 200 down 0.43% Hang Seng up 2.2% Kospi up 0.08% Oil may have rallied a bit but it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s still a poor outlook for prices of other industrial commodities. London Copper has dropped 1% to $4,480 a tonne this afternoon, nearing 2009 lows. Nickel fell 2%, while lead and zinc eased nearly 1%. None of that is great for the Australian-Anglo mining behemoth BHP Billiton which is down again by 0.43% this afternoon on the Australian stock market. Rio Tinto, which is not exposed to oil prices in the same way, is up more than 1.5%. And Australian gold producers are doing well out of the chaos. The precious metal rose to a two-month high of $1,113.2, a gain of 4.9 percent so far this year. The Japanese finance minister Taro Aso has warned that the Chinese might find it hard to continue supporting the yuan given the decline in its foreign currency reserves revealed on Thursday. Aso said Tokyo that further declines could trigger further capital flight from China and potentially set off competitive currency devaluations in other countries. Foreign exchange reserves have already fallen this much due to China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s purchases of yuan to support its own currency, so it could be difficult to continue. China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s foreign exchange reserves fell $512.66 billion in 2015 to $3.33 trillion, central bank data showed on Thursday. $107.9 billion was accounted for in December alone. Reuters quotes a trader at a European bank in Shanghai that state-owned banks were offering dollar liquidity at 6.59 yuan per dollar in an attempt to push it higher. But it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s confused picture, not helped by the difference in the onshore and offshore value of the yuan. Reuters explains what happened after the PBOC set the yuan at 6.5636 today, with the currency moving towards that fix from an overnight close of 6.5929 backed by state-owned banks\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 intervention: The onshore yuan recovered to 6.5887 in morning trade, while the offshore yuan was about 1.4 percent weaker at 6.6798, narrowing a spread that reached around 2 percent a day earlier, making the central bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s currency management task more complicated. After its sharply lower fix on Thursday, the PBOC had later sown confusion by reportedly intervening heavily to defend the yuan in offshore trade, reversing a decline of more than 1 percent that took it to a record low of 6.7600 per dollar. That left dealers at a loss to know what the central bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s aims were. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The sharp drop has led to speculation that China is letting go of the reins on the CNY (yuan), or perhaps targeting faster depreciation to reach an \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcequilibrium\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 level,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd wrote analysts at Barclays, while conceding that no one was really sure. The Chinese central bank, the PBOC, is intervening to support the yuan, according to Reuters. The global oil benchmark, Brent crude, has rallied 2% today after China boosted the yuan. Brent had risen 56 cents to $34.31 a barrel as of 12.50 AEDT (0150 GMT), having hit $34.72 earlier. It settled down 48 cents at $33.75 in the previous session, after marking $32.16, a level last seen in April 2004. US crude was trading 63c higher at $33.90 a barrel. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not easy to keep track this morning but here are the main points. Asia Pacific has seen wild trading on the main stock markets amid continued uncertainty and doubts about Chinese policy The People\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Bank of China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision to fix the yuan firmer initially boosted equities after a nervous start But trading has been volatile: Shanghai Composite and CSI300 index both more than 1% higher after first lurching up, then down. Nikkei up 0.3%; ASX/S&amp;P 200 down 0.5%; Kospi up 0.16%; Hang Seng up 1.09% Oil rises off 12-year lows $34.31 a barrel Aussie dollar rises, while Japanese yen drops Australian retail sales met expectations with 0.4% growth in November It should be said at this point that the volatility of the Chinese markets is much more significant for what it tells us about policy-making in Beijing than the intrinsic importance of the numbers. Most people accept that the share prices in China are totally overvalued and must be allowed to fall. But it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the disorderly manner in which this is happening which makes it interesting. My colleague Nils Pratley wrote on Monday that Beijing risked making the same mistakes this week as they did in the northern summer by stopping prices finding their natural level. Read what Nils had to say here. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pretty much come to pass: Are you keeping up at the back? It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a confused picture today and no mistake. The chart in this tweet is quite helpful though. Thanks to Patrick McGee of the FT. Traders were following China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s lead upwards. But the Chinese markets are all over the place. After an early rally, the Shanghai Composite index and the CSI300 index of leading shares are heading south again. How low will they go? Decent Australian retail sales for November helped boost the ASX. They were up 0.4% boosted by a 1% rise in the cafes and restaurants category, yet proof if any were needed that Australians just love to eat out. Household goods sales increased by 0.9%. Total retail spending was $24.77bn in November, up from $24.66bn in October, the Australian Bureau of Statistics said. Stock markets have rallied across Asia Pacific. The Nikkei is down just 0.24%, while the ASX/S&amp;P 200 in Australia is now into positive territory. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the first time the PBOC has fixed the yuan stronger in nine days. A lower number equals a stronger fix because it relates to what it takes to buy one US dollar. The People\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Bank of China set the midpoint rate at 6.5636 per dollar prior to market open, firmer than the previous fix of 6.5646, and firmer than the previous day\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s closing quote 6.5929. That is the first time the PBOC has firmed the midpoint against the dollar in 9 trading days, after it allowed the biggest fall in the yuan in five months on Thursday, pressuring regional currencies and sending global stock markets tumbling as investors feared it would trigger competitive devaluations. The Australian dollar is an immediate beneficiary of this stronger yuan fix. The Aussie has gained almost half a cent in the last 10 minutes and is now buying US70.60c. Equities following upwards. The yuan fix is a good deal more stabilising than previous ones this week. Last night\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s close was 6.5929 to the US dollar which means the PBOC has opted for a more confidence-boosting currency level for now. Yuan fixed at 6.5636 Only a few minutes before the People\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Bank of China announces today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fix for the yuan. A weaker than expected fix has twice triggered market crashes this week so this is going to be a key moment. Yesterday China published figures for foreign reserves which showed it was burning through cash to prop up the yuan. So will they stick or twist today? Good morning and welcome to the live blog. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been another lively morning on the financial markets and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tense ahead of the opening of the Chinese mainland markets at 12.30 AEDT. The Chinese regulator has scrapped its controversial \u00e2\u20ac\u0153circuit-breaker\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd mechanism which has been triggered twice this week when losses hit 7%, forcing the markets to cease trading. Added to the continued devaluation of the yuan, traders around the world have drawn the conclusion that the Chinese authorities know something about the state of their economy that fairly rosy official figures are not showing. So will prices be allowed to fall to a fair value after six months of restrictions on sales? Or will the state instead intervene with mass buying of stocks? Perhaps they will try to moderate the yuan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s recent devaluation in order to boost confidence? Meanwhile, the market in Australia \u00e2\u20ac\u201c always the first major market to face the new ball, as it were \u00e2\u20ac\u201c has fallen more than 1%. More here:",

                "bodyText":"Its specialist action cameras allow surfers, skiers and other thrillseekers to record their exploits. The devices have been strapped to eagles to give a real bird\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s eye view of the landscape, and can even be attached to a specially designed harness so that dog owners can view the world through the eyes of their pet. When GoPro floated its shares on Wall Street in June 2014, there seemed to be no limit to how high they might go. Snapped up at $24 a share by an eager investing public, the shares rocketed to $94 as investors backed the US company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s vision of fun videos and fast-growing revenues. The company was valued at $3bn (\u00c2\u00a32.1bn) on flotation and its chief executive, Nick Woodman, scooped $86m by selling part of his stake in the deal. This week, the group\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shares lurched dramatically downwards. On Wednesday, they plunged 28% to just more than $12 as the group said sales were not meeting targets and it would miss revenue projections by around 14%for the calendar year. The problems are centred on GoPro\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Hero4 Session \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a new camera released last year small enough to fit in the palm of a hand. But buyers balked at the $399 launch price. GoPro cut the price to $299, and then again to $199 (about \u00c2\u00a3170 in the UK ) in a bid to boost sales. Cheap Chinese competition, from firms like Xiaomi, is another headache. And spooking investors further, the group said it would cut its workforce by around 7%, costing it between $5-10m in restructuring expenses. The statement was more bad news for investors who have been disappointed time and again in recent months. The shares dropped below the issue price of $24 for the first time in November. Over the whole of 2015 they were down 70% . Citi analyst Jeremy David slashed his price target last month from $75 to $22, saying the GoPro novelty may be wearing off: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We are becoming worried that poor sell thru could be a reflection of diminishing consumer interest in new GoPro devices.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd After this week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s news, he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s reduced his target further, to $12. Woodman dreamed up the idea for GoPro during a surfing trip after the digital marketing firm he started after college became a casualty of the dot-com collapse. At the time of the float his GoPro shareholding was valued at around $1.3bn. Now it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s worth around half that. Needless to say, shareholders have been left unimpressed and are reaching for their lawyers. At least one law firm has started legal action, claiming that the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s management has been too slow to warn investors about its deteriorating sales prospects. Glancy, Prongay and Murray, a Los Angeles-based law firm, alleges in its class action lawsuit that GoPro\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s management statements since July 2015 have been false and misleading \u00e2\u20ac\u201c specifically with reference to sales of the group\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Hero camera range. For others, the extreme market reaction to problems in the delivery of one product is a very good reason to remain in the private sector and not float. Suranga Chandratillake, a partner at Balderton, an investor in companies such as Betfair, Wonga and The Hut, said the huge share price reaction was down to one product not working out as expected: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153While that is not a good thing, the reaction seems extreme and is typical of public markets \u00e2\u20ac\u201c extreme enthusiasm/pessimism around technology companies.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd That overreaction, he says, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153is one of the big drivers of why many big tech companies, such as Uber and AirBnb, are choosing to stay private. It allows them to stay agile, build for the long term,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he says. GoPro\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s statement came in the middle of a difficult week for US technology stocks. Over the last week both Fitbit, the exercise monitor, and Etsy, the digital crafts marketplace, have sunk to all-time share price lows. Shares in the larger technology companies are also well down on their three-month highs. Facebook was trading at $95 on Friday afternoon, compared with $107 at the end of December. Netflix is down from $130 to around $103, and Amazon\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shares are trading at around $570 compared with $694 at the end of 2015. GoPro\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s management and investors will be hoping its next products can revitalise its flagging stock. The company is expected to launch a new line of products in the first half of 2016, including a flying camera. Should that catch on, investors could return. Woodman tried to remain optimistic, when he addressed employees by email after the news of the revenue shortfall. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Today isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t the type of day we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re used to at GoPro. But from the looks of things \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 tomorrow is looking pretty damn good.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd How the tech giants have fared All the major US technology groups have suffered from share price falls, along with the market, so far this year.

                "body":"<p>Along the King Fahd highway in downtown Riyadh, signs of the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s wealth glitter and dazzle. Monuments include the massive Kingdom Centre \u00e2\u20ac\u201c instantly recognisable by the giant bottle-opener feature formed by its two wings \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and the beautiful and futuristic Faisaliyah building. New ones are still rising, like the King Abdullah financial district, still under construction: a reminder of the fat years of high oil revenues under the previous monarch.</p> <p>On nearby Tahliya Street, lined with young Saudi men watching black-robed, headscarfed women saunter past, crowds throng into American-style shopping malls flaunting the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s priciest and most luxurious brands.</p> <p>Saudi wealth \u00e2\u20ac\u201c whether in downtown Riyadh or Knightsbridge \u00e2\u20ac\u201c is highly conspicuous. And they have the colossal Saudi Aramco oil corporation to thank for it.</p> <p>Locals were stunned by the sudden news of the possible sale of part of the company that has been synonymous with their country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s history almost since its foundation. Uncertainty about exactly what it would mean has not been laid to rest by the cautious statement confirming the impending plan to float the business later issued from Aramco\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s headquarters in the eastern province of Dammam.</p> <p>There was also concern that news of the momentous decision was first aired in an interview given by the powerful deputy crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, to foreign media. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Aramco is our spine and they suddenly announce this!\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd exclaimed Professor Fawziah al-Bakr, an education expert and women\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s activist.</p> <p>Aramco\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s history is the story of the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153discovery and development of the greatest energy reserves the world has ever known and the rapid transformation of Saudi Arabia from desert kingdom to modern nation state,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd the company says. Its pledge has always been to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153maximise the value of the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s petroleum reserves for the benefit of the kingdom\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s citizens\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Exactly how that will be done if foreign investors can buy shares is a troubling and unanswered question, say critics.</p> <p>But a 75% plunge in global crude prices over the last 18 months to $30 per barrel \u00e2\u20ac\u201c caused by a downturn in demand and a supply glut that Saudi Arabia and fellow Opec members have refused to address in their determination to drive US fracking rivals out of business \u00e2\u20ac\u201c has caused financial pain to producing nations around the world, who had grown used to funding pretty much their entire economies and social programmes on black gold.</p> <p>The Saudi budget deficit rocketed last year to 15% of gross domestic product and more than $100bn of the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s $650bn of foreign reserves has already been used to fill up gaps left by depleted oil revenues.</p> <p>The 2016 income and expenditure plan has involved a huge rise in the price of petrol, electricity and water along with a pledge to introduce a value added tax of 5%, together with tariffs on sugary drinks and tobacco.</p> <p>The 60% increase in petrol prices \u00e2\u20ac\u201c to 16p a litre \u00e2\u20ac\u201c has shocked many Saudis but not all motorists. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Yes, the cost of petrol has gone up,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said a Bangladeshi taxi driver stuck on King Fahd highway. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153But it is still probably the cheapest in the world.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd</p> <p>Mohammed, a Saudi government official, was more worried about future rises than this one. But the increase has triggered alarm, with some car owners rushing out the night before it took effect to fill their tanks and save the equivalent of a few pennies.</p> <p>At least Saudis, who live in an autocratic state where free education and other social benefits have effectively been traded by unspoken compact for political freedom, are not alone. Last week, the neighbouring Gulf state of Bahrain, just off the coast of Saudi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s eastern province, also raised the price of fuel by 60% \u00e2\u20ac\u201c for the first time in 33 years. Oman had already done the same.</p> <p>The possible selloff of at least part of Aramco, previously considered the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s crown jewel, has stunned the global energy and investment sectors as much as locals.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"3fc838a2e2441346358ca22e8071becaa0badf13\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3fc838a2e2441346358ca22e8071becaa0badf13/278_0_5648_3391/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sunset over Riyadh, with the evening light reflecting off the Kingdom Centre.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sunset over Riyadh, with the evening light reflecting off the Kingdom Centre.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Kirkland/Design Pics/Corbis</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>One Wall Street report claimed an American financial adviser was forced to stop his car because he was laughing so much from sheer incredulity when the Aramco float news broke. But plans for an initial public offering by what may be most secretive \u00e2\u20ac\u201c but almost certainly the most valuable \u00e2\u20ac\u201c company in the world have been confirmed by its chairman, Khalid al-Falih.</p> <p>\u00e2\u20ac\u0153We are considering \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 a listing of the main company and obviously the main company will include upstream,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said last week, thereby indicating that the flotation plan could give access to the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 260bn barrels of oil reserves and 263 trillion cubic feet of gas.</p> <p>Among the more than 100 oil and gas fields controlled by Aramco \u00e2\u20ac\u201c which began life as the California-Arabian Standard Oil Company in 1933 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c are Ghawar, the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest onshore oil location, plus Safaniya, the biggest offshore field in the world.</p> <p>The scale of the Aramco empire dwarfs every other corporation in the world. Its oil assets alone are 10 times more than those held by the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest publicly quoted oil company, ExxonMobil. If the Texas-based business has a stock market value of $400bn, that would make Aramco\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s oil assets potentially worth $4tn (\u00c2\u00a32.7tn).</p> <p>Energy analysts admit they find it impossible to accurately calculate the exact worth of a company that boasts of producing 9.5m barrels of oil a day \u00e2\u20ac\u201c one in every eight of the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s production. But some estimates go as high as $10tn. That is 10 times the combined value of Apple and Alphabet (the new parent company of Google).</p> <p>They know Aramco has huge oil and gas reserves, a raft of refineries and other business interests, but details are scant. The company does not publish its accounts or even its revenues, never mind its profits.</p> <p>What is known about Aramco by anyone outside the company tends to come from bland information provided by its official websites or an annual review of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153facts and figures\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the last one covering 2014.</p> <p>You will find no mention of the flotation proposal on its website. The latest bit of news concerns what appears to be a low-key joint venture with a German chemical company called Lanxess. There is no date given for when it was announced, nor who to contact should one require more information.</p> <p>A plan to float even a relatively small slice of the business would change all that. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153You cannot take public funds (foreign investment) without sufficient operating and financial results being made available,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd says Fadel Gheit, a veteran oil analyst with the Oppenheimer brokerage in New York.</p> <p>\u00e2\u20ac\u0153And you would not choose to float a company when commodity prices are so low. But the Saudis are clearly in need of money and part of it is their own fault. They ignored plenty of warnings that US shale production was on its way into the market. It is too late to stop that now.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd</p> <p>What Aramco\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s annual review does say is that the company \u00e2\u20ac\u201c alongside its mountainous oil and gas reserves \u00e2\u20ac\u201c controls more than 3m barrels a day of refining capacity, both inside Saudi and abroad.</p> <p>There are some joint refining ventures with foreign oil companies inside the Middle Eastern kingdom, such as the Saudi Aramco Shell Refinery Company, which operates a plant in Yanbu on the north-west Saudi coast with Royal Dutch Shell.</p> <p>There are similar local refining partnerships with Exxon, Total of France and Sinopec of China, while Shell has the most substantial joint venture with Aramco outside Saudi in its Motiva Enterprises operation in the US.</p> <p>More recently there have been moves to establish chemical plants at refineries through tie-ups with the likes of Dow Chemical of the US and Sumitomo Chemical of Japan. The American firm has a joint venture, Sadara, building a facility at Jubail while the Japanese are involved in a joint venture at the Petro Rabigh plant on the Red Sea.</p> <p>In addition there are oil exploration agreements inside Saudi with Shell and for gas development with Russia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Lukoil, Sinopec and a consortium of Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ENI and Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Repsol. Industry experts say these deals give very little real access to rich resources and have produced little of benefit to the foreign companies so far.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"694a99b38931fcec12f483f9c408ab3a8a270157\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/694a99b38931fcec12f483f9c408ab3a8a270157/0_82_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Deputy crown prince Mohammed bin Salman\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Deputy crown prince Mohammed bin Salman announced news of the float in an interview.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Charles Platiau/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Aramco until recently owned a fleet of very large tankers to ship oil abroad through a separate subsidiary it established, called Vela International Marine. But the business \u00e2\u20ac\u201c one of the biggest of its kind in the world and which still handles much of Saudi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s oil exports \u00e2\u20ac\u201c was recently transferred to the ownership to the Saudi national shipping company.</p> <p>Aramco continues to keep a network of international offices in locations such as Paris, the Hague and London. It also keeps a research base in Aberdeen, centre of UK North Sea activity.</p> <p>The assumed wisdom about Aramco is that it is relatively well run but is used as a personal piggy bank by the ruling family as well as an income to fund government social and other policies. There are question marks over why the company is reported to be running four Boeing 747s and four other jets as well as a number of football stadiums around the country.</p> <p>Aramco\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s crude is especially attractive because it almost gushes out of the ground with barely the prod of a stick.

What impact would such a fall have on North Sea companies, the consumer and the economy?</strong></p> <p><strong>OIL INDUSTRY</strong><br>Up to 65,000 jobs have already been lost from the British offshore oil industry since the cost of crude fell from a peak of $115 per barrel in June 2014 to its latest level of $30. A further decline to $10 would clearly turn a cull into a massacre, not least because the North Sea is a high-cost place to operate, with the break-even price for many fields around $60.</p> <p>Just last week BP unveiled plans to axe a further 4,000 jobs \u00e2\u20ac\u201c most over the next 12 months \u00e2\u20ac\u201c with 600 of them in Aberdeen. Shell has promised to cut 2,800 if, as expected, its merger with BG goes through in the next few weeks.</p> <p>Around the world, 68 oil projects with a combined investment cost of $380bn have been dumped over the last year, according to Edinburgh-based global oil consultancy Wood Mackenzie.</p> <p>Thirty-seven north American oil and gas producers have filed for bankruptcy, says Texas-based law firm Haynes and Boone, while analysts have warned half of US shale drillers could be out of business if the slump continues.</p> <p>Dividend payments from Shell and others could be slashed if oil skids further and a major new round of takeovers would almost certainly begin. Sub-$10 oil in the late 1980s led to BP buying rival Amoco for $42bn and a series of other mega-mergers as companies sought to bulk up while cutting jobs and offices.</p> <p><strong>CONSUMERS</strong><br>Motorists have already benefited from lower petrol prices, which are now below \u00c2\u00a31 a litre in some places \u00e2\u20ac\u201c but they still do not reflect the true cost of supplies, and $10 oil would bring more benefits.</p> <p>The last time that price was reached \u00e2\u20ac\u201c during the height of the Asian financial crisis in 1998 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c petrol prices fell to around 86p per litre. Oil companies argue that the vast majority of the petrol price is made up of taxes but a further collapse in crude values would produce a glut of cheap refined products and pressure to pass on cuts.</p> <p>Many international gas contracts are also tied to oil prices, and wholesale prices have fallen by at least 30% over the last 18&#xa0;months. These lower costs have not been fully passed onto householders. Energy regulator Ofgem said on Friday that the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153big six\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd UK suppliers are overcharging \u00e2\u20ac\u0153for the vast majority of people\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd.</p> <p>Despite the growth in wind and solar for providing electricity, gas is still the key fuel for energy generation, whether in the home or the power station. Even without lower crude prices, there have been growing expectations that power prices will at least remain flat from now until the end of the decade.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"dece2722fa077a3475d485559d824cc50aea9c17\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/dece2722fa077a3475d485559d824cc50aea9c17/0_135_4820_2893/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Petrol station sign with price at 99.7p\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Petrol prices have dropped below \u00c2\u00a31 per litre in some locations.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Paul Ellis/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>THE ECONOMY</strong><br>A fall in the oil price is the same as a tax cut for consumers.

                "bodyText":"Along the King Fahd highway in downtown Riyadh, signs of the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s wealth glitter and dazzle. Monuments include the massive Kingdom Centre \u00e2\u20ac\u201c instantly recognisable by the giant bottle-opener feature formed by its two wings \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and the beautiful and futuristic Faisaliyah building. New ones are still rising, like the King Abdullah financial district, still under construction: a reminder of the fat years of high oil revenues under the previous monarch. On nearby Tahliya Street, lined with young Saudi men watching black-robed, headscarfed women saunter past, crowds throng into American-style shopping malls flaunting the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s priciest and most luxurious brands. Saudi wealth \u00e2\u20ac\u201c whether in downtown Riyadh or Knightsbridge \u00e2\u20ac\u201c is highly conspicuous. And they have the colossal Saudi Aramco oil corporation to thank for it. Locals were stunned by the sudden news of the possible sale of part of the company that has been synonymous with their country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s history almost since its foundation. Uncertainty about exactly what it would mean has not been laid to rest by the cautious statement confirming the impending plan to float the business later issued from Aramco\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s headquarters in the eastern province of Dammam. There was also concern that news of the momentous decision was first aired in an interview given by the powerful deputy crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, to foreign media. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Aramco is our spine and they suddenly announce this!\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd exclaimed Professor Fawziah al-Bakr, an education expert and women\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s activist. Aramco\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s history is the story of the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153discovery and development of the greatest energy reserves the world has ever known and the rapid transformation of Saudi Arabia from desert kingdom to modern nation state,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd the company says. Its pledge has always been to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153maximise the value of the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s petroleum reserves for the benefit of the kingdom\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s citizens\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Exactly how that will be done if foreign investors can buy shares is a troubling and unanswered question, say critics. But a 75% plunge in global crude prices over the last 18 months to $30 per barrel \u00e2\u20ac\u201c caused by a downturn in demand and a supply glut that Saudi Arabia and fellow Opec members have refused to address in their determination to drive US fracking rivals out of business \u00e2\u20ac\u201c has caused financial pain to producing nations around the world, who had grown used to funding pretty much their entire economies and social programmes on black gold. The Saudi budget deficit rocketed last year to 15% of gross domestic product and more than $100bn of the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s $650bn of foreign reserves has already been used to fill up gaps left by depleted oil revenues. The 2016 income and expenditure plan has involved a huge rise in the price of petrol, electricity and water along with a pledge to introduce a value added tax of 5%, together with tariffs on sugary drinks and tobacco. The 60% increase in petrol prices \u00e2\u20ac\u201c to 16p a litre \u00e2\u20ac\u201c has shocked many Saudis but not all motorists. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Yes, the cost of petrol has gone up,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said a Bangladeshi taxi driver stuck on King Fahd highway. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153But it is still probably the cheapest in the world.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Mohammed, a Saudi government official, was more worried about future rises than this one. But the increase has triggered alarm, with some car owners rushing out the night before it took effect to fill their tanks and save the equivalent of a few pennies. At least Saudis, who live in an autocratic state where free education and other social benefits have effectively been traded by unspoken compact for political freedom, are not alone. Last week, the neighbouring Gulf state of Bahrain, just off the coast of Saudi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s eastern province, also raised the price of fuel by 60% \u00e2\u20ac\u201c for the first time in 33 years. Oman had already done the same. The possible selloff of at least part of Aramco, previously considered the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s crown jewel, has stunned the global energy and investment sectors as much as locals. One Wall Street report claimed an American financial adviser was forced to stop his car because he was laughing so much from sheer incredulity when the Aramco float news broke. But plans for an initial public offering by what may be most secretive \u00e2\u20ac\u201c but almost certainly the most valuable \u00e2\u20ac\u201c company in the world have been confirmed by its chairman, Khalid al-Falih. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We are considering \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 a listing of the main company and obviously the main company will include upstream,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said last week, thereby indicating that the flotation plan could give access to the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 260bn barrels of oil reserves and 263 trillion cubic feet of gas. Among the more than 100 oil and gas fields controlled by Aramco \u00e2\u20ac\u201c which began life as the California-Arabian Standard Oil Company in 1933 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c are Ghawar, the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest onshore oil location, plus Safaniya, the biggest offshore field in the world. The scale of the Aramco empire dwarfs every other corporation in the world. Its oil assets alone are 10 times more than those held by the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest publicly quoted oil company, ExxonMobil. If the Texas-based business has a stock market value of $400bn, that would make Aramco\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s oil assets potentially worth $4tn (\u00c2\u00a32.7tn). Energy analysts admit they find it impossible to accurately calculate the exact worth of a company that boasts of producing 9.5m barrels of oil a day \u00e2\u20ac\u201c one in every eight of the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s production. But some estimates go as high as $10tn. That is 10 times the combined value of Apple and Alphabet (the new parent company of Google). They know Aramco has huge oil and gas reserves, a raft of refineries and other business interests, but details are scant. The company does not publish its accounts or even its revenues, never mind its profits. What is known about Aramco by anyone outside the company tends to come from bland information provided by its official websites or an annual review of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153facts and figures\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the last one covering 2014. You will find no mention of the flotation proposal on its website. The latest bit of news concerns what appears to be a low-key joint venture with a German chemical company called Lanxess. There is no date given for when it was announced, nor who to contact should one require more information. A plan to float even a relatively small slice of the business would change all that. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153You cannot take public funds (foreign investment) without sufficient operating and financial results being made available,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd says Fadel Gheit, a veteran oil analyst with the Oppenheimer brokerage in New York. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153And you would not choose to float a company when commodity prices are so low. But the Saudis are clearly in need of money and part of it is their own fault. They ignored plenty of warnings that US shale production was on its way into the market. It is too late to stop that now.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd What Aramco\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s annual review does say is that the company \u00e2\u20ac\u201c alongside its mountainous oil and gas reserves \u00e2\u20ac\u201c controls more than 3m barrels a day of refining capacity, both inside Saudi and abroad. There are some joint refining ventures with foreign oil companies inside the Middle Eastern kingdom, such as the Saudi Aramco Shell Refinery Company, which operates a plant in Yanbu on the north-west Saudi coast with Royal Dutch Shell. There are similar local refining partnerships with Exxon, Total of France and Sinopec of China, while Shell has the most substantial joint venture with Aramco outside Saudi in its Motiva Enterprises operation in the US. More recently there have been moves to establish chemical plants at refineries through tie-ups with the likes of Dow Chemical of the US and Sumitomo Chemical of Japan. The American firm has a joint venture, Sadara, building a facility at Jubail while the Japanese are involved in a joint venture at the Petro Rabigh plant on the Red Sea. In addition there are oil exploration agreements inside Saudi with Shell and for gas development with Russia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Lukoil, Sinopec and a consortium of Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ENI and Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Repsol. Industry experts say these deals give very little real access to rich resources and have produced little of benefit to the foreign companies so far. Aramco until recently owned a fleet of very large tankers to ship oil abroad through a separate subsidiary it established, called Vela International Marine. But the business \u00e2\u20ac\u201c one of the biggest of its kind in the world and which still handles much of Saudi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s oil exports \u00e2\u20ac\u201c was recently transferred to the ownership to the Saudi national shipping company. Aramco continues to keep a network of international offices in locations such as Paris, the Hague and London. It also keeps a research base in Aberdeen, centre of UK North Sea activity. The assumed wisdom about Aramco is that it is relatively well run but is used as a personal piggy bank by the ruling family as well as an income to fund government social and other policies. There are question marks over why the company is reported to be running four Boeing 747s and four other jets as well as a number of football stadiums around the country. Aramco\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s crude is especially attractive because it almost gushes out of the ground with barely the prod of a stick. Operating costs of $12 per barrel make it the cheapest in the world after Kuwait and five times cheaper than the UK North Sea. Shell, Total and Sinopec would almost certainly look at taking a stake in any Aramco IPO for strategic reasons, but whether sovereign wealth funds or big western pension funds would queue for a stake is less certain at a time of low crude prices. Gheit thinks they might, but traditional institutional investors would need to see audited financial information and know they would be able to pursue legal remedies in the event of a dispute. Any float will ultimately come down to price and (royal) pride. But in the meantime expect to see western investment bankers, lawyers and PRs \u00e2\u20ac\u201c who want a slice of what will be very lucrative advisory work in the run-up to any IPO \u00e2\u20ac\u201c joining the queue on King Fahd highway. THE COST OF FALLING PRICES Standard Chartered last week issued the most gloomy forecast yet on the future price of oil: $10 a barrel. What impact would such a fall have on North Sea companies, the consumer and the economy? OIL INDUSTRY Up to 65,000 jobs have already been lost from the British offshore oil industry since the cost of crude fell from a peak of $115 per barrel in June 2014 to its latest level of $30. A further decline to $10 would clearly turn a cull into a massacre, not least because the North Sea is a high-cost place to operate, with the break-even price for many fields around $60. Just last week BP unveiled plans to axe a further 4,000 jobs \u00e2\u20ac\u201c most over the next 12 months \u00e2\u20ac\u201c with 600 of them in Aberdeen. Shell has promised to cut 2,800 if, as expected, its merger with BG goes through in the next few weeks. Around the world, 68 oil projects with a combined investment cost of $380bn have been dumped over the last year, according to Edinburgh-based global oil consultancy Wood Mackenzie. Thirty-seven north American oil and gas producers have filed for bankruptcy, says Texas-based law firm Haynes and Boone, while analysts have warned half of US shale drillers could be out of business if the slump continues. Dividend payments from Shell and others could be slashed if oil skids further and a major new round of takeovers would almost certainly begin. Sub-$10 oil in the late 1980s led to BP buying rival Amoco for $42bn and a series of other mega-mergers as companies sought to bulk up while cutting jobs and offices. CONSUMERS Motorists have already benefited from lower petrol prices, which are now below \u00c2\u00a31 a litre in some places \u00e2\u20ac\u201c but they still do not reflect the true cost of supplies, and $10 oil would bring more benefits. The last time that price was reached \u00e2\u20ac\u201c during the height of the Asian financial crisis in 1998 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c petrol prices fell to around 86p per litre.

THE ECONOMY A fall in the oil price is the same as a tax cut for consumers. It means they have more to spend on other goods and services, though there is some evidence that UK car owners are spending some of their windfall on extra petrol as they increase the miles they drive. A slump to in the oil price to $10 will not mean a big fall in pump prices because of the tax levied - but businesses will get a big lift from cheaper oil products. It cuts the cost of transport and there are also benefits from cheaper plastics, fertilisers and synthetic fabrics. The downward pressure on inflation will persuade the Bank of England to keep interest rates lower for longer. That is bad news for savers, but good for mortgage payers and high-street spending. The government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hope will be that consumers spend more on goods and services produced by UK businesses, boosting growth.

Meanwhile the core rate of inflation (excluding food and fuel) rose 1.4% year on year versus a consensus forecast of 1.2%. This was also the highest inflation rate since January last year.</p> <p>The details show air fares contributed positively (up 26.8% year on year! Sea fares were up 20.3%) \u00e2\u20ac\u201c note that the transportation component was the only one of 12 CPI sub components to actually increase. It showed transport prices swinging from -2.1% year on year to -0.2%. However, food prices saw intensifying deflation, as did clothing, furniture, recreation and culture. Therefore, today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pick-up in inflation (particularly core) can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t really be viewed as suggesting the story regarding inflation has changed much. After all, transportation prices will fall back again next month given what has happened to fuel costs.<br></p> <p>Given that inflation remains so soft and with tomorrow\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s UK labour report set to show a further slowing in the pace of wage growth, the Bank of England is under no pressure to respond. Moreover, the Brexit uncertainty poses clear risks for growth, particularly through the investment and hiring channels, which will more than offset concerns about inflation risks from sterling\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s recent falls. As such we see little prospect of BoE action ahead of the EU referendum, which seems set for June/July. We continue to have November as the probable start point for UK rate hikes, assuming the UK votes to remain an EU member state.<br></p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-569e0841e4b03e04102e173d\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-01-19T09:57:57.006Z\">9.57am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"bbf656ba8ba91f2cfe7b7818b541ca1f2e852f89\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bbf656ba8ba91f2cfe7b7818b541ca1f2e852f89/0_0_746_527/500.jpg\" alt=\"UK inflation contribution\" width=\"500\" height=\"353\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">UK inflation contribution</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Office for National Statistics</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-569e0788e4b06544a9da911f\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-01-19T09:55:06.043Z\">9.55am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The pound has moved to its day\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s highs against the dollar and euro, as the UK inflation figures came in higher than expected.</p> <p>Sterling touched $1.4340, up from $1.4320 before the data, while against the euro it strengthened from 76p to 75.82p.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-569e06ffe4b0cdd2b1e0ce2f\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-01-19T09:53:00.115Z\">9.53am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/FOREXcom/statuses/689380128820838400\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Other measures of UK inflation were also stronger than expected with RPI rising 1.2% vs. 1.0% expected and HPI +7.7% vs. 7.3% y/y <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/FX?src=hash\">#FX</a> ^FR</p>&mdash;

                "bodyText":"PS: If you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d like to learn more about Mark Pollock, please start here: And that is all from us for tonight. Back in the morning. GW Davos isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t just about greedy bankers and scheming politicians. Tonight, the press pack are hearing from Mark Pollock, who became the first blind man to reach the South Pole in 2009. The next year, he fell from a second floor window, broke his back, and is paralysed. He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s currently explaining how he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been working with pioneering doctors who are working on spinal cord injuries and seeking a cure for paralysis. Impossible? Not if you listen to Pollock, whose resolve and optimism is quite, quite gripping. He believes a cure is possible, saying: The next big step for mankind is to take the first step after paralysis. And he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shown us videos of how he has worked with scientists to get his own body working again (we just saw him bend his left leg, thanks to an array of wiring). Pollock\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s message is that, in the 4th industrial revolution, biotechnology and genetic engineering could help a new wave of pioneers to redefine what it means to be human (I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m paraphrasing him). Google him, please, and find out more about what he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s doing. It sounds pretty important. An intriguing theme has emerged around this year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Davos - the Falklands Islands. Argentina\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new president, Mauricio Macri, has declared that he wants to rebuild his country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s relationship with the UK, more than thirty years after the Falklands War. Macri is going to meet with David Cameron at Davos; we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be poised for that. The awards ceremony is over, and delegates are fanning out across the Congress Centre, and beyond, ready for tomorrow\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s action. DiCaprio announces that his foundation is making a new \u00c2\u00a315m donation to help protect fragile ecosystems. This includes rainforests in Sumatro, and protecting other rainforsts from the palm oil industry. And finally, Leonardo DiCaprio is picking up a Crystal Award for his work on environmental issues and climate change. The Hollywood actor tells delegates at Davos thatworld leaders took an important first step in Paris with their agreement to reduce carbon emissions. But there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s much more to do. The Paris agreement was a call to action, but it falls to all of us to help fight against the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153irreversible damage\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd that climate change will cause. We simply cannot afford the greed of the oil industry to determine the future of humanity. Enough is enough, you know better, the world knows better. History will put the blame for this devastation firmly at their feet. And DiCaprio insists that fossil fuel reserves must be left where they are. Climate change cannot be stopped unless fossil fuels are left in the ground. The next Crystal award goes to Chinese actor Yao Chen. She\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s known as the Queen of Weibo, with 78 million followers on the social media site (there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s an audible gasp in the audience). Chen is being recognised for her work raising awareness of the refugee crisis, visiting migrant communities in countries such as Philippines, Thailand, Ethiopia, Lebanon and Pakistan. Chen thanks aid organisations, the UN, and her husband for his support, and talks about how helping other people is important; it helps to meet the needs of the helper too. America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s poorest communities could be changed forever if they could spawn the next technology giant, will.i.am continues. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the long-term goal of his foundation. Hilde Schwab, who co-founded WEF with her husband Klaus, has the floor in Davos. She\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s announcing the winners of the Crystal Awards - WEF\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s annual prizes for people who have gone the extra mile to make the world better (no, they don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t give them to Wall Street bankers) This year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s winners are actors Yao Chen and Leonardo DiCaprio, artist Olafur Eliasson, and musician and entrepreneur will.i.am. Hilde explains that Eliasson has helped create and strengthen communities by building large-scale installations and designs. Next comes Will.i.am (of the Black Eyed Peas, younger readers) is being recognised for his work bringing educational opportunist to the underpriviliged. His I am Angel foundation has helped keep young people in education and out of Will.i.am is now on stage, joking that he grew up near gangs in the ghettos of America but he was more scared of his mother than the gangs so he kept out. But turning serious, he says he wants kids to aspire to be the next Steve Jobs, the next Bill Gates, and fix the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s problems rather than waiting for governments to do it for them. One of Davos\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s many curious traditions is a habit of ringing cowbells when a keynote session is about to start. And that ding-ding noise in the distance means the opening ceremony is getting underway. Back at the cancer moonshot talk, Joe Biden has called on the public to do their bit to help tackle the illness. It won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be easy, or cheap. As well as warning about the impact of automation, Axel Weber, chairman of UBS, is discussing today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s latest downgrade of global growth forecasts by the IMF. It was like groundhog day, he say, as the IMF had downgraded its forecasts nine times. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a sign we have moved to a lower growth economy.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Weber adds that the problem isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t so much cyclical as structural. The low growth, low inflation and low interest environment was likely to remain, he said. UBS chairman Axel Weber says politicians need to address the rising inequality that the robot revolution will cause: Jill is tweeting the details: While Biden was demanding more progress on cancer, Swiss bank UBS has been presenting a new report into the fourth industrial revolution. And you may be unsurprised to hear that UBS reckons the richest will benefit most from new technologies such as robots, AI, 3D printing, and all those cutting-edge systems. Why? Because firms will be able to use robots to squeeze out low-paid workers, boosting their profit margins at the expense of the poorest. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the story, by Jill Treanor: Joe Biden is now challenging the experts on the panel, who includes top cancer researchers from the US and beyond, to share their data better. Big data, he insists, is the key to this moonshot. What would happen if I asked all of you who have data..... to get together in one room. Could that make sense, to talk to each other?... No-one dares to object. Well, in that case I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m going to do it, Biden grins. Not for the cameras, but for my own knowledge, and to make faster progress. Some reaction to Joe Biden\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s words: Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s another photo from the cancer moonshot talk: Data is absolutely crucial to Joe Biden\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s cancer moonshot: When Joe Biden talks about a cancer moonshot, he is harking back to the Apollo landings, and John F Kennedy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s declaration that America would put a man on the moon before the end of the 1960s. This battle is different, though, partly because Biden doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think the Federal government can do all the work. Part of our role is to get out of the way, so the real experts can make the progress we need, the vice-president tells his audience at Davos. But we will also do everything we can at the federal level to help. Cancer has touched nearly all of us in some way, Joe Biden points out - few families have avoided experiencing it. And every year, 14 billion people are diagnosed with cancer, 8 million die from it. That total, of course, includes Beau Biden, the vice-president\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s son who died of brain cancer last year. Hello from Davos, where this year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s World Economic Forum is getting underway. Not without a few hitches, though. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bumper-to-bumper traffic out there, as business leaders, politicians, policy advocates and the media make the annual trek to WEF. And even the vice-president of the United States, Joe Biden, got caught in the jam; it made him around 30 minutes late for a meeting with top scientists to push for a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcmoonshot\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 to find a cure for cancer. The vice-president apologises profusely and charmingly - but he doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t need to; everyone here knows how Davos is a logistical nightmare this time of year. And his mission is so important that it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s well worth waiting a few minutes.....\u00ef\u0153\ufffd And then it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s down to business, with Biden explaining why he believes the world can make huge progress in the next few years. President Obama and I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want small change, he insists - we want a Quantum Leap. Biden says: We are at an inflection point - a lot has been achieved in the last decade or less. We have seen amazing advances in science, immunology. Genomics is being leveraged in ways that weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t possible even six years ago. VP Biden adds that it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s vital to ensure that researchers have access to all the data available, as every cancer centre keeps a record of its own data. Tapping this treasure trove is vital to speeding the process towards finding a cure for cancer. The session is being streamed here. On a busy day and ahead of the start of the Davos conference, here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a quick recap of events: Chinese GDP shows a slowdown.... ...but markets move higher on hopes for further central bank stimulus UK inflation hits an 11 month high ... but Bank of England governor Mark Carney rules out early rate rise ....which sends the pound sharply lower Meanwhile the IMF cuts its global growth forecasts The oil market could drown in oversupply says the International Energy Agency On that note, we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll close for the moment. But Graeme Wearden will be back later with the first reports from this year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Davos gathering. US markets have followed the example of Europe, and are moving sharply higher in early trading. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently 148 points or 0.9% higher, while the S&amp;P 500 has climbed around 1%. Chinese GDP figures prompted talk of further stimulus measures to support the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s second largest economy, while positive results from Bank of America and Morgan Stanley added to the upbeat mood. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a horrifying thought. There could be more plastic in the sea than fish in just over three decades. Ahead of Davos, Graeme Wearden reports: As a record-breaking yachtswoman, Dame Ellen MacArthur has seen more of the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s oceans than almost anyone else. Now she is warning that there will be more waste plastic in the sea than fish by 2050, unless the plastics industry cleans up its act. According to a new report issued by the Ellen MacArthur Foundation at the World Economic Forum on Tuesday, new plastics will consume 20% of all oil production within 35 years, up from an estimated 5% today. Plastics production has increased by twentytimes since 1964, reaching 311m tonnes in 2014, the equivalent of more than 900 Empire State Buildings, the report says, and it is expected to double again in the next 20 years, and almost quadruple by 2050. Despite this growing demand, just 5% of plastic goods are actually recycled effectively, while 40% end up in landfill and a third leak into fragile ecosystems such as the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s oceans. The full story is here: Mark Carney\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s caution on interest rates is justified, says our economics editor Larry Elliott: Mark Carney is half way through his five-year term as governor of the Bank of England. Judging by his latest remarks on the state of the economy he could go back to Canada in the summer of 2018 and still not have raised interest rates. The governor\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s speech was notable for its dovish tone. Six months ago, in a speech in Lincoln, he said the decision on whether to increase the cost of borrowing would come into sharper relief around the turn of the year. That was seen as an indication that a tightening of policy would be announced sooner rather than later. Well, the turn of the year has arrived, Carney has decided that the time is not yet ripe for a rate rise. Marching the markets up to the top of the interest rate hill only to march them down again has become a bit of a habit. For all that, the governor\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s caution is justified. Carney said a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153powerful set of forces\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd - some domestic, some global, some long-lasting, some cyclical - had combined to keep interest rates at their record low rates since the Great Recession ended in 2009. Read the full analysis here: On the pound\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decline today, David Lamb, head of dealing at the forex group Fexco, said: The prospect of a UK interest rate rise hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t been kicked into the long grass. The Governor hoofed it right out of the park. Mark Carney\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s prediction - made last summer - that we would have greater clarity on interest rates at the start of 2016 has been completely overtaken by events. Six months on, the prospects for UK interest rates remain as clear as mud. Even though UK inflation crept up a notch to a paltry 0.2% in December, tumbling oil prices will continue to drag down prices. Against a backdrop of extreme Chinese volatility and slipping rates of both growth and wages in the UK, none of the stars are aligned for a rate rise any time soon. With a UK rate hike now receding into the distance once again, monetary policy in London and Washington will continue to move in opposite directions. As a result the pound has tumbled against the dollar, and it is even slumping against the euro too. The combination of skittish equity markets and the vanishing prospect of a rate hike means investor appetite for sterling is eroding - and as a result the pound\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s gradual slide is likely to continue. And the pound is still falling: Answering questions, Carney said the Bank was picking up uncertainty around political events, but investment intentions remained robust. He also indicated that rates could rise before the consumer price index hit 2%: Spot in this chart of today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s movement of the pound against the dollar when Carney started speaking and suggesting now is not the time to raise rates: The governor of the Bank of England has warned that the UK faces \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a powerful set of forces\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd preventing policymakers from raising interest rates and the date of the first rise is still uncertain, writes Phillip Inman. Mark Carney said the plunge in oil prices had dragged down inflation and postponed the date of a rise from the current 0.5%, though he refused to indicate when the central bank would make its first move. Carney said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Monetary policy will continue to depend on economic prospects and not the calender.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd But his gloomy outlook, which also highlighted the rapid slowdown in China and the recent turmoil in global markets, is likely to be seen as delaying the first increase in rates since 2008 until at least the end of this year or possibly 2017. This will force many of the City\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s investment banks to tear up their own forecasts, which have pencilled in a rise in the summer or Autumn. Bank of England governor Mark Carney wants to see faster growth and stronger inflation before raising interest rates, with no set timetable for an increase. In a speech at the Queen Mary University of London, he said global and domestic growth had proved weaker than he expected in the middle of last year, when he predicted a decision on rates would come into sharper relief by early 2016. He said: Well the year has turned, and, in my view, the decision proved straightforward: now is not yet the time to raise interest rates. This wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t a surprise to market participants or the wider public. They observed the renewed collapse in oil prices, the volatility in China, and the moderation in growth and wages here at home since the summer and rightly concluded that not enough cumulative progress had been made to warrant tightening monetary policy. You can follow his speech live here. And now oil is back over $30 a barrel, despite the International Energy Agency warning of continuing oversupply. Brent crude has jumped 5.7% to $30.18, helped by strong oil demand from China. There is also the hope of more stimulus from the Chinese authorities following the latest GDP figures, which showed a slowdown in growth. Stock markets continue to move higher following the Chinese GDP data, and despite higher than expected UK inflation and the IMF cutting its global growth forecasts. The FTSE 100 is currently up nearly 1.9%, while Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax is 2% higher and France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac has climbed 2.3%. In the US the futures are showing a 250 rise on the Dow Jones Industrial Average. As a reminder the US markets were closed on Monday, and fell sharply in the previous session on the tumbling oil price. Crude is now up 4.7% at $29.9 a barrel. And here are the IMF comments on markets and China, courtesy of Reuters: Global financial markets seem to be overreacting to falling oil prices and China, the chief economist of the International Monetary Fund said on Tuesday. Maurice Obstfeld also said it was critical that China is clear about its overall policy strategy, including its currency. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not a stretch to suggest that (markets) may be reacting very strongly to rather small bits of evidence in an environment of volatility and risk aversion,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Obstfeld said in a news conference held after the IMF cut its global growth forecasts for the third time in less than a year. The IMF has commented on the prospect of Britain leaving the EU: Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the UK Treasury welcoming the day\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s inflation figures: The IMF is giving more details of its global outlook. Its chief economist Maurice Obstfeld said there were clearly deflationary pressures in the eurozone, and he expected the European Central Bank to ease further as further data comes in. He added that the US recovery appeared to be weaker than the Federal Reserve was expected when it raised interest rates in December. And he played down the recent market turmoil: He said the IMF did not see some of the extreme negative scenarios that the markets seemed to be anticipating. He added that a falling oil price would help consumers, so it was not an unmitigated negative. UK house prices are at a 10 month high, according to the Office for National Statistics: Meanwhile the ZEW confidence index showed a downbeat mood among German analysts and investors in the wake of the recent market turmoil. With any slowdown in China likely to knock the German export market, the ZEW think tank said economic sentiment fell from 16.1 in December to 10.2 in January. But this was higher than a Reuters estimate of 8.2. In the eurozone, inflation has come in at 0.2% year on year in December, in line with expectations. The month on month figure was flat. November\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s year on year figure was revised down from 0.2% to 0.1%. That is a long was short of the European Central Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 2% target despite the stimulus package the central bank has instituted. Dennis de Jong, managing director at UFX.com, said: Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s inflation figures suggest that ECB President Mario Draghi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s renewed stimulus plan isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t yet having the desired effect, and the two per cent target is still a long way off. Record low oil prices, alongside volatility in China and elsewhere, have taken their toll on major economies the world over and the Eurozone is no different. With a stimulus programme in effect and no real room to manoeuvre interest rates further, Draghi is running out of options. Draghi must hope that any extra cash in the pockets of consumers due to low oil prices goes straight back into the economy to spur growth. Back with UK inflation, and Howard Archer at IHS Global Insight expects a UK rate rise in August: With consumer price inflation still only 0.2% in December, there is certainly little immediate pressure on the Bank of England to start raising interest rates. We believe it is pretty unlikely that the Bank of England will raise interest rates (from 0.50% to 0.75%) until at least August \u00e2\u20ac\u201c given the increased probability that inflation will stay lower for longer and a current more uncertain growth outlook. Indeed, there is a very real chance that the Bank of England could delay raising interest rates until the fourth quarter of 2016. Our current belief that the Bank of England will most likely edge interest rates up from 0.50% to 0.75% in August is based on the assumption that economic growth will be reasonable over the first half of 2016, earnings growth sees some renewed pick-up amid a tightening labour market and consumer price inflation trends gradually up. Even if the Bank of England does delay interest rates beyond August, we doubt it will delay acting until 2017 - barring a major slowdown in UK growth. The International Monetary Fund has reduced its growth forecasts in its latest update on the global economy. Our economics editor Larry Elliott reports: [The IMF] has added to concerns about the health of the global economy by cutting its growth forecasts for the next two years and warning that recovery from the financial crisis could be derailed altogether if key challenges are mishandled. The Washington-based body said world output would be 0.2 points lower in 2016 and 2017 compared with forecasts made just three months ago \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and that the risks to its predictions were to the downside. In an update to its World Economic Outlook, the IMF said growth was put at 3.4% this year and 3.6% in 2017. It said central banks should continue to boost growth and that finance ministries should bolster investment spending where possible. It also warned that a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153tide of refugees\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd was putting the EU under strain and that action was needed to ensure that migrants could find jobs. Full story here: The inflation figures, along higher than expected, should not put pressure on the Bank of England to raise rates, said James Knightley at ING Bank: December UK headline consumer price inflation has come in at 0.2% year on year, up from 0.1% in November and is the fastest rate of price increase since January 2015. Meanwhile the core rate of inflation (excluding food and fuel) rose 1.4% year on year versus a consensus forecast of 1.2%. This was also the highest inflation rate since January last year. The details show air fares contributed positively (up 26.8% year on year! Sea fares were up 20.3%) \u00e2\u20ac\u201c note that the transportation component was the only one of 12 CPI sub components to actually increase. It showed transport prices swinging from -2.1% year on year to -0.2%. However, food prices saw intensifying deflation, as did clothing, furniture, recreation and culture. Therefore, today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pick-up in inflation (particularly core) can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t really be viewed as suggesting the story regarding inflation has changed much. After all, transportation prices will fall back again next month given what has happened to fuel costs. Given that inflation remains so soft and with tomorrow\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s UK labour report set to show a further slowing in the pace of wage growth, the Bank of England is under no pressure to respond. Moreover, the Brexit uncertainty poses clear risks for growth, particularly through the investment and hiring channels, which will more than offset concerns about inflation risks from sterling\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s recent falls. As such we see little prospect of BoE action ahead of the EU referendum, which seems set for June/July. We continue to have November as the probable start point for UK rate hikes, assuming the UK votes to remain an EU member state. The pound has moved to its day\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s highs against the dollar and euro, as the UK inflation figures came in higher than expected. Sterling touched $1.4340, up from $1.4320 before the data, while against the euro it strengthened from 76p to 75.82p. Our report on inflation, from Patrick Collinson: There was a surprise rise in the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s inflation rate to 0.2% in December, the first month since January 2015 in which the rate has exceeded 0.1% according to the Office for National Statistics. Transport costs, particularly air fares, and to a lesser extent motor fuels, were the main contributors to the rise, said the ONS. These were partly offset by downward pressure on prices for alcohol and tobacco along with food and non-alcoholic beverages partially offset the rise. Monthly inflation has been between -0.1% and 0.1% for the past eleven months, helped by plunging commodity prices. More here: And here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the trend for CPI: Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a breakdown of the inflation data: This is also the first time the rate has exceeded 0.1% since January 2015, according to the Office for National Statistics. It said: Movements in transport costs, particularly air fares and to a lesser extent motor fuels, were the main contributors to the rise in the rate. Downward pressures from prices for alcohol and tobacco along with food and non-alcoholic beverages partially offset the rise. The UK consumer price index has risen 0.1% in December on a month on month basis, in line with forecasts. But the year on year figure of 0.2% is the highest since January 2015, and higher than expectations of a 0.1% rise. The crude oil market will continue to be oversupplied until at least late 2016, according to the International Energy Agency. It said the market \u00e2\u20ac\u0153could drown in oversupply.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd With unseasonably warm weather and rising supply - not least from Iran now sanctions have been lifted - will continue to put pressure on crude prices. The IEA said global oil demand fell to a one year low of 1m barrels a day in the fourth quarter of 2015, down from 2.1m in the previous three months. In its latest monthly report the IEA left its estimate of global demand growth for 2016 at 1.2m barrels a day. The IEA said (quote courtesy Reuters): We conclude that the oil market faces the prospect of a third successive year when supply will exceed demand by 1m barrels a day and there will be enormous strain o the ability of the oil system to absorb it efficiently. Brent crude, which was earlier up 3%, is now 2.5% higher at $29.29 a barrel. A couple of positive comments on the Chinese GDP figures. Rain Newton-Smith, CBI director of economics, said: These figures paint a picture of a Chinese economy which is slowing and rebalancing, but still making a huge contribution to the global economy. In recent weeks, financial markets have struggled to digest this situation, alongside further weakness in oil prices. While direct links between the UK and China are relatively small, the spill-over effects from China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economic slowdown, alongside continued volatility in financial markets, amplify the downside risks to growth in the UK. Nevertheless, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s important not to be too downbeat about China or emerging markets more generally. With household incomes up by 7%, and online retails sales growing by 33% last year, China represents a lucrative market for British business. Meanwhile James Sinclair at corporate finance house Clearwater International said: Much will be made of the fact that this is China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s weakest growth in a quarter of a century: Intense volatility in the stock market and the cycle of industrial overcapacity and sluggish external demand have had policymakers looking over their shoulder for a good while. But we don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t see this as the toppling of an economic giant. Instead, there is a rapidly different business environment forming in China. The overall trend for consumer spending is far from grim, and the surging middle class is at the heart of this consumption boom. While consumers are boosting demand for imported goods, there are Chinese companies working in the opposite direction, and redefining what Chinese exporters look like. With the growth of entrepreneurism and innovation in the country, we can expect to see many other Chinese companies both threaten existing industry structures and open up new spaces. By the end of the decade, we still expect China to be one of the leading cross-border investors, and given the patterns we have seen, this is a trend we see no sign of stopping. More on UK inflation. lya Spivak, currency strategist at DailyFX, said: The core year-on-year inflation rate is expected to register at 1.2% in December, unchanged from the prior month. Leading survey data hints downward price pressures may have waned however, opening the door for an upside surprise. Such an outcome may breathe a big of life into rate hike speculation, offering a lift to the British pound. Follow-on comments from Bank of England governor Mark Carney represent a bit of wild card and may either amplify or undermine the initial post-CPI response, depending on the central bank chief\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tone. Despite Bank of England governor Mark Carney saying in the middle of last year that it should be clearer by now when UK interest rates should be increased, that is not at all the case. Recent weak data and the current market turmoil that many analysts do not expect any move until much later this year, if at all. Bank of England policymaker Gertjan Vlieghe seemed to concur on Monday, saying ultra low rates could be here to stay for some years. So Carney\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s speech later at the University of London will be closely watched for any hints as to the timing of any rate rise. Still on the corporate front, one of the day\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest gainers in the UK market so far is Ocado. The online grocer is up 11% following a revival of talk that Amazon could be interested in a takeover to boost its own fledgling food business. Unilever, which makes everything from Dove soap to Pot Noodle, is expecting trading condtions to be tougher and more volatile this year. The company beat analysts forecasts with full year sales up 4.1%, despite negligible growth in developmed markets and weakness in emerging markets. Full story here: As the markets hold onto their early gains, analyst Tony Cross at Trustnet Direct said: A shortfall in Chinese GDP data for 2015 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and accompanying hopes that this will be the catalyst for further stimulus measures from Beijing \u00e2\u20ac\u201c is the key driver here, and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the natural resources stocks that are leading the charge. Whilst some upside is probably warranted \u00e2\u20ac\u201c not least given the protracted falls we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve accrued of late \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the question as always is just how sustainable these gains will prove to be. The news of weak growth has obviously done nothing to lend support to oil prices, but bargain hunting and a mounting belief that Opec\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s over supply of the market will now reign in higher cost production is also helping crude edge higher. A break back above $30/barrel here could prove instrumental in cementing a degree of confidence in the wider market. David Morrison at Spreadco said it will be key to see if markets can maintain their earlyi momentum: How this now plays out could be very instructive. If equities can hold on to early gains then we could finally build some upside momentum and reverse last year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s losses. But if this rally fades, as did all the attempts last week, then that could signal that we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re entering a fully blown bear market. Ahead of the latest EU inflation number and the ZEW confidence figures, Germany has reported a 0.2% year on year rise in its consumer price index. Following a move below $28 a barrel on Monday in the wake of Iran\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s promise to increase exports now sanctions have been lifted, crude prices have regained some ground. Brent is now up 3% at $29.44 a barrel, following strong oil data from China where demand in 2015 was at a record 10.32m barrels a day, up 2.5% from the previous year. Following on from Asia, European stock markets have moved higher in early trading. The FTSE 100 has jumped 1.7% or 102 points to 5881.92 while Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax is up 2.1%, France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac 1.9% and Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ibex 1.7%. The Chinese data is behind the moves. With the GDP figure was just shy of the government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s targets, investors are betting on more stimulus from the central bank to give the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s second largest economy a lift. So mining shares are among the leading risers, with Glencore and Anglo American both up around 8%. Ahead of the World Economic Forum\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s annual conference which begins this evening, my colleague Graeme Wearden has looked at the eight key themes, ranging from the rise of the robots to market turmoil and medicine: For UK inflation, most analysts expect the CPI figure to come in at 0.1% but RBC Capital Markets goes a little higher: RBC forecasts CPI inflation at 0.3% year on year in December 2015, up from 0.1% year on year in November. However, as last time, we acknowledge that the risk to the forecast is to the downside as the continued decline in the petrol price has reduced the base effects that were due to kick in on the back of oil price declines at the end of 2014. For RPI inflation, we look for the annual rate to hold at 1.1% year on year. Beyond the monthly print, the message remains that even if inflation does get near 1% year on year soon, there are limited prospects in 2016 for it taking another leg up from there and moving towards the 2% target. As well as China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock markets moving higher, the Nikkei and Hang Seng are also in positive territory, up 0.5% and 1.75% respectively. So Europe is expected to follow suit: Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. On a busy day for economic news, China has kicked things off with news of the slowest GDP growth in 25 years. The figure of 6.9% growth for the year was not far from the government target but prompted talk of new stimulus measures, and gave some support to the Chinese stock market. The CSI300 index rose 2.95% while the Shanghai composite was 3.2% higher. Here is our report on the Chinese GDP numbers: Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK, said: This morning\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s latest Chinese economic data hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t really shed any new light on an economy that we know is slowing down. The latest fourth quarter GDP data came in at 6.8%, the slowest pace in 25 years and slightly below consensus expectations, while December industrial production slid back to 5.9% from 6.2% in November, no real surprise given recent weak PMI readings. Retail sales were slightly disappointing coming in at 11.1%, slipping back from 11.2% and breaking a sequence of consecutive monthly improvements since last March. While these numbers are slightly disappointing they don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t point to a sharp slowdown, however it does raise the question as to what further steps to stimulate the economy policymakers will take in the coming weeks. Elsewhere in the run up to Davos, the International Monetary Fund releases its latest growth forecasts. There are also UK and EU inflation figures, as well as a speech from Bank of England governor Mark Carney.

Technically, the major indices formed a topping pattern as they failed to make fresh highs after the China-inspired summer sell-off. Stress in the high yield bond market was becoming apparent even before the Fed hiked rates. That hike now looks as if it will go down as one of the worst-timed rate rises in history, even crowning the ECB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s classic efforts in 2011.

Perhaps not yet - in a statement and press conference in Frankfurt. After last month, when the measures announced proved a disappointment, and the more hawkish elements on the ECB clearly prevented the bank from doing more, Draghi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s comments will be widely watched. Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s focus is likely to shine on the first ECB rate meeting of 2016, against a continuing backdrop of weak inflation in the euro area.</p> <p>With last month\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s December disappointment still fresh in the memory ECB President Mario Draghi will have to convince the markets that the ECB has a plan, and the ammunition to cope with the further slide in inflationary pressures that are likely to ripple across Europe in the coming weeks.</p> <p>It is clear that the hawks won out last month preventing the ECB from acting in a much stronger fashion, and in the process giving the ECB President a bloody nose, after he had indicated the prospect of much stronger action. How Mr Draghi navigates these divisions will be particularly pertinent given how they were revealed in the most recent minutes, especially given that the next projections in March are likely to see inflation expectations guided lower.</p> <p>This is because since last month\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s December meeting oil prices have slid another 35%, which means that while the ECB President might come across as dovish later today, after last month\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s disappointment markets may not necessarily take him at his word.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f2494b2fe927581f6e47d8b56b40c51998ee852c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f2494b2fe927581f6e47d8b56b40c51998ee852c/0_0_3252_1951/1000.jpg\" alt=\"ECB President Draghi.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">ECB President Draghi.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Francois Lenoir/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Economists at Unicredit said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>ECB president Mario Draghi will likely sound dovish today, but we expect him to strike a reasonable balance. Mr. Draghi will be careful to avoid fuelling too much speculation about further action to avoid a repetition of the December experience, when the announcement of QE2 fell short of high expectations.</p> <p>At the time, the market\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s disappointed reaction resulted in a 3% rally in euro-dollar exchange rate. Today, we do not expect the meeting to cause any major move in exchange rates, as the market seems prepared for a relatively balanced debate.

                "bodyText":"George Soros then went on to launch an astonishing attack on Donald Trump, saying that he was doing \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the work of Isis\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. He added: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153By fearmongering he and (Ted) Cruz are doing the work of Isis. They want people to turn against the Muslim community and make the Muslim community think there is no alternative to terrorism. It turns the Muslim community into a breeding ground for Isis. Last month, Donald Trump called for a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153total and complete shutdown\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd on Muslims entering the US. This prompted a huge petition to have the businessman and presidential candidate banned from the UK, which MPs debated earlier this week. During the debate, Trump was labelled (among other things) a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153ridiculous xenophobe\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Soros said Vladimir Putin was making the crisis worse by his bombing of civilians in Syria. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153He wants the EU to collapse.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Soros then warned that European countries were in crisis, due to the number of people who have fled to the region: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We have reached a tipping point where the influx reduces the capacity of receiving countries assimilate or integrate the refugees and we have a panic. It is like a cinema on fire without exit signs.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Soros said 2016 was going to be a difficult year. There would be no further rate rises from the Federal Reserve and the ECB would ease policy in March, he predicted (as Mario Draghi hinted today). George Soros, the billionaire financier turned philanthropist, has warned the World Economic Forum tonight that the migration crisis is putting the European Union in jeopardy. Larry Elliott was at the event, and reports: George Soros said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The EU is in an existential crisis as a result of migration. The EU is falling apart.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Backing the idea of a Marshall Plan, Soros said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Most people know that something has gone terribly wrong. It has to be put right.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd As we covered in this liveblog this morning, Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s finance minister Wolfgang Sch\u00c3\u00a4uble has called for billions to be spent helping the troubled countries in the Middle East, to stem the flood of refugees into Europe. Soros added that the same conditions were in place as caused the crisis in 2008. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153There is a financial crisis and a bear market. The source of the disequilibrium is different. In 2008 it was US sub prime. Today it is China where a hard landing is practically unavoidable.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The Greek government says the talks between Lagarde and Tsipras were \u00e2\u20ac\u0153sincere\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Helena Smith has the details: The Greek government has just issued one of its famous briefing papers calling Tsipras\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 talks with IMF chief Christine Lagarde \u00e2\u20ac\u0153sincere.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The Greek PM \u00e2\u20ac\u0153underlined that time is a critical parameter for the successful conclusion of the Greek programme and the first evaluation [of the economy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s performance,]\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd the paper said. Both agreed that from now on there should be \u00e2\u20ac\u0153direct communication\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd between the Greek government and the IMF \u00e2\u20ac\u0153so that each side has a clear view of the positions of the other,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd it noted. After saying it would be preferable if the IMF did not participate in Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s latest bailout, Athens reluctantly agreed last week to the Washington-based body remaining amongst the lenders. Christine Lagarde, head of the IMF, has met with Alexis Tsipras at the sidelines of the World Economic Forum. It was a good meeting, one insider says. And the IMF has now issued a statement, reiterating that Greece needs significant debt relief, as well as pension reforms which are causing such anger in Athens. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The managing director reiterated that the IMF stands ready to continue to support Greece in achieving robust economic growth and sustainable public finances through a credible and comprehensive medium-term economic program. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Such a program would require strong economic policies, not least pension reforms as well as significant debt relief from Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s European partners to ensure that debt is on a sustainable downward trajectory.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd While the Greek prime minister Alexis Tsipras was addressing delegates in Davos earlier today, opposition against the policies his government is being forced to apply intensified as thousands took to the streets. Our correspondent, Helena Smith, reports from Athens. Opposition to the pension and tax measures set as the price of further bailout funds mounted today as thousands of protestors \u00e2\u20ac\u201cmostly from the professions \u00e2\u20ac\u201c joined farmers and fishermen and public sector unionists in denouncing the policies. As Tsipras hob-nobbed in Davos, around 10,000 demonstrators took to the streets \u00e2\u20ac\u201c following up farmer blockades that also expanded - in further evidence that after months (some might say years) of being relatively inactive, the protest movement is once again gaining steam. For the most part, lawyers, doctors and engineers, many said they belonged to Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s vast sector of self-employed who stood to be hard hit by the reforms. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153A lot of us here voted for the left and feel really betrayed,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Baltis Kapopoulos, an Athenian engineer, told me. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s terrible that the left should be tainted by such policies,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said in front of the Greek parliament, a placard emblazoned with the words \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcYou won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t kick us out of the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 above his head. At 29, Kapopoulos said he had no desire to leave Greece but like many might be forced to by the measures. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153If they go through, pensions will drop, contributions will soar and taxes will double. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be a lot of black market work with no insurance. And it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be the end of small firms.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I think the reason there has been such a delay in protest is because people have been shocked. We voted \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcno\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 in the referendum [last July] and 48 hours later, Tsipras went and accepted everything,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said of the leftist\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s spectacular surrender to creditors\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 demands under threat of Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ejection from the euro zone. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Either we react now or we never will. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the last chance if we don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to be forced to leave our country.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Felix Salmon, the sharp-as-a-very-sharp-tack financial columnist, has delivered his verdict on this year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Davos. And it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a zinger, surpassing Felix\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s earlier criticism of the annual shindig in the mountains. He argues that the excitement and chatter behind the scenes about Donald Trump (the antithesis of the spirit of Davos), shows that WEF\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s vision of an open, inclusive approach to solving the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s problems is failing. Especially as we seem to be collecting more problems, not fewer, from stock market turmoil and oil, to the Middle East. Over to Felix: This year, then, is proving itself to be the Davos of denial, the year that the disconnect between rhetoric and reality became more obvious than ever. The founder of the World Economic Forum, Klaus Schwab, is on some level a plutocratic power-broker just like many other rich and powerful men, but his dream of bringing the world together in the service of peace and prosperity is, or was, a genuine one. It has even been bought into by leftist critics who complain that Davos is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153increasingly where global decisions are being taken and moreover is becoming the default form of global governance.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The truth, however, is that with the exception of a few public-health initiatives, the Davos model of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153multi-stakeholder initiatives\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and \u00e2\u20ac\u0153global redesign\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd has utterly failed in its stated aims. The grandiloquence is as lofty as ever, but the world has not come together; instead, it is fracturing, and the World Economic Forum\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s manifold Leaders are reduced to the status of impotent spectators. Some men just want to watch the world burn; Davos Man wants nothing less. But, right now, that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s all he can realistically do. In the financial markets, ECB president Mario Draghi has provided some respite today with his assurances that the central bank will review policy in March - hinting fresh stimulus could come sooner than many investors had been expecting. London\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bluechip FTSE 100 index rebounded from a three-year low on Draghi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s remarks, which followed assurances from his Bank of England counterpart Mark Carney this week that UK interest rates would stay at their record low amid turmoil on global markets and signs that the domestic economy had softened. The FTSE 100 closed up 100 points, or 1.8%, at 5,773.8 but it is still down more than 7% from the start of the year having sold off with other leading bourses around the world on worries over global growth and China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s downturn. The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index closed up 2% and on Wall Street the Dow Jones industrial average was up 1.2% and the S&amp;P 500 was up 0.8% at the time of the London close. Analysts cautioned that while Draghi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s words had soothed markets for now, they would need to be followed with real action. Many recalled December\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s disappointment when ECB action was deemed much less aggressive than Draghi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s prior promises had led investors to believe. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153ECB president Draghi once again saw the equity markets confirm his \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcsuper\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 status as they jumped almost as soon as he started his speech,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Alastair McCaig, analyst at online trading company IG. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153All in all it was very impressive, especially when you consider he didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t actually promise anything, but he was convincing enough to get JP Morgan, RBS and Barclays to bring forward their calls for further easing from June to March.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Ranko Berich, head of market analysis at Monex Europe, commented: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Although equity markets have lapped up the prospect of additional easing like manna from heaven, any euphoria derived from promises of central bank action may prove to be fleeting. Despite Draghi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s assurances, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s still not clear if the ECB is willing to commit to the sort of massive, unconditional and open-ended QE programmes that we have seen from the Bank of Japan and the Fed.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Now here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a turn-up. Davos attendees have voted that the answer to inequality lies more in wealth distribution than greater opportunity, we hear. At the start of the debate, the audience were split 65%-35% in favour of opportunity. But after a spirited debate, the vote was switched, reports Philip Jennings of the UNI Global union. George Osborne has denied that the EU renegotiations are hurting the UK economy, and claimed that the recent market volatility is actually a good thing: Speaking to CNBC here in Davos, he said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Internationally we need a big of a sense of perspective which is, underlying all this volatility are some transformations and transitions which are fundamentally good for the world \u00e2\u20ac\u201c China becoming a more consumption based economy, energy being cheaper\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6in the European Union and the euro zone, the European Central Bank ready to\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6step in and support the euro zone.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Because of the very sharp falls in the oil price the markets are unstable\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6but fundamentally for most western economies\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6the fall in the price of energy is a good thing.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd This rather sums Davos up: Businesses at Davos are being urged to provide more financial assistance to help the world prepare for the next major pandemic. Jeremy Farrar, director of the Wellcome Trust, has warned that we are simply not ready for another serious outbreak, similar to the Ebola crisis that struck Africa last year. Speaking at Davos he says: Pandemics are not that rare, we have had a dozen in the last decade. He cites Sars, bird flu, Mers, influenza and the Zika virus as examples of diseases which could create a new pandemic. At the moment, vaccines do not exist for any of these viruses. This leaves the world very vulnerable, and we need to address it at the time between epidemics. As well as life-saving drugs, Farrar says countries also need to prepare their response plans, so they are not caught out when a pandemic begins. A new report, from the Commission on Creating a Global Health Risk Framework for the future, estimated that epidemics and pandemics cost the global economy $60 billion annually. Victor Dzau, who oversaw the commission, says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The report calls the attention globally that this isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t just a health issue, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a global security issue\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The report called for the World Health Organisation to be strengthened, and for more money for R&amp;D. In total, Farrar tells me, just 60 cents or 40p per person would make a dramatic difference in fighting pandemics. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s $4.5bn, which could come from governments and philanthropic groups as well as business. As Farrar puts it: If we did that, we could go a long way to avoiding another Ebola, or worse. Dr Zia Khan of the Rockefeller Foundation says businesses must do their bit: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We are looking to the business community, as well as G7 and others, to take up as a call to action. It is directly relevant to them\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. If you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re just tuning in, please click here to see our earlier summary of the comments made by the French and Dutch PMs today. Our politics liveblog had rounded up Cameron\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s speech - here. In brief, they are that: Cameron said that he was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153not in a hurry\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to get an EU deal by February (really, prime minister?) Cameron said there would still be many \u00e2\u20ac\u0153imperfect\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd things about the EU even if he got the reform package he wanted. He urged business to start campaigning now for Britain to stay in a reformed EU. He said Britain could have \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the best of both worlds\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in a reformed EU. Lets get back to Davos. And Carlos Ghosn, the CEO of Renault-Nissan, just told me that his company will cope fine if Britain chooses to leave the EU. Asked about the possibility of Brexit, Ghosn said: I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m not worried. Whatever is the decision of the UK we will adapt to it. We will adapt to it. If the UK stays, we will continue what we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re doing. If the UK decides to move out, we will adapt to the situation. I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think there is a reason to worry. We knew for many years that this was possible. So we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll deal with it. But might you be forced to move jobs out of the UK, if we leave the EU? Frankly it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s too early to talk about that. To sum up, ECB president Mario Draghi said the ECB would review and may reconsider its monetary policy in March, and that interest rates were likely to stay at low levels for some time. That hint of further stimulus was enough to send the euro lower against the pound and dollar, and give markets a boost. He also dismissed suggestions the ECB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s governing council was split over December\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision to cut the deposit rate and extend the length of the QE programme. Last minutes showed governing council was divided, how confident are you you can get a majority for more easing measures. On the 2% target, ex-chief economist of ECB said target should be in longer term not medium because it harms ECB credibility. Disagree that minutes show such divisions. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s line of communication was unanimous. We have got a majority over last four years, so should have no doubts the council has the willingness and cohesion necessary to take actions needed. On second point, when people say it should be lower than 2% while others say above, camps are divided. [Economist] confirmed validity of the target. The horizon of reaching this objective is his argument. View of council is we should reject any suggestion we may do less than what\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s necessary, in order to achieve target without undue delay. There are global events which could adversely affect objective, but not reason to give up. And with that, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s all over. Could markets get ahead of themselves as before December meeting? I abstained from blaming markets as such. Communication is a two way affair, hard to put blame of some disappointment on one side only. The council is open to use all necessary instruments to cope with the situation which is materially different from what it was at the beginning of December. In October, said you would re-examine in December and there was action. Is there any difference now? How worried are you about recent drop in inflation expectations? All inflation expectations have declined, and more worryingly, their correlation with inflation has increased. The council has the power, the willingness to act. What is message for countries like Spain whose disinflation is less effective. Is there a need for fiscal change in eurozone. Spain has achieved one of most significant progress in reform, country is now on its way to continue recovery and structural reforms. With very low inflation rates, the internal revaluations become more difficult. One of reasons inflation at 2% makes even more sense in a monetary union like ours. No disagreement on fiscal policy between ECB and EC. We are not the guardians, that is the EC. Fiscal consolidation should be growth friendly based on tax cuts, government spending control and possibly investment. There has been a wave of stock market selling, especially bank shares and Italian bank shares. You more or less gave a clean bill of health to banks, markets seem to disagree with your assessment. On non performing loans, you have asked for information so what is the purpose of this action? This allows me to clarify a confused perception. The NPLs were fully assessed in comprehensive assessment. Nothing new. The provisioning for these was fully determined. So no new unexpected provisioning or requests for more capital will be made by banking supervisor. On Italy, its banks have a level of provision similar to that prevailing in eurozone area, and a level of collatoral. European supervisor is aware it takes years to deal with NPLs, cannot be resolved with short period of time. Good example is Ireland - successful in terms of recovery and they are dealing with NPLs gradually. The questionaire was sent to several banks, not only Italy. It is an enquiry on how banks are managing NPLs. The purpose is to look at different national practices to get one best practice in time. Not an initiative to get banks to deal with NPLs urgently. Don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think markets disagree but there has been confusion. Hope this helps. Causes of movements in markets? Difficult to assess. Whether it will be transient or not, whether market adjust to a different level, better question for market analysts to answer. Regarding the fall in the oil price - wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t it be better to ignore effect of that. History suggests they will rise again for sure [and lift inflation], why not wait? When we have dramatic movement in commodities we look at three factors: persistence of these changes, if it was a short term effect we would look through it but this has not been our experience. Materiality, the size. Since December oil fell by 40%. Look at second round effects - low commodity prices do feed into other prices and that could generate what we want to avoid, spiralling down phenomona. So far don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have that, but have to be vigilent. We have to take seriously that low commodity prices for a long period may have second round effects that we want to take action against. Comment on China risks. On refugees, chancellor Merkel is taking a big risk and if situation worsens she could leave, was there a discussion on this domestic German crisis. On China, there have been three main developments - weaker PMI, situation in forex market, situation in stock market. All this generated sizeable capital outflows. We are monitoring. So far indicators suggest there is a gradual deceleration in line with our expectations. But outlook for eurozone area after these developments has been revised downwards. There has been a renewed decline in commodity and oil prices since December. On oil, supply and demand factors and what is happening in China is contributing to demand side. What do we expect? Chinese authorities have reputation for acting responsibly. In last two weeks they have been regaining control of policy. On refugees, can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t talk about one country. Large change but could become opportunity. One of constraints on purchases is political. On financial turmoil have you seen signs of stress among investors, customers. If there were constraints, we will have technical work so we can use all instruments. On second point, best answer to recent developments is to make sure banking sector is resilient. Is a factual statement that all the actions taken have produced a much stronger banking sector than it was before the crisis. But should be cautious about not being too self congratulatory. The commodity volatility we are seeing would previously have tested banking system, but we have seen, they stand pretty resilient. Are you concerned about banking system and financial stability in light of what\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s happening in world. We are constantly monitoring financial sector, banking sector, trying to see whether central banks\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 monetary policies could become a source of financial instability. So far we have not seen signs of the potential financial instability of the like we have seen in the pre-crisis times. Not our mandate to protect banks\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 profitability but we are aware of consequences. Best answer is to ensure economy returns to growth, stable growth. Best answer for banking sector as well. You said no limits to what you could do, could you extend purchases to other classes of assets such as equities, lower other rates not just deposit. On refugee issue, are you concerned of effects of border closures on economy? I can only reiterate there are no limits. If we are to decide about a specific policy we want to be confident there are no technical limits to the size of its deployment. On refugees, this is an extraordinary development which is and will be changing the face of our society in Europe. It is in our hands, the opportunity, the ability to transform this development into an opportunity for future growth in Europe. We are not surrendering in front of these global actions. Our mandate is to reach a level of inflation at if not below 2%, even more determined in face of adverse events. Last month, you said monetary policy was adequate, now reviewing. Does this harm credibility. Inflation could fall below zero despite everything, do central banks not have as much control. Monetary policy has been quite effective - improvement in all financial conditions, now translated into real economic improvements. In December measures we decided were appropriate. But based on prevailing circumstances. We looked at exchange rate, price of oil, growth prospects of emerging markets. Since then, these circumstances have changed. Oil fallen by 40%, exchange rate fallen, and you can see situation of financial and commodity markets. Those measures in December were quite significant (NB one criticsim was the measures were watered down) The credibility of ECB would be harmed if we did not review and reconsider monetary policy stance when we have the full information. We have the determination to act and there are no limits within our mandate. The governing council was unanimous on this line of communication. (there was talk of a split) Now for questions. You will reconsider monetary policy stance in March, what measures do you have left and what can they do? Could you clarify position on Portugals Novo Banco where ECB not said to be involved in the bail in? Draghi: On second question, we are not the resolution authority. On monetary policy: In a speech in New York I said there are no limits to deploying instruments to reach objective of inflation at 2%. Don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to discuss specifics of instruments. The euro is dropping as Draghi speaks, on the prospect of further action including perhaps further rate cuts: But European markets seem to like the talk, with Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax up 1.2% and France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac climbing 1.3%. ECB president Mario Draghi said the bank had decided to keep key interest rates unchanged, and it expected them to remain at present or lower levels for an extended period of time. He said the asset purchases under the QE programme were proceeding smoothly. He said it was clear that its monetary policies were working. Developments in the real economy, financing conditions have improved, strengthened the eurozone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s resilience recent global market shocks. Extension of QE until March 2017 was appropriate, there was a significant addition of liquidity to the banking system. But he added: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Yet as we start the new year, downside risks have increased again amid heightened uncertainty about emerging market prospects, commodity markets, geopolitical risks. Eurozone inflation dynamics are also weaker than expected in December. It is necessary to review and reconsider our monetary policy stance in early March, when new economic projections become available.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd He said the fall in the oil price should help consumers and businesses, but the risks to eurozone growth remained to the downside. Inflation expectations will be low in coming months, and pick up only later in 2016. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the full text of the European Central Bank rate decision ahead of president Mario Draghi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s press conference: At today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meeting the governing council of the ECB decided that the interest rate on the main refinancing operations and the interest rates on the marginal lending facility and the deposit facility will remain unchanged at 0.05%, 0.30% and -0.30% respectively. And here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a comment from David Katimbo-Mugwanya, a fund manager at EdenTree Investment Management: The ECB will be keen to take stock in the coming weeks, preferring to appraise the effectiveness of its December policy actions rather than easing further in the immediate future. The central bank will have taken note, nevertheless, of persistent disinflationary pressures stemming from oil and commodity price weakness. Crowds are gathering in the Congress Hall for David Cameron\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s speech on Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Place in the World. As covered this morning, we expect the PM to call on business leaders to back him over the EU renegotiations. As it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a massive UK political story, my colleague Andy Sparrow is going to live blog it himself, here: You can watch the session live here: Just bumped into Jamie Dimon, boss of JP Morgan, whose bank is planning to back the In campaign on the UK EU referendum. He would not say how much the bank is spending - \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve just started doing (it)...Wish we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have to do it at all\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Q: So will JP Morgan stay if there is a no vote? That will depend on how Brexit happens, and which operations the bank could and couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t keep in Britain, Dimon replies. He continues: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been a great home for financial companies and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s benefited London quite a bit. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d like to stay there but if we can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t, we can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t. I can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t tell the British people what to do, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s up to them\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Time for a quick recap. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s future in, or out, of Europe has dominated the morning of the second day of the World Economic Forum in Davos. A series of European politicians have urged the UK not to quit the European Union. Dutch PM Mark Rutte said Europe needs Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u0153outward looking , trade oriented, growth oriented\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd approach, and urged UK business and community leaders to speak out. French PM Manuel Valls said Brexit would be a tragedy, while German finance minister Wolfgang Sch\u00c3\u00a4uble called it a disaster for Britain, and the EU. Valls also suggested that David Cameron will not succeed in completing his renegotiations next month. The migration crisis has also loomed large: Sch\u00c3\u00a4uble called for a new Marshall Plan to tackle Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s refugee crisis, saying billions must be spent. Rutte said that the Dublin agreement, under which migrants seek residency in the first EU country they register in, must be reformed. Otherwise the Schengen agreement allowing free movement across most EU countries will collapse. And Greek PM Alexis Tsipras said the EU needs to do more to help \u00e2\u20ac\u0153transit countries\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd such as Greece and devise a properly thought-out and paid-for relocation and resettlement plan. Tsipras also clashed with Sch\u00c3\u00a4uble over Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s approach to growth and austerity. The Greek PM wants more help; Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s finance minister wants more competitiveness. Elsewhere in Davos... US Treasury secretary Jack Lew has hinted that markets have over-reacted to the oil price slump and China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s slowdown. The chief economist of Brazil\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest bank has warned its economic woes could last until 2018 A top Chinese official has defended Beijing\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s handling of the crisis.... ...after Christine Lagarde said China has a communication problem. The boss of HSBC has warned that it is hard to raise money for green energy right now The European Central Bank has kept its interest rates unchanged, as expected. After December\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s cut, it has left the deposit rate at -0.3%. Its benchmark refinancing rate is steady at 0.05%. The euro has inched up to $1.0915 following the news. Now for ECB president Mario Draghi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s press conference, due shortly. Italy hopes to agree a plan with the EU to help its struggling banks by next week at the latest, Reuters is reporting. The report says the idea is to set up vehicles to help banks sell bad loans, with a disposal price equivalent to between 20% and 30% of the nominal value of the loan. The latest proposal submitted by Italy is being discussed with a technical meeting due on Friday. Yesterday, there were reports that some customers were withdrawing savings from Monte Paschi bank, with its chief executive saying said the fall in deposits was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153limited\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and that the bank could cope with it.. Jack Lew managed to crack a joke; things can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be that bad. The US Treasury secretary, Jack Lew, is discussing the state of the US economy, and the wider globe. Lew begins by warning that the world economy isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t strong enough: I look around the world and there are a lot of headwinds. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve seen very slugging growth in demand for some years now, and that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s led to a not-strong-enough global economy. And now that things are developing in parts of the global economy that are disruptive, people are reacting to it. And he argues that people are being too negative over recent developments, such as the slump in crude oil. For anyone consuming oil, lower oil is a tax cut. And on China, Lew says the situation isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t dramatically different than last year. They are in a long and difficult transition, from an export-driven economy to a consumer one. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a tough and disruptive process. The big issue in China is whether it can stick to its own economic reform plan, and deliver the growth that it, and the world economy, needs. He said it was important to see how China handled its currency - which was deprecated last summer - and called for \u00e2\u20ac\u0153an orderly transition\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd with the exchange rate, and for the Chinese to allow industrial capacity to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153right size. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153These are big ifs\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, Lew said. And Lew also hints that investors may be getting too jumpy. I know it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been bumpy days in the market, but I try to look beyond the hour to hour, day to day, to what the big trends are. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m not minimising that it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been choppy in the markets, but I think you do need to look at some of these underlying trends in a long-term way. Ilan Goldfajn, chief economist at Brazil\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest bank, Ita\u00c3\u00ba Unibanco, says that his country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economic malaise is unlikely to be tackled until 2018. Goldfajn warned that : \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Brazil has a fiscal problem, it has an external problem and it has a political problem.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The impeachment proceedings against Brazil\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s president Dilma Rousseff meant there had \u00e2\u20ac\u0153been a lame duck government from day one\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Congress was blocking any attempts to resolve Brazil\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economic problems, in part caused by the collapse in commodity prices and in part by mismanagement. Every country in South America had seen its growth rate halved since the end of the commodity super-cycle, Goldfajn said, but Brazil had done much worse than that. It had gone from growth of 4% a year to contraction of 4% a year. The political impasse would last until the next presidential election in 2018, he fears, saying: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The most likely scenario is that the economic problems are not going to be resolved until then. The economy will eventually not be in recession but there won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be a recovery either.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s finance minister, Wolfgang Sch\u00c3\u00a4uble, warned Davos that Brexit would be disastrous for all involved: BP\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chief executive Bob Dudley says the current situation in the oil market reminds him of the 1986 crisis, where oversupply led to a collapse in prices, reports Reuters. Speaking in Davos, Dudley said he expected further pressure on prices this year as Iran ramped up exports: The first and second quarter will be very difficult....It is a big shock for producing countries. It reminds me of 1986. Prices will remain low for longer but not forever. He said markets would begin to rebalance later in 2016 as the glut of oil reduces and investment falls. Brent crude is currently down 0.4% at $27.76 a barrel. Manuel Valls has also told reporters here that he doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think David Cameron will agree a renegotiation deal next month: French PM Manual Valls says it would be a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153tragedy for Europe\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd if the UK quit the Union. He tells Davos that David Cameron is making some good points, and that a more simple and effective Europe would be good for everyone. We must find a compromise, and everyone must contribute to it. Our British friends must understand we will move forwards hand in hand, together, Valls continues. And he warns that the sight of Britain going it alone, at a time when countries need to work more closely to tackle the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s problems, would be disastrous: Nothing would be worse than to see a country like UK leave, it would lead to more populism. Dutch prime minister Mark Rutte has told Davos that Europe \u00e2\u20ac\u0153needs\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd the United Kingdom to stay within the European Union. He also called on business and community leaders at Davos to campaign for the In side in the upcoming referendum, echoing David Cameron\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s speech this afternoon. Rutte says: The UK is outward looking , trade oriented, growth oriented, and we do not have enough of that storyline, that tradition, that culture within the European Union. The European Union can only survive if it is relevant to its people, and it can only be relevant if it leads to economic growth, more jobs and prosperity. It is also crucial for the UK to not lose its place in Europe: I believe the United Kingdom will be worse off outside the EU. It will not have the influence it has in the world today.... Isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t it strange to even debate a Brexit at a time the world is facing all these huge issues and challenges? Rutte goes on to call Cameron \u00e2\u20ac\u0153influential\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and an \u00e2\u20ac\u0153excellent prime minister\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. We would all be worse off if he left, so all 28 countries must work together to create an EU that is more competitive, more outwardd-looking, more growth-oriented. If we could achieve that, the whole episide will have a positive ending Are you optimistic about the upcoming summit? Rutte says he is fairly optimistic that leaders could get to an postiive outcome in February, but not certain. He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also fairly optimistic about the referendum, and urges Davos attendees to speak out. I hope that all of you, business leaders, community leaders, with influence in the United Kingdom will participate. Don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t leave it all to the politicians. You should not preach, as that will never work, but to explain to the British public why it is important in your view for the UK to be part of the European Union. Music to David Cameron\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ears, I expect, as he tours Davos today. Asked about the IMF\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s role in the Greek bailout, Sch\u00c3\u00a4uble appears to admit that he was over-ruled by chancellor Merkel: And the German parliament approved the 3rd bailout on those terms: Sch\u00c3\u00a4uble responds to Tsipras, saying he does agree that Europe should help countries who need it. But Europe also need to be competitive. Germany has its own problems, including demographic (its ageing population). If we want to make Europe stronger, then we should implement what we agreed to implement. We could just say implementation, stupid. Back to Alexis Tsipras. He says Greece has made great efforts to reform its economy in recent years, through an unprecedented downturn. We lost 25% of our GDP, and unemployment skyrocketed, says the Greek PM. Tsipras then inplicitly criticises Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s approach to Greece, saying: Greece needs considerable structural reforms. We must all understand that next to balanced budget, we also have to have growth. Greece needs to tackle corruption, boost investment, and help the state to rebuild itself. And he demands more solidarity, saying: We need a co-ordinated growth strategy, and Europe must help to diminish the inequalities between North and South. We need more Europe, and show more solidarity as well. Wolfgang Sch\u00c3\u00a4uble refuses to say whether Germany can cope with another million refugees this year. And he says Europe must spend billions on the areas where refugees are fleeing. He agrees with Alexis Tsipras that Europe cannot become a fortress This problem will cost the European public more than expected, But it cannot be ignored. Sch\u00c3\u00a4uble says, if Europe is to guarantee its security. It is a problem of and for Europe. Everything that goes wrong with these regions won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t end up in Canada, it will end up in Europe. Alexis Tsipras says all European countries must share the burden of the refugee crisis. Europe must create a two-way system for migration, so people can be returned home. He also calls for much more co-operations between countries; Greece simply cannot cope alone. Next question, on migration, goes to Dutch PM Mark Rutte. Can the Schengen Agreement survive the refugee crisis? Rutte says that 35,000 people have already arrived on the shores of Europe this year. When spring comes, and the numbers quadruple, we cannot as a European Union cannot cope with the numbers any longer. This is the immediate agenda for the next few months. And the priorities include: Success of EU-Turkish union Successful hotspots in Greece and Turkey and Italy Schengen is crucial, Rutte continues. But we also have the Dublin agreement, and it isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t working. Before we kill Schengen, we have to make Dublin work.... No-one wants to kill Schengen, but if it is only a fair-weather system then it cannot survive. Manuel Valls, France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s prime minister, kicks off the European session by saying security and terrorism are one of the biggest challenges faced by the continent. We are at war against terrorism. A world war. And we as Europeans need to face up to this. And European must work together to fight it, pooling resources, and also sharing more information - including a common programme of oversight of flights and airports. So could EU forces be deployed to hot spots in the Middle East? We need more Europe, not less, says Valls, as he thanks everyone who offered help and support to France after the Paris terror attacks. The Middle East is just two hours from Europe - we cannot ignore what is going on there. We must move away from this selfishness, and find the means to deal with this historic challenge. Hundreds of people are pouring into the Davos Congress Hall for the main set-piece event of the morning - the Future of Europe session. It will pit Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Alexis Tsipras against Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Wolfgang Schauble, with France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Manual Valls, the Netherland\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Mark Rutte, and Eni chairman Emma Marcegaglia. You can watch it live, here: Perhaps we spoke too soon. The attempted rally in Europe seems to be petering out, with the FTSE down around 8 points and Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax off 24 points. Dow futures are also falling, now indicating a 130 point decline at the opening bell. David Morrison at Spread Co said: Equities are on the slide again as crude oil continues its relentless decline. Both WTI and Brent are trading below $28 for the usual supply/demand reasons. However, there are also concerns as speculation mounts over the possibility that Saudi Arabia may unpeg the riyal from the US dollar. The strength of the greenback combined with the low oil price is a serious drain on the Kingdom\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s reserves and breaking the peg would be one way of easing the pain. Looks like another topsy-turvey day. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our report on today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s session on the Chinese economy: A senior Chinese official has defended the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economic policies and urged investors to stop fixation on fluctuations in its stock market. Fang Xinghai, Office of the central leading group for financial and economic affairs, told the World Economic Forum that while the stock market was down 40% from its peak it was up 30% over 18 months, He also insisted that there was no basis on which to devalue the currency and said the country was commitment to moving to shadowing a basket of currencies. He declared: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s record of honouring itss commitment is superb\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. He is speaking against a backdrop of countries concerned about the Chinese economy, its currency - which was devalued during the summer - and the volatility in its stock market. Gary Cohn, chief operating officer of Goldman, said most market participants believed China would devalue its currency this year. He joined Christine Lagarde, managing director of the International Monetary Fund, in calling for better communication over its polices. Lagarde said: Given the massive transitions in China, there is a communication issue - this is something that markets do not like. Uncertainty, not knowing exactly what the policy is. Not knowing exactly what the renmimni is valued against - the dollar, or a basket of currencies. Better and more communication\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd would serve the country better, she said. Gary Cohn, chief operating officer of Goldman Sachs, agreed with Lagarde and urged the Chinese to stick its polices once they have been communicated. Fang Xinghai has also told Davos that there is need for more co-operation with global policymakers around the world,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffdWe have to cooperate more closely to overcome this soft patch,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Fang said. Taken to task by Ray Dalio of Bridgewater Associations about what this co-operation meant, Fang said it meant in all areas. More on the ECB ahead of today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meeting: Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s finance minister, Wolfgang Schauble, has weighed in on the Brexit question, arguing Britain should stay in Europe: Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s prime minister, Matteo Renzi, is reported to have pulled out of Davos to deal with the problems in the Italian banking sector: Yesterday, there were reports that customers were pulling funds out of the Monti Paschi bank, on concerns over its bad debts. European markets are holding onto their early gains, while US futures are suggesting a dip of around 45 points on the Dow Jones Industrial Average when Wall Street opens. David Morrison at trading company Spread Co said: The reaction to the overnight Asian Pacific slump from European equities and US stock index futures has been surprisingly muted. At the time of writing, all the major indices are in positive territory. On the face of it this is quite encouraging, particularly as crude is still trading near its 2003 lows. But once again, what looks like the beginning of a recovery in equities could easily turn out to be nothing more than a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153dead-cat bounce.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no doubt there have been signs of stress in global equities for a while now. As far as the US is concerned, in the latter half of 2015 the FANG stocks (Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Google (Alphabet)) were responsible for holding up the major indices as the broader market declined. Technically, the major indices formed a topping pattern as they failed to make fresh highs after the China-inspired summer sell-off. Stress in the high yield bond market was becoming apparent even before the Fed hiked rates. That hike now looks as if it will go down as one of the worst-timed rate rises in history, even crowning the ECB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s classic efforts in 2011. To top it all, China suffered a second melt-down just as we began the New Year. The Dutch finance minister, Jeroen Dijsselbloem, has admitted that Europe blundered by not dealing with its banks faster. A group of demonstrators have been spotted in Davos. They\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re protesting against China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s activities in the Pakistani territory of Balochistan, where Beijing is developing a large new economic zone. Rough translation: Protests in Davos are not so large now. And that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s because of the huge security presence in this ski resort, which clamps down on any signs of dissent. Top Chinese official Fang Xinghai has hit back at Christine Lagarde\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s complaint about communications failings (see earlier post) Fang is the vice chairman of the China Securities Regulatory Commission, and a senio advisor to the premier Li Keqiang. With markets in turmoil, oil sliding to new lows, concerns about Chinese growth and worries about whether central bankers have run out of ammunition to support the global economy, the president of the European Central Bank will be on the spot later to spell out where he thinks we go from here. Mario Draghi will unveil the ECB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s latest measures - more QE? Perhaps not yet - in a statement and press conference in Frankfurt. After last month, when the measures announced proved a disappointment, and the more hawkish elements on the ECB clearly prevented the bank from doing more, Draghi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s comments will be widely watched. Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK, said: Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s focus is likely to shine on the first ECB rate meeting of 2016, against a continuing backdrop of weak inflation in the euro area. With last month\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s December disappointment still fresh in the memory ECB President Mario Draghi will have to convince the markets that the ECB has a plan, and the ammunition to cope with the further slide in inflationary pressures that are likely to ripple across Europe in the coming weeks. It is clear that the hawks won out last month preventing the ECB from acting in a much stronger fashion, and in the process giving the ECB President a bloody nose, after he had indicated the prospect of much stronger action. How Mr Draghi navigates these divisions will be particularly pertinent given how they were revealed in the most recent minutes, especially given that the next projections in March are likely to see inflation expectations guided lower. This is because since last month\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s December meeting oil prices have slid another 35%, which means that while the ECB President might come across as dovish later today, after last month\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s disappointment markets may not necessarily take him at his word. Economists at Unicredit said: ECB president Mario Draghi will likely sound dovish today, but we expect him to strike a reasonable balance. Mr. Draghi will be careful to avoid fuelling too much speculation about further action to avoid a repetition of the December experience, when the announcement of QE2 fell short of high expectations. At the time, the market\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s disappointed reaction resulted in a 3% rally in euro-dollar exchange rate. Today, we do not expect the meeting to cause any major move in exchange rates, as the market seems prepared for a relatively balanced debate. The euro has held up well since the 3 December meeting, and it would take a strong (unexpected) dovish signal of imminent action to change this pattern. Mic Mills at Capital Index said: All eyes today will be on the ECB with the interest rate decision at 12:45 [GMT] followed by Draghi giving the post meeting press conference at 13:30, which after last month will need to persuade the markets that there is more in the cupboard, as there seems to be no respite in sight when it comes to deflationary pressure. FXTM analyst Lukman Otunuga said: For an extended period falling commodity prices have left the Eurozone engaged in an ongoing one-sided battle against stubbornly low inflation levels, while stalling domestic economic growth continues to test the European Central Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s credibility. It is widely expected that the ECB will remain on standby today and keep rates unchanged, but Mario Draghi may reiterate his dovish mantra and threaten further QE in an attempt to talk down the value of the Euro. At an HSBC breakfast on climate change, the bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chief executive Stuart Gulliver has said the current state of the financial markets is not exactly conducive to raising private funds to tackle global warming. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The markets are showing signs of quite significant distress and it is not a high priority for fund managers to set up a green fund\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, Gulliver says. He also says that the crash in oil prices may have the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153unintended consequence\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd of deterring investment in alternative energy sources because the R&amp;D costs will be considered too high. Gulliver says that following the Paris climate change conference governments and the private sector had to raise $5tn a year over the next two decades. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It is a vast financing challenge\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, he says. Despite the falls in Asia, European markets have made a positive start, if not a totally convincing one. The FTSE 100 is up 31 points or 0.5%, while France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac has climbed 0.1%, Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB is 0.5% better and Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ibex has added 0.5%. Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax, despite Deutsche Bank saying it expected to report a record loss of \u00e2\u201a\u00ac6.7bn for 2015, is ahead by 0.2%. IMF chief Christine Lagarde has warned that Beijing needs to improve the way it communicates with the markets. Currently, investors are being spooked as they watch China embark on a huge economic rebalancing. She tells today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s discussion on China that: Given the massive transitions in China, there is a communication issue - this is something that markets do not like. Uncertainty, not knowing exactly what the policy is. Not knowing exactly what the renmimni is valued against - the dollar, or a basket of currencies. China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rebalancing is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153perfectly manageable\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd if the right policies are taken, she adds. Ji\u00c4\ufffdng Ji\u00c3\u00a0nq\u00c4\u00abng, the Chairman of the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, has argued that China can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be blamed for the stock market turmoil. Speaking on a panel in China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy, Ji\u00c3\u00a0nq\u00c4\u00abng said a range of factors are being it. He cites the slow pace of recovery in the world economy, meaning growth is flat. The US interest rate hike, and economic policies in the EU have also created volatility. And commodity prices are under pressure. So the world all over is facing volatility. Some reasons are normal, some are abnormal. There is a certain degree of panic in the market. Policymakers must implement structural reforms to lead the world economy out of this period of low growth, and regulators should work together to reduce volatility. European markets are expected to make an uncertain start after Wednesday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rout, which saw the FTSE 100 head into bear market territory. A recovery on the Dow Jones Industrial Average from its worst levels \u00e2\u20ac\u201c albeit still showing a 249 point fall \u00e2\u20ac\u201c may give some support, although Asian markets lost their early gains to head into the red again. Here are the opening calls in Europe: Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK, said: Now that equity markets, both here in Europe and in the US have slipped into bear market territory the big question now is where do we go to next. That looks highly likely to depend on oil prices and a late rebound off the lows yesterday did see US markets recoup a large portion of their losses, the Dow was 566 points down at one stage, but they still finished the day below their previous lows in August. This late rebound should be enough to see European markets open higher this morning, a welcome respite after yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sell-off, but it is going to need a significant turnaround in sentiment to recoup the losses seen so far this week, and prevent markets from posting their third successive weekly decline. Oil in fact is slipping back again, with Brent crude down 1% at $27.58 a barrel. David Cameron is to call on the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s business chiefs to support him in the upcoming EU referendum to secure Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s place in a reformed EU. The prime minister is using his trip to Davos to drum up support, ahead of a potentially decisive EU summit in February where he could secure concessions from fellow European leaders. The PM is expected to say that: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This is a once-in-a-generation moment and the stakes are high.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Cameron\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s message to business chiefs is that if they want Britain to remain in the EU with less red tape and a more complete single market, they need to come out and back the In Campaign. He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll say: If you want a more competitive Europe, where the single market is completed, where there are more trade deals and fewer regulations: join me in making that case. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153If you believe, like I do, that Britain is better off in a reformed European Union, then, when the time comes, help me make that case for Britain to stay.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Business leaders in Davos have been very unwilling to talk on the record about the Brexit issue, while many international delegates have sounded more worried about the prospect of Britain leaving the EU. So Cameron will certainly be in demand today, as he holds a series of \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcbilateral\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 meetings. Good morning from Davos, where the second day of the World Economic Forum is getting underway. Yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock market plunges have sent a shiver through this little ski resort, as the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153global elite\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd gather to debate the major issues of the moment. And world leaders and business chiefs will be monitoring events in the markets closely again, following a wild day\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trading in Asia overnight. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s session will be dominated by Europe, with prime minister David Cameron giving a big set-piece speech in the afternoon. Cameron is also due to meet with Argentina\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new president, Mauricio Macri, in what could be a thawing of relations between the two countries. Greece is also in focus today, as prime minister Alexis Tsipras tries to lobby creditor nations to cut Athens some slack on austerity and debt relief. He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s expected to meet with Christine Lagarde during the day. And there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also a big focus on geopolitics, with the migration crisis and the turmoil in the Middle East. Some sessions which we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll try to cover include: 8.45am CET (7.45am GMT): Where is the Chinese economy headed? Including IMF chief Christine Lagarde 10.15am CET A debate on the future of Europe, including French PM Manuel Valls, Greek PM Alexis Tsipras, Dutch PM Mark Rutte and German finance minister Wolfgang Schauble 12.30pm CET: Treasury secretary Jack Lew discusses \u00e2\u20ac\u0153global financial priorities in 2016.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd 2pm CET: David Cameron on Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s place in the world 3pm: How to educate Syria\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s displaced children",

                "bodyText":"Let\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s end on a heartwarming tale from Davos. One of the most impressive delegates this year was Mark Pollock, the first blind man to race to the South Pole who was later paralysed. Pollock\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s wheelchair just broke, leaving him in a serious jam. But he was rescued by a technician who trudged through the snow to find him, and fix it. And he only charged 20 francs. Quite a bargain, and proof that the world isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t all bad. Delegates are streaming away from the WEF conference all, with a lot to think about. Philip Jennings, head of the UNI Global Union, says this Davos was about \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Beauty and the Beast\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. We started the with Oxfam saying that 62 people are as wealthy as the poorest half of the world, prompting warning about inequality and distribution. We ended it with JP Morgan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Jamie Dimon putting two fingers up to the world, and taking a 30% pay rise. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been a funny old Davos this year. The wild swings in the stock markets reminded us that the global economy remains fragile, dominated by emerging market woes and fears of a new global slowdown. But that was trumped by the awful news that at least 45 people drowned yesterday fleeing the Middle East for Europe. The worst January on record for refugee deaths could herald a grim 2016. Davos is nearly over - and delegates are tucking into lunch. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s quite a menu - including deer, veal ragout, soup, a *huge* swiss cheese , and pancakes (or Cr\u00c3\u00aape Suzette for posher readers). There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also a rather large chocolate fountain... We know that George Osborne is a big China fan. And he concluded the session on the Global Economic Outlook by urging global leaders to support Beijing. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The world has not been very good over previous centuries at accommodating rising powers,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd the chancellor warned. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It is massively in our interests that we bring China into the multilateral institutions of the world.....and make it feel part of the global system.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd  China really has dominated this year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s World Economic Forum (along with the refugee crisis). Osborne\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s words may fall flat, though, if policymakers fumble the move to a more domestic-driven, consumer based economy. Especially if the credit bubble that has swelled over recent years bursts badly. Bank of Japan governor Kuroda\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s suggestion today that China should impose capital controls highlights the pressure on Beijing. Chris Giles of the FT explains: The subject of capital controls is very sensitive for the IMF because late last year it recommended the renminbi be admitted into the fund\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s elite basket of currencies, including the US dollar, euro, yen and sterling, on the grounds that it was now \u00e2\u20ac\u0153widely used\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and \u00e2\u20ac\u0153freely usable\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Capital controls would undermine both conditions. George Osborne\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s comments won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t spare Google from a grilling in parliament over the tax deal. There is plenty of concern that \u00c2\u00a3130m in back taxes is a rather meagre sum, for a company of Google\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s size and importance. And the Public Accounts Committee is determined to dig into it. Meg Hillier MP, chair of the PAC, said overnight that she was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153shocked\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd by the workaround methods used by multinationals. It doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t reflect well on the tax officials, either: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153HMRC now needs to assure taxpayers that it will keep up the pressure to tackle whatever the next emerging issue is in real time, rather than years later. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It is effectively admitting it pulled in too little tax from Google for nine out of ten years. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This is not a great success rate and the Public Accounts Committee will be calling in HMRC and Google to explain. George Osborne has told the Guardian that the \u00c2\u00a3130m tax deal announced with Google overnight is a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153huge step forward\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Speaking to my colleagues Larry and Jill just after his panel debate in Davos, the chancellor said he regarded it as a major success for the government. He told us: This is a major success of our tax policy. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve got Google to pay taxes and I think that is a huge step forward and addresses that perfectly legitimate public anger that large corporations have not been paying tax. I think it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a really positive step. I hope to see more firms follow suit and of course I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve introduced a diverted profits tax which will require this going forward. So I think it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a big step forward and a victory for the government\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Overnight, the search giant announced that it will pay \u00c2\u00a3130m to the UK - a decade\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s worth of tax. It will also pay more taxes in the UK in future, as part of a shake-up of the way the multinational pays tax. Osborne\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s comments at Davos come after Labour shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, criticised the deal. My colleague Kevin Rawlinson reports: People will be \u00e2\u20ac\u0153sceptical\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd about what he said looked like a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153sweetheart deal\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, he told BBC Radio 4\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Today programme on Saturday, adding that HMRC seemed to have settled for a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153relatively trivial amount of money.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd McDonnell will be asking HMRC to publish full details of what it believed Google owed. He said he would raise the issue in Parliament next week as the issue needed \u00e2\u20ac\u0153wider scrutiny\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. The session ended with Christine Lagarde calling for a new way of measuring economic success: I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll do a more thorough wrap-up in a minute. Tidjane Thiam, head of Credit Suisse, reckons we are not on the brink of another banking crisis despite the recent market turmoil. Q: Does Christine Lagarde think China needs capital controls? Lagarde replies that it wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be a particularly good idea for Beijing to burn through all its reserves propping up the yuan. China needs to give clarity, certainty and one message on exactly how the exchange mechanism works, and what the yuan is being measured against. Onto China, which has been eating into its foreign exchange reserves in an attempt to support the yuan. Kuroda says that Beijing faces a tough battle, and may need consider new restrictions to prevent money leaving the country. He says: China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s authorities have been struggling to avoid excessive depreciation or appreciation of its currency while also maintaining an accommodative monetary stance. My personal view, which may not be shared by the Chinese authorities is that in this somewhat contradictory situation, capital controls could be useful to manage the exchange rate as well as domestic monetary policy in a consistent and appropriate way. Japanese central bank governor Kuroda says that inflation, currently around zero, could strengthen significantly if the oil price recovers. And if not, he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s prepared to do more. Echoing the famous pledge from ECB chief Mario Draghi, Kuroda says: The Bank of Japan is fully committed to achieving the price stability target of 2% and will do whatever it takes to achieve that target, at the earliest stage. We don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t believe there are any limits to our policy tools, he adds. Japan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s central bank chief, Haruhiko Kuroda, says he doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t believe China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy will crash. Markets have been volatile this year, against heightened uncertainty over China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy and oil prices, he says. But he does not share the pessimistic view about the implications. China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s slowdown is due to the challenge of rebalancing its economy. Q: Will Britain be in the EU in a year? Osborne says he is optimistic of getting a good deal for Britain and the European Union. And he insists that Europe needs to reform itself. I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want my continent priced out of the world economy. And if the British people see we are delivering that change across Europe, they will vote to stay in a reformed EU. Osborne says that Europe likes to cut a deal at the 11th hour, because the Greek banks need to open or a bond needs paying. But we aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t behaving like the greek government. We have taken a much more measured approach, approaching Europe as friends, colleagues and allies. Osborne says that in \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a mature and measured way\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd we can get that agreement, maybe at the February meeting. If it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not a good deal, Britain won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t sign. But given all the challenges in the EU, I think it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s in Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s interests to give us a deal that works for all member states. W Q: Is there any chance of a deal in the next few weeks that will satisfy the huge eurosceptical forces in the UK? There will be people who want to leave Europe, come what may, and some who want to stay, George Osborne replies. But if David Cameron can come back with a creditble reform packate, we can make a case for staying. There is goodwill out there, we now have to make it happen. Britain has three priorities through our EU renegotiation, says Osborne: We want to create a more competitive European union, to create more jobs and growth Want to address concerns about migration. Mainstream governments should not ignore these pressure, but should address the legitimate concerns that can fuel them. Thirdly, we need a better working relationship between euro and non-euro countries, and the fact that large countries such as the UK will not be in the eurozone. There is a remorseless logic that the eurozone needs ever-closer union, and Britain does not want to be part of it, Osborne concludes. Now George Osborne speaks, saying his \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcclear economic plan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 has given the UK a pretty secure footing going forwards. But we don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t duck big decisions - the Scottish referendum, for example, has \u00e2\u20ac\u0153checked a move towards the break-up\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd of the UK. And with the EU referendum, Britain is seeking a more competitive EU. I have sat on panels for five years, hearing people talk about creating more competition. Now we need to do it, says Osborne. And he cites an old Chinese proverb: Talk does not cook rice. On Europe, Lagarde says the economy is in better shape than a year ago,. But the IMF has two big concerns: One is Brexit, and whether there is a deal between the United Kingdom and the rest of Europe. We hope very much [there is a deal], as it would really be conducive to more stability and a more cohesive economic zone. The second is the refugee crisis, which Lagarde calls a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcmake-or-break\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 issue for Europe, Lagarde adds. If it is well-handled and the integration process is handled well, it will be an upside for the eurozone, boosting growth particularly in Sweden and Germany. So do you agree that the refugee crisis is \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcmake or break\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 for the Schengen area? Speaking personally, not as MD as the IMF, Yes, I think so, Lagarde replies. Lagarde says there are four key risks: China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economic rebalancing, as it moves from industry to service, export to domestic market,and investment to consumption. Commodity prices, where the fall has accelerated in the last 18 months. Asynchronous monetary policies around the world, creating capital flows as money returns to the US, depreciating the currencies of some emerging markets. And emerging markets - Lagarde says India and China are performing much better than Brazil or Russia. [Is this the death of the BRICS idea?] Christine Lagarde says the IMF believes the world economy will grow at a faster rate, even though it cut its growth forecasts this week. From 3.1% in 2015, the IMF expects growth of 3.4% in 2016 and 3.6% in 2017. Credit Suisse CEO Tidjane Thiam says the financial markets have had their worst start to a year ever. Fears over China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy are a prime factor, prompting market turmoil and concerns that we could be heading into a global recession. Massive outflows from asset managers, some from sovereign wealth funds, as they face losses on their And there is a shortage of liquidity in the market, which means shares and bonds are more volatile. But investors are over-reacting, and should remember that the fall in the oil price is good for consumers, good for Europe, and good for 5 billion people who are net importers of oil. The FT\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Martin Wolf is chairing the debate, and spending several minutes running through the state of play today. And it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not great - world stock markets are in turmoil, everyone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s worrying about China, emerging economies face a tough year, the US economy may be slowing too, the migration crisis is threatening European Union, populism is on the rise, and Britain may be heading towards Brexit. What on earth is going on, he demands? Reminder, the panel are UK chancellor George Osborne, Japanese central bank governor Haruhiko Kuroda, IMF managing director Christine Lagarde, Indian finance minister Arun Jaitley, and Credit Suisse CEO Tidjane Thiam. Cowbells are ringing across the Davos conference centre (yes, really), signalling that the debate on the Global Economy is starting now. This year, the Guardian\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Davos bureau is a prime table at the heart of WEF, just outside the office of founder Klaus Schwab. And from there, we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve seen a string of senior politicians and top central bankers emerge from a meeting. That includes the IMF\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Christine Lagarde, Bank of England governor Mark Carney, Finland\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s finance minister Alex Stubb, and Axel Weber of UBS. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not a crisis meeting, though, but an IGWEL - an informal gathering of world and economic leaders. Stubb has helpfully tweeted from the meeting. Gideon Rachman, the Financial Times\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s top foreign affairs writer, reckons that this year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s World Economic Forum has been dogged by the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153shadow of populism\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd: Davos delegates shouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be surprised that the public are looking at the state of the world economy, and the political landscape, and decide that a change is needed. But the sort of populism promoted by Donald Trump is rather alien, and alarming, for those at WEF. Gideon writes: The shadow of Donald Trump has loomed over Davos this year. So has the prospect that refugee flows into Europe will undermine centrist leaders such as Angela Merkel, the German chancellor. More broadly, those at Davos are aware that they increasingly represent the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153unpopular\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u201d the business and political elites that are the targets of public anger and disillusionment. Sooner or later, most corridor conversations in Davos have turned to the US presidential election. It is gradually dawning on people in the Swiss resort that either Mr Trump or Ted Cruz, the Texas senator, will probably win the Republican nomination, and that the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153unthinkable\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u201d a Trump or Cruz victory in November\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s presidential election \u00e2\u20ac\u201d could happen. Our economics editor Larry Elliott has been coming to Davos for two decades. And he writes that this year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meeting has been particulary dominated downbeat. For Justin Welby, mulling over the state of the world in Davos has been easier than the previous week spent trying to hammer out an Anglican church compromise over gay marriage. The Archbishop of Canterbury even cracked one of the better jokes at the World Economic Forum. Asked whether god is in cyberspace, Welby replied: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I think he must be because every time I am on the underground or a bus I see people looking at their computer or mobile phone saying \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcoh god, why won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t this work\u00e2\u20ac\u2122.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Humour has been in short supply at this year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Davos. The optimism of a year ago that the global economy was on the up after the deep slump of 2008-09 has disappeared fast.... Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the full piece: So, what have we learned from Davos this year? In a nutshell, the so-called \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcglobal elite\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 are worried about a range of problems, and struggling to make much progress in solving them. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been no end of talk about refugees, market turmoil, oil, the risk of a new pandemic, and gender inequality. But no real sign that we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re close to a breakthrough on any of it. As one senior delegate put it, 2016 is going to be a year of shocks. Some delegates might be heading for the ski slopes but there still signs of work being done. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s all go in the main Congress centre this morning. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve spotted Bank of England governor Mark Carney, Canada\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, Tidjane Thiam, chief executive of Credit Suisse and WPP\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Sir Martin Sorrell coming from one direction. From another direction there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been a string of top bankers. To name a few: Ana Bot\u00c3\u00adn of Santander, Ant\u00c3\u00b3nio Horta-Os\u00c3\u00b3rio of Lloyds Banking Group, Bill Winters of Standard Chartered, Axel Webber of UBS and Stuart Gulliver of HSBC. A drugs scandal has hit Davos this year, in a serious embarrassment for the Swiss authorities. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not the delegates who have been puffing and snorting, though, but a dozen of the soldiers who patrol the ski resorts roads. They\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve been sent home, and may face criminal charges. The AFP newswire has the details: Twelve on-duty soldiers had tested positive on Tuesday for cannabis and five of them had also used cocaine, army spokesman Stefan Hofer told the ATS news agency. The twelve, among some 4,500 soldiers brought in to ensure security at the World Economic Forum this week, had been tested after others in their unit raised the alarm. Using drug-sniffing dogs, military police had also discovered that one of the soldiers had more than three grammes of cocaine in his possession, according to the report. Guten Morgen. Just like the wicked, there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no rest for the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s global elite. So world leaders, CEOs, union chiefs, economists and journalists are gathering for the final act of the 2016 World Economic Forum. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a different feel in Davos today. Partly because it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Saturday, which means this gorgeous ski resort actually has some skiers here today, trudging through the snow alongside delegates. And partly because after three days discussing the problems of the world economy, everyone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a bit shattered and ready to go home. But not before the final big event, a debate on the world economy. On the panel: UK chancellor George Osborne, Japanese central banker Haruhiko Kuroda, IMF managing director Christine Lagarde, Indian finance minister Arun Jaitley, and Credit Suisse CEO Tidjane Thiam. It begins in an hour\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time, at 10.30am Davos time or 9.30am UK time. You should be able to watch it here. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll cover it in this liveblog, along with any other major developments at Davos, and try to work out what (if anything) has been achieved this year....",

It should be the duty of those making tax policy to find better ways to limit the elasticity. Google may be the symptom, but it is not the cause.</p> <p>\u00e2\u20ac\u0153There is a lot the government could be doing. Tax policy must be made more practicable and the tax system more coherent.

                "bodyText":"MPs have launched an inquiry into the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tax system after the government was accused of allowing Google to pay too little in a \u00c2\u00a3130m deal. The House of Commons Treasury committee announced that it would examine whether a radical shakeup of corporation tax was needed, amid concern that Google has been allowed to get away with an effective rate of 3%. The inquiry is not directed at Google, but will investigate the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shrinking corporate tax base more widely and whether HMRC is doing enough to tackle avoidance. It will ask whether there needs to be a radical shakeup of the system, and whether business taxation could be based on turnover rather than profits. Andrew Tyrie, chairman of the committee, said the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tax law had become too elastic, allowing companies to get away legally with paying too little. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The complexity of tax law is turning what should be a straightforward principle \u00e2\u20ac\u201c that everybody should pay the correct amount of tax \u00e2\u20ac\u201c into a piece of elastic. For corporation tax, for instance, the problem is exacerbated by the globalisation of economic activity and any liability to tax that accompanies it,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153A corporation\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s duty to shareholders will be to minimise its tax liability. It should be the duty of those making tax policy to find better ways to limit the elasticity. Google may be the symptom, but it is not the cause. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153There is a lot the government could be doing. Tax policy must be made more practicable and the tax system more coherent. Tax needs to be fair. It needs to provide more certainty and stability. There is a lot to do and a lot for the committee to examine.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Speaking in the House of Commons, Tyrie suggested \u00e2\u20ac\u0153fundamental reform\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd of the tax base might need to be considered in light of the Google case. In the same debate, George Osborne was mocked by Labour for claiming the government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00c2\u00a3130m deal with Google was a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153major success\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd after No 10 failed to show similar enthusiasm. John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, said Osborne had managed to unite opinion against the deal, which has been criticised for recovering too little from Google. In an urgent question to the House of Commons, McDonnell also called on the Treasury to publish details of the negotiations and how the deal was reached. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The chancellor has managed to create an unlikely alliance between myself, the Sun newspaper, the mayor of London and, according to reports, even No 10 this morning. All of us think this deal is not the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcmajor success\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 the chancellor claimed at the weekend,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd McDonnell said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t the minister agree it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s important that everyone is treated equally and fairly whether they be large multi-billion pound corporations or small businesses?\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd He told MPs that experts have estimated Google paid an effective tax rate of around 3% over the past decade, despite a UK corporation tax rate of more than 20%.

He called for a thorough overhaul of the system.

It would be a good thing, both for the UK finances and for the image of these great companies, if they paid more,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he wrote.

The prime minister\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s spokeswoman said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153As I said, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a step forward.

Oil was on the slide, falling back below $30 a barrel on continuing fears of a supply glut at a time when demand is weakening.</p> <p>So European markets began with falls of nearly 2%. But a revival in the crude price came amid talk that Opec could be prepared to cut production if rival producers followed suit. That, along with some decent financial results from the likes of Procter &amp; Gamble, set Wall Street off to a positive start and gave a lift to markets elsewhere. Ahead of Apple\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s latest figures later and the US Federal Reserve interest rate decision on Wednesday, the final scores in Europe showed:</p> <ul> <li><strong>The FTSE 100 finished up 34.46 points or 0.59% at 5911.46, having fallen as low as 5771.

The transfer of income from producers to consumers, who are more likely to spend on other goods and services, should boost global demand. At worst, the impact might be expected to be neutral, with the winners offsetting the losers. In practice, though, the net impact of the recent slump in oil prices appears to have been negative, or at least perceived as such in financial markets.</p> <p>There are a number of factors at play here. First, the speed and extent of the slump has itself added to the uncertainty about the global economy. Rightly or (more probably) wrongly, the fall has been interpreted as evidence of a collapse in demand and fuelled fears about a hard landing in China in particular.</p> <p>Second, the costs to producers have been proportionately much larger (relative to their incomes) than the benefits to consumers. This concentration of losses relative to the more diffuse benefits is one reason why producers appear to have cut their spending more quickly and by a larger amount than consumers have increased theirs.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c4dd0af88d165ae6bdaaa473eace73706eedbc96\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c4dd0af88d165ae6bdaaa473eace73706eedbc96/0_0_3500_2099/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Oil fields in Kazakhstan.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Oil fields in Kazakhstan.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Shamil Zhumatov/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <blockquote> <p>This asymmetry has compounded the negative impacts on financial markets. Energy companies may now only account, for example, for a small share of the US junk bond market, but the fear is that there will be widespread defaults throughout this sector, rippling through the financial system as a whole. Similarly, the impact on the 20% or so of the UK FTSE 100 accounted for by commodity producers is far more visible than the potential benefits to the remaining 80% who are not.</p> <p>Pressure on oil producers to sell assets accumulated in Sovereign Wealth Funds has also soured the mood, even though this selling might actually boost the global economy if the proceeds are used to support local spending.</p> <p>The additional downward pressure on headline inflation from lower energy costs has revived fears that vulnerable economies may slip into a more damaging period of deflation.</p> <p>However, this analysis does also allow us to draw some more positive conclusions. Stabilisation in oil prices \u00e2\u20ac\u201c even at a low level \u00e2\u20ac\u201c should at least ease some of the associated uncertainty about the health of the global economy. The downward pressure on headline inflation should unwind too. Many of the negatives are also about timing. Producers have generally been quicker to adjust their spending, but eventually this should be outweighed by increases in spending by consumers on other goods and services.</p> <p>On balance, then we continue to expect an extended period of lower oil prices to boost global growth over the next few years, even if this process may take longer than we had anticipated.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-56a79880e4b085519d006727\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-01-26T16:06:36.100Z\">4.06pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>The recovery in the oil price has given a boost to stock markets and follows hopes that Opec would be willing to cut production if non-member countries - notably Russia - also agree to reduce supply.</strong></p> <p>Iraqui oil minister Adel Abdel Mahdi said he saw some flexibility for a deal with rival producers, and as a consequence, Brent crude is now up 2.9% at $31.38.

                "bodyText":"Volatile days are becoming the norm but even by those standards, the swings during the course of the day\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trading were pretty notable. A 6% slump in Chinese markets - partly driven by poor rail freight figures casting new doubt on the strength of the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy - got things off to a bad start. Oil was on the slide, falling back below $30 a barrel on continuing fears of a supply glut at a time when demand is weakening. So European markets began with falls of nearly 2%. But a revival in the crude price came amid talk that Opec could be prepared to cut production if rival producers followed suit. That, along with some decent financial results from the likes of Procter &amp; Gamble, set Wall Street off to a positive start and gave a lift to markets elsewhere. Ahead of Apple\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s latest figures later and the US Federal Reserve interest rate decision on Wednesday, the final scores in Europe showed: The FTSE 100 finished up 34.46 points or 0.59% at 5911.46, having fallen as low as 5771. Commodity companies led the rebound. Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax added 0.89% to 9822.75 France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac closed 1.05% higher at 4356.81 Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB rose 1.51% to 18,923.83 Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ibex ended 1.46% better at 8692.5 In Greece, the Athens market added 2.15% to 546.22 On Wall Street the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently 285 points or 1.78% higher. On that note, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time to close up. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be back again tomorrow. The slump in the oil price should theoretically be good for the global economy but stock markets at least do not seem to be taking that on board. Julian Jessop at Capital Economics says: In principle, a lower oil price should be positive for the world economy. The transfer of income from producers to consumers, who are more likely to spend on other goods and services, should boost global demand. At worst, the impact might be expected to be neutral, with the winners offsetting the losers. In practice, though, the net impact of the recent slump in oil prices appears to have been negative, or at least perceived as such in financial markets. There are a number of factors at play here. First, the speed and extent of the slump has itself added to the uncertainty about the global economy. Rightly or (more probably) wrongly, the fall has been interpreted as evidence of a collapse in demand and fuelled fears about a hard landing in China in particular. Second, the costs to producers have been proportionately much larger (relative to their incomes) than the benefits to consumers. This concentration of losses relative to the more diffuse benefits is one reason why producers appear to have cut their spending more quickly and by a larger amount than consumers have increased theirs. This asymmetry has compounded the negative impacts on financial markets. Energy companies may now only account, for example, for a small share of the US junk bond market, but the fear is that there will be widespread defaults throughout this sector, rippling through the financial system as a whole. Similarly, the impact on the 20% or so of the UK FTSE 100 accounted for by commodity producers is far more visible than the potential benefits to the remaining 80% who are not. Pressure on oil producers to sell assets accumulated in Sovereign Wealth Funds has also soured the mood, even though this selling might actually boost the global economy if the proceeds are used to support local spending. The additional downward pressure on headline inflation from lower energy costs has revived fears that vulnerable economies may slip into a more damaging period of deflation. However, this analysis does also allow us to draw some more positive conclusions. Stabilisation in oil prices \u00e2\u20ac\u201c even at a low level \u00e2\u20ac\u201c should at least ease some of the associated uncertainty about the health of the global economy. The downward pressure on headline inflation should unwind too. Many of the negatives are also about timing. Producers have generally been quicker to adjust their spending, but eventually this should be outweighed by increases in spending by consumers on other goods and services. On balance, then we continue to expect an extended period of lower oil prices to boost global growth over the next few years, even if this process may take longer than we had anticipated. The recovery in the oil price has given a boost to stock markets and follows hopes that Opec would be willing to cut production if non-member countries - notably Russia - also agree to reduce supply. Iraqui oil minister Adel Abdel Mahdi said he saw some flexibility for a deal with rival producers, and as a consequence, Brent crude is now up 2.9% at $31.38. But given the recent volatility, the gains may not last long. Chris Beauchamp, senior market analyst at online trading group IG, said: As oil goes, so goes the rest of the market. Yesterday a rapid decline in crude paved the way for stock markets to give up their gains, but today the price of black gold is on the up again, with the reliable market rumour of production cuts providing the foundation for both Brent and WTI to move back above $31 a barrel. At this point, a decision between Opec and non-Opec members to cut production is not the important element; the key point is such talk allows the price to move upwards to a position where bears can hit the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcsell\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 button once again. Rallies in oil in recent months have only lasted a few days, and once talk of a deal dries up, the way will be clear for the downtrend to resume. More protests in Greece. Helena Smith reports: Unionists representing Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 35,000-strong nurses\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 federation have been protesting outside the finance ministry in the latest display of fury over the leftist-led government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s draft proposals overhauling the pension system. Nurses, who have been hard hit by austerity, starting with relentless rounds of wage cuts, have become increasingly vociferous in recent months. Many turned up in surgery outfits. The country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s union of civil servants (ADEDY) will stage a much bigger protest rally and march this evening to coincide with an extraordinary debate in parliament over the proposed measures. It will be the first time that prime minister Alexis Tsipras clashes in the 300-seat House with Kyriakos Mitsotakis, the newly-elected leader of New Democracy, the centre right main opposition party. The Harvard-educated erswhile banker, among the biggest champions of reform in Greece, has recently been leading polls. Odysseus Trivalas, who heads ADEDY, told me: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Without any prospect of growth or reduction in unemployment the proposed pension reforms are unsustainable. The government keeps saying without these measures the system will collapse but we argue that with contributions so low and unemployment so high it will collapse anyway if the government does not provide extra funding through the budget.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The funds should have been strengthened with all that money that was initially earmarked for the recapitalisation of banks. They didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t listen to us and now they will pay the price because these protests are not going to end soon.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Forecasts that Greek banks would need as much as \u00e2\u201a\u00ac25bn to withstand possible shocks proved to be vastly over-inflated when it was estimated in November that recapitalisation needs would not exceed more than \u00e2\u201a\u00ac5.7bn. Farmers, who have also taken to the streets, are expected to expand tractor roadblocks nationwide during a rowdy meeting of union heads currently taking place in Thessaloniki. They have signalled they would be likely to vote to cut off road links and customs terminals with Bulgaria and Turkey to the north and east - causing yet more financial havoc for Greece. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It is going to be very difficult for them to roll back without concrete promises by the government,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Travalas added. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We are all one group now, determined to stop this legislation going through.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd More US data, and this time it is more positive for the Federal Reserve. January\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s consumer confidence index came in at 98.1, better than the 96.5 expected and the 96.3 level in December. Dennis de Jong at UFX.com said: Despite global economic volatility, that US consumer confidence levels are higher than expected will be music to the ears of Fed Chair Janet Yellen. The US job market has surely contributed to the feel good vibe, with unemployment at a seven year low, in addition to sinking prices at the pumps providing consumer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s wallets with a much needed fillip. There are still dangers on the road ahead for Yellen and Co as global growth expectations have been downgraded and a strong dollar is starting to hurt US exports. However, considering the outlook for other major economies, Yellen has every right to be pleased with the start to the calendar year. The World Bank has cut its forecast for crude oil prices for 2016 by $14 a barrel to $37, and also reduced its predictions for 37 out of 46 commodities. Phillip Inman reports: The World Bank has slashed its forecast for oil prices this year, saying the cost of a barrel of crude will stay near its current lows for the rest of 2016. The Washington-based institution said a glut of oil that sent prices crashing by almost half last year and another 27% this month will continue to dominate the market for the next year. It added that warm winter weather in Europe and weaker than expected growth in China and other emerging economies will depress demand and keep the average price at $37 a barrel, down from a projection of $51 last October. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Low prices for oil and commodities are likely to be with us for some time,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said John Baffes, senior economist and lead author of the bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s commodities markets outlook. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153While we see some prospect for commodity prices to rise slightly over the next two years, significant downside risks remain.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Brent crude is currently up 1.1% at $30.85 a barrel. Here is our full story: More weak data for the US Federal Reserve to consider as it gathers for its first meeting since raising interest rates in December, a move many believe may have been a mistake. The US services sector has seen its slowest growth since December 2014. The Markit initial reading for the purchasing managers business activity index came in at 53.7 in January. This is down from 54.3 the previous month and just below the expected 53.9. Markit said: U.S. service providers started the year with another slowdown in business activity growth...Although still indicative of a solid increase in business activity, the headline index has now signalled weaker overall growth in four of the past five months. Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit said a drop in business confidence suggested things could get worse: The survey data paint an inauspicious start to the year for the US economy. A struggling manufacturing economy is being accompanied by a services sector where growth showed further signs of losing momentum in January even before the bad weather hit. The data are by no means disastrous, signalling a 1.5% annualised rate of economic growth at the start of the year, but the drop in business confidence to one of its lowest levels for over five years suggests that firms are bracing themselves for worse to come. Worries about financial market volatility, the impact of slower growth overseas, a downturn in the energy sector and uncertainty about higher interest rates all took their toll and set the scene for further weakness in coming months. On what has been a volatile day for markets so far, Wall Street has started off on the front foot ahead of results from Apple and as the Federal Reserve begins its latest two day meeting. With oil recovering from its early falls - Brent crude is now up 1.6% at $30.99 a barrel having fallen as low as $29.27 - the Dow Jones Industrial Average is up 133 points or 0.8% in early trading. In Europe the FTSE 100 is 0.15% higher while Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax, France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac and Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ibex have edged into positive territory despite the earlier 6% slump on the Chinese market. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy continues to grow pretty steadily, according to the Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chief economist Andy Haldane, and a Chinese slowdown is unlikely to push the world economy into negative growth. Haldane said in an interview with Wolverhampton\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Express and Star newspaper: We would have to fall a long way, or something very untoward would have to happen for that to fall into negative territory,. I think that is a reasonably unlikely event. Now are there things that could happen that could slow that rate of growth? Yes there are. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s true to say there are some concerns about how rapidly the Chinese economy is growing. These days China is of such a size and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sufficiently well integrated into the world economy that when it sneezes there is a sense at which the world economy is at risk of catching a cold. Does that mean there is a chance that world growth could slow from current levels? Yes, there is a chance of that. Do I think there is a big risk of us being tipped into negative growth in the world economy? That strikes me as quite unlikely as things sit today. Meanwhile, as Carney was speaking, the World Economic Forum has announced the Bank of England governor as one of eight \u00e2\u20ac\u0153senior decision makers\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd joining a taskforce to discuss the future of the global financial system. The group was formed at the request of Carney and WEF founder professor Klaus Schwab and it will \u00e2\u20ac\u0153work to identify, analyse and propose recommendations in response to major transformative forces influencing the future of global finance and economics.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd A recent WEF document identified five areas which the taskforce could discuss in its first meeting: emerging markets, technologyi, regulatory and monetary policies, loss of trust in financial services and financial inclusion. Apart from Carney the other members of the taskforce are Citgroup chief executive Michael Corbat; Blackrock chairman Laurence Fink; HSBC chairman Douglas Flint; Bank of America chairman Brian Moynihan; Raghuram Rajan, governor of the Reserve Bank of India; Min Zhu, deputy managing director of the IMF; and Liu Mingkang, economics and finance fellow at the Chinese University of Hong Kong. Why is governor Mark Carney worrying about the current account deficit anyway? The current account is significant, as it shows the balance between the goods, services and financial transactions into, and out of, the UK. Britain has been running a persistent deficit for some time -- dubbed the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcinvisible deficit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, as the financial markets have been relaxed about it. But historically, countries with large current account deficits have often been hit with currency crises, as investors eventually lose faith and stop buying your assets. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s what Mark Carney means when he mentions the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153kindness of strangers\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. A currency depreciation can actually help fix a current account deficit, as it makes imports unpleasantly expensive while helping exporters compete. But as our economics editor Larry Elliot has argued, Britain doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have the manufacturing base to really profit from a Sterling crisis. So if international investors decide not to buy UK assets, or hold the pound, if Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s EU membership is in doubt, there could be a problem..... A quick recap of the main points from the Governor of the Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s appearance at parliament: 1) Mark Carney warned that Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s current account deficit is still a risk to financial stability, due to the current market instability and the looming referendum on EU membership. He warned that: First, the general global environment has been much more febrile, much more volatile. Relying on the kindness of strangers is not optimal in that type of environment, and that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s what is the case when you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re running a 4%, 4.5% current account deficit. And secondly, the possibility of a risk premium being attached to UK assets because of certain developments exists. And that plays into the riskiness of the situation. Carney also agreed that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153material decisions\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd can have an impact on financial stability, when questioned about Brexit. 2) Carney gave a clear hint that he might stay at the Bank of England for longer than planned. The governor\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s five-year term expires in July 2018, and he will decide this year whether to plump for a full eight-year term. I guess this is a new form of forward guidance.... If he does, Carney would return to the jobs market just as the IMF\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s top job comes up. #MediaSpeculation 3) Carney said the Federal Reserve\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s interest rate hike last month has added to the turbulence in the market. He said that domestic inflation pressure justified the hike, but cautioned that policymakers need to be aware that safe-haven currencies, and riskier ones, could both be buffeted as commodity prices tumble. 4) Carney said there is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153no concern\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd at present, about direct or indirect stresses on UK banks. He argues that new capital rules, designed to bail in investors, should protect the system. 5) Carney also pointed out that OPEC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ability to influence the oil prices isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t what it was (as the plunge in the Brent crude oil price shows us) 6) Carney has also talked himself into a trip to the cinema. Hopefully The Big Short won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t give him any flashbacks Stock markets have recovered some of their early losses. The FTSE 100 is now down just 28 points, or 0.5%, having been down almost 100 points earlier. On a lighter note, Wes Streeting then asks Mark Carney if he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s seen The Big Short, the new film of Michael Lewis\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s excellent book about the US sub-prime crash that almost brought down Wall Street. I feel like I lived it, Carney replies [he was running the Bank of Canada at the time] I haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t seen it, but I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m sure I will. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m happy to go. The question was prompted by Paul Waugh of the Huffington Post: A bottle of wine for any reader who spots the Carneys at their local Odeon. Q: Has the MPC or FPC gathered any information on how negative interest rates might affect the UK economy? We have thought more carefully about where the zero lower bound is, Carney replies. [ie, could they cut rates below the current record low of 0.5%?] But the actual question of negative interest rates, and the impact on the financial system, has not arisen, as we don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think that is the prospect. Labour MP Wes Streeting asks Carney whether the Treasury has ever leant on him over banking regulations. No, and it wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t make a difference if it tried, Carney replies. Q: And is the bank worried about recent elections in Spain and Portugal, given the relative instability of the governments which arose? Carney says the latest financial stability report concluded that the biggest risk had moved from advanced economies to emerging economies. He still thinks that is still the case. Rachel Reeves MP asks Carney about Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s current account deficit, and the implications on UK trade if it leaves the EU. Q: Is the UK current account a growing risk, a declining risk, or a stable risk? And do you think Brexit would make it more or less of a risk? Carney says the current account deficit has gone down somewhat, and the improvement in the European economy should mean our net foreign income improves (as Britain exports more across the Channel). But he won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t say that the riskiness has not gone down, for two reasons: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153First, the general global environment has been much more febrile, much more volatile. Relying on the kindness of strangers is not optimal in that type of environment, and that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s what is the case when you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re running a 4%, 4.5% current account deficit. And secondly, the possibility of a risk premium being attached to UK assets because of certain developments exists. And that plays into the riskiness of the situation. Carney didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t define \u00e2\u20ac\u02dccertain developments\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, but it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pretty clear what he meant. Credit Suisse, the Swiss bank, warned yesterday that investors would probably demand a considerably higher risk premium to hold UK assets if the public voted to leave the EU. John Mann MP demands to know whether Carney had any role in the decision to abandon Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s review of banking culture. This decision was taken entirely by the FCA, Carney replies. We have nothing to apologise for regarding our handling of UK bank culture, Carney continues, adding that the BoE isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t yet satisfied with bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s responses to questions about their conduct. Mark Carney is asked whether Britain would face financial instability if it votes to leave the EU. The governor says the Bank will reveal its precautionary measures \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcafter the fact\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. Speaking carefully (to avoid saying anything too controversial) he adds that material decisions can have an impact on financial stability, but doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t give a particular view on Brexit. Carney also denies that central bankers hope the oil price goes up, to push inflation higher. Q: Can OPEC survive the slump in the oil price? Mark Carney says that OPEC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ability to influence the global supply has been diminished, given technical developments and increased supply sources (eg US shale gas). But the competitive position of the major opec suppliers, especially Saudi Arabia, is unrivalled as they can produce oil cheaper than many others. So one scenario is that OPEC has some influence, but at a lower price point. Back in the committee room, Mark Carney has been fielding questions about market turbulence, and the oil price. We are in an environment of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153heightened risk aversion\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd which could continue for some time, says the BoE governor. And that will effect currencies that are seen as safe (the US dollar, the Swiss franc), and those that are riskier (emerging market currencies). Authorities need to bear this in mind. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a piece of idle speculation..... If Mark Carney does change his mind and serve a full eight years at the Bank of England, he would leave the BoE at the end of June 2021. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also the summer when the managing directorship of the International Monetary Fund becomes vacant. Christine Lagarde appears to be nailed-on to do a second five-year term, starting in July 2016. When he arrived in London, the talk was that Carney fancied a move into Canadian politics. The prime minister-ship is now in Justin Trudeau\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s youthful hands, and could stay there for some time. Having run two central banks (UK and Canada), and also chaired the Financial Stability Board, Carney would be well-qualified to run the International Monetary Fund. It would also break the European hold on the top job at the IMF, without giving it to an American. Looking away from the select committee.... Tesco has been ordered to improve the way it deals with suppliers. An official inquiry into the 2014 scandal around Tesco\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s financial results found that the supermarket has delayed payments to suppliers, to support its profits. Christine Tacon, the Grocery Code Adjudicator, was damning about Tesco\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s behaviour, saying: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I was troubled to see Tesco at times prioritising its own finances over treating suppliers fairly.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s some reaction: Now the Treasury Committee has moved onto the new rules to handle failed banks, which will see bond-holders \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcbailed in\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 to cover the costs of a rescue. Q: When will the system be ready, and will it work? Carney says several things need to happen. 1) Banks need to refinance debt, so that their \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcbail-in-able debt\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 is in the right place within the organisation, to cover the cost of failure. 2) The holders of the debt need to know that they can be bailed in - he doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want retail bond investors to be surprised that they are now shareholders. 3) That knowledge will creates an incentive on bond-holders to ensure that banks hold enough equity to handle problems. The aim is to be ready by 2019, says Carney, so that the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcring-fenced\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, systemically important banks are protected and can keep running after a collapse, if needed. This process will cost billions, and it will push up funding costs. But that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the price of avoiding another huge taxpayer-funded bailout. Q: But could the markets freeze up, leaving banks unable to protect themselves? Carney says he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s met with many bank chiefs recently (including, I suspect, at Davos), and confirmed they are on track with building up the capital buffers they need. He argues that there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s very little chance of one bank failure causing a systemic failure. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s more likely to be triggered by a general shock to the economy. Right now, he insists, there are no concerns about direct or indirect stresses on major banks. Q: Carney is then asked who, if anyone, he consulted before giving a speech last week saying that it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not time to raise interest rates? I wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t clear a speech with anyone before giving my personal view, Carney replies. Q: But did you discuss it with anyone on the MPC (monetary policy committee)? All draft speeches by MPC members are circulated in advance, as a courtesy, says Carney. And he denies that he said rates would definitely stay on hold for some time (as some papers reported) Q: So was the speech also shared with members of the FPC? (financial policy committee)? It wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t - MPC speeches aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t typically shared with the FPC beforehand. Q: Was the Federal Reserve right to raise interest rates in December? Carney gives a long answer, arguing there is solid growth at the core of advanced economies. And domestic inflation pressures merited the change in monetary policy, he argues. Q: But did the rate hike cause the turmoil in the financial markets in recent weeks? The governor says that it was not the fundamental cause, but it did contribute to it. Andrew Tyrie, chairman of the Treasury Committee, then asks Mark Carney if he is reconsidering his decision to only serve five years at the Bank of England. Could he now decide to serve the full eight years? Carney smiles, then replies that he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s certainly not planning to leave and follow Andrew Bailey to the FCA. We are making progress at the Bank of England, but there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s more work to do, the governor says. And if I were to request a longer term, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d probably have to do so by the end of this. Carney is half-way through his five-year term. Tyrie says it would be valuable to know as soon as possible whether Carney might change his mind, and seek a longer stint at the Bank of England. The session begins with Mark Carney paying tribute to Andrew Bailey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s career at the Bank of England. It will probably take three to six months to appoint a new deputy governor to replace Bailey. There is no designated successor, Carney adds. So get your application ready, readers Heads-up: Mark Carney, governor of the Bank of England, is about to start taking questions from the Treasury Committee. The session is being streamed live here. Looking back at the markets quickly... the FTSE 100 is still deep in the red, down 64 points or 1% at 5812. Oil is recovering some of its early losses, but it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s still down around 2% at $29.91 per barrel. George Osborne has really surprised the City by announcing Andrew Bailey as the new head of the FCA. Bank of England governor Mark Carney says he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a fine choice (although would he really say anything else?....) Andrew is an extraordinary public servant who has devoted his entire professional life to serving the people of the United Kingdom. During his career, he has worked across all of the Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s policy areas, combining leadership and innovation to deliver consistently the Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s policy objectives. His work in helping to manage the crisis and then to develop the post-crisis regulatory framework has been exemplary. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s some instant reaction: Newsflash: Britain has a new City regulator. Andrew Bailey, the deputy governor of the Bank of England, has just been named as the new chief executive of the Financial Conduct Authority. He replaces Martin Wheatley, who was ousted by chancellor George Osborne last July. Bailey has been in charge of prudential regulation at the Bank of England - trying to sure that banks stick to the rules, and avoid the damaging risks that caused the 2008 financial crisis. Osborne\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision to sent Wheatley packing last year has been seen as a sign that the British government was taking a friendlier approach to the City. Here are a couple of photos from China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s brokerage houses, as investors watched the market tumble by 6%. Analysts are divided over the severity of the Chinese slowdown. Yogi Dewan, founder of Hassium Asset Management (a wealth management firm) told Bloomberg TV that China is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153slowing, not melting down\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. He argues that Beijing are taking some \u00e2\u20ac\u0153very positive\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd steps, including devaluing the yuan and building close financial links with Europe. But Joseph Oughourlian of Amber Capital Investment Management is less optimistic. He is steering clear of companies who benefitted from China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s investment boom over the last 15 years. FXTM Research Analyst Lukman Otunuga says investors are worried that capital will continue to ooze out of China, as people try to escape its slowing economy: A re-established wave of risk aversion gripped Asian equities sending most into red territory, while elevated fears that China capital outflows may accelerate as the economy decelerates has sent the Shanghai Composite Index diving -6.3% lower, to levels not seen in 13 months. With days like today continuing to come back to haunt the Shanghai Composite Index, the Chinese New Year period and the trading break couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t come soon enough. Shares in easyJet have dropped by 2%, after the company reported that recent terror attacks have weakened demand. The budget airline said revenue suffered after November\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Paris terror attack, and the bombing of a plane flying form Egypt\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Sharm el-Sheikh. The recent market turmoil has also been a mixed blessing for the airline. The fall in the oil price will save it \u00c2\u00a3180m on fuel costs, however currency moves will wipe out \u00c2\u00a350m. In other words, easyJet needs fewer dollars to pay for fuel, but it needs to stump up more pounds to buy the dollars first.... Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s selloff comes nearly a week after global markets slumped into bear market territory, triggering alarm around the world: Simon Smith, chief economist at currency trading firm FXPro, fears that more market turbulence is coming. He writes: Chinese indices are 6% lower overnight, Japanese over 2% in the red and oil is back below 30 bucks a barrel. Volatility has been rising throughout the year so far but we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re still someway off the big spike in the Vix (volatility index or \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcfear gauge\u00e2\u20ac\u2122) last August and so there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s potential for moves in markets to get even more dramatic. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s selloff has been triggered by the slide in the oil price, as well as the Chinese market mayhem. Tony Cross of Trustnet Direct explains: Crude is sliding on renewed oversupply fears and even the building narrative we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re seeing from Opec that they are ready to strike a deal with other producer nations \u00e2\u20ac\u201c possibly centred around Russia \u00e2\u20ac\u201c doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t really appear to be lending any support to the equation, at least not yet. The gold price has jumped by 1%, as money pours out of shares and into safe-haven assets. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s usually a sign that investors are worried. Other European markets are also falling, with France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s CAC down 1.6% and the German DAX shedding 1.3%: The FTSE 100 index of major UK companies has fallen by 87 points at the start of trading, or 1.4%, to 5789 Almost every share is falling, as traders face another day of volatile trading dominated by fears over the global economy. BP and Royal Dutch Shell are both down around 3%, mirroring today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sliding oil price. Mining companies are also suffering, reflecting worries about China. Commodity trader Glencore has shed 3.5%, and Anglo American (which produces iron ore, copper, nickel etc) is down 3.2% Almost every share on the Chinese stock market was hit by today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rout, with only four gaining ground. A late wave of selling has gripped the Shanghai stock market, sending shares slumping and triggering new angst in financial markets worldwide. China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s benchmark index, the CSI 300, shed 188 points or 6.02% to finish the day at 2940. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s its lowest level since December 2014. Scores of shares were suspended after falling 10%, the maximum allowed under Chinese stock market regulations. The Shanghai market tumbled by 6.4%, the biggest daily loss since the first week of 2015. The selloff, which helped to drive oil down, came after new economic data showed that China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rail freight volume dropped by 11.9% last year, compared to 2014. That fuelled fears that China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy is slowing faster than official figures show. The crude oil price has lurched back through $30 per barrel. Brent crude has slumped by 3% this morning, and is changing hands at $29.61 per barrel. The selloff is partly being driven by oversupply fears, with OPEC members sticking to their guns and keeping pumping in an apparent attempt to drive other suppliers out of business. Kit Juckes of French bank Soci\u00c3\u00a9t\u00c3\u00a9 G\u00c3\u00a9n\u00c3\u00a9rale says the weak oil price will add to the gloomy mood in the markets: The fall in oil prices will make most of the headlines and drive most of the movement in markets today, unless it is reversed for no particularly good reason. The latest driver is the news that Iraqi oil output is strong. US production remains the key swing on supply and is what will eventually trigger a turn. But it will take hard news about declining US output to shift the market mood. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. It looks like being another \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcchallenging\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 day in the markets. Asia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s two-day rally has hit the wall, with most markets falling. Japan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Nikkei just closed down 2.4%, and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re expecting European stock markets to fall at the open (8an GMT). The surge of optimism which pushed shares higher at the end of last week has dissolved, in the face of worries about deflation and economic slowdown. In the corporate sector, budget airline easyJet and high street tech chain Dixons Carphone are releasing results. Mark Carney, Governor of the Bank of England, is testifying to MPs this morning about the BoE\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s financial stability report, from 10am GMT. And we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll have an eye on Greece, where unions are expected to hold a protest rally in Athens today against pension cuts. That comes as We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be tracking all the main events through the day....",

So the statement accompanying the rate decision is likely to be scrutinised for clues as to the Fed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s latest thinking.</p> <p>It must surely acknowledge the market slump and fears of a global downturn which have increased since December, and may even hint that it no longer expects three or four more rate rises this year. The wording of its comments on the current state of the global economy will be key, but analysts are divided on what the Fed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tone will be.</p> <p>Simon Smith, chief economist at FXPro said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>All eyes will be back on the Federal Reserve today as they make their first interest rate decision and monetary policy statement of the year but there are no economic projections or press conference this time round, which come at the next meeting in March. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve seen a rise in risk appetite in this final week of January which so far has been a bit of a blood bath, although the recovery from lows in many indices has softened the blow for many investors. This has come as a result of a bounce in oil prices but also a growing expectation that central banks will have to do more to support the global economy.</p> <p>Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Fed meeting as a result is likely to see a more dovish tone to it, especially since the market consensus is that we will see fewer rate hikes this year than the Fed is currently pencilling in.</p> <p>Even though we saw a higher than expected rise in US consumer confidence yesterday a big warning shot has come from one of the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest companies Apple which saw its first fall in revenue since 2003.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a59eec51d6b478c60d8d80577479b838861028df\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a59eec51d6b478c60d8d80577479b838861028df/0_0_3942_2366/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Fed chair Janet Yellen.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Fed chair Janet Yellen.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Susan Walsh/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But lya Spivak, currency strategist at DailyFX, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The rate-setting FOMC committee is broadly expected to keep the benchmark lending rate unchanged this time around. Indeed, priced-in probability of an increase is a mere 14.3%. This puts the spotlight on the text of the statement accompanying the rate decision and the forward guidance contained therein.</p> <p>Investors appear positioned for a dovish outcome having scaled back 2016 tightening bets amid risk aversion since the beginning of the year...</p> <p>For its part, the Fed will have to attempt a difficult balancing act. On one hand, it will have to acknowledge recent market turmoil as well as softening US growth dynamics in the final months of 2015. On the other, it will have to re-focus investors\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 attention on mandate-relevant fundamentals and establish the possibility of tightening in March. This is necessary so that such a move, if deemed appropriate, does not trigger an overly violent response.</p> <p>On balance, the case for policy normalization remains compelling. Realized and expected inflation is firming: the latest readings on core year-on-year CPI and hourly earnings growth registered at multi-year highs while 2-3 year breakeven rates have trended upward since August. On the jobs front, the unemployment rate is at the lowest level since 2008 and nonfarm payrolls growth is running at a reasonably brisk pace, with the 12-month trend average at 220k.</p> <p>This means that the Fed statement will have to reassure investors that it will adjust policy if market stress infects the real economy. In the same breath, it will have to explain that as of now, the projected rate hike path has not materially changed since the first post-QE rate hike in December. </p> <p>The markets\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 subsequent reaction will depend on the degree of wishful thinking that traders are prepared to entertain. If they emphasize the first point \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a possible result considering the dovish shift in expectations in spite of the aforementioned fundamental evidence \u00e2\u20ac\u201c risk appetite is likely to strengthen. This will see the stocks rising alongside sentiment-geared currencies like the Australian and New Zealand Dollars while the greenback as well as the anti-risk Euro and Yen decline. A focus on the second point will probably deliver the opposite result.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-56a8d4fbe4b0de317fbefc60\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-01-27T14:36:36.263Z\">2.36pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Wall Street opens lower</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>As investors await the latest US oil inventory figures and the outcome of this month\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Federal Reserve meeting, Wall Street is on the slide again.</p> <p>In early trading the Dow Jones Industrial Average has fallen 113 points or 0.7%, partly due to Apple which is down 3.8% at $96.24 following its disappointing figures.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-56a8d28fe4b027b9c9e83740\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-01-27T14:22:49.756Z\">2.22pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Ahead of the start of US trading, here are some opening calls:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/RANsquawk/statuses/692351571607298048\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"in\" dir=\"ltr\">US Pre-market movers:&#10;<a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%24CAPN&amp;src=ctag\">$CAPN</a> +34.9%&#10;<a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%24RPTP&amp;src=ctag\">$RPTP</a> +12.1%&#10;<a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%24BIIB&amp;src=ctag\">$BIIB</a> +5.4%&#10;<a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%24SUNE&amp;src=ctag\">$SUNE</a> +4.9%&#10;<a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%24TEX&amp;src=ctag\">$TEX</a> +3.2%&#10;<a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%24BBBY&amp;src=ctag\">$BBBY</a> -2.9%&#10;<a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%24AAPL&amp;src=ctag\">$AAPL</a> -3.1%&#10;<a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%24FCAU&amp;src=ctag\">$FCAU</a> -5%&#10;<a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%24BA&amp;src=ctag\">$BA</a> -6.7%&#10;<a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%24X&amp;src=ctag\">$X</a> -7.7%</p>&mdash; RANsquawk (@RANsquawk) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/RANsquawk/status/692351571607298048\">January 27, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>Note Apple is quoted as falling more than 3%.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-56a8ce3ae4b00acfaea29c4e\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-01-27T14:11:08.536Z\">2.11pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Oil has come back from its worst levels of the day, on renewed hopes that Opec and other producers such as Russia would act to stem the supply glut which has hit prices.</strong></p> <p>Brent crude is now down 0.8% at $31.52 a barrel having fallen to $30.83 earlier.

                "bodyText":"And finally.... Wall Street has ended the night on the back foot, after being underwhelmed by the Federal Reserve. The Dow Jones shed 222 points, or almost 1.4%, to close at 15,944.46. The S&amp;P 500 index, which covers a wider range of companies, lost over 1% while the tech-heavy Nasdaq slid by over 2%. Investors have noted the Fed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s dovish stance, and recognised that the central bank is anxious about the global economy and the market turmoil. But policymakers still see the US economy recovering, which could mean it still raises borrowing costs later this year.... Anyway, we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll back in the morning, London time, for more reaction. Good night, GW Facebook also posted some highly impressive mobile advertising revenue: Some late breaking news... Facebook appears to have smashed forecasts. The social network has posted earnings of 79 cents per share, compared to expectations of 68 cents. And Wall Street loves it, sending shares leaping in afterhours trading. David Zervos, Chief Market Strategist at Jefferies, is telling Bloomberg TV that the Fed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s statement was quite comforting. But the markets are still being driven by fluctuations in the oil price, and fears over emerging markets, he adds. Zervos says: Markets are still bouncing around on oil, still bouncing around on China. So what could turn the markets around? Signs that the US economy is still doing well, and not entering recession. Our news story on the Fed decision is now live: Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a flavour: The Federal Reserve is keeping a key interest rate unchanged while pledging to closely monitor developments in the global economy and financial markets. In December the central bank made the decision to raise rates for the first time since the recession. Stock markets have been turbulent across the world since the move, and all the US markets entered negative territory again after the announcement. The policymakers left their benchmark rate unchanged in a range of 0.25% to 0.5%. Until December, they had kept that rate at record lows. The Fed noted in its latest policy statement that economic growth has slowed since it raised rates from record lows: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The [Fed] is closely monitoring global economic and financial developments and is assessing their implications for the labor market and inflation, and for the balance of risks to the outlook.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The changes in its statement signaled that the Fed could be prepared to slow future rate hikes if recent market turbulence and global weakness do not abate..... (click here for more). The selloff is picking up pace, with the Dow Jones industrial average now down over 1%. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not all down to the Fed, though. Apple has shed 6% after last night\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s disappointing results showed that iPhone sales have slowed. Paul Ashworth, chief US economist at Capital Economics, also points out that the Fed is no longer willing to describe the risks to the outlook as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153balanced\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd (as covered here). He writes: As expected, the new statement acknowledged the apparent slowdown in activity growth in the fourth quarter. The growth of consumption and business investment is now described as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153moderate\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd whereas back in December it was described as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153solid\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. The slowdown in inventory investment also receives an explicit reference. At the same time, the Fed stressed that labourmarket conditions \u00e2\u20ac\u0153improved further\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd with \u00e2\u20ac\u0153strong\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd job gains. Ashworth reckons that economic data, and financial markets, may not improve in time to allow a rates to rise in March. But he still expects a string of hikes later in the year. Nevertheless, we still think that once the worst fears about China blow over and US economic growth rebounds, the Fed will end up raising interest rates more rapidly that expected in the second half of this year. We expect the fed funds rate to reach 1.50% to 1.75% by end-2016. The Fed is primarily worried about China, argues Worth Wray, chief economist at wealth management firm Evergreen GaveKal. One expert reckons the Fed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s statement guarantees more market turbulence in the next six weeks: This month\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Fed meeting was always going to be all about the statement, given the FOMC bit the bullet and raised borrowing costs for the first time since the crisis in December. The tone of the Fed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s comments set the tone for the next few weeks -- and the statement is being taken as quite dovish. Chris Beauchamp, Senior Market Analyst at City trading firm IG, explains: Markets got the more dovish tone they were hoping for, with the Fed noting slowing economic growth and tipping its hat towards the idea that inflation won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t rise towards 2% as fast as it thought in December. This doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t mean a March move is out of the question, but the reference to global economic developments means that there will have to be plenty more improvement in the US economy before one is a definite possibility. With the risks to the economy no longer seen as \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcbalanced\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 this is a Fed committee drawing in its horns. It was never going to admit that December\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s move was a mistake, but today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s statement acknowledges that it is not time to get carried away with rate hikes. Matthew Boesler of Bloomberg says the Fed is taking the recent stock market losses seriously, without panicking. Brett House, chief economist of US investment management firm Alignvest, reckons the Fed won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t raise rates four times this year (as it had been expecting). Financial commentator Bobi Petrov reckons rates will remain on hold at the Fed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s next meeting, in early March. The Fed also doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t see inflation roaring away this year - hardly surprising, given the oil price tumble. Tonight\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s statement says: Inflation is expected to remain low in the near term, in part because of the further declines in energy prices, but to rise to 2 percent over the medium term as the transitory effects of declines in energy and import prices dissipate and the labor market strengthens further This is a useful tool, showing some of the changes to this month\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s statement: Note how jobs growth is now \u00e2\u20ac\u0153strong\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd after this month\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s blowout non-farm payroll report showed 292,000 new hirings in December. Stocks are falling on Wall Street as traders digest tonight\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s statement. Not immediately clear why - but investors may be concerned that the Fed has dropped that line about economic risks being balanced. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a significant change between this statement and December\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s one. The Fed has dropped the line saying that the risks to economic activity and the labour market are \u00e2\u20ac\u0153balanced\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. That suggests the Fed thinks the situation has become unbalanced.... You can read the statement online, here. The Fed is also sticking to its view that interest rates will only rise gradually, meaning borrowing costs will remain below the long-term average for some time. But it all depends on the data..... However, the actual path of the federal funds rate will depend on the economic outlook as informed by incoming data. The decision was unanimous -- all 10 members of the Federal Reserve Open Market Committee agreed to leave borrowing costs unchanged. Again, that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not a surprise. The US central bank also reckons that the American economy is continuing to heal. The statement says: Household spending and business fixed investment have been increasing at moderate rates in recent months, and the housing sector has improved further; however, net exports have been soft and inventory investment slowed. A range of recent labor market indicators, including strong job gains, points to some additional decline in underutilization of labor resources The Federal Reserve says it is keeping a close eye on the global economy, and financial markets. In tonight\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s statement, is says: The Committee is closely monitoring global economic and financial developments and is assessing their implications for the labor market and inflation, and for the balance of risks to the outlook. That means the Fed is considering the impact on recent market turmoil, and the fall in the oil price, on the US economy and the path of inflation. In the least surprising news of 2016, the US central bank has left borrowing costs unchanged. The policy rate remains at 0.25% to 0.5%. OK, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s nearly time for the Federal Reserve to announce this month\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s monetary policy decision. Remember, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s all about the Fed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s statement - Wall Street is certain that Janet Yellen isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t going to raise interest rates again..... Ahead of the Federal Reserve\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s interest rate setting meeting, and following a rise in the oil price, European shares have ended the day on a positive note. With hopes of co-operation between oil producers - notable Opec and Russia - to tackle the issue of oversupply, Brent crude has jumped 3.6% to $32.96. The rise comes despite a jump in US crude inventories. The closing scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished 78.91 points or 1.33% higher at 5990.37 Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax added 0.59% to 9880.82 France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac climbed 0.54% to 4380.36 Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ibex ended up 0.56% at 8741.0 Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB was an exception, dipping 0.4% to 18,848.03 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently 34 points or 0.22% higher. Another reason for the day\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s strength in the oil price: Russia has said it discussed co-operation with Opec over crude prices. Reuters reports: Russia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s energy ministry said possible coordination between Russia and the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) was discussed at a meeting with Russian oil companies on Wednesday. The ministry said the discussion was related to unfavourable oil prices. There is also talk of an emergency Opec meeting in February. Despite its share price fall, Apple is still top of the pile in value terms: Markets are moving higher on the back of the improvement in the oil price. Tony Cross, market analyst at Trustnet Direct said: The threat of the early sell-off for oil prices this morning failed to materialise with crude bouncing above the $30 mark and this has in turn lent a raft of support to equity markets on both sides of the Atlantic. Even what could at best be described as a mixed bag in terms of US oil inventory data has failed to knock sentiment so London\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE-100 is rounding off the day \u00e2\u20ac\u201c where we tested highs not seen for two weeks \u00e2\u20ac\u201c with a bullish tone. Next up however it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the latest Federal Reserve Open Market Committee meeting and anything that is interpreted as being overly hawkish here could readily unseat equity markets globally that are still clearly rattled by recent events. Elsewhere, US crude stocks rose to their highest level on record - ie back to 1930 - last week while gasoline stocks increased but inventories of distillates fell. The figure for distillates, which include heating oil, follows the cold front hitting the country in the past few days. Distillate inventories fell by 4.1m barrels compared to expectations of a near 2m fall. But crude stocks climbed by 8.4m barrels last week, well above expectations of a 3.3m increase, to 494.9m, the highest level since the Energy Information Administration began compiling records. Refinery crude runs fell by 551,000 barrels a day. Gasoline stocks climbed by 3.5m barrels compared to forecsats of a 1.5m increase. But despite the rises, Brent crude is up 0.79% at $32.05 a barrel. Joshua Mahony, market analyst at IG, said: US crude oil inventories rose by the highest level since April 2015 last week, pushing overall oil in storage to near levels not seen in 80 years for this time of year. Crucially, we did see domestic production fall ever so slightly. This distinction highlights the reaction in global trade, which has seen oil prices rise off the back of seemingly bearish headline data. With sentiment driven by record output from Iraq and Russia, alongside the entry of Iran on the mainstream oil market, any news that US output is starting to turn lower is certainly welcome for oil bulls. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our take on the libor verdicts: Five of the six brokers were acquitted of conspiring to rig Libor, reports Reuters. The jury also reached a not guilty verdict on one count of conspiracy to defraud for former Icap broker Darrell Read, said Reuters, but it has yet to reach a verdict on a second count. The judge has asked the jury to reach a majority verdict. The six brokers on trial were Darrell Read, Danny Wilkinson and Colin Goodman from Icap, Noel Cryan from Tullett Prebon, and Jim Gilmour and Terry Farr from RP Martin. Five out of six brokers accused of manipulating libor bank rates have been acquitted of fraud at Southwark crown court. A jury is still discussing one count against one of them, but the others have been freed. The six were accused of conspiring with Tom Hayes and others in a trial brought by the Serious Fraud Office which has lasted 15 weeks. But a jury took just a day to acquit them. The Federal Reserve is holding its first meeting since December\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s now-contentious decision to raise interest rates for the first time in nearly a decade. The subsequent market turmoil, focused on a slowdown in China and the tumbling oil price, has made many wonder whether the Fed was a bit premature in pulling the rate trigger. The Fed is highly unlikely to change rates at this meeting, and there is no press conference for Fed chair Janet Yellen to be quizzed about her thoughts on the aftermath of last month\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s move. So the statement accompanying the rate decision is likely to be scrutinised for clues as to the Fed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s latest thinking. It must surely acknowledge the market slump and fears of a global downturn which have increased since December, and may even hint that it no longer expects three or four more rate rises this year. The wording of its comments on the current state of the global economy will be key, but analysts are divided on what the Fed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tone will be. Simon Smith, chief economist at FXPro said: All eyes will be back on the Federal Reserve today as they make their first interest rate decision and monetary policy statement of the year but there are no economic projections or press conference this time round, which come at the next meeting in March. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve seen a rise in risk appetite in this final week of January which so far has been a bit of a blood bath, although the recovery from lows in many indices has softened the blow for many investors. This has come as a result of a bounce in oil prices but also a growing expectation that central banks will have to do more to support the global economy. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Fed meeting as a result is likely to see a more dovish tone to it, especially since the market consensus is that we will see fewer rate hikes this year than the Fed is currently pencilling in. Even though we saw a higher than expected rise in US consumer confidence yesterday a big warning shot has come from one of the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest companies Apple which saw its first fall in revenue since 2003. But lya Spivak, currency strategist at DailyFX, said: The rate-setting FOMC committee is broadly expected to keep the benchmark lending rate unchanged this time around. Indeed, priced-in probability of an increase is a mere 14.3%. This puts the spotlight on the text of the statement accompanying the rate decision and the forward guidance contained therein. Investors appear positioned for a dovish outcome having scaled back 2016 tightening bets amid risk aversion since the beginning of the year... For its part, the Fed will have to attempt a difficult balancing act. On one hand, it will have to acknowledge recent market turmoil as well as softening US growth dynamics in the final months of 2015. On the other, it will have to re-focus investors\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 attention on mandate-relevant fundamentals and establish the possibility of tightening in March. This is necessary so that such a move, if deemed appropriate, does not trigger an overly violent response. On balance, the case for policy normalization remains compelling. Realized and expected inflation is firming: the latest readings on core year-on-year CPI and hourly earnings growth registered at multi-year highs while 2-3 year breakeven rates have trended upward since August. On the jobs front, the unemployment rate is at the lowest level since 2008 and nonfarm payrolls growth is running at a reasonably brisk pace, with the 12-month trend average at 220k. This means that the Fed statement will have to reassure investors that it will adjust policy if market stress infects the real economy. In the same breath, it will have to explain that as of now, the projected rate hike path has not materially changed since the first post-QE rate hike in December. The markets\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 subsequent reaction will depend on the degree of wishful thinking that traders are prepared to entertain. If they emphasize the first point \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a possible result considering the dovish shift in expectations in spite of the aforementioned fundamental evidence \u00e2\u20ac\u201c risk appetite is likely to strengthen. This will see the stocks rising alongside sentiment-geared currencies like the Australian and New Zealand Dollars while the greenback as well as the anti-risk Euro and Yen decline. A focus on the second point will probably deliver the opposite result. As investors await the latest US oil inventory figures and the outcome of this month\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Federal Reserve meeting, Wall Street is on the slide again. In early trading the Dow Jones Industrial Average has fallen 113 points or 0.7%, partly due to Apple which is down 3.8% at $96.24 following its disappointing figures. Ahead of the start of US trading, here are some opening calls: Note Apple is quoted as falling more than 3%. Oil has come back from its worst levels of the day, on renewed hopes that Opec and other producers such as Russia would act to stem the supply glut which has hit prices. Brent crude is now down 0.8% at $31.52 a barrel having fallen to $30.83 earlier. But US inventory figures due later will undoubtedly have an impact on the price, not to mention the Federal Reserve rate setting meeting and any effect the US central bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s comments have on the dollar. Meanwhile the recovery in crude has helped support stock markets. Both the FTSE 100 and Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax are marginally in positive territory after earlier falls, while France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac is only narrowly down. US futures are showing a 57 point decline on the Dow Jones Industrial Average after Tuesday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 282 point surge. Apple\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shares will of course be in focus after its disappointing update. Ben van Beurden is upbeat about today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s vote, despite the small revolt. Shell\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s CEO says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I am delighted with the positive shareholder vote and the confidence that shareholders have shown in the strategic logic of the combination of Shell and BG. Our immediate focus is on the successful completion of the transaction and we now await the results of tomorrow\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s BG shareholder vote. Assuming BG\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shareholders approve the deal (they will), Shell will become the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest liquefied natural gas (LNG) trader. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s worth reiterating that 17% of Shell shareholders opposed the BG merger at today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s vote. That suggests that some big City investors have reservations about the deal, despite Shell chief Ben van Beurden\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s best efforts to persuade them of its merits. Standard Life was the only large investor to go public - their head of equities, David Cumming, reckoned the deal only made sense when oil was over $60 per barrel, not $30ish. But Standard Life owned less than 2% of the company, so others have clearly found the deal too risky. Our financial editor, Nils Pratley, reminds me that even Royal Bank of Scotland\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s disastrous merger with ABN Amro in October 2007 got the support of 99% of shareholders (who then suffered huge losses). So a 17% revolt may sting, a little. Thousands of workers at Shell and BG now face the axe, once the merger goes through. Shell announced last month that it will cut around 2,800 positions, or some 3% of the combined company. Newsflash from The Hague - Royal Dutch Shell shareholders have just voted in favour of its \u00c2\u00a335bn merger with rival oil firm BG. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s despite pressure from some shareholders to renegotiate the tie-up, which was negotiated before the oil price slumped to just $30 per barrel. During the meeting, Shell chief executive Ben van Beurden told the meeting that the deal would be a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153springboard to simplify Shell\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, the Evening Standard reports. Van Beurden also argued that a merger still made sense despite the cheaper oil price. The deal was approved by 83% of shareholders, with 17% opposing the plan. BG investors give their verdict tomorrow, but there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s little chance that they will block the deal. RBS is helping to drag the London stock market down into the red today. As traders scoff a quick sandwich (or three courses at Gaucho), the FTSE 100 is down 22 points at 5888. RBS are the second biggest faller, down 3.8% at 251p. The only biggest faller is Anglo American, the mining company, which has shed 5.2%. Other miners are also in the red, reflecting ongoing concerns over global growth. Other European markets are also in the red, as investors wait to hear from the US Federal Reserve at 7pm GMT (when it will surely leave interest rates unchanged). Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s more reaction to RBS\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s latest financial woes, via Press Association: Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell, said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s another bitter pill, but putting legacy issues behind it is essential if Chancellor George Osborne is going to off-load the Government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stake during this parliament.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd But banking analyst Gary Greenwood, at Shore Capital, said that, while \u00e2\u20ac\u0153disappointing\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, the latest financial charges are not unexpected. Over in America, traders are expecting Apple\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s share price to slide after it warned that revenue will fall this quarter, for the first time in 13 years. RBS isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t the only bank counting the cost of the PPI scandal today. Santander, the Spanish financial giant, has announced it is setting aside another \u00c2\u00a3450m to cover compensation to customers who were missold Payment Protection Insuranace. The move will dent profits at Santander UK. It could be the bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s final bill for the scandal, but we won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know for sure until the deadline for PPI claims in 2018. A wave of \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcchallenger banks\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 have sprung up since the financial crisis, hoping to win business from scandal-splattered big players such as Royal Bank of Scotland. And one of them, Metro Bank, has announced plans to float on the stock market. Metro, which is losing around \u00c2\u00a310m per quarter, wants to raise \u00c2\u00a3500m from shareholders. Random fact: Metro encourages dogs into its branches, and even lays on water bowls and doggie toys. If only bankers had spent more time doing that before the crisis, instead of churning out toxic debt and lumbering customers with PPI contracts.... The British public had better face the truth - we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll all be shareholders in the banks for a while longer yet. So argues Chris Beauchamp, senior market analyst at City firm IG. He told clients: RBS\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ability to surprise investors with fresh bad news has been one of the hardy perennials of the past six years, and yet still the news keeps coming. George Osborne\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision to sell a chunk of the government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stake last August, which was derided at the time, now looks like a sound financial decision, but it does mean any further sales are essentially off the table. Coincidentally, with Lloyds down 2% this morning in sympathy, it seems the government will remain a key asset manager when it comes to UK banks. If you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re just tuning in, here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Jill Treanor\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s news story about the latest problems at RBS: RBS takes \u00c2\u00a32.5bn hit to profits as chief executive announces bank \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcclean-up\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Royal Bank of Scotland is set to report its eighth consecutive year of full-year losses after announcing a string of charges for legal bills, compensation and a pension payment. The bank, which is more than 70%-owned by the taxpayer, said it would take a \u00c2\u00a32.5bn hit to profits in 2015 as a result of a clean-up exercise, driving its share price to a three-year low in Wednesday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s early trading. RBS shares fell 5% to 246p \u00e2\u20ac\u201c below the 330p at which George Osborne sold off the the government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s first tranche of shares in August, and less than half the 502p average price at which taxpayers pumped \u00c2\u00a345bn into the bank. Issuing an unscheduled trading update on Wednesday, Ross McEwan, the chief executive of RBS, said the move was part of a continued clean-up but conceded that that the bank would make another full-year loss for 2015. It has not reported a profit since 2007. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I am determined to put the issues of the past behind us, and make sure RBS is a stronger, safer bank. We will now continue to move further and faster in 2016 to clean up the bank and improve our core businesses,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said McEwan. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve always been open about the scale of past issues facing RBS and although there is clearly much more to do, this announcement is a further step towards addressing legacy issues and building a great bank for our customers and delivering long-term value for our shareholders,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he added..... Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Jill\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s full story: The latest problems at RBS show that bankers need keeping on a tight leash, argues campaigners for a financial transaction tax. David Hillman, spokesperson for the Robin Hood Tax campaign, says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s groundhog day in the City as RBS announces yet another huge provision for dodgy dealing and fleecing its customers. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Try as it might, the banking sector is incapable of shaking off its past sins. The government must take note \u00e2\u20ac\u201d now is not the time for it to ease up on financial sector reform.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd There are signs that Britain is taking a softer line with the City. An inquiry into banking culture was curiously abandoned at the end of last year, alarming campaigners. And yesterday, Bank of England deputy governor Andrew Bailey was appointed as head of the Financial Conduct Authority - and hand-picked by George Osborne for this crucial job. Citigroup analysts have warned that RBS could suffer even more legal charges this year, points out the BBC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Kamal Ahmed: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We still see significant additional litigation charges in 2016, on top of the charges that have been announced today. A quick explanation. When RBS says it is setting aside \u00c2\u00a31.5bn to cover \u00e2\u20ac\u0153various US residential mortgage-backed securities (\u00e2\u20ac\u0153RMBS\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd) litigation claims\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, it is referring to one of the more noxious elements of the 2007-08 financial crisis. In the build-up to the crisis, milions of mortgages were sold to US citizens with shaky credit histories, who could not really afford them. Those loans were repackaged by investment banks into new financial products (the RMBSs) and sold onto investors who weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t told how dangerous they might be. Cue the credit crunch, and the collapse of the subprime market. Mortgage-backed securities plunged in value, as the borrowers behind them failed to meet their payments and handed back the key to their homes. And the smaller banks, credit unions, insurers and suchlike who had been left holding them when the music stopped (and the Big Short paid out) launched waves of legal action against Wall Street. RBS had a finger in this unsavoury pie though its US subsidiary, Greenwich Capital Markets. In 2013, the SEC accused it of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153misleading investors\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and cutting corners, by selling loans that didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t meet underwriting guidelines. Important point: The \u00c2\u00a31.5bn in new US legal charges announced by RBS this morning does not cover any potential settlements with the US Department of Justice, or various US State Attorney General investigations. Ian Gordon of Investec warns that: The timing and the cost of resolving those cases remains highly uncertain. City analysts are punting out their opinions now. And Sandy Chen of Cenkos Securities isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t too alarmed by RBS\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s announcement. He argues that the bank is simply cleaning up the mess of previous eras (or possibly \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcprevious errors\u00e2\u20ac\u2122). The new \u00c2\u00a31.5bn provision against US mortgage-backed security costs brings the total bill to \u00c2\u00a33.8bn - \u00e2\u20ac\u0153closer to the \u00c2\u00a34-6bn totals that most analysts have had in mind\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, Chen says. And the \u00c2\u00a3500m payment protection insurance top-up should be one of the last big ones, given the FCA\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s consultation on a 2018/19 time-bar on PPI claims, Chen adds. His conclusion: Bad news \u00e2\u20ac\u201c really? More like putting their past in their behind, as Pumba said (in the Lion King). [I think Pumba actually says \u00e2\u20ac\u0153you got to put your behind in your past.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd -- but we get the gist] The UK government currently owns almost 73% of RBS, and at today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s share price I fear we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re stuck with it for some time. The taxpayer paid around 502p per share when it bailed the stricken bank out in 2008. Today, RBS shares are trading at just 250p, so we would take a stonking loss if George Osborne sells another slice of the bank. Last summer, he sold \u00c2\u00a32.1bn of stock at around 320p - crystallising a \u00c2\u00a31bn loss for the taxpayer. That deal was criticised, but with hindsight the hedge funds who bought the stock are now sitting on a loss themselves. RSB shares have just hit their lowest level since September 2012, I reckon. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not good news for George Osborne, as he tried to sell the bank back to the private sector. Shares in Royal Bank of Scotland have slumped by 5% at the start of trading, shedding 12.1p to 248p. That makes RBS is the biggest faller on the FTSE 100. Bad news for shareholders - which in RBS\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s case is every member of the UK public, as we bailed the bank out in 2008. Q: When did RBS last make a profit, asks Jill Treanor. CEO Ross McEwan sucks through his teeth and takes a stab at 2007 -- the year before Lehman Brothers failed. We told you that 2015 and 2016 was about tidying up these legacy issues, and that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s exactly what we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re doing, McEwan adds. Q: How much has RBS paid out on PPI? The total bill is around \u00c2\u00a34.3bn, says McEwan. Q: Do today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s provisions mean RBS will declare a loss for 2015? Yes, McEwan replies. Some of these charges will hit the bottom line (not the pension changes, though) My colleague Jill Treanor asks whether today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00c2\u00a3500m PPI provision is finally the end of the saga. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve done the best we can, based on what we know today, to estimate what the final provision will be, McEwan replies. We think it is hopefully the end. People have until spring 2018 to file PPI claims. McEwan says PPI has been a long and torturous journey for many banks, and a reminder of how to treat consumers (or how not to mistreat them). RBS is briefing the media now, on a conference call. Chief Financial Officer Ewen Stevenson is telling reporters that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153underneath it all we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve got a strong core bank\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Will it ever end, wonder City journalists.... Is Ross McEwan is cleaning up RBS ahead of a sale, wonders the BBC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Kamal Ahmed. RBS has also told the City that it is putting \u00c2\u00a34.2bn into its pension scheme, to cover an accounting deficit of \u00c2\u00a33.3 billion. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s mainly an accelerated payment of existing committed future contributions. It follows changes in accounting practice, which have made RBS rethink whether or not it has an unconditional right to a refund of any surpluses in its employee pension funds. Royal Bank of Scotland has stunned the City with a fresh wave of provisions to cover bad behaviour and legal bills. In an unscheduled announcement, RBS announced a series of new charges. In a nutshell: The bank is setting aside $2.2 billion, or \u00c2\u00a31.5bn, to cover litigation claims in the US relating to various residential mortgage-backed securities. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a legacy of the subprime crisis. It is also setting aside an extra \u00c2\u00a3500m to cover Payment Protection Insurance (\u00e2\u20ac\u0153PPI\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd) claims. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the long-running mis-selling scandal in which millions of consumers were sold insurance they didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t need (or even ask for, in some cases). RBS taking a goodwill impairment charge of \u00c2\u00a3498m against its Private Banking business. More than seven years after being rescued by the taxpayer, RBS is still a work in progress..... CEO Ross McEwan insists that he is cleaning up the mess of the past: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I am determined to put the issues of the past behind us and make sure RBS is a stronger, safer bank. We will now continue to move further and faster in 2016 to clean-up the bank and improve our core businesses. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve always been open about the scale of past issues facing RBS and although there is clearly much more to do, this announcement is a further step towards addressing legacy issues and building a great bank for our customers and delivering long term value for our shareholders.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets the eurozone, and business. Two things dominate today -- the turmoil in the stock markets, and the first US Federal Reserve interest rate decision of 2016. Traders can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t take their eye off the oil price, which is lurching around the $30 per dollar mark this week. Brent crude is currently trading around $31.42 per barrel, helped by rumours that Russia and Saudi Arabia might carve up some kind of deal to cut production. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s all a bit flaky, though. Michael Hewson of CMC Markets explains: The symbiotic relationship between equity markets and oil prices continued yesterday as after a rocky start to trading saw a slide in oil prices below $30 drag equity markets lower, the lack of follow through saw a semblance of stability return and a sharp recovery back above the $30 level on vague chatter that senior OPEC officials were looking to open a dialogue and put together some form of deal with Russia in an effort to put a floor under prices. European markets are likely to be calm this morning, as investors await new from America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s central bank. At 7pm GMT tonight, the Federal Reserve announces its decision on monetary policy. It will surely (surely!) leave interest rates unchanged, having made the first symbolic post-crisis hike last month. The Fed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s statement will be scrutinised for its view on the global economy, and any signs of \u00e2\u20ac\u02dchikers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 remorse\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, given the turmoil in the markets in recent weeks. Lots of companies reporting results today, although the biggie - Facebook - comes at 9pm GMT. The City will also be digesting Apple\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s results last night, which showed that the iPhone boom may finally be over: We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be tracking all the main events through the day....",

That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s why we can use state-aid tools to look for more individual companies and more selective advantages being given out in the form of tax rulings.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Vestager defended a private meeting she had last week with Apple\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chief executive, Tim Cook. She said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It is important for anyone who has a case with us to be able to state their [view] and then of course we listen \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 This is a union built on the rule of law. Every company, when they have a case, has the full right of defending themselves, presenting their arguments, their facts of the case.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd She added: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m here to do a job for all Europeans. For all the companies who pay their taxes, for all the Europeans who pay their taxes.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s financial police said they could not confirm figures contained in the Repubblica report. There have been reports this week about a possible settlement with Google after a long-running inquiry into its tax affairs. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Google complies with the tax laws in every country where we operate. We continue to work with the relevant authorities,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Google in Italy said. A source close to Google said the group had not yet received any official notice from prosecutors or other authorities. Google paid about \u00e2\u201a\u00ac2.2m in taxes in Italy on official sales of \u00e2\u201a\u00ac54.4m, according to publicly available accounts. However, the true revenue figure is thought by government officials to be far higher. The company \u00e2\u20ac\u201c like other internet groups in Italy that pay low taxes \u00e2\u20ac\u201c has publicly claimed that its activities in Italy are limited to marketing and consulting services in connection to its European headquarters in Ireland.",

The construction sector followed the same path. Affected by a slowdown in global trade, the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/jul/17/pound-euro-interest-rate-rise-bank-england-mark-carney\">high value of the pound</a>, and possibly the government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s determination to impose another five years of austerity, businesses became more circumspect about expanding output.</p> <p>Now, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jan/28/uk-gdp-growth-rises-05-as-annual-rate-slows-to-three-year-low\">official figures for GDP growth</a> in the final three months of 2015 show that these backbone of the economy activities, the stuff of making and building things, actually shrank.</p> <p>While manufacturing accounts for little more than 10% of the economy, and construction about 7%, they are vital elements. The chancellor, George Osborne, promised <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jan/12/march-of-the-makers-osbornes-economy-manufacturing-output\">a march of the makers</a>. It hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t happened.</p> <p>In fact, the manufacturing sector\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s output remains well below its pre-crash peak. Should we worry?

                "bodyText":"Last summer, a brief recovery in the manufacturing sector was already running out of steam. The construction sector followed the same path. Affected by a slowdown in global trade, the high value of the pound, and possibly the government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s determination to impose another five years of austerity, businesses became more circumspect about expanding output. Now, official figures for GDP growth in the final three months of 2015 show that these backbone of the economy activities, the stuff of making and building things, actually shrank. While manufacturing accounts for little more than 10% of the economy, and construction about 7%, they are vital elements. The chancellor, George Osborne, promised a march of the makers. It hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t happened. In fact, the manufacturing sector\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s output remains well below its pre-crash peak. Should we worry? Of course we should. Osborne might welcome growth wherever it comes from. But if the source is the residential property sector, where a return to buying, selling and buoyant lending means the pace of price rises is three times that of wages, then the economy is like a listing ship. It might still be moving ahead, but not all the engines are in the water and even a modest wave could knock it over. Osborne has largely given up on an increase in corporation tax receipts over the next five years \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Google is just one element of that surrender \u00e2\u20ac\u201c but he expects receipts from stamp duty on property to soar between now and 2020, as prices continue to outstrip wages. The other element of growth, highlighted by Mark Carney, the Bank of England governor, in a recent speech, has been the increase in GDP that relates to immigrants.

Yet the real picture here is that even after cuts the vast majority of households in the UK are massively overpaying for their energy.</p> <p>E.ON and SEE customers with typical usage on their standard tariffs will be paying at least \u00c2\u00a31,050, after the cuts, and those from other firms even more.

                "bodyText":"It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been an awfully busy day, so let\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s wrap up with a reminder of the key points (with links to the appropriate news stories) The government has slammed the brakes on its plan to sell its stake in Lloyds Banking Group to the public. Chancellor George Osborne said it would have been \u00e2\u20ac\u0153frankly quite irresponsible\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to press on with the sale when Lloyds shares are just 64p, compared to a break-even price of 74p. City analysts say Osborne made the right decision, but political opponents have claimed he was reckless in pushing for the sale at all. The UK economy has posted its weakest annual growth in three years. New GDP figures showed that the economy expanded by 1.9% year-on-year in the last three months of 2015. On a quarterly basis, GDP rose by 0.5%. City regulators have reopened investigations into the senior managers who ran HBOS, before its collapse in 2007. The probe could lead to former HBOS being banned from the City for mismanaging the bank, which was rescued by Lloyds - triggering a taxpayer-led bailout (and leaving George Osborne with a lot of shares to sell) The EC has proposed new rules to prevent multinational companies gaming the system and avoiding paying a fair rate of tax. Announcing the move, commissioners Pierre Moscovici vowed to \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcname and shame\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 those who didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t play by the rules, but denied planning to impose a flat rate of corporation tax across the EU. He also confirmed the EU could investigate the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new tax deal with Google. And it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been another volatile day in the markets. Oil soared, then subsided, when rumours of OPEC supply cuts were denied. Traders were cautious, after the US Federal Reserve said last night it was watching the global economic and financial system closely. The FTSE 100 shed 1%, or 58 points, to close at 5931. And there were bigger losses across Europe, on concerns that global economic problems is hurting Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s recovery. Conner Campbell of Spreadex has the details: The UK index has flailed about for much of the day, only just recovering from its lunch-time losses to start the US session flat. The Eurozone was a whole different story; plunging nearly 1.5% the DAX got a taste of the dramatic today, struggling in the face of Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s weak inflation and import prices figures. This helped drag the CAC with it, though the French index was slightly less hysterical, tumbling around 35 points as the day wore on. And that is all for today. Thanks, and goodnight. GW There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also speculation that Lloyds could be planning to set even more money aside to cover Payment Protection Insurance compensation. The chancellor might want to keep the share sale off the table, until the PPI scandal is off the agenda again. Raul Sinha, banking analyst at JPMorgan Chase said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We are estimating that Lloyds will take \u00c2\u00a33bn of PPI provisions up to 2018 and the market fears that they might decide to take some of that now.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Yesterday, Royal Bank of Scotland announced another \u00c2\u00a3500m to cover PPI claims, while Santander put aside \u00c2\u00a3450m. PPI has already cost Lloyds an eye-watering \u00c2\u00a314bn, making it the biggest culprit. Susan Kramer, Liberal Democrat treasury spokesman, has criticised the chancellor for his eagerness to sell the government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s remaining stake in Lloyds: She said (via the Financial Times): \u00e2\u20ac\u0153George Osborne\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s dash to sell off the public\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stake in Lloyds as soon as possible was already a bad idea. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It is worrying that it has taken a major collapse in global economic confidence to finally make him see sense.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd More volatility in the markets! Shares are diving on both sides of the Atlantic, as OPEC members rubbish today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rumour of production cuts. The FTSE 100 index of blue chip shares listed in London has now shed 97 points, or 1.6%, to 5892. Not a great environment to be launching the Lloyds retail share offering. The German DAX has slumped by 2.4%. And on Wall Street, the Dow Jones is now in the red, extending yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s losses. The selloff also follows some disappointing US economic data, showing a big drop in durable goods production (that machinery and long-lasting goods). Capital Economics explains: The 5.1% m/m decline in durable goods was due primarily to a sharp decline in the notoriously volatile aircraft component. Nevertheless, the details suggest that equipment investment shrank in the fourth quarter. Can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t argue with this tweet..... Our financial editor, Nils Pratley, agrees that Osborne couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have got away with selling Lloyds to the public on the cheap. But the chancellor should consider exactly why the bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shares have fallen so much this year. He writes: Before Osborne spends too much time congratulating himself on his \u00e2\u20ac\u0153responsible\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd move, he should ask why Lloyds\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 share price has fallen by a quarter since last May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s election. Yes, those pesky turbulent markets are a major contributor. But Lloyds \u00e2\u20ac\u201c more than any other big UK bank \u00e2\u20ac\u201c is also a proxy for the market\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s view of the health of the UK economy. Investors sense bigger problems for the chancellor than an embarrassing delay in a \u00c2\u00a32bn share-sale. City firm IG reckons that the Lloyds share sale will be a success, eventually. IG analyst Chris Beauchamp reports that there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s plenty of public interest in it: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Research conducted by IG shows there is significant public appetite for the Lloyds share offer, with 43% of the UK adult population being aware of the offer and 6% likely to apply. This is the equivalent of 2.4 million people, which exceeds the government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s goal of engaging 2 million investors based on them investing \u00c2\u00a31000. But who are those 2 million people? I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d guess that many of them will be experienced investors, who aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t daunted by the City, and who also have a spare grand to invest. Speaking of the markets... the oil price is suddenly surging. Brent crude has leapt 8% to $35 per barrel, a remarkable move, following reports that Russia and Saudi Arabia might agree a 5% production cut. However, there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s nothing official yet.... Is Osborne justified in blaming \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcmarket turbulence\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 for scuppering the Lloyd sale (at least temporarily)? I think so. The FTSE 100 has fallen by around 7% since last October, but bank shares have suffered a steeper decline - as this chart shows. And other global markets have seen bigger losses. German\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s DAX index has lost almost 9% since the start of this year, a period in which Japan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Nikkei is down 10%. Economic problems in China, the oil price rout, and fears of a global slowdown and rising deflation have all spooked investors this year. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s little prospect of Lloyds share price surging from 63p to the 74p break-even point anytime soon. Pausing the Lloyds float is embarrassing for the government, but it does avoid the possibility of a failed privatisation. Russ Mould, investment director at stockbrokers AJ Bell, says a Lloyds flop could have undermined the zeal for Thatcherite privatisations. He says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Osborne will clearly be looking for a better deal for the Government, to maximise returns as best he can, and he won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want any issue that was aiming for substantial involvement from private investors to be a flop. That would damage already fragile sentiment and make it harder for any future privatisations to do well. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s more than two years since the government sold off Royal Mail, prompting claims that it had sold the firm off far too cheaply. Royal Mail shares are worth 450p today, around a third higher than the 330p float price, and peaked at over \u00c2\u00a36. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the problem with flotations. If shares slide, they were a rip-off. And if they surge, then the company was sold off too cheaply. George Osborne took his mind off the Lloyds sale suspension and the Google tax tow with a trip to Airbus\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s factory in Filton this morning. Looks like the chancellor enjoyed himself: Banking analyst Ian Gordon says George Osborne has made the right call given the circumstances. The Press Association has the details: Lloyds shares were to be offered to retail investors at a 5% discount to the market price, with a bonus share for every 10 shares held by the investors for more than a year. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153If Osborne were to have gone ahead with the sale to retail investors ... this would have produced an effective price of sub 60 pence,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Investec analyst Ian Gordon. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153That would be politically and economically impossible to justify. So I think that this (decision) is perfectly sensible.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd A Downing Street spokesperson has also blamed the current stock market volatility for the decision to postpone the Lloyds retail offering, saying: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s important that any share sale delivers value for money and we have to take account of current market conditions.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd And the market conditions aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t great today. After a calm start, the FTSE 100 has now fallen by 30 points or 0.5% to 5958. Lloyds shares have dropped by 1.5% to 63.93p -- around 10p shy of the break-even level (as explained earlier). Lloyds Banking Group has issued a statement: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The Government has already been able to progressively reduce its stake in the Group from 43% to just 9% today, returning over \u00c2\u00a316 billion to taxpayers at a profit. This reflects the hard work undertaken over the last four years to transform the Group into a simple, low-risk and customer-focused bank. The timing of any future retail sale is a matter for the Government. Our focus is on moving the Group forward so that it can continue to be profitable and deliver sustainable returns to all our shareholders.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Sky News also ask George Osborne if he regrets calling the \u00c2\u00a3130m Google tax deal a major success (when speaking to the Guardian at the World Economic Forum in Davos last Saturday). Osborne says that his only interest as chancellor of the exchequer is to get the best deal for Britain. Google used to pay no tax, now it is paying tax. And he cites his new diverted profits tax, which is aimed at large multinationals who artificially shift their profits offshore. I regard that as a major success, he adds. Clearly there is more to do, and the ultimate solution is to create more succesful UK companies. So he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s still using the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcmajor success\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 line, but appears to be tweaking it to cover his general action on tax avoidance, not just the Google deal. Sky News just broadcast their interview with George Osborne. In it, he says it would be \u00e2\u20ac\u0153frankly quite irresponsible\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to embark on a major share sale when the markets are so volatile. His aim is to get the best deal for the public and the country. Q: Is the sale of Royal Bank of Scotland shares also going to be postponed? Osborne says he will continue, when it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s right, to sell RBS shares to the market. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153My interest is a bank that works for the British people, that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s out there lending to businesses, but also ensuring that over time we do get out of that bank. We will continue to make sales to the market. Britain currently owns around 70% of Royal Bank of Scotland, whose share price is around half the break-even price of 500p. The government is aiming to sell shares to City institutions, rather than to the public. Hundreds of thousands of small investors will be disappointed by the postponement of the Lloyds shares sale, says Laith Khalaf of Hargreaves Lansdown. He points out that Osborne had promised to sell the shares at a 5% discount to the market price, so he must now hope for a recovery in markets later in the year. Market volatility in recent months has seen UK stock market values fall by around 20% since the April 2015 high, so its understandable that the share sale is being delayed. The government are committed to returning the Bank to private hands and within that had previously pledged to offer at least \u00c2\u00a32 billion as a retail offering. Therefore we expect this share sale to proceed at some stage but the timescales are unknown. Sky News\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ed Conway smells a rat with the timing of the Lloyds news: For anyone just tuning in, here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our news story on the Lloyds share sale suspension: George Osborne has postponed the sale of the last taxpayer-owned tranche of Lloyds Bank shares this spring, blaming \u00e2\u20ac\u0153market turbulence\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. The chancellor pledged in last year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s election manifesto to sell the remaining stake in the bank \u00e2\u20ac\u201c just under 10% of the company \u00e2\u20ac\u201c to the public this spring. However, he told Sky News and other broadcasters that he has decided to delay the sale following the sharp selloff in stock markets in recent weeks. Several indices, including London\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s leading share index, entered bear market territory earlier this month, pressured by the slump in oil prices coupled with concerns about China and global economic slowdown. The FTSE has recovered this week but it global equity markets remain volatile. The Lloyds share price has dropped more than 10% below the price at which the government would make a profit from the share sale. Osborne told reporters that: I want to create a share-owning democracy. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also my responsibility to ensure economic responsibility so with these turbulent financial markets now is not the right time to have that sale. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We will sell Lloyds to the British people but we will do so when the time is right.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd It is yet another U-turn on a manifesto pledge, following his change of heart over tax credit cuts in the autumn statement. By announcing the postponement today, George Osborne avoids breaking the bad news in March\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s budget. But this is still a blow to his plans, and probably means he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll need to borrow more money to balance the books. The chancellor has billed the sale as the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153biggest privatisation for 20 years\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. He was planning to raise \u00c2\u00a32bn through the retail offering to small shareholders that has now been halted. Osborne announced the sale at the Tory party conference last October, telling activists that: Next Spring, we will make Lloyds shares available to every member of the public. They\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be offered at a discount. Small shareholders will get priority, and long-term investors will get a bonus. You can register from today. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the biggest privatisation for more than twenty years. And every penny we raise will be used to pay off our debts. So, with the Google tax row gathering pace, this is turning into a week to forget for the chancellor. Our financial editor, Nils Pratley, warned two weeks ago that the Lloyds share sale was in trouble. He wrote: Under the drip-feed programme [sales to City firms], which has reduced the state\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stake to 9%, sales are prohibited below 73.6p, the break-even price. And, if the drip-feed programme is stalled, can Osborne really go ahead with his parallel idea to exit Lloyds with a flourish this spring by selling \u00c2\u00a32bn worth of discounted shares to the public? Technically, he can. But it would be highly embarrassing, politically speaking, to sell Lloyds shares to private punters at a loss to the public purse. At today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s share price, the government would swallow a chunky loss if it carried on with the Lloyds sale. The break-even point, above which Osborne could boast a profit, is 73.6p. Lloyds shares are changing hands this morning at 63.9p. They haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t been above 74p since New Year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Eve 2015, before global stock markets began 2016 with hefty falls. Osborne has confirmed that the sale of Lloyds shares is off: It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s all go today! Back in the UK, the chancellor has just announced that he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s putting the sale of Lloyds Banking Group shares to the public on hold. He blames market turbulence. Britain acquired a 43% shareholding in Lloyds following the collapse of HBOS (now being freshly probed, of course). Osborne has managed to whittle it down to 9% 14% , and had hoped to shift the rest to the public soon. But Lloyds shares have shed a quarter of their value in the last eight months, and clearly the sale is no longer \u00e2\u20ac\u02dca goer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. Q: These proposals still allow companies to shift profits to other EU, or non-EU countries. Won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t that simply lead to a race to the bottom, as member states cut their corporation tax bills. We don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to impose corporation tax at the national level, Pierre Moscovici reiterates. But there are also fiscal rules, public services to fund, which means countries cannot afford a race to the bottom. Q: And will you impose more punitive measures, if we don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t see the \u00e2\u201a\u00ac50bn-\u00e2\u201a\u00ac70bn lost to tax evasion flooding into EU coffers. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s an official estimate, but we won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t use it as a benchmark of success, Moscovici says. Q: Which countries are helping multinational companies avoid paying fair tax? Switzerland, perhaps? I was at Davos last week, says Moscovici. I met the new Swiss minister for finance, and we agreed that the excellent co-operation that exists between the EC and Switzerland would continue. A recent EC-Swiss agreement means that the banking secrecy no longer exists, and will aid the exchange of information, Moscovici adds. He doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to point a finger at any countries, but wants to create a new system to prevent aggressive tax avoidance and boost transparency. Q: Would these EC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new proposals on tax avoidance stop legal arrangements such as Google, where the UK operations are carried out by a separate company working for Google in Dublin, who is paid a fee, to ensure the UK operations make as small a profit as possible? Moscovici says he can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t talk directly about the Google deal. however. There are some measures inside our proposed directive that can address the issue. Especially exit taxation, to prevent companies relocating assets purely to avoid taxation. Q: How does this deal relate to the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s controversial deal with Google, under which the search giant will pay \u00c2\u00a3130m in back taxes? Pierre Moscovici says they aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t directly linked. The commission could investigate the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s deal with Google, and the broad principle is that: All companies must pay their fair share of taxes, where they pay their profits. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s why we have been active in preventing member states ability to offer sweetheart deals. The measures I am announcing today will tackle the most common loopholes in international law, Moscovici insists. It should have a major impact in tackling aggressive tax planning. Q: Won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t these new rules penalise countries a long way from the centre of Europe, who might struggle to attract firms without an attractive corporation ? (Ireland, perhaps) Moscovici says the EC isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t planning to set tax rates across the region. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s talking about common rules. Pierre Moscovici is taking questions now Q: How confidence is the EC that member states will accept new rules on tax? Moscovici says he expect a lively debate with national governments. He doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think his new plan will be accepted 100%, but he has \u00e2\u20ac\u0153every confidence\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd that new rules to combat tax avoidance will be agreed. Over in Brussels, European commissioner Pierre Moscovici is announcing a new crackdown on multinational companies\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 tax avoidance. Moscovici, Commissioner for economic and financial affairs, taxation and customs, is telling reporters that tax avoidance is a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153global problem\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. But the EC is determined to crack down on companies who play the system and cut their tax bills. It is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153too easy for companies to escape taxation by shifting assets to tax havens\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, Moscovici says, vowing to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153name and shame\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd companies who don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t play fair. The Commission is also keen to rein in member states who offer unfairly low tax rates to encourage multinationals to base their HQs there. Today we take action to put states on an equal footing, by setting legally binding rules that they must all abide by.....Member states must all apply a minimum level protection against tax avoidance. And he concludes: The days are numbered for companies who avoid paying tax at the expense of others. City regulators certainly haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t been quick-off-the mark on the HBOS scandal. Yes, HBOS bosses could potentially be banned from the City, but it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s eight years since the bank was rescued by Lloyds Banking Group, who then required a massive taxpayer bailout. The decision to start investigating HBOS\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s former top managers is a significant moment. Until now, only one HBOS banker - Peter Cummings -- has been banned, even through a parliamentary inquiry blamed \u00e2\u20ac\u0153colossal failure of management\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd for its failure. Breaking news: Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s City watchdogs have announced they are starting a probe into some of the top managers at HBOS, the bank which collapsed during the financial crisis. This statement just landed in my inbox: The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) and the Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA) have decided to start investigations into certain former HBOS senior managers. These investigations will determine whether or not any prohibition proceedings should be commenced against them. The FCA and PRA continue to review materials with a view to making further decisions regarding other former HBOS senior managers. The move comes two months after an official report into the HBOS affair was finally published. It concluded that the decision to not investigate at least 10 former executives was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153materially flawed\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. That list included chairman Lord Stevenson and chief executives Andy Hornby and James Crosby. Potentially, the FCA and the PRA could decide to ban former HBOS top executives from working in the City..... The GDP report shows that Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy has suffered from the slump in oil prices in the last year: Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s growth was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153relatively lacklustre\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and \u00e2\u20ac\u0153worryingly lopsided\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, warns Howard Archer of IHS Global Insight, an analyst group. It was completely dependent on the services sector, which saw output growth pick up to 0.7% quarter-on-quarter from 0.6% in the third quarter. There was marginal contraction in construction output (0.1% quarter-on-quarter) and industrial production (down 0.2%). Services is the only part of the UK economy that is larger than before 2008, when the financial crisis began. Quick clarification. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s report shows that GDP was 1.9% higher in Quarter 4 (Oct to Dec) 2015 compared with the same quarter a year ago. During 2015, the economy grew by 2.2%. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a slowdown, as the UK grew by 2.6% during 2014. The chancellor tweets: Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy has now posted 12 quarters of growth, and is estimated to be 6.6% higher than the pre- economic downturn peak in Q1 2008. This chart highlights how Britain relies on the service sector for growth (it does make up around 80% of the economy) Britain economy continues to rely on services company for growth, while manufacturers failed to grow. The ONS reports that: The service sector grew by 0.7% in the last quarter agriculture grew by 0.6% But the production sector shrank by 0.2%, with manufacturing output flat Construction decreased by 0.1% Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Reuters first take on the GDP figures (they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve been in a lock-in at the Office for National Statistics): Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy ended 2015 on a soft note after the annual pace of growth slowed to its weakest in nearly three years as the global economic slowdown weighed on its previously rapid expansion. Fourth-quarter gross domestic product grew by 0.5%, up slightly from 0.4% in the three months to September, the Office for National Statistics said on Thursday, and in line with economists\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 forecasts. Output in the three months to December was 1.9% higher than a year earlier, down from 2.1% in the third quarter and the smallest increase since early 2013. The figures are likely to ease worries that Britain is facing a sharp economic slowdown, as domestic demand appears to have remained resilient. But they suggest that the robust growth of the past two years will not return until the world economy regains strength. Breaking! The UK economy grew by 0.5% in the final three months of 2015. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s up from 0.4% in the third quarter, and in line with expectations. But annual growth has slowed to 1.9% - the slowest in three years. More to follow.... Just 10 minutes to go until the GDP figures are released. Reminder: The City is expecting UK growth of 0.5% in the last quarter, with annual growth dipping to 1.9% Gross domestic product is a blunt tool for assessing a country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy. Although it measures activity within an economy, GDP doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t assess the actual value of that work. Burning down a rainforest and building a new railway are seen in the same way. And it doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t measure inequality - whether the fruits of the economic success are shared fairly. This message has finally filtered through to the global elite at Davos last week, where IMF chief Christine Lagarde called for a shake-up. Lagarde told the World Economic Forum that: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We have to go back to GDP, the calculation of productivity, the value of things \u00e2\u20ac\u201c in order to assess, and probably change, the way we look at the economy.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Newsflash from Japan: the economy minister, Akira Amari, has announced his resignation. It follows allegations that he had received at least 12 million yen (about \u00c2\u00a370,000) from a construction company, breaching political funding law. Amari, a key player in the stimulus programme spearheaded by prime minister Sinzo Abe, had denied wrong-doing. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be hearing from George Osborne shortly, flags up Sky News Faisal Islam. That may be a sign that today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s growth figures is OK; the chancellor has a habit of being \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcotherwise engaged\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 when there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bad news to discuss.... European markets are pretty calm this morning, as investors wait for the UK growth figures in 45 minutes time. The main indices are all up, a little, and oil is hovering around $33 per barrel. But Conner Campbell of SpreadEx warns that Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s GDP report could spoil the mood: The upward movement from Brent Crude has caused a wave of green to overcome the UK index\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s crucial oil and mining stocks, in turn allowing the FTSE to flirt seriously with the 6000 mark for the first time in a fortnight. However, a major spanner in the works could be thrown in if the day\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s first look at the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fourth quarter GDP disappoints. Analysts are expecting 0.5%, marginally better than the 0.4% seen back in Q3; yet there is more than a chance that the figure might underperform, with the Chinese slowdown, Brexit fears AND those weaker than hoped for Christmas retail sales all swirling around to potentially take a point or two off the reading. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a round-up of today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s other corporate news: Transport company FirstGroup warned profits would come in lower than expected. It blamed the recent wet weather and flooding in Britain and driver shortages in the US. Drinks giant Diageo, which makes Johnnie Walker scotch and Smirnoff vodka, reported a 1.8% rise in first-half sales. It took a hit from foreign exchange rates and the sale of assets, including its wine business. Sweden\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s H&amp;M has also been hit by the strong dollar, which drove up its purchasing costs (it buys most of its clothes in Asia in US dollars), and warned that big markdowns on winter wear will hurt its profit margins in the first quarter. Like rivals, the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s second-biggest fashion retailer pointed to the unusually warm weather in many part of Europe and north America, which put customers off buying winter clothes. Jimmy Choo had a good 2015, as Asian shoppers snapped up its luxury shoes. It said strong demand in Asia, especially Japan, had countered the loss of Russian visitors at its European stores and the impact of the Paris terrorist attacks. Retail net revenues grew by 9% at constant exchange rates to \u00c2\u00a3208m, contributing to 7% growth in overall revenues to \u00c2\u00a3318m. But the price cut does not even come close to the drop in wholesale gas prices, consumer experts point out. Money Saving Expert Martin Lewis, founder of www.cheapenergyclub.co.uk, said: Baaaah. SSE has bleated and followed Eon\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s price cut last week, the rest of the big six sheep will likely soon follow. And again it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s just a trivial 5% on gas only not electricity, nothing close to the drop in wholesale prices. Energy firms must be whooping for joy that they can get away with such small cuts and have the energy minister praising them, albeit slightly. Yet the real picture here is that even after cuts the vast majority of households in the UK are massively overpaying for their energy. E.ON and SEE customers with typical usage on their standard tariffs will be paying at least \u00c2\u00a31,050, after the cuts, and those from other firms even more. Yet the market\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s cheapest tariffs for switchers are around \u00c2\u00a3770 a year on the same usage. And indeed both E.ON and SSE offer these for those who bother to switch.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd SSE, one of Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s big six energy companies, will cut its domestic gas prices by an average of 5.3% \u00e2\u20ac\u201c but not until after Easter. The company said: This latest reduction will save a typical household gas customer on our standard tariff \u00c2\u00a332 a year compared with existing prices.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The move, which takes effect on 29 March, comes a week after rival E.On reduced its gas prices by 5.1% from 1 February. SSE said it lost 300,000 customers in the first nine months of its financial year, as customers defected to smaller utility firms \u00e2\u20ac\u201c part of a wider trend. Customer accounts dropped to 8.28m by 31 December. Even so, the company stuck to its full-year adjusted earnings per share target of 115p and said it would hike its dividend at least in line with retail price inflation. Some economists fear that UK growth slowed to just 0.3% in the last quarter, due to economic problems overseas and political uncertainty back home. Others predict a healthy pick-up in GDP. My colleague Katie Allen explains: Economists forecast that the figures will show growth of 0.5% in the final three months of 2015, slightly faster than growth of 0.4% in the previous quarter, according to the consensus in a Reuters poll. But with worries about China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s downturn and the wider global economy clouding the outlook, there is significant uncertainty over the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s performance. Individual economists\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 forecasts range from 0.3% to 0.6%. Weak retail sales figures for the key Christmas season There have also been warnings from businesses that the looming EU referendum is hurting confidence and forcing some firms to put investment plans on hold. With polls pointing to a tight vote, the pound has fallen sharply in recent weeks. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s place in the world.... Good morning. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re about to find out how well, or badly, Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy fared in the last three months of 2015. Fresh GDP data for the October-December period is released at 9.30am. It will show how the UK performed during a time of growing worries about the global economy, and volatility in the markets. Economists predict that the UK economy expanded by around 0.5% during the quarter. That would be a small improvement on the 0.4% growth posted in July-September, and fairly unremarkable compared with long-term averages. But in the current climate, with China suffering a somewhat bumpy slowdown, any growth is better than nothing. The figures have global significance; Britain is the first major advance economy to report fourth-quarter GDP data. As we covered in last night\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s blog, the US central bank has said it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s watching the global economy and the markets closely. And domestically, the data are another quarterly term card report for George Osborne, and his management of the economy. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s likely that service sector firms provided most of the growth, not the industrial sector that the chancellor hoped to reinvigorate. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be covering the build-up to the figures at 9.30am, and instant reaction and analysis once they are released.",

                "bodyText":"At a time when the foundations of the European Union have never looked shakier, Margrethe Vestager is a powerful reminder that Brussels, when it works as it should, has clout. The EU competition commissioner\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s threat to investigate the British government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s controversial tax settlement with Google and take action if she deems it necessary is no empty one, as multinationals such as Fiat, Starbucks, Gazprom and \u00e2\u20ac\u201c in a separate case \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Google can attest. In her continuing fight against anti-competitive behaviour by global corporations and the unfair aid given to them by member states, Vestager is aided by robust European legislation that allows her, for example, to fine guilty firms up to 10% of their global turnover. But she also brings to the job a determined, no-nonsense personality seen as tough even by Danish standards; an actual, working sense of humour \u00e2\u20ac\u201c unconventional in Brussels \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and a quirky charm best exemplified by her longstanding habit of knitting during meetings, especially elephants. Vestager, a member of the Social Liberal party, was appointed competition commissioner in 2014 after a stellar career in Danish politics, a world of minority governments, fragile coalitions, consensus and compromise. In that setting, she appeared steely and cold-blooded almost to the point of callousness. Vestager pushed through swingeing cuts to the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s once-sacrosanct unemployment and early retirement benefits while economic affairs minister in the unstable three-party leftist coalition headed by the former Social Democrat prime minister, Helle Thorning-Schmidt. Then widely considered by Danish media and pollsters to be the most powerful politician in the country, before even Thorning-Schmidt, Vestager won recognition on the European stage during Denmark\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 2012 presidency of the EU council, chairing the Ecofin finance ministers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 meetings. Her coolness has at times been startling. Asked about the misery likely to be endured by people losing their benefits, Vestager, who has an economics degree from Copenhagen University and has also served as education minister and deputy prime minister, replied: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Well, that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the way it goes.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd But a similar single-mindedness has been evident in Brussels. Since her arrival, Vestager has already tackled Google, launching formal antitrust proceedings against the company in April last year over accusations that it uses its dominance as a search engine to unfairly privilege Google\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s online shopping service over those of its rivals. She also has the mostly state-owned Russian gas company Gazprom firmly in her sights, which she suspects of unfair pricing and illegally interfering with the energy markets in at least eight European countries. Vestager is also looking at the subsidies paid by some European governments to their electricity utilities, arguing that they may amount to illegal state aid. Despite the fact that her boss, the European commission president, Jean-Claude Juncker, is a former prime minister of Luxembourg, she has not shied away from pursuing watershed test cases against the preferential tax treatment allegedly and variously granted to multinationals Amazon, Apple, Starbucks and Fiat by Ireland, the Netherlands and Luxembourg. Fiat and Starbucks have already been ordered to pay tens of millions of euros; verdicts on Amazon and Apple await. Vestager insists she is not opposed to ultra-low taxes in principle, as long as they are available to everyone and not just a select multinational few. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I was brought up with a very strong value that you should always protect the small and the few against those who want to misuse their muscle and weight in order to get what they weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t supposed to,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd she told Reuters just before her appointment.

Her admission that Sidse Babett Knudsen, who plays Denmark\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fictional prime minister in Borgen, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153followed me around when I was economic affairs minister, to see how it works,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd prompted speculation she was one of the main inspirations for Knudsen\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s character, Birgitte Nyborg, in the hit TV drama.

It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s an incredibly difficult and crowded e-commerce environment,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Sucharita Mulpuru, a retail analyst at Forrester Research. She noted there are more than 800,000 online stores, all vying to attract customers through the gateway of Google.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Online real estate has become crowded and expensive. Bidding on keywords against the likes of Amazon and large traditional retailers to land on the first page of search results is a costly game.<br></p> <p>Macy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s and Nordstrom, for example, spent an estimated $6.4m and $4m, respectively, in paid search listings for the top 1,000 apparel-related keywords in the first quarter of 2015, according to a study this month from <a href=\"http://www.l2inc.com\">L2 Inc</a>, a research firm that tracks digital brands. <br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>\u00e2\u20ac\u0153Clicks disproportionately go to the highest-placed search ads, with little room for differentiation,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd states the L2 report, which examines what it calls \u00e2\u20ac\u0153evolved retailers\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u201c online merchants that have opened brick and mortar storefronts.</p> <p>By opening physical stores, they aim to increase awareness and draw customers in a realm where the retail options aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t infinite or influenced by an all-powerful gatekeeper. And for purveyors of tactile and personal products like clothing, eyewear and jewelry, selling stuff in person has an obvious appeal.</p> <p>For many, the offline foray has started with a trial pop-up shop before launching flagship stores in high-profile shopping districts like New York\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s SoHo neighborhood or Chicago\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Michigan Avenue. Encouraged by the results, some have since expanded quickly.</p> <p>\u00e2\u20ac\u0153The big benefit of the flagship stores is that they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re terrific marketing vehicles,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Jason Goldberg, senior vice-president of commerce and content at digital agency Razorfish. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Not only do those stores tend to be economically successful on their own but they generate a huge lift in incremental shopping to the online store.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd</p> <p>That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been the case for Warby Parker, which has created a popular brand by selling stylish eyeglass frames for under $100. After starting online in 2010, it opened its Soho flagship three years later and now has 20 stores nationwide, with plans to add another 20 this year.<br></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/apr/30/warby-parker-eyewear-valuation-funding-t-rowe-price\">Eyewear upstart Warby Parker valued at $1.2bn after latest round of funding</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Co-founder and co-chief executive Dave Gilboa said Warby Parker stores that have been open at least two years are already profitable. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We also see a halo effect where stores themselves become a great generator of awareness for our brand and drive a lot of traffic to our website, as well and accelerate our e-commerce sales,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he added. <br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Gilboa declined to disclose actual sales figures but the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rapid ascent hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t been lost on investors. T Rowe Price last spring led a $100m round of funding in Warby Parker at a reported $1.2bn valuation, making it a so-called unicorn.</p> <p>While someone can leave a Warby Parker store sporting a new pair of glasses, other e-tailers have opened what are essentially showrooms. This approach allows customers to size and sample products while minimizing real estate and other traditional retail costs.</p> <p>Among the best-known brands adopting this model is menswear shop Bonobos. Billed as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153guideshops\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, its 20 stores let customers try on clothing while orders are placed online for home delivery.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>The concept is that men want to shop in stores, but don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t necessarily want to leave toting shopping bags. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This supported our idea of using Bonobos.com as the place to fulfill orders, so we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have to worry about stocking inventory in a location and we could focus more on the customer experience,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Erin Ersenkal, Bonobos\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 chief revenue officer. </p> <p>The average order size in Bonobos\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 stores has proven to be twice that of online, with a higher proportion of new customers also coming through the guideshops.</p> <p>Similarly, jewelry e-tailer Blue Nile last year opened its first standalone outpost in the Roosevelt Field mall on Long Island for similar reasons to Bonobos. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Consumers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 No 1 objection to buying [jewelry] online is not being able to see and touch and feel the product,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd explained CEO Harvey Kanter.</p> <p>Purchases are still made online, where the company says prices are typically 20% to 40% lower than its traditional counterparts.<br></p> <p>Unlike others embracing brick and mortar, publicly traded Blue Nile is hardly a startup. Founded in 1999, it survived the dotcom bust, and is on track this year for revenue of about $500m. So why hit the mall now?</p> <p>Compared with other e-commerce categories, jewelry still has low penetration online, said Kanter. Venturing offline is a way to spur higher growth. Since opening last June, Blue Nile has seen a lift in traffic and sales in the region around its initial Long Island location. As such, it plans to open another three or four \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Webrooms\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in the first six months of 2016.</p> <p>As Blue Nile and other e-tailers branch out, though, don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t expect them to pop up on Main Street. Given the focus on marketing, marquee locations in select cities are more likely to be their turf. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Their economic future isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t tied to opening a store in Montana or Idaho or some of those smaller markets,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Razorfish\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Goldberg.<br></p> <p>Even so, Claude de Jocas, research lead on the L2 study, said the benefits of economies of scale could lead to adding more locations. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Some are also beefing up their physical retail teams with senior-level hires, suggesting aggressive expansion plans are in the works,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd she said.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>So what about Amazon? Its bookstore is closely linked to its website. Amazon Books\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 5,000 titles are selected based on customer ratings and pre-orders on Amazon.com. Each book is displayed face-out with a barcode to check pricing using its app. The outlet also lets people test drive its devices like the Kindle e-reader and Fire tablets.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Amazon didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t respond to media inquiries, and has previously declined comment on plans for additional locations. Jennifer Cast, vice-president for Amazon Books, told <a href=\"http://bit.ly/0oYJBE\">the Seattle Times</a> in November: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We hope it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not the only one. But we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll see.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd<br></p> <p>Other \u00e2\u20ac\u0153evolved\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd retailers probably hope Amazon doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t adapt well to selling on land.</p>",

It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s an incredibly difficult and crowded e-commerce environment,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Sucharita Mulpuru, a retail analyst at Forrester Research. She noted there are more than 800,000 online stores, all vying to attract customers through the gateway of Google. Online real estate has become crowded and expensive. Bidding on keywords against the likes of Amazon and large traditional retailers to land on the first page of search results is a costly game. Macy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s and Nordstrom, for example, spent an estimated $6.4m and $4m, respectively, in paid search listings for the top 1,000 apparel-related keywords in the first quarter of 2015, according to a study this month from L2 Inc, a research firm that tracks digital brands. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Clicks disproportionately go to the highest-placed search ads, with little room for differentiation,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd states the L2 report, which examines what it calls \u00e2\u20ac\u0153evolved retailers\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u201c online merchants that have opened brick and mortar storefronts. By opening physical stores, they aim to increase awareness and draw customers in a realm where the retail options aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t infinite or influenced by an all-powerful gatekeeper. And for purveyors of tactile and personal products like clothing, eyewear and jewelry, selling stuff in person has an obvious appeal. For many, the offline foray has started with a trial pop-up shop before launching flagship stores in high-profile shopping districts like New York\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s SoHo neighborhood or Chicago\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Michigan Avenue. Encouraged by the results, some have since expanded quickly. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The big benefit of the flagship stores is that they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re terrific marketing vehicles,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Jason Goldberg, senior vice-president of commerce and content at digital agency Razorfish. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Not only do those stores tend to be economically successful on their own but they generate a huge lift in incremental shopping to the online store.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been the case for Warby Parker, which has created a popular brand by selling stylish eyeglass frames for under $100. After starting online in 2010, it opened its Soho flagship three years later and now has 20 stores nationwide, with plans to add another 20 this year. Co-founder and co-chief executive Dave Gilboa said Warby Parker stores that have been open at least two years are already profitable. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We also see a halo effect where stores themselves become a great generator of awareness for our brand and drive a lot of traffic to our website, as well and accelerate our e-commerce sales,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he added. Gilboa declined to disclose actual sales figures but the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rapid ascent hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t been lost on investors. T Rowe Price last spring led a $100m round of funding in Warby Parker at a reported $1.2bn valuation, making it a so-called unicorn. While someone can leave a Warby Parker store sporting a new pair of glasses, other e-tailers have opened what are essentially showrooms. This approach allows customers to size and sample products while minimizing real estate and other traditional retail costs. Among the best-known brands adopting this model is menswear shop Bonobos. Billed as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153guideshops\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, its 20 stores let customers try on clothing while orders are placed online for home delivery. The concept is that men want to shop in stores, but don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t necessarily want to leave toting shopping bags. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This supported our idea of using Bonobos.com as the place to fulfill orders, so we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have to worry about stocking inventory in a location and we could focus more on the customer experience,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Erin Ersenkal, Bonobos\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 chief revenue officer. The average order size in Bonobos\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 stores has proven to be twice that of online, with a higher proportion of new customers also coming through the guideshops. Similarly, jewelry e-tailer Blue Nile last year opened its first standalone outpost in the Roosevelt Field mall on Long Island for similar reasons to Bonobos. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Consumers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 No 1 objection to buying [jewelry] online is not being able to see and touch and feel the product,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd explained CEO Harvey Kanter. Purchases are still made online, where the company says prices are typically 20% to 40% lower than its traditional counterparts. Unlike others embracing brick and mortar, publicly traded Blue Nile is hardly a startup. Founded in 1999, it survived the dotcom bust, and is on track this year for revenue of about $500m. So why hit the mall now? Compared with other e-commerce categories, jewelry still has low penetration online, said Kanter. Venturing offline is a way to spur higher growth. Since opening last June, Blue Nile has seen a lift in traffic and sales in the region around its initial Long Island location. As such, it plans to open another three or four \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Webrooms\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in the first six months of 2016. As Blue Nile and other e-tailers branch out, though, don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t expect them to pop up on Main Street. Given the focus on marketing, marquee locations in select cities are more likely to be their turf. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Their economic future isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t tied to opening a store in Montana or Idaho or some of those smaller markets,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Razorfish\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Goldberg. Even so, Claude de Jocas, research lead on the L2 study, said the benefits of economies of scale could lead to adding more locations. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Some are also beefing up their physical retail teams with senior-level hires, suggesting aggressive expansion plans are in the works,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd she said. So what about Amazon? Its bookstore is closely linked to its website. Amazon Books\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 5,000 titles are selected based on customer ratings and pre-orders on Amazon.com. Each book is displayed face-out with a barcode to check pricing using its app. The outlet also lets people test drive its devices like the Kindle e-reader and Fire tablets. Amazon didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t respond to media inquiries, and has previously declined comment on plans for additional locations. Jennifer Cast, vice-president for Amazon Books, told the Seattle Times in November: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We hope it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not the only one. But we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll see.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Other \u00e2\u20ac\u0153evolved\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd retailers probably hope Amazon doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t adapt well to selling on land.",
