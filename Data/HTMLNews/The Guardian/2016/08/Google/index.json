The Saatchi &amp; Saatchi executive chairman resigned last week after giving an interview to <em>Business Insider</em> that was so riddled with sexism and complacency it is difficult to pick out a particular soundbite.</p> <p>To summarise, Roberts said that there was no problem with sexual discrimination at Saatchi &amp; Saatchi and that some women, and men, were looking just to be happy in life rather than climb up the ranks of a company. He also accused a female campaigner of \u201cmaking up a lot of stuff to create a&#xa0;profile\u201d.</p> <p>Roberts was put on leave by Saatchi &amp; Saatchi at the weekend before <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/aug/03/saatchi-saatchi-boss-kevin-roberts-resigns-amid-sexism-row\" title=\"\">resigning on Wednesday,</a> apologising for \u201cmy miscommunication on a number of points\u201d.</p> <p>This should not be the end of the matter, however. For a start, it was noticeable that Roberts apologised for \u201cmiscommunication\u201d rather than the views that were expressed, while Saatchi &amp; Saatchi also allowed him to resign rather than firing him, allowing the Lancastrian to protect what is left of his reputation.</p> <p>But more importantly, chasing Roberts out of his job and celebrating his departure does not mean that all is well again in the advertising industry and beyond.

                "bodyText":"So farewell, Kevin Roberts. The Saatchi &amp; Saatchi executive chairman resigned last week after giving an interview to Business Insider that was so riddled with sexism and complacency it is difficult to pick out a particular soundbite. To summarise, Roberts said that there was no problem with sexual discrimination at Saatchi &amp; Saatchi and that some women, and men, were looking just to be happy in life rather than climb up the ranks of a company. He also accused a female campaigner of \u201cmaking up a lot of stuff to create a profile\u201d. Roberts was put on leave by Saatchi &amp; Saatchi at the weekend before resigning on Wednesday, apologising for \u201cmy miscommunication on a number of points\u201d. This should not be the end of the matter, however. For a start, it was noticeable that Roberts apologised for \u201cmiscommunication\u201d rather than the views that were expressed, while Saatchi &amp; Saatchi also allowed him to resign rather than firing him, allowing the Lancastrian to protect what is left of his reputation. But more importantly, chasing Roberts out of his job and celebrating his departure does not mean that all is well again in the advertising industry and beyond. To put it simply, all businesses are failing to put male and female workers on an equal footing. While some are heading in the right direction, there is so much more to do. The Women\u2019s Equality party in Britain wants quotas to be introduced so that 50% of a company\u2019s board and 50% of its executive committee are made up of women within the next 10 years. It has also made proposals about how British companies can get there, including overhauling maternity and paternity policies so that there is shared parental leave of six weeks at 90% pay for both partners, and free childcare from nine months. Companies should also be forced to publish the average pay of male and female employees, and the gender balance at each level of management. Despite the efforts of campaigners and the government-backed report by Lord Davies, the situation in Britain is shocking. Among leading companies there appears to be a mixture of those doing the minimum amount acceptable and those not bothering at all. The Female FTSE Board Report, produced by Cranfield University, showed that less than 25% of boardroom recruits to FTSE 100 firms were female in the six months to March 2016, the lowest level since 2011. This drop in recruitment is not because FTSE 100 boardrooms are overflowing with female voices. Just 26% of FTSE 100 directors are women \u2013 and the vast majority of these female directors are non-executives with no day-to-day power. When you just consider executive directors \u2013 such as chief executives or finance directors \u2013 the proportion falls to just 9.7%. It is far easier for a company to increase its proportion of female directors by appointing an established businesswoman as a non-executive, rather than developing its own female employees and encouraging them through the ranks so they become executives. Perhaps Roberts, who was also \u201chead coach\u201d for Saatchi &amp; Saatchi\u2019s parent, Publicis, should now be charged with helping firms elevate their female employees to the upper echelons of management? After all, he seems to understand their mindset. On second thoughts, the Lancastrian should be left to enjoy holidays in his property in the Lake District. Britain has someone else far better placed to ensure gender equality in the boardroom and in business: Theresa May, the new prime minister.

The \u00a35m investigation by the Competition and Markets Authority \u2013 first announced in July 2014 when former Labour leader Ed Miliband was vowing to create new banks \u2013 is intended to kickstart competition in a sector where only 3% of personal and 4% of business customers switch to a different bank in any year.

Brussels declared that when flights arrive at their final destination three hours or more late, the passenger is eligible for \u20ac250-\u20ac600 in compensation, depending on the distance flown. They were cited by some as a reason to vote to remain in the EU.</p> <p>Since the EU261 rules came into force, the airlines have spent much of their time trying to wriggle out of them, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2015/may/11/airlines-ignore-court-rulings-over-compensation-for-delayed-flights\" title=\"\">as the <em>Observer</em> has highlighted</a>. Many will define routine problems as \u201cextraordinary circumstances\u201d to avoid paying refunds. Online applications are made deliberately obtuse in the hope that frustrated applicants will give up along the way. And many do.</p> <p>But, while newspapers traditionally campaign for consumer rights, could it be that the compensation awards (we\u2019ll whisper this very quietly) are just a bit <em>too</em> generous?</p> <p>Take, for example, a colleague recently back from the Costa Dorada this summer. His Ryanair flight from Barcelona to London was delayed for more than three hours. He has since obtained \u20ac1,000 (\u00a3853) compensation for himself, wife and two children. How much did he pay for those flights? Less than \u00a3400. He feels like he has been given a free holiday.</p> <p>The same colleague flew British Airways from Heathrow to Hawaii last year for a once-in-a-lifetime treat with the family. That flight was also delayed, by just over three hours, and because it was more than 3,500km, they qualified for the big one: \u20ac600 compensation per person. The family picked up \u20ac2,400 (just under \u00a32,000 at the time) from BA. Not quite the whole cost of the tickets, but not far off.</p> <p>You may be left thinking: \u201cI wish I got delayed like that.\u201d Passengers delayed for two-and-a-half hours often find themselves praying the delay will go on for at least another 30 minutes.</p> <p>If they were in America, they wouldn\u2019t be. The US has no formal compensation rules for flight delays. Travellers can be delayed 24 hours on a flight from LA to Manchester and receive nothing, but they can pick up \u00a3500 if they are held up for three hours flying in the opposite direction.</p> <p>The EU261 rules are designed to knock the airlines into shape, and keep delays to a minimum, argue their proponents. These proponents include an increasing number of lawyers keen to snaffle a one-third cut of any \u201caward\u201d from the airline.</p> <p>Back in 2014, easyJet complained that \u201cpaying compensation far in excess of the fare price places a huge financial burden on us as an airline and will ultimately lead to higher fares for all.\u201d</p> <p>The average ticket at easyJet costs \u00a361.93, and half of all sold are below \u00a350. That means the airline has to pay around three times the ticket revenue it receives when there is a delay.</p> <p>Curiously, the airlines were reluctant when the <em>Observer</em> reached out for comment on this issue. They don\u2019t want to appear to be campaigning against consumer rights.</p> <p>But, off the record, their dissatisfaction with the rules is intense \u2013 and understandable. Limiting compensation just to the fare price may make them a little too sloppy when it comes to avoiding delays. But mightn\u2019t it be fairer to repay travellers their ticket price, plus a set fee, such as \u20ac50 or \u20ac100? Still generous, but not excessive.</p> <p>And we need to be thinking about this, because it\u2019s one of those many EU rules which we may have to renegotiate on Brexit.</p> <h2>Could there be an \u2018Opec for news\u2019?</h2> <p>Finding a way to give newspapers a slug of the advertising cash they have lost to Google is one of those old-media dreams that won\u2019t die. There have been many attempts, most recently in Germany and Spain, but they have all failed. The European commission, we learned on Thursday, is hatching the latest cunning plan.</p> <p>A draft working paper sets out options for a new law. Publishers will have an exclusive right to make their content available to the public and to reproduce it for digital purposes. The intention is to create a better regulatory tool to extract licensing payments from services like Google News.</p> <p>Legislation on its own will change nothing. Publicly funded organisations like the BBC may choose not to demand a fee. And Google could simply stop displaying articles from those who want to charge. The effects can be devastating: when the publisher of <em>Bild</em>, Germany\u2019s biggest tabloid, tried to enforce licensing fees in 2014, its traffic dropped by 80% in two weeks.</p> <p>For licensing to work, news groups will have to act collectively. The creation of Opec in the 1960s transformed the fortunes of oil nations, redressing the balance of power with western-owned oil firms. Should Europe form an Opec for news?</p> <p>Political support for a fightback is at fever pitch in France and Germany, but has been lacking so far in the UK. David Cameron\u2019s links to Google were close. Theresa May, on the other hand, spent years at the Home Office pushing for search engines and social media to take down links to extremist material. She may not be such a fan.</p> <p>But Google is really the wrong target. For many, Facebook is now their primary news source. Publishers voluntarily upload their journalism for free on the platform, where it is then shared between users. The commission\u2019s proposed licensing rights probably wouldn\u2019t apply to the Facebook model. Obtaining fair payment for Europe\u2019s journalistic black gold looks set to remain a pipe dream.</p> <h2>A new chancellor should face up to old poverty statistics</h2> <p>What does a government do when the numbers stop going its way? Stop publishing the numbers, of course.</p> <p>That\u2019s how it looked when former chancellor George Osborne ditched the Treasury\u2019s analysis of how his budgets affected the very poorest and the richest in Britain. Instead, after the Conservatives\u2019 election victory, an inferior substitute of this \u201cdistributional analysis\u201d was concocted. Rather than looking at 10 income groups, it covered just five \u2013 so the impact of austerity on the very poorest was no longer clear. Instead of showing what households actually received, the new model showed changes in the share of public spending received. The newer analysis also projected future effects, not how households were faring in the present.</p> <p>Now Andrew Tyrie MP, chair of the Treasury select committee, is asking the new chancellor Philip Hammond to revert to the old, more transparent analysis. In a government that pledges to create \u201c<a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/statement-from-the-new-prime-minister-theresa-may\" title=\"\">a country that works not for a privileged few, but for every one of us</a>\u201d, let\u2019s hope Hammond listens.</p>",

He has since obtained \u20ac1,000 (\u00a3853) compensation for himself, wife and two children. How much did he pay for those flights? Less than \u00a3400. He feels like he has been given a free holiday. The same colleague flew British Airways from Heathrow to Hawaii last year for a once-in-a-lifetime treat with the family. That flight was also delayed, by just over three hours, and because it was more than 3,500km, they qualified for the big one: \u20ac600 compensation per person. The family picked up \u20ac2,400 (just under \u00a32,000 at the time) from BA. Not quite the whole cost of the tickets, but not far off. You may be left thinking: \u201cI wish I got delayed like that.\u201d Passengers delayed for two-and-a-half hours often find themselves praying the delay will go on for at least another 30 minutes. If they were in America, they wouldn\u2019t be. The US has no formal compensation rules for flight delays. Travellers can be delayed 24 hours on a flight from LA to Manchester and receive nothing, but they can pick up \u00a3500 if they are held up for three hours flying in the opposite direction. The EU261 rules are designed to knock the airlines into shape, and keep delays to a minimum, argue their proponents. These proponents include an increasing number of lawyers keen to snaffle a one-third cut of any \u201caward\u201d from the airline. Back in 2014, easyJet complained that \u201cpaying compensation far in excess of the fare price places a huge financial burden on us as an airline and will ultimately lead to higher fares for all.\u201d The average ticket at easyJet costs \u00a361.93, and half of all sold are below \u00a350. That means the airline has to pay around three times the ticket revenue it receives when there is a delay. Curiously, the airlines were reluctant when the Observer reached out for comment on this issue. They don\u2019t want to appear to be campaigning against consumer rights. But, off the record, their dissatisfaction with the rules is intense \u2013 and understandable. Limiting compensation just to the fare price may make them a little too sloppy when it comes to avoiding delays. But mightn\u2019t it be fairer to repay travellers their ticket price, plus a set fee, such as \u20ac50 or \u20ac100? Still generous, but not excessive. And we need to be thinking about this, because it\u2019s one of those many EU rules which we may have to renegotiate on Brexit. Could there be an \u2018Opec for news\u2019? Finding a way to give newspapers a slug of the advertising cash they have lost to Google is one of those old-media dreams that won\u2019t die. There have been many attempts, most recently in Germany and Spain, but they have all failed. The European commission, we learned on Thursday, is hatching the latest cunning plan. A draft working paper sets out options for a new law. Publishers will have an exclusive right to make their content available to the public and to reproduce it for digital purposes. The intention is to create a better regulatory tool to extract licensing payments from services like Google News. Legislation on its own will change nothing. Publicly funded organisations like the BBC may choose not to demand a fee. And Google could simply stop displaying articles from those who want to charge. The effects can be devastating: when the publisher of Bild, Germany\u2019s biggest tabloid, tried to enforce licensing fees in 2014, its traffic dropped by 80% in two weeks. For licensing to work, news groups will have to act collectively. The creation of Opec in the 1960s transformed the fortunes of oil nations, redressing the balance of power with western-owned oil firms. Should Europe form an Opec for news? Political support for a fightback is at fever pitch in France and Germany, but has been lacking so far in the UK. David Cameron\u2019s links to Google were close. Theresa May, on the other hand, spent years at the Home Office pushing for search engines and social media to take down links to extremist material. She may not be such a fan. But Google is really the wrong target. For many, Facebook is now their primary news source. Publishers voluntarily upload their journalism for free on the platform, where it is then shared between users. The commission\u2019s proposed licensing rights probably wouldn\u2019t apply to the Facebook model. Obtaining fair payment for Europe\u2019s journalistic black gold looks set to remain a pipe dream. A new chancellor should face up to old poverty statistics What does a government do when the numbers stop going its way? Stop publishing the numbers, of course. That\u2019s how it looked when former chancellor George Osborne ditched the Treasury\u2019s analysis of how his budgets affected the very poorest and the richest in Britain. Instead, after the Conservatives\u2019 election victory, an inferior substitute of this \u201cdistributional analysis\u201d was concocted. Rather than looking at 10 income groups, it covered just five \u2013 so the impact of austerity on the very poorest was no longer clear. Instead of showing what households actually received, the new model showed changes in the share of public spending received. The newer analysis also projected future effects, not how households were faring in the present. Now Andrew Tyrie MP, chair of the Treasury select committee, is asking the new chancellor Philip Hammond to revert to the old, more transparent analysis. In a government that pledges to create \u201ca country that works not for a privileged few, but for every one of us\u201d, let\u2019s hope Hammond listens.",

Therefore the ruling should not have a material impact on the group\u2019s finances or its considerable research and development spending. The \u20ac13bn represents more than a quarter of its last full year profits, which were $53.4bn and is equal to sales of 20m iPhone6 Plus handsets, at a current UK cost price of \u00a3539. What does \u20ac13bn mean to Ireland? It is a huge sum \u2013 more than the \u20ac12.9bn annual government spending on the Irish health service and nearly one-third of Ireland\u2019s total government tax revenue in 2015, which was \u20ac45.6bn. It is also the equivalent of \u20ac2,830 for every one of Ireland\u2019s 4.6 million population. Could a post-Brexit UK now offer such generous tax deals? Brussels has no power over corporation tax rates, which member states have always been able to set themselves. The former chancellor, George Osborne, had pledged to make Britain the most competitive G20 country in terms of corporation tax. That has seen him set a roadmap that, unless it is adjusted by his successor, Philip Hammond, will soon take the UK corporate tax rate down to 17%. Once it is outside the EU, Britain would have even more leeway to offer special deals to multinationals in the hope they would invest in the UK. That said, such moves could leave Britain looking more and more like a tax haven, and could hamper the willingness of other countries to trade openly with the UK.",

Nobody did a deal with Apple and we stand over that. Secondly, we think the commission is getting involved in what is the competence of sovereign governments in Europe. The Europe treaties say that individual countries are responsible for taxation policy. And this is an approach through the back door, to try and influence tax policy, through competition law, and we don\u2019t agree with that.

The closing scores in Europe showed: The FTSE 100 fell 17.26 points or 0.25% to 6820.79 Germany\u2019s Dax climbed 1.07% to 10,657.64 France\u2019s Cac closed 0.75% higher at 4457.49 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB finished 1.42% better at 16,891.42 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended 0.8% up at 8685.4 In Greece, the Athens market added 0.48% to 564.37 On that note it\u2019s time to close for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. The US has said it is concerned about Europe\u2019s unilateral approach over international taxation in the wake of the Apple decision, according to Reuters. The White House said if the Europeans have concerns about taxation, they should work jointly with the US. It added that the Apple ruling could hurt the US by allowing the company to deduct European tax payments from US taxes. Former Finnish finance minister Alexander Stubb has weighed in on the Apple debate: More from Irish finance minister Michael Noonan. Speaking to CNBC he said: Apple paid all the tax that was due for their activities in Ireland. The OECD who have been at the forefront of reforming corporation tax say the tax should apply where the economic activity occurs, which generates the profit. Now, on my...the back of my Aplle iPhone, it says, designed in California, manufactured in China. So I can\u2019t see how the Irish authorities would have a tax liability for economic activity, that takes place in other juridictions.... We stand by the legitimacy of what was done in the past. Nobody did a deal with Apple and we stand over that. Secondly, we think the commission is getting involved in what is the competence of sovereign governments in Europe. The Europe treaties say that individual countries are responsible for taxation policy. And this is an approach through the back door, to try and influence tax policy, through competition law, and we don\u2019t agree with that. But more importantly we think they\u2019re in breach of international tax practice, where tax liability follows economic activity, and the economic activity on which they\u2019re raising the tax assessment in Ireland, did not occur in Ireland. Apple shares are currently down just under 1% following the EU tax ruling ordering the company to pay back up to \u20ac13bn in Irish taxes, helping push the Dow Jones Industrial Average 0.25% lower. Jasper Lawler, market analyst at CMC Markets, said: The risk for Ireland is that by taking \u20ac13bn from Apple, there will be a mass exodus of American firms and a resulting loss of jobs and investment. Nobody would dispute that corporations need to pay their fair share of tax, but a retroactive cash-grab creates uncertainty and could impact investment in Europe. Apple\u2019s troubled tax situation will cast a long shadow over the revenue-boosting hopes of [its] new product launch on September 7. Meanwhile Apple-supplier ARM is set to complete its \u00a324bn takeover by Japan\u2019s SoftBank after its shareholders voted overwhelmingly to back the bid. At a court meeting, scheme shareholders voted 95.12% in favour of the deal, while a general meeting later saw 94.92% of votes cast by ordinary shareholders also backing the takeover. Back with Apple, and Ireland needs the US technology group more than the other way round, according to Brad Badertscher, professor of accountancy at the University of Notre Dame\u2019s Mendoza College of Business: I think this will have significant effects on Ireland and the rest of the EU countries. Apple will appeal the ruling and likely pay the taxes many years from now and Apple will do fine going forward but Ireland relies upon Apple for tax revenue (obviously the EU wants them to collect more but at some point more causes Apple to leave and that is likely to happen). Ireland needs Apple more than Apple needs Ireland. Many EU countries used low tax rates to attract large (often US) multinational firms. This door is now closing very quickly and the countries themselves are not happy that the EU is imposing such rules. One of the reasons the UK left the EU was because of the ever increasing power of the EU and this is another example of that power. The strong US consumer confidence figures come despite concerns about the global economy, says Dennis de Jong, managing director of UFX.com, but this may not last: The slight uptick in US consumer confidence for August will have surprised many. Considering the growing global uncertainty on the financial markets, Fed Chair Janet Yellen should be very happy with the results. On the whole, the US consumer has remained a robust proposition within an international context of weakening demand, and the positive data may put the long-speculated interest rate hike further up Yellen\u2019s agenda. The real test, however, is whether this confidence begins to waver as we enter what will surely be the most contentious US presidential race in living memory. Lynn Franco, director of economic indicators at the Conference Board, said: Consumer confidence improved in August to its highest level in nearly a year, after a marginal decline in July. Consumers\u2019 assessment of both current business and labor market conditions was considerably more favorable than last month. Short-term expectations regarding business and employment conditions, as well as personal income prospects, also improved, suggesting the possibility of a moderate pick-up in growth in the coming months. More positive US economic data, with August consumer confidence figures coming in better than expected. According to the Conference Board, the consumer confidence index rose from 96.7 in July to 101.1, better than the 97 forecast and the highest level since September 2015. Elsewhere the Bank of England bought another \u00a31.17bn of long dated bonds - maturing in 15 years or more - as part of its quantitative easing programme. It received offers representing 2.08 times the number of bonds it wanted to buy, up from 1.54 a week ago. German economy minister Sigmar Gabriel has backed the EU ruling that Apple has to pay up to \u20ac13bn in Irish taxes, and named another target. Reuters reports: Gabriel said it was important that companies like Apple and Alphabet Inc\u2019s Google are made to pay their taxes. Meanwhile Irish finance minister Michael Noonan, who earlier said the country would appeal against the EU decision, has been making a few more comments. He told broadcaster RTE: As far as I am concerned there is no economic basis for this decision. It\u2019s bizarre and it\u2019s an exercise in politics by the Competition Commission. They don\u2019t have responsibility for taxes and they are opening a back door through state aid to influence tax policy in European countries when the European treaties say tax policy is a matter for sovereign governments. Only small moves in US markets in early trading on Tuesday, following gains on Monday: Dow Jones: -0.01% at 18,502 S&amp;P 500: +0.01% at 2,181 Nasdaq: -0.05% at 5,230 US house prices dipped by 0.1% in June on a seasonally adjusted basis according to the latest Case-Shiller index. The report, which measures property prices in 20 cities, showed the annual pace of growth slowed to 5.1% from 5.2% in May. Portland, Seattle, and Denver reported the strongest annual rises in June. David Blitzer, managing director and chairman of the index committee at S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices, said: Home prices continued to rise across the country led by the west and the south. Overall, residential real estate and housing is in good shape. Almost time for Wall Street to open. IG is forecasting a very slight fall in US markets: The French president Francois Hollande has thrown the TTIP free trade deal further into doubt by saying it will not be completed before Barack Obama leaves office in January. Hollande said discussions between Europe and the US over the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership had become \u201cbogged down\u201d. Addressing French ambassadors, Hollande said: The negotiations are bogged down, positions have not been respected, it\u2019s clearly unbalanced. It followed comments over the weekend from German economy minister Sigmar Gabriel, who said talks had failed: In my opinion, the negotiations with the United States have de facto failed, even though nobody is really admitting it. The FTSE is lagging its European peers this afternoon. FTSE 100: -0.01% at 6,837 Germany\u2019s DAX: +1% at 10,649 France\u2019s CAC: +0.8% at 4,460 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB: +1.4% at 16,882 Spain\u2019s IBEX: +0.8% at 8,688 Europe\u2019s STOXX 600: +0.6% at 345 In other news, German inflation slowed unexpectedly in August, suggesting price pressures remain weak in Europe\u2019s largest economy. The EU harmonised annual rate of inflation fell to 0.3% from 0.4% in July. Economists polled by Reuters were expecting the rate to pick up to 0.5%. Consumer price inflation on the national measure was unchanged in August at 0.4%. Carsten Brzeski, ING\u2019s chief economist in Germany, say the European Central Bank has a tough job at its policy meeting next week: Today\u2019s German inflation data will not make the ECB\u2019s already difficult life any easier. Ahead of next week\u2019s policy meeting, available data has been too inconclusive to justify any (significant) change to the ECB\u2019s current monetary policy stance. Normally, the staff projections have a so-called cut-off date some ten days ahead of the ECB meeting. This would mean that this week\u2019s set of macro data will not have any impact on the ECB\u2019s staff projections, leaving the projections with a rather benign reaction to the Brexit vote and no hard macro data after the second quarter. Consequently, we expect only very few changes to the ECB staff\u2019s outlook for inflation and growth. Against this background, the ECB will probably try to buy some additional time before making another move. In order not to come entirely empty-handed at next week\u2019s press conference, the ECB could drop the current deposit rate floor for its purchases of government bonds. This would address the increasing problem of bond scarcity and would also buy some time. A Cabinet meeting will be held in Dublin tomorrow to discuss the fallout from the EU\u2019s ruling against Apple\u2019s tax arrangements with the Irish state. Finance Minister Michael Noonan has already briefed his counterpart in the Fianna Fail party, Michael McGrath, about the government\u2019s course of action in appealing against the decision in Brussels. At the heart of the Fine Gael led administration\u2019s objections to any potential \u20ac13 billion tax windfall from Apple is that it would cause Ireland \u201creputational damage\u201d in the eyes of other - mainly US - multi-nationals thinking of establishing their European base in the Republic. Left-wing parties in Ireland have criticised the government\u2019s position on not wanting to force Apple to pay up what the EU says it owes the Irish exchequer . They have demanded that the \u20ac13 billion be channeled into either the Irish health service - the figure is exactly the amount spent each year on public health - or invested in public housing, especially in Dublin where there is a major lack of homes. However, Fine Gael, the main opposition party Fianna Fail, and a host of independent deputies serving as ministers in the coalition government support the policy of a low taxation regime for multi-nationals because they have created hundreds of thousands of jobs in the state. Margrethe Vestager the EU commissioner in charge of competition has spoken to CNBC, and admitted the Apple case is not done and dusted: We have a strong obligation for equal treatment to any country in the EU single market. I think it is more likely that Ireland will continue to appeal the case to the European court system and then of course they will also look at it but that is the most probable situation looking forward. Outlining Apple\u2019s long-standing commitment and economic contribution to Ireland, where it employs almost 6,000 people, Cook goes on to say: Apple is the largest taxpayer in Ireland, the US and the world The company neither sought nor received special tax deals in Ireland Apple is being asked to pay taxes \u201cretroactively\u201d to a government that says it is not owed any money The ruling undermines the sovereignty of EU member states and their ability to deal with their own tax matters Apple will join Ireland in appealing the decision Cook also fires a warning shot on the implications for jobs and investment in Europe: Beyond the obvious targeting of Apple, the most profound and harmful effect of this ruling will be on investment and job creation in Europe. Using the Commission\u2019s theory, every company in Ireland and across Europe is suddenly at risk of being subjected to taxes under laws that never existed. Apple has published a strongly-worded statement from chief executive Tim Cook in response to the EU\u2019s ruling that the company must pay up to \u20ac13bn in back-dated tax to the Irish government. In a statement entitled \u2018a message to the Apple community in Europe\u2019, Cook rejects the EU\u2019s findings and says the US tech giant will appeal the ruling. The European Commission has launched an effort to rewrite Apple\u2019s history in Europe, ignore Ireland\u2019s tax laws and upend the international tax system in the process. The opinion issued on August 30th alleges that Ireland gave Apple a special deal on our taxes. This claim has no basis in fact or in law. We never asked for, nor did we receive, any special deals. We now find ourselves in the unusual position of being ordered to retroactively pay additional taxes to a government that says we don\u2019t owe them any more than we\u2019ve already paid. Cook goes on to say the commission\u2019s move undermines the sovereignty of EU member states: The Commission\u2019s move is unprecedented and it has serious, wide-reaching implications. It is effectively proposing to replace Irish tax laws with a view of what the Commission thinks the law should have been. This would strike a devastating blow to the sovereignty of EU member states over their own tax matters, and to the principle of certainty of law in Europe. Ireland has said they plan to appeal the Commission\u2019s ruling and Apple will do the same. We are confident that the Commission\u2019s order will be reversed. A few more quotes from Margrethe Vestager, the European Commissioner for competition who announced the Apple ruling: Member states cannot give unfair tax benefits to selected companies, no matter if they are European or foreign, large or small, part of a group or not. [In 2011], for every million in profits, it [Apple] paid just \u20ac500 in taxes. This effective tax rate dropped further to as little as 0.005% in 2014 which means that even less was paid in taxes - it was \u20ac50 euros per \u20ac1m in profits. I have the feeling that if my objective tax rate were 0.05% falling to 0.005%, maybe I should have had a second look at my tax bill. Our decision concludes that splitting the profits [between different Apple companies] did not have any factual or economic justification. The company\u2019s head office - or so called head office as it only existed on paper - had no employees, no premises and no real activities. Anneliese Dodds, a British member of the European parliament, says the EU ruling on Ireland\u2019s sweetheart tax deal is a \u201cwatershed moment\u201d in the fight against tax avoidance and evasion. Once again the EU is showing that it leads the way in the fight for tax justice. If the commission has found that the Irish government arranged a special sweetheart deal for Apple in the early 1990s, then it is absolutely right to call an end to this practice and demand that Apple repay the money that it has avoided in taxes for over twenty years. The Tory government in the UK should take note of today\u2019s landmark decision when it approaches Brexit negotiations. Today\u2019s decision should mark a watershed moment in the fight against tax avoidance: the race to the bottom on tax must stop, and we must make sure all companies \u2013 whatever their size \u2013 are able to compete in a fair environment. It is important that the Commission continues to resist interference from the US Government when dealing with tax affairs in Europe. All multinationals, regardless of their country of origin, must abide by EU competition law if they wish to access the European market. The European Commission has provided a graphic to try and help explain Apple\u2019s tax affairs in Ireland: Ireland does not want the money from US tech giant Apple. Michael Noonan, Ireland\u2019s finance minister, says the government will appeal the EU ruling, adding that he disagrees \u201cprofoundly\u201d with the decision in Brussels: The decision leaves me with no choice but to seek cabinet approval to appeal the decision before the European Courts. This is necessary to defend the integrity of our tax system; to provide tax certainty to business; and to challenge the encroachment of EU state aid rules into the sovereign member state competence of taxation. It is important that we send a strong message that Ireland remains an attractive and stable location of choice for long-term substantive investment. Apple has been in Ireland since the 1980s and employs thousands of people in Cork. The company has continued to expand its operations in Ireland in recent times. To put Apple\u2019s Irish unpaid tax bill in context, the Guardian\u2019s Henry McDonald in Dublin says \u20ac13bn is the equivalent of one year\u2019s spending in the Irish health service budget... This is real change, and it is change for the better. - EU commissioner Margrethe Vestager on the Apple tax ruling. The commission found fault with two tax rulings issued by Ireland to Apple that have \u201csubstantially and artificially lowered the tax paid by Apple in Ireland since 1991\u201d. It says almost all profits recorded by two Irish incorporated companies of the Apple group were attributed to a \u201chead office\u201d. However, the commission found these head offices existed only on paper, and could not have generated such profits. These profits allocated to the \u201chead offices\u201d were not subject to tax in any country under specific provisions of the Irish tax law, which are no longer in force. As a result of the allocation method endorsed in the tax rulings, Apple only paid an effective corporate tax rate that declined from 1% in 2003 to 0.005% in 2014 on the profits of Apple Sales International. The European Commission\u2019s investigation into Apple\u2019s tax affairs began in June 2014. It concluded on Tuesday that Ireland has been giving the US tech giant illegal state aid since 1991, adding: The commission can order recovery of illegal state aid for a 10-year period preceding the commission\u2019s first request for information in 2013. Ireland must now recover the unpaid taxes in Ireland from Apple for the years 2003 to 2014 of up to \u20ac13 billion, plus interest. The tax treatment in Ireland enabled Apple to avoid taxation on almost all profits generated by sales of Apple products in the entire EU Single Market. This is due to Apple\u2019s decision to record all sales in Ireland rather than in the countries where the products were sold. This structure is however outside the remit of EU state aid control. If other countries were to require Apple to pay more tax on profits of the two companies over the same period under their national taxation rules, this would reduce the amount to be recovered by Ireland. A few facts about Apple in Ireland from the Guardian\u2019s Henry McDonald: The late Steve Jobs opened Apple\u2019s first base in Ireland in 1980. Apple employs 6,000 people in the Republic, mostly at its main site in Cork. Even with the EU ruling on its tax affairs looming, Apple went ahead with planning permission to expand its facility at Holyhill in Cork which will create an extra 1,000 jobs. Even if Apple pays back millions to the Irish state under EU rules, the windfall gains in 2016 or 2017 will only be allowed to further reduce Ireland\u2019s national debt. Commissioner Margrethe Vestager, in charge of competition policy, says the EU is sending a clear message that illegal state aid will not be tolerated. Member States cannot give tax benefits to selected companies \u2013 this is illegal under EU state aid rules. The Commission\u2019s investigation concluded that Ireland granted illegal tax benefits to Apple, which enabled it to pay substantially less tax than other businesses over many years. In fact, this selective treatment allowed Apple to pay an effective corporate tax rate of 1 per cent on its European profits in 2003 down to 0.005 per cent in 2014. It is now up to Ireland to recover the tax from Apple. The Commission says: The European Commission has concluded that Ireland granted undue tax benefits of up to \u20ac13 billion to Apple. This is illegal under EU state aid rules, because it allowed Apple to pay substantially less tax than other businesses. Ireland must now recover the illegal aid. The full statement on Apple\u2019s Irish tax bill can be found here. Ireland must recover up to \u20ac13bn in taxes from Apple according to an EU ruling. EU regulators say Apple\u2019s unpaid Irish tax bill could be cut if other countries including the US order the company to pay more. The pound is down 0.2% against the dollar this morning at $1.3083. It is roughly flat against the euro at \u20ac1.1710. Confidence in eurozone countries edged lower in August, suggesting the Brexit vote has started to take its toll in the single currency bloc. The European Commission\u2019s economic sentiment indicator fell to 103.5 in August from 104.5 in July. It was weaker than the 104.1 forecast by economists. The business climate indicator fell to a near three-year low of 0.02 this month from 0.38 in July. Jack Allen, European economist at Capital Economics, says the indicators signal a slowdown in the eurozone: August\u2019s fall in the eurozone economic sentiment indicator supports our long-held view that growth in the currency union will slow in the second half of this year. The sectoral breakdown confirmed the fall in consumer confidence and revealed declines in the services, retail and industrial indices. Meanwhile, among the euro-zone\u2019s four largest economies, France was the only country in which the ESI rose. Italy\u2019s index fell to an 18-month low, probably reflecting political uncertainty and concerns about the country\u2019s banks. But the general weakness of ESIs across the euro-zone suggests that more fundamental forces are weighing on growth, such as the fading boost from previous declines in oil prices and the euro exchange rate. Allen says the data suggests quarterly eurozone growth of just 0.1% to 0.2%, from 0.3% in the second quarter. The European Commission is expected to deliver its verdict on Apple\u2019s back-dated Irish tax bill at 11am UK time. The press conference should be live streamed here. Howard Archer at IHS Markit says the weaker-than-expected mortgage data reinforces his expectation that house prices will drop by about 3% towards the end of this year, and by 5% in 2017. We believe housing market activity is likely to be limited over the coming months and prices will weaken as heightened uncertainty following the UK\u2019s vote to leave the EU weighs down on consumer confidence and willingness to engage in major transactions, and also hampers economic activity. The fundamentals for house buyers look likely to soften over the coming months with unemployment rising and purchasing power softening. Scott Bowman, UK economist at Capital Economics, says the drop in mortgage approvals is likely to accelerate in the post Brexit vote environment. July\u2019s UK money and credit figures provided more evidence that the housing market is cooling down. With Brexit uncertainty having driven new buyer enquiries lower in recent months, we suspect that mortgage approvals have further to fall over the rest of the year. There were some initial signs that the Brexit vote has effected consumers too. Indeed, net consumer credit only rose by a monthly \u00a31.2bn, well below the consensus expectation for a \u00a31.7bn increase. The Bank of England figures also revealed a cooling in the amount of credit borrowed by UK consumers. Consumer credit, including credit cards and personal loans, increased by \u00a31.181bn in July, the weakest increase since August 2015. It took the annual rate of growth down to 10.1% from 10.3% - the first drop in growth since December 2014. The figures are contrary to other recent reports that suggest British consumer have shrugged off any uncertainty caused by the Brexit vote. UK banks approved the lowest number of mortgages in July since January 2015 according to the Bank of England. Mortgage approvals fell to 60,912 in the month after the Brexit vote, from 64,152 in June. Economists polled by Reuters had predicted a smaller drop to 61,900 in July. When Janet Yellen gave her highly anticipated speech at Jackson Hole on Friday, commentators initially felt the US Fed chair was sending a hawkish message. But with a bit more time to digest the message, investors appear to have shrugged off concerns that a hike might be coming at the Fed\u2019s September meeting. The probability of a September move increased to 36% from 30%, so there was no huge swing. Yellen said the case for rate rises had \u201cstrengthened\u201d- essentially leaving the door open to a hike before the end of the year - but she gave markets little guidance on timing, saying they would be \u201cgradual\u201d and happen \u201cover time\u201d. Investors will look to the latest US monthly jobs report on Friday for any clue as to whether it makes a September hike more or less likely. Brian Lucey, a professor in finance at Trinity College Dublin, says the EU\u2019s expected ruling on Apple is politically difficult for the Irish government. He told the BBC\u2019s Radio 4 Today programme: Bizarre as though it may seem, on a day when we have been told we have that we have a record level of homelessness among children, the Irish government is going to say no no, we don\u2019t want your filthy money. The reason of course is that they feel if they were to accept the ruling ... that would basically fly in the face of 20/25 years of denials. There are political ramifications from this that they don\u2019t want to face up to. They also feel that were that to be the case they might find themselves under increased pressure in Europe at a time when post Brexit we\u2019re likely to need all the friends we can get in Europe to allow us to cut any special deals regarding the UK\u2019s position with Ireland etc. So they\u2019re in a bit of a bind. Connor Campbell, analyst at Spreadex, gives an insight into the markets this morning: Kicking things off after its Bank Holiday break the UK index rose 20 points after the bell, an upwards move that puts it on track to recover at least some of last week\u2019s gradual losses . If anything the FTSE can feel pleased with any gains at all considering the redness of its mining sector, the likes of BHP Billiton and Rio Tinto down 2.8% and 3.4% respectively. The eurozone was the source of the biggest movers this morning. The DAX surged by 1%, with the CAC not far behind; this meant the former could once again approach 10,650, while the latter held strong at 4,470. European markets are up in early trading, following rises in the US on Monday. FTSE 100: +0.1% at 6,842 Germany\u2019s DAX: +0.5% at 10,595 France\u2019s CAC: +0.5% at 4,444 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB: +1.1% at 16,845 Spain\u2019s IBEX: +0.3% at 8,644 Spanish deflation on the EU harmonised measure of consumer prices eased in August to -0.3% from -0.7% in July. The figure, published by Spain\u2019s statistics office, was in line with expectations. Deflation also eased on Spain\u2019s national measure of consumer prices to -0.1% in August from -0.6% in July. The data come ahead of the flash estimate for eurozone inflation on Wednesday. It is expected to pick up to 0.3% in August from 0.2% in July. Also today... There will be more clues on how well business and consumer confidence is holding up in the eurozone following the Brexit vote in June, with the latest sentiment indexes for August. The Bank of England will publish mortgage approvals and consumer credit data for July, which again will offer some insight into behaviour immediately after the EU vote on 23 June. German inflation data for August will be published ahead of the flash estimate for the wider eurozone on Wednesday. And later in the US the Case-Shiller house price index will be published, as well as the latest consumer confidence report. Europe\u2019s major markets are expected to open higher this morning, with the exception of the FTSE. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Apple is facing a potentially huge bill for back taxes in Ireland, with the European commission expected to give its ruling on the matter today. The commission has been investigating whether Apple\u2019s tax deals with Ireland, which have allowed the company to pay very little tax on income earned throughout Europe, amounted to illegal state aid. We will bring you the decision and reaction when it comes.",

                "bodyText":"Plans by mobile phone operators to block adverts for customers across their networks are in doubt after the EU said they breached net neutrality legislation. Updated guidelines issued by the Body of European Regulators for Electronic Communications (Berec) this week state that advertising should not be blocked by networks, something that mobile operator Three has already trialled in the UK. Net neutrality is the principle that internet service providers should treat all online content equally without blocking or slowing down specific websites on purpose, or allowing companies to pay for preferential treatment. The EU ruling could eliminate a looming threat to publishers who are already struggling with the commercial consequences of growing numbers of people using software to block ads on their PCs or smartphones. Berec\u2019s new guidelines say that providers \u201cshould not block, slow down, alter, restrict, interfere with, degrade or discriminate advertising \u2026 unless the conditions of the exceptions \u2026 are met in a specific case.\u201d It is the responsibility of UK regulator Ofcom to implement and interpret the guidelines. However, the UK government has previously indicated it is sympathetic to publisher complaints about ad blocking. In March, the then culture secretary John Whittingdale described ad blocking as a \u201cmodern-day protection racket\u201d. Three would not comment on the new guidelines but has argued that it does not fall foul of net neutrality rules because it offers consumers a choice about whether or not to block advertising. However, a response to consultation on the guidelines issued by Berec rules out that argument. It says: \u201cBerec does not consider that end-user consent enables ISPs to engage in such practices at the network level.\u201d The intervention by the European commission on behalf of publishers comes just days after reports of proposals to allow news organisations to charge search engines such as Google for using snippets from articles in search results. Germany\u2019s Axel Springer, one of Europe\u2019s most powerful media companies and publisher of the continent\u2019s largest tabloid, Bild, has been vocal in pushing for clampdowns on ad-blocking and greater regulation of the way Google and others use its content online. Three has not revealed the results of its 24-hour trial, and has not said when or if it plans to roll out an ad-blocking product for its customers. The company, which also operates in Italy, is using technology provided by Israeli company Shine, which already provides blocking across the Digicell network in Jamaica owned by Irish tycoon Denis O\u2019Brien. One of Shine\u2019s investors is Li Ka-shing, boss of Three parent company CK Hutchison and also a major investor in Facebook. Facebook itself is engaged in a battle with ad blockers, and earlier this month introduced technology to combat them.
