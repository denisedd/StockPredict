The group also put a further \u00a38m in bank debt in its back pocket to support similar projects such as the reopening of an Art Deco cinema in Bristol which had been derelict for 17 years. \u201cIf anyone thinks they have got an existing cinema and wants to move on, or an old bingo hall or just a cute space we can fit in, we\u2019re interested,\u201d says Lilly.</p> <p>The Odeon business, which was<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/jul/12/guy-hands-sells-odeon-uci-cinemas-group-amc-entertainment\"> sold to the Chinese-backed company AMC last month for \u00a3920m</a>, was happy to offload ageing high street sites as it concentrated on opening out of town multiplexes. Potentially AMC will speed up that process and Lilly says: \u201cIf they\u2019re up for selling we\u2019re up for buying.\u201d Since reopening the former Odeons under the Everyman brand, box office takings have risen 60% on average. \u201cWe completely change the business model and can make these buildings work. There is nothing more satisfying than bringing an old cinema back to life,\u201d says Lilly.</p> <p>The group began life in 2000 when investors led by the young entrepreneur Daniel Broch rescued the Hampstead Everyman from administration. The venture is backed by Paul Wise, Everyman\u2019s chairman, Leonard Lewis, of the family behind the River Island fashion chain, as well as Adam and Sam Kaye, founders of the Ask pizza chain.
