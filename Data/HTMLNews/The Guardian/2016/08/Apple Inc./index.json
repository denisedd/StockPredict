Apple paid a tax rate on European profits of between 0.005% and 1%, according to the EU\u2019s executive arm. The US technology group, and Ireland, have said they will appeal against the decision but it will have ramifications for countries and companies across Europe. </p> <h2>Why has the European commission ordered Ireland to claw back up to \u20ac13bn in tax from Apple?</h2> <p>The commission has found that Apple benefited from a sweetheart tax ruling granted by Ireland decades ago, saving the iPhone-maker huge sums in taxes over many years. The ruling was not only generous but gave Apple special tax treatment unavailable to competitors. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/aug/30/apple-pay-back-taxes-eu-ruling-ireland-state-aid\">As such, competition officials in Brussels have found it amounted to unlawful state aid under EU rules.</a> The sweetheart deal allowed Apple to shift up to two-thirds of its global profits through a handful of Irish-registered companies that routinely paid less than 1% tax.</p> <h2>Are other companies in the line of fire?</h2> <p>Over the past four years the commission has been looking at similar generous tax deals handed out to multinationals, questioning whether they too amount to unlawful state aid. Tax rulings from Luxembourg and the Netherlands \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/oct/21/starbucks-and-fiat-tax-deals-with-eu-nations-ruled-unlawful\">granted to Fiat and Starbucks respectively</a> \u2013 have already been found unlawful. In both cases the companies are appealing against the commission\u2019s findings. Meanwhile, competition regulators are also investigating a tax deal from Luxembourg awarded to both McDonald\u2019s and Amazon. <br></p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/video/2016/aug/30/why-apple-is-facing-13bn-tax-bill-in-ireland-video-explainer\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/5xjmj\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2691352\"            data-video-name=\"Why Apple is facing a \u20ac13bn tax bill in Ireland \u2013 video explainer\"            data-video-provider=\"guardian.co.uk\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-57c5a5a9e4b04fe839bc4fcd\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/08/30/160830applexplainerFINAL_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/08/30/160830applexplainerFINAL.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/08/30/160830applexplainerFINAL_WebM.webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/video/2016/aug/30/why-apple-is-facing-13bn-tax-bill-in-ireland-video-explainer\">Why Apple is facing a \u20ac13bn tax bill in Ireland</a></figcaption> </figure>   <h2>Will EU taxpayers benefit and will multinationals become more transparent with tax?</h2> <p>If the commission\u2019s decision is not overturned on appeal, then Ireland will have to recalculate years of back taxes and send Apple a large bill. That will boost Ireland\u2019s public purse, but in the longer term it may damage its reputation as one of the most attractive places for multinational companies such as Facebook and Google to locate their operations.<br></p> <h2>Will Ireland cease to be a tax haven for multinationals?</h2> <p>Ireland has been under pressure to ditch its most aggressive tax deals for multinationals for many years.

                "bodyText":"The European commission has ordered Apple to pay back the Irish state up to \u20ac13bn in taxes in a landmark ruling. Apple paid a tax rate on European profits of between 0.005% and 1%, according to the EU\u2019s executive arm. The US technology group, and Ireland, have said they will appeal against the decision but it will have ramifications for countries and companies across Europe. Why has the European commission ordered Ireland to claw back up to \u20ac13bn in tax from Apple? The commission has found that Apple benefited from a sweetheart tax ruling granted by Ireland decades ago, saving the iPhone-maker huge sums in taxes over many years. The ruling was not only generous but gave Apple special tax treatment unavailable to competitors. As such, competition officials in Brussels have found it amounted to unlawful state aid under EU rules. The sweetheart deal allowed Apple to shift up to two-thirds of its global profits through a handful of Irish-registered companies that routinely paid less than 1% tax. Are other companies in the line of fire? Over the past four years the commission has been looking at similar generous tax deals handed out to multinationals, questioning whether they too amount to unlawful state aid. Tax rulings from Luxembourg and the Netherlands \u2013 granted to Fiat and Starbucks respectively \u2013 have already been found unlawful. In both cases the companies are appealing against the commission\u2019s findings. Meanwhile, competition regulators are also investigating a tax deal from Luxembourg awarded to both McDonald\u2019s and Amazon. Will EU taxpayers benefit and will multinationals become more transparent with tax? If the commission\u2019s decision is not overturned on appeal, then Ireland will have to recalculate years of back taxes and send Apple a large bill. That will boost Ireland\u2019s public purse, but in the longer term it may damage its reputation as one of the most attractive places for multinational companies such as Facebook and Google to locate their operations. Will Ireland cease to be a tax haven for multinationals? Ireland has been under pressure to ditch its most aggressive tax deals for multinationals for many years. Pressure comes not just from other European countries, but also from the US, where Ireland has been heavily criticised for helping big businesses hoard profits offshore, beyond the reach of the US tax authorities. The so-called \u201cdouble Irish\u201d tax structure, which has been used by Google, Facebook, Microsoft and Apple, is being phased out. However, Ireland has made sure it has other replacement tax breaks to keep multinationals from moving elsewhere. Will this make US multinationals bring their cash piles home? The last place American multinationals want to move profits is back home to the US, where the 35% headline tax rate is one of the highest in the world. While many big firms worry that Brussels may try to chase these huge cash reserves, they would prefer to be taxed in Europe than America so are unlikely to repatriate funds. Can Apple afford to pay back \u20ac13bn? Yes it can. The technology group \u2013 valued at $570bn on the stock market \u2013 has a cash stockpile of more than $230bn, of which more than 90% is kept outside the US so that it does not attract US tax. Therefore the ruling should not have a material impact on the group\u2019s finances or its considerable research and development spending. The \u20ac13bn represents more than a quarter of its last full year profits, which were $53.4bn and is equal to sales of 20m iPhone6 Plus handsets, at a current UK cost price of \u00a3539. What does \u20ac13bn mean to Ireland? It is a huge sum \u2013 more than the \u20ac12.9bn annual government spending on the Irish health service and nearly one-third of Ireland\u2019s total government tax revenue in 2015, which was \u20ac45.6bn. It is also the equivalent of \u20ac2,830 for every one of Ireland\u2019s 4.6 million population. Could a post-Brexit UK now offer such generous tax deals? Brussels has no power over corporation tax rates, which member states have always been able to set themselves. The former chancellor, George Osborne, had pledged to make Britain the most competitive G20 country in terms of corporation tax. That has seen him set a roadmap that, unless it is adjusted by his successor, Philip Hammond, will soon take the UK corporate tax rate down to 17%. Once it is outside the EU, Britain would have even more leeway to offer special deals to multinationals in the hope they would invest in the UK.

Even if we accept the job and wealth creation arguments put forward by multinationals as mitigation against tax liability, this has to be within reason.\u201d Toby Quantrill, Christian Aid\u2019s principal adviser on economic justice, said: \u201cThe staggering amount of money at stake here suggests that millions of citizens are paying a painfully high price for multinationals\u2019 cosy tax deals with certain governments. \u201cThis is not a one-off situation \u2013 it is part of a damaging race to the bottom in which governments are competing on who can offer multinationals the lowest tax bill. It\u2019s time to get multinationals\u2019 tax affairs out in the open, so we can all see how much they are actually contributing to the rest of society.\u201d In the US Peter Kenny, senior market strategist at Global Markets Advisory Group, said it was not yet clear which side would ultimately prevail, but that the ruling was a watershed moment. \u201cThere\u2019s no telling whether the verdict will stand on appeal, but we know that the landscape is changing for US corporations in the EU.\u201d He described Vestager\u2019s ruling as \u201cjust the tip of the spear \u2013 an enormously important ruling\u201d because US-based companies \u201chave traditionally used the EU as a way of circumventing a higher US corporate tax code.\u201d Apple\u2019s share price, however, was largely unmoved. In a note to investors, Gene Munster, analyst at Piper Jaffray, said the \u20ac13bn potential bill was not a big deal for the huge company. \u201cWhile the penalty is large in absolute terms, it represents a small portion of AAPL\u2019s [Apple\u2019s] overall valuation.\u201d It is not yet clear which side will be backed by either of the 2016 presidential candidates. Republican Donald Trump has said he would force US companies, Apple in particular, to move manufacturing jobs within the nation\u2019s own borders, rather than allowing them to seek cheaper labour overseas. He has also said he would lower the US corporate tax rate. His Democratic rival, Hillary Clinton, has also hinted that she might lower the corporate tax rate. She has closer ties to Apple than Trump.

Speaking to CNBC he said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Apple paid all the tax that was due for their activities in Ireland. The OECD who have been at the forefront of reforming corporation tax say the tax should apply where the economic activity occurs, which generates the profit.</p> <p>Now, on my...the back of my Aplle iPhone, it says, designed in California, manufactured in China. So I can\u2019t see how the Irish authorities would have a tax liability for economic activity, that takes place in other juridictions....</p> <p>We stand by the legitimacy of what was done in the past. Nobody did a deal with Apple and we stand over that. Secondly, we think the commission is getting involved in what is the competence of sovereign governments in Europe. The Europe treaties say that individual countries are responsible for taxation policy. And this is an approach through the back door, to try and influence tax policy, through competition law, and we don\u2019t agree with that.

                "bodyText":"It was a mixed day for stock markets, with the FTSE 100 returning after the Bank Holiday weekend with an uncertain performance. Dragged down by mining shares, it ended the day marginally lower. Elsewhere though, European markets ended the day in positive territory, even shrugging off an early fall on Wall Street. Following the EU demand that Apple pay \u20ac13bn in Irish taxes, the US technology group has seen its shares dip 0.6%, helped drag the Dow Jones Industrial Average down 56 points or 0.3%. The closing scores in Europe showed: The FTSE 100 fell 17.26 points or 0.25% to 6820.79 Germany\u2019s Dax climbed 1.07% to 10,657.64 France\u2019s Cac closed 0.75% higher at 4457.49 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB finished 1.42% better at 16,891.42 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended 0.8% up at 8685.4 In Greece, the Athens market added 0.48% to 564.37 On that note it\u2019s time to close for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. The US has said it is concerned about Europe\u2019s unilateral approach over international taxation in the wake of the Apple decision, according to Reuters. The White House said if the Europeans have concerns about taxation, they should work jointly with the US. It added that the Apple ruling could hurt the US by allowing the company to deduct European tax payments from US taxes. Former Finnish finance minister Alexander Stubb has weighed in on the Apple debate: More from Irish finance minister Michael Noonan. Speaking to CNBC he said: Apple paid all the tax that was due for their activities in Ireland. The OECD who have been at the forefront of reforming corporation tax say the tax should apply where the economic activity occurs, which generates the profit. Now, on my...the back of my Aplle iPhone, it says, designed in California, manufactured in China. So I can\u2019t see how the Irish authorities would have a tax liability for economic activity, that takes place in other juridictions.... We stand by the legitimacy of what was done in the past. Nobody did a deal with Apple and we stand over that. Secondly, we think the commission is getting involved in what is the competence of sovereign governments in Europe. The Europe treaties say that individual countries are responsible for taxation policy. And this is an approach through the back door, to try and influence tax policy, through competition law, and we don\u2019t agree with that. But more importantly we think they\u2019re in breach of international tax practice, where tax liability follows economic activity, and the economic activity on which they\u2019re raising the tax assessment in Ireland, did not occur in Ireland. Apple shares are currently down just under 1% following the EU tax ruling ordering the company to pay back up to \u20ac13bn in Irish taxes, helping push the Dow Jones Industrial Average 0.25% lower. Jasper Lawler, market analyst at CMC Markets, said: The risk for Ireland is that by taking \u20ac13bn from Apple, there will be a mass exodus of American firms and a resulting loss of jobs and investment. Nobody would dispute that corporations need to pay their fair share of tax, but a retroactive cash-grab creates uncertainty and could impact investment in Europe. Apple\u2019s troubled tax situation will cast a long shadow over the revenue-boosting hopes of [its] new product launch on September 7. Meanwhile Apple-supplier ARM is set to complete its \u00a324bn takeover by Japan\u2019s SoftBank after its shareholders voted overwhelmingly to back the bid. At a court meeting, scheme shareholders voted 95.12% in favour of the deal, while a general meeting later saw 94.92% of votes cast by ordinary shareholders also backing the takeover. Back with Apple, and Ireland needs the US technology group more than the other way round, according to Brad Badertscher, professor of accountancy at the University of Notre Dame\u2019s Mendoza College of Business: I think this will have significant effects on Ireland and the rest of the EU countries. Apple will appeal the ruling and likely pay the taxes many years from now and Apple will do fine going forward but Ireland relies upon Apple for tax revenue (obviously the EU wants them to collect more but at some point more causes Apple to leave and that is likely to happen). Ireland needs Apple more than Apple needs Ireland. Many EU countries used low tax rates to attract large (often US) multinational firms. This door is now closing very quickly and the countries themselves are not happy that the EU is imposing such rules. One of the reasons the UK left the EU was because of the ever increasing power of the EU and this is another example of that power. The strong US consumer confidence figures come despite concerns about the global economy, says Dennis de Jong, managing director of UFX.com, but this may not last: The slight uptick in US consumer confidence for August will have surprised many. Considering the growing global uncertainty on the financial markets, Fed Chair Janet Yellen should be very happy with the results. On the whole, the US consumer has remained a robust proposition within an international context of weakening demand, and the positive data may put the long-speculated interest rate hike further up Yellen\u2019s agenda. The real test, however, is whether this confidence begins to waver as we enter what will surely be the most contentious US presidential race in living memory. Lynn Franco, director of economic indicators at the Conference Board, said: Consumer confidence improved in August to its highest level in nearly a year, after a marginal decline in July. Consumers\u2019 assessment of both current business and labor market conditions was considerably more favorable than last month. Short-term expectations regarding business and employment conditions, as well as personal income prospects, also improved, suggesting the possibility of a moderate pick-up in growth in the coming months. More positive US economic data, with August consumer confidence figures coming in better than expected. According to the Conference Board, the consumer confidence index rose from 96.7 in July to 101.1, better than the 97 forecast and the highest level since September 2015. Elsewhere the Bank of England bought another \u00a31.17bn of long dated bonds - maturing in 15 years or more - as part of its quantitative easing programme. It received offers representing 2.08 times the number of bonds it wanted to buy, up from 1.54 a week ago. German economy minister Sigmar Gabriel has backed the EU ruling that Apple has to pay up to \u20ac13bn in Irish taxes, and named another target. Reuters reports: Gabriel said it was important that companies like Apple and Alphabet Inc\u2019s Google are made to pay their taxes. Meanwhile Irish finance minister Michael Noonan, who earlier said the country would appeal against the EU decision, has been making a few more comments. He told broadcaster RTE: As far as I am concerned there is no economic basis for this decision. It\u2019s bizarre and it\u2019s an exercise in politics by the Competition Commission. They don\u2019t have responsibility for taxes and they are opening a back door through state aid to influence tax policy in European countries when the European treaties say tax policy is a matter for sovereign governments. Only small moves in US markets in early trading on Tuesday, following gains on Monday: Dow Jones: -0.01% at 18,502 S&amp;P 500: +0.01% at 2,181 Nasdaq: -0.05% at 5,230 US house prices dipped by 0.1% in June on a seasonally adjusted basis according to the latest Case-Shiller index. The report, which measures property prices in 20 cities, showed the annual pace of growth slowed to 5.1% from 5.2% in May. Portland, Seattle, and Denver reported the strongest annual rises in June. David Blitzer, managing director and chairman of the index committee at S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices, said: Home prices continued to rise across the country led by the west and the south. Overall, residential real estate and housing is in good shape. Almost time for Wall Street to open. IG is forecasting a very slight fall in US markets: The French president Francois Hollande has thrown the TTIP free trade deal further into doubt by saying it will not be completed before Barack Obama leaves office in January. Hollande said discussions between Europe and the US over the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership had become \u201cbogged down\u201d. Addressing French ambassadors, Hollande said: The negotiations are bogged down, positions have not been respected, it\u2019s clearly unbalanced. It followed comments over the weekend from German economy minister Sigmar Gabriel, who said talks had failed: In my opinion, the negotiations with the United States have de facto failed, even though nobody is really admitting it. The FTSE is lagging its European peers this afternoon. FTSE 100: -0.01% at 6,837 Germany\u2019s DAX: +1% at 10,649 France\u2019s CAC: +0.8% at 4,460 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB: +1.4% at 16,882 Spain\u2019s IBEX: +0.8% at 8,688 Europe\u2019s STOXX 600: +0.6% at 345 In other news, German inflation slowed unexpectedly in August, suggesting price pressures remain weak in Europe\u2019s largest economy. The EU harmonised annual rate of inflation fell to 0.3% from 0.4% in July. Economists polled by Reuters were expecting the rate to pick up to 0.5%. Consumer price inflation on the national measure was unchanged in August at 0.4%. Carsten Brzeski, ING\u2019s chief economist in Germany, say the European Central Bank has a tough job at its policy meeting next week: Today\u2019s German inflation data will not make the ECB\u2019s already difficult life any easier. Ahead of next week\u2019s policy meeting, available data has been too inconclusive to justify any (significant) change to the ECB\u2019s current monetary policy stance. Normally, the staff projections have a so-called cut-off date some ten days ahead of the ECB meeting. This would mean that this week\u2019s set of macro data will not have any impact on the ECB\u2019s staff projections, leaving the projections with a rather benign reaction to the Brexit vote and no hard macro data after the second quarter. Consequently, we expect only very few changes to the ECB staff\u2019s outlook for inflation and growth. Against this background, the ECB will probably try to buy some additional time before making another move. In order not to come entirely empty-handed at next week\u2019s press conference, the ECB could drop the current deposit rate floor for its purchases of government bonds. This would address the increasing problem of bond scarcity and would also buy some time. A Cabinet meeting will be held in Dublin tomorrow to discuss the fallout from the EU\u2019s ruling against Apple\u2019s tax arrangements with the Irish state. Finance Minister Michael Noonan has already briefed his counterpart in the Fianna Fail party, Michael McGrath, about the government\u2019s course of action in appealing against the decision in Brussels. At the heart of the Fine Gael led administration\u2019s objections to any potential \u20ac13 billion tax windfall from Apple is that it would cause Ireland \u201creputational damage\u201d in the eyes of other - mainly US - multi-nationals thinking of establishing their European base in the Republic. Left-wing parties in Ireland have criticised the government\u2019s position on not wanting to force Apple to pay up what the EU says it owes the Irish exchequer . They have demanded that the \u20ac13 billion be channeled into either the Irish health service - the figure is exactly the amount spent each year on public health - or invested in public housing, especially in Dublin where there is a major lack of homes. However, Fine Gael, the main opposition party Fianna Fail, and a host of independent deputies serving as ministers in the coalition government support the policy of a low taxation regime for multi-nationals because they have created hundreds of thousands of jobs in the state. Margrethe Vestager the EU commissioner in charge of competition has spoken to CNBC, and admitted the Apple case is not done and dusted: We have a strong obligation for equal treatment to any country in the EU single market. I think it is more likely that Ireland will continue to appeal the case to the European court system and then of course they will also look at it but that is the most probable situation looking forward. Outlining Apple\u2019s long-standing commitment and economic contribution to Ireland, where it employs almost 6,000 people, Cook goes on to say: Apple is the largest taxpayer in Ireland, the US and the world The company neither sought nor received special tax deals in Ireland Apple is being asked to pay taxes \u201cretroactively\u201d to a government that says it is not owed any money The ruling undermines the sovereignty of EU member states and their ability to deal with their own tax matters Apple will join Ireland in appealing the decision Cook also fires a warning shot on the implications for jobs and investment in Europe: Beyond the obvious targeting of Apple, the most profound and harmful effect of this ruling will be on investment and job creation in Europe. Using the Commission\u2019s theory, every company in Ireland and across Europe is suddenly at risk of being subjected to taxes under laws that never existed. Apple has published a strongly-worded statement from chief executive Tim Cook in response to the EU\u2019s ruling that the company must pay up to \u20ac13bn in back-dated tax to the Irish government. In a statement entitled \u2018a message to the Apple community in Europe\u2019, Cook rejects the EU\u2019s findings and says the US tech giant will appeal the ruling. The European Commission has launched an effort to rewrite Apple\u2019s history in Europe, ignore Ireland\u2019s tax laws and upend the international tax system in the process. The opinion issued on August 30th alleges that Ireland gave Apple a special deal on our taxes. This claim has no basis in fact or in law. We never asked for, nor did we receive, any special deals. We now find ourselves in the unusual position of being ordered to retroactively pay additional taxes to a government that says we don\u2019t owe them any more than we\u2019ve already paid. Cook goes on to say the commission\u2019s move undermines the sovereignty of EU member states: The Commission\u2019s move is unprecedented and it has serious, wide-reaching implications. It is effectively proposing to replace Irish tax laws with a view of what the Commission thinks the law should have been. This would strike a devastating blow to the sovereignty of EU member states over their own tax matters, and to the principle of certainty of law in Europe. Ireland has said they plan to appeal the Commission\u2019s ruling and Apple will do the same. We are confident that the Commission\u2019s order will be reversed. A few more quotes from Margrethe Vestager, the European Commissioner for competition who announced the Apple ruling: Member states cannot give unfair tax benefits to selected companies, no matter if they are European or foreign, large or small, part of a group or not. [In 2011], for every million in profits, it [Apple] paid just \u20ac500 in taxes. This effective tax rate dropped further to as little as 0.005% in 2014 which means that even less was paid in taxes - it was \u20ac50 euros per \u20ac1m in profits. I have the feeling that if my objective tax rate were 0.05% falling to 0.005%, maybe I should have had a second look at my tax bill. Our decision concludes that splitting the profits [between different Apple companies] did not have any factual or economic justification. The company\u2019s head office - or so called head office as it only existed on paper - had no employees, no premises and no real activities. Anneliese Dodds, a British member of the European parliament, says the EU ruling on Ireland\u2019s sweetheart tax deal is a \u201cwatershed moment\u201d in the fight against tax avoidance and evasion. Once again the EU is showing that it leads the way in the fight for tax justice. If the commission has found that the Irish government arranged a special sweetheart deal for Apple in the early 1990s, then it is absolutely right to call an end to this practice and demand that Apple repay the money that it has avoided in taxes for over twenty years. The Tory government in the UK should take note of today\u2019s landmark decision when it approaches Brexit negotiations. Today\u2019s decision should mark a watershed moment in the fight against tax avoidance: the race to the bottom on tax must stop, and we must make sure all companies \u2013 whatever their size \u2013 are able to compete in a fair environment. It is important that the Commission continues to resist interference from the US Government when dealing with tax affairs in Europe. All multinationals, regardless of their country of origin, must abide by EU competition law if they wish to access the European market. The European Commission has provided a graphic to try and help explain Apple\u2019s tax affairs in Ireland: Ireland does not want the money from US tech giant Apple. Michael Noonan, Ireland\u2019s finance minister, says the government will appeal the EU ruling, adding that he disagrees \u201cprofoundly\u201d with the decision in Brussels: The decision leaves me with no choice but to seek cabinet approval to appeal the decision before the European Courts. This is necessary to defend the integrity of our tax system; to provide tax certainty to business; and to challenge the encroachment of EU state aid rules into the sovereign member state competence of taxation. It is important that we send a strong message that Ireland remains an attractive and stable location of choice for long-term substantive investment. Apple has been in Ireland since the 1980s and employs thousands of people in Cork. The company has continued to expand its operations in Ireland in recent times. To put Apple\u2019s Irish unpaid tax bill in context, the Guardian\u2019s Henry McDonald in Dublin says \u20ac13bn is the equivalent of one year\u2019s spending in the Irish health service budget... This is real change, and it is change for the better. - EU commissioner Margrethe Vestager on the Apple tax ruling. The commission found fault with two tax rulings issued by Ireland to Apple that have \u201csubstantially and artificially lowered the tax paid by Apple in Ireland since 1991\u201d. It says almost all profits recorded by two Irish incorporated companies of the Apple group were attributed to a \u201chead office\u201d. However, the commission found these head offices existed only on paper, and could not have generated such profits. These profits allocated to the \u201chead offices\u201d were not subject to tax in any country under specific provisions of the Irish tax law, which are no longer in force. As a result of the allocation method endorsed in the tax rulings, Apple only paid an effective corporate tax rate that declined from 1% in 2003 to 0.005% in 2014 on the profits of Apple Sales International. The European Commission\u2019s investigation into Apple\u2019s tax affairs began in June 2014. It concluded on Tuesday that Ireland has been giving the US tech giant illegal state aid since 1991, adding: The commission can order recovery of illegal state aid for a 10-year period preceding the commission\u2019s first request for information in 2013. Ireland must now recover the unpaid taxes in Ireland from Apple for the years 2003 to 2014 of up to \u20ac13 billion, plus interest. The tax treatment in Ireland enabled Apple to avoid taxation on almost all profits generated by sales of Apple products in the entire EU Single Market. This is due to Apple\u2019s decision to record all sales in Ireland rather than in the countries where the products were sold. This structure is however outside the remit of EU state aid control. If other countries were to require Apple to pay more tax on profits of the two companies over the same period under their national taxation rules, this would reduce the amount to be recovered by Ireland. A few facts about Apple in Ireland from the Guardian\u2019s Henry McDonald: The late Steve Jobs opened Apple\u2019s first base in Ireland in 1980. Apple employs 6,000 people in the Republic, mostly at its main site in Cork. Even with the EU ruling on its tax affairs looming, Apple went ahead with planning permission to expand its facility at Holyhill in Cork which will create an extra 1,000 jobs. Even if Apple pays back millions to the Irish state under EU rules, the windfall gains in 2016 or 2017 will only be allowed to further reduce Ireland\u2019s national debt. Commissioner Margrethe Vestager, in charge of competition policy, says the EU is sending a clear message that illegal state aid will not be tolerated. Member States cannot give tax benefits to selected companies \u2013 this is illegal under EU state aid rules. The Commission\u2019s investigation concluded that Ireland granted illegal tax benefits to Apple, which enabled it to pay substantially less tax than other businesses over many years. In fact, this selective treatment allowed Apple to pay an effective corporate tax rate of 1 per cent on its European profits in 2003 down to 0.005 per cent in 2014. It is now up to Ireland to recover the tax from Apple. The Commission says: The European Commission has concluded that Ireland granted undue tax benefits of up to \u20ac13 billion to Apple. This is illegal under EU state aid rules, because it allowed Apple to pay substantially less tax than other businesses. Ireland must now recover the illegal aid. The full statement on Apple\u2019s Irish tax bill can be found here. Ireland must recover up to \u20ac13bn in taxes from Apple according to an EU ruling. EU regulators say Apple\u2019s unpaid Irish tax bill could be cut if other countries including the US order the company to pay more. The pound is down 0.2% against the dollar this morning at $1.3083. It is roughly flat against the euro at \u20ac1.1710. Confidence in eurozone countries edged lower in August, suggesting the Brexit vote has started to take its toll in the single currency bloc. The European Commission\u2019s economic sentiment indicator fell to 103.5 in August from 104.5 in July. It was weaker than the 104.1 forecast by economists. The business climate indicator fell to a near three-year low of 0.02 this month from 0.38 in July. Jack Allen, European economist at Capital Economics, says the indicators signal a slowdown in the eurozone: August\u2019s fall in the eurozone economic sentiment indicator supports our long-held view that growth in the currency union will slow in the second half of this year. The sectoral breakdown confirmed the fall in consumer confidence and revealed declines in the services, retail and industrial indices. Meanwhile, among the euro-zone\u2019s four largest economies, France was the only country in which the ESI rose. Italy\u2019s index fell to an 18-month low, probably reflecting political uncertainty and concerns about the country\u2019s banks. But the general weakness of ESIs across the euro-zone suggests that more fundamental forces are weighing on growth, such as the fading boost from previous declines in oil prices and the euro exchange rate. Allen says the data suggests quarterly eurozone growth of just 0.1% to 0.2%, from 0.3% in the second quarter. The European Commission is expected to deliver its verdict on Apple\u2019s back-dated Irish tax bill at 11am UK time. The press conference should be live streamed here. Howard Archer at IHS Markit says the weaker-than-expected mortgage data reinforces his expectation that house prices will drop by about 3% towards the end of this year, and by 5% in 2017. We believe housing market activity is likely to be limited over the coming months and prices will weaken as heightened uncertainty following the UK\u2019s vote to leave the EU weighs down on consumer confidence and willingness to engage in major transactions, and also hampers economic activity. The fundamentals for house buyers look likely to soften over the coming months with unemployment rising and purchasing power softening. Scott Bowman, UK economist at Capital Economics, says the drop in mortgage approvals is likely to accelerate in the post Brexit vote environment. July\u2019s UK money and credit figures provided more evidence that the housing market is cooling down. With Brexit uncertainty having driven new buyer enquiries lower in recent months, we suspect that mortgage approvals have further to fall over the rest of the year. There were some initial signs that the Brexit vote has effected consumers too. Indeed, net consumer credit only rose by a monthly \u00a31.2bn, well below the consensus expectation for a \u00a31.7bn increase. The Bank of England figures also revealed a cooling in the amount of credit borrowed by UK consumers. Consumer credit, including credit cards and personal loans, increased by \u00a31.181bn in July, the weakest increase since August 2015. It took the annual rate of growth down to 10.1% from 10.3% - the first drop in growth since December 2014. The figures are contrary to other recent reports that suggest British consumer have shrugged off any uncertainty caused by the Brexit vote. UK banks approved the lowest number of mortgages in July since January 2015 according to the Bank of England. Mortgage approvals fell to 60,912 in the month after the Brexit vote, from 64,152 in June. Economists polled by Reuters had predicted a smaller drop to 61,900 in July. When Janet Yellen gave her highly anticipated speech at Jackson Hole on Friday, commentators initially felt the US Fed chair was sending a hawkish message. But with a bit more time to digest the message, investors appear to have shrugged off concerns that a hike might be coming at the Fed\u2019s September meeting. The probability of a September move increased to 36% from 30%, so there was no huge swing. Yellen said the case for rate rises had \u201cstrengthened\u201d- essentially leaving the door open to a hike before the end of the year - but she gave markets little guidance on timing, saying they would be \u201cgradual\u201d and happen \u201cover time\u201d. Investors will look to the latest US monthly jobs report on Friday for any clue as to whether it makes a September hike more or less likely. Brian Lucey, a professor in finance at Trinity College Dublin, says the EU\u2019s expected ruling on Apple is politically difficult for the Irish government. He told the BBC\u2019s Radio 4 Today programme: Bizarre as though it may seem, on a day when we have been told we have that we have a record level of homelessness among children, the Irish government is going to say no no, we don\u2019t want your filthy money. The reason of course is that they feel if they were to accept the ruling ... that would basically fly in the face of 20/25 years of denials. There are political ramifications from this that they don\u2019t want to face up to. They also feel that were that to be the case they might find themselves under increased pressure in Europe at a time when post Brexit we\u2019re likely to need all the friends we can get in Europe to allow us to cut any special deals regarding the UK\u2019s position with Ireland etc. So they\u2019re in a bit of a bind. Connor Campbell, analyst at Spreadex, gives an insight into the markets this morning: Kicking things off after its Bank Holiday break the UK index rose 20 points after the bell, an upwards move that puts it on track to recover at least some of last week\u2019s gradual losses . If anything the FTSE can feel pleased with any gains at all considering the redness of its mining sector, the likes of BHP Billiton and Rio Tinto down 2.8% and 3.4% respectively. The eurozone was the source of the biggest movers this morning. The DAX surged by 1%, with the CAC not far behind; this meant the former could once again approach 10,650, while the latter held strong at 4,470. European markets are up in early trading, following rises in the US on Monday. FTSE 100: +0.1% at 6,842 Germany\u2019s DAX: +0.5% at 10,595 France\u2019s CAC: +0.5% at 4,444 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB: +1.1% at 16,845 Spain\u2019s IBEX: +0.3% at 8,644 Spanish deflation on the EU harmonised measure of consumer prices eased in August to -0.3% from -0.7% in July. The figure, published by Spain\u2019s statistics office, was in line with expectations. Deflation also eased on Spain\u2019s national measure of consumer prices to -0.1% in August from -0.6% in July. The data come ahead of the flash estimate for eurozone inflation on Wednesday. It is expected to pick up to 0.3% in August from 0.2% in July. Also today... There will be more clues on how well business and consumer confidence is holding up in the eurozone following the Brexit vote in June, with the latest sentiment indexes for August. The Bank of England will publish mortgage approvals and consumer credit data for July, which again will offer some insight into behaviour immediately after the EU vote on 23 June. German inflation data for August will be published ahead of the flash estimate for the wider eurozone on Wednesday. And later in the US the Case-Shiller house price index will be published, as well as the latest consumer confidence report. Europe\u2019s major markets are expected to open higher this morning, with the exception of the FTSE. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Apple is facing a potentially huge bill for back taxes in Ireland, with the European commission expected to give its ruling on the matter today. The commission has been investigating whether Apple\u2019s tax deals with Ireland, which have allowed the company to pay very little tax on income earned throughout Europe, amounted to illegal state aid. We will bring you the decision and reaction when it comes.",

How dare Brussels\u2019 meddling competition regulators <a href=\"http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_IP-16-2923_en.htm\">retrospectively unpick a tax deal</a> that the iPhone-maker had secured from Ireland a quarter of a century ago. What business is it of theirs? Tax, after all, is a sovereign issue for each individual member state within the European Union. The European commission\u2019s ruling would have a \u201cprofound and harmful effect\u201d on investment and job creation in Europe, he said.</p> <p>His political allies at home have waded in too. US Treasury secretary Jack Lew <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/aug/24/apple-taxes-european-commission\">warned last week</a> that the move could have a \u201cchilling effect on US-EU cross-border investment\u201d. The US would have to \u201cconsider potential responses\u201d. </p> <p>According to the Cook script, Apple is a good corporate citizen with a long history of investment and employment in Ireland. That is why, quite properly, almost two-third\u2019s of the group\u2019s profits arise in its Irish-registered subsidiaries. On Tuesday, he posted a lengthy <a href=\"http://www.apple.com/ie/customer-letter/\">message direct to customers</a> explaining what a travesty of justice Brussels\u2019 intervention had been, with \u201cno basis in fact or in law\u201d.</p> <p>That, of course, is hogwash. Whatever you think of the commission\u2019s intervention, any honest discussion of Apple\u2019s taxes must start with the admission that its subsidiaries in Knocknaheeny, a run-down suburb of Cork, do not produce almost two-thirds of the group\u2019s profits. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/aug/30/apple-pay-back-taxes-eu-ruling-ireland-state-aid\">Apple ordered to pay up to \u20ac13bn after EU rules Ireland broke state aid laws</a> </p> </aside>  <p>That Cook still clings to this narrative is disappointing, and does not reflect well on those advisers he has gathered around him. </p> <p>The Apple CEO would do well to listen a little to the candid reflections of the firm\u2019s co-founder Steve Wozniak. Earlier this year, <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-36108378\">he said</a>: \u201cI don\u2019t like the idea that Apple might be unfair \u2013 not paying taxes the way I do as a person.\u201d </p> <p>For all that, Wozniak noted, on the other hand there are always commercial pressures at play. \u201cAny company that is a public company, its shareholders are going to force it to be as profitable as possible. And that means financial people studying all the laws of the world and figuring out all the schemes that work that are technically legal.\u201d</p> <p>Cook, though, has his own, cleaner, less equivocal, version of events. And Tuesday was not the first time he has taken to the stage, with faux exasperation, offering justifications of Apple\u2019s huge Irish profits that have for years gone almost entirely untaxed. In 2013, he appeared before the US senate subcommittee on investigations to reject a detailed analysis of the group\u2019s tax planning from Carl Levin (Democrat) and John McCain (Republican).</p> <p>\u201cYou shifted that golden goose to Ireland,\u201d Levin accused Cook, summing up his verdict during a six-hour hearing. \u201cYou shifted it to three companies that do not pay taxes in Ireland \u2026 These are the crown jewels of Apple Inc \u2026 Folks, it\u2019s not right.\u201d</p> <p>Cook affected incredulity. \u201cThere is no [profit] shifting going on that I see at all,\u201d he said. \u201cApple has real operations in real places, with Apple employees selling real products to real customers. We pay all the taxes we owe \u2013 every single dollar \u2026 We don\u2019t depend on tax gimmicks.\u201d</p> <p>That message is now as obsolete as an iPod Classic. Nevertheless, sorting out a fair resolution of Apple\u2019s tax affairs remains less obvious. Where exactly has the tech firm be avoiding its dues? If not Ireland, then where are Apple\u2019s profits truly made? <br></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/aug/30/eu-apple-ireland-tax-ruling-q-and-a\">The Apple tax ruling \u2013 what this means for Ireland, tax and multinationals</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The fact that the group\u2019s tax structure has been subject to fierce attack from critics in both Washington and Brussels shows that there are several parties who feel they are entitled to spoils from any revised tax settlement. <br></p> <p>At present though, it is Ireland that is set to benefit from the European commission\u2019s decision. And the result could be a one of the largest ever bills for back taxes, running into many billions of euros. Brussels officials have suggested the figure could be up to \u20ac13bn (\u00a311bn), though the final sum will be for the Irish tax office to determine. </p> <p>Add to that sum interest charges stretching back more than 10 years and the final tally could put a modest, but not insignificant, dent in Apple\u2019s colossal offshore reserves. At last count, this cash pile stood at more than $200bn (\u00a3152bn).</p> <p> However dim the view you take of Apple\u2019s tax planning, though, a multibillion euro windfall for Ireland looks perverse. Critics on both sides of the Atlantic have castigated Dublin\u2019s politicians and regulators for helping Apple spirit taxable profits away from other jurisdictions. Why should Irish taxpayers end up winners?<br></p> <p>It is an uncomfortable irony that Margrethe Vestager, Europe\u2019s competition commissioner, is well aware of. After announcing her Apple decision, she stressed that it was now open to other countries to draw on the commission\u2019s analysis and make their own sub-claims on Apple\u2019s Irish back taxes. Even America, she appeared to hint, could have a call on this money.<br></p> <p>All of which looks a messy prospect, which is unlikely to be resolved for many years. As Vestager noted, her powers are limited. Occasional moves by Brussels to police the taxation of multinationals need to be complemented by co-ordinated and sustained international efforts that close loopholes and ensure tax regimes keep pace with the digital economy.</p> <p>Some argue that Vestager did more on Tuesday to damage than to assist this fragile international consensus on tackling tax avoidance. Certainly her intervention has ruffled feathers and, in the short term at least, appears to offer a far from perfect resolution. <br></p> <p>That said, any serious effort to root out toxic tax behaviour is bound to create upset along the way. There are powerful vested interests that would like to see the taxation of corporate profits wither and fade into history. Vestager has set herself against such ambitions. A few more politicians showing her courage would be a fine thing.<br></p> <ul> <li>This article was amended on 31 August.</li> </ul>",

The European commission\u2019s ruling would have a \u201cprofound and harmful effect\u201d on investment and job creation in Europe, he said. His political allies at home have waded in too. US Treasury secretary Jack Lew warned last week that the move could have a \u201cchilling effect on US-EU cross-border investment\u201d. The US would have to \u201cconsider potential responses\u201d. According to the Cook script, Apple is a good corporate citizen with a long history of investment and employment in Ireland. That is why, quite properly, almost two-third\u2019s of the group\u2019s profits arise in its Irish-registered subsidiaries. On Tuesday, he posted a lengthy message direct to customers explaining what a travesty of justice Brussels\u2019 intervention had been, with \u201cno basis in fact or in law\u201d. That, of course, is hogwash. Whatever you think of the commission\u2019s intervention, any honest discussion of Apple\u2019s taxes must start with the admission that its subsidiaries in Knocknaheeny, a run-down suburb of Cork, do not produce almost two-thirds of the group\u2019s profits. That Cook still clings to this narrative is disappointing, and does not reflect well on those advisers he has gathered around him. The Apple CEO would do well to listen a little to the candid reflections of the firm\u2019s co-founder Steve Wozniak. Earlier this year, he said: \u201cI don\u2019t like the idea that Apple might be unfair \u2013 not paying taxes the way I do as a person.\u201d For all that, Wozniak noted, on the other hand there are always commercial pressures at play. \u201cAny company that is a public company, its shareholders are going to force it to be as profitable as possible. And that means financial people studying all the laws of the world and figuring out all the schemes that work that are technically legal.\u201d Cook, though, has his own, cleaner, less equivocal, version of events. And Tuesday was not the first time he has taken to the stage, with faux exasperation, offering justifications of Apple\u2019s huge Irish profits that have for years gone almost entirely untaxed. In 2013, he appeared before the US senate subcommittee on investigations to reject a detailed analysis of the group\u2019s tax planning from Carl Levin (Democrat) and John McCain (Republican). \u201cYou shifted that golden goose to Ireland,\u201d Levin accused Cook, summing up his verdict during a six-hour hearing. \u201cYou shifted it to three companies that do not pay taxes in Ireland \u2026 These are the crown jewels of Apple Inc \u2026 Folks, it\u2019s not right.\u201d Cook affected incredulity. \u201cThere is no [profit] shifting going on that I see at all,\u201d he said. \u201cApple has real operations in real places, with Apple employees selling real products to real customers. We pay all the taxes we owe \u2013 every single dollar \u2026 We don\u2019t depend on tax gimmicks.\u201d That message is now as obsolete as an iPod Classic. Nevertheless, sorting out a fair resolution of Apple\u2019s tax affairs remains less obvious. Where exactly has the tech firm be avoiding its dues? If not Ireland, then where are Apple\u2019s profits truly made? The fact that the group\u2019s tax structure has been subject to fierce attack from critics in both Washington and Brussels shows that there are several parties who feel they are entitled to spoils from any revised tax settlement. At present though, it is Ireland that is set to benefit from the European commission\u2019s decision. And the result could be a one of the largest ever bills for back taxes, running into many billions of euros. Brussels officials have suggested the figure could be up to \u20ac13bn (\u00a311bn), though the final sum will be for the Irish tax office to determine. Add to that sum interest charges stretching back more than 10 years and the final tally could put a modest, but not insignificant, dent in Apple\u2019s colossal offshore reserves. At last count, this cash pile stood at more than $200bn (\u00a3152bn). However dim the view you take of Apple\u2019s tax planning, though, a multibillion euro windfall for Ireland looks perverse. Critics on both sides of the Atlantic have castigated Dublin\u2019s politicians and regulators for helping Apple spirit taxable profits away from other jurisdictions. Why should Irish taxpayers end up winners? It is an uncomfortable irony that Margrethe Vestager, Europe\u2019s competition commissioner, is well aware of. After announcing her Apple decision, she stressed that it was now open to other countries to draw on the commission\u2019s analysis and make their own sub-claims on Apple\u2019s Irish back taxes. Even America, she appeared to hint, could have a call on this money. All of which looks a messy prospect, which is unlikely to be resolved for many years. As Vestager noted, her powers are limited. Occasional moves by Brussels to police the taxation of multinationals need to be complemented by co-ordinated and sustained international efforts that close loopholes and ensure tax regimes keep pace with the digital economy. Some argue that Vestager did more on Tuesday to damage than to assist this fragile international consensus on tackling tax avoidance. Certainly her intervention has ruffled feathers and, in the short term at least, appears to offer a far from perfect resolution. That said, any serious effort to root out toxic tax behaviour is bound to create upset along the way. There are powerful vested interests that would like to see the taxation of corporate profits wither and fade into history. Vestager has set herself against such ambitions. A few more politicians showing her courage would be a fine thing. This article was amended on 31 August.",

Which is what they need to be told.\u201d O\u2019Leary said he didn\u2019t think the ruling would withstand a legal challenge. \u201cI think it has no chance of surviving a court ruling in Europe,\u201d he said. \u201cThe idea that the state aid mob, who have had more court verdicts overturned than any other department in Europe in the past 20 years, can come along 10 years after the event and say \u2018We didn\u2019t like that, we think you should have done something else\u2019 is frankly bizarre.\u201d \u201cWill they tell the UK you can now start charging all the Russian billionaires who are here on non dom tax schemes \u2018Sorry, you\u2019re providing state aid to Russian oligarchs, you should tax them all at 55%?\u2019\u201d \u201cThere are certain things Europe has no competence in and no rights in.\u201d",
