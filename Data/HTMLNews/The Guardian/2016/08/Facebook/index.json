It is the story of what happens when governments believe cutting funding has no consequence and that paying fewer people to do the same work is an \u201cefficiency\u201d regardless of quality.</p> <p>I am probably among the top 0.1% users of the ABS website. I spend whole days looking at data, and as one who will mine the census data when it is finally released I had no issue with completing my census form. I wasn\u2019t very much persuaded by those arguing I should boycott the census due to privacy fears, mostly because I found the arguments pretty weak and covered in layers of smugness towards anyone who dared to suggest the concerns were overstated.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/aug/10/census-2016-the-political-game-has-changed-and-coalition-failed-its-first-test\">Census 2016: the political game has changed and Coalition failed its first test | Katharine Murphy</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But the failure of the census site last night unfortunately will only serve to bolster those arguments. It rather easily raises the question: if the ABS can\u2019t even be trusted to properly collect our data, how can we trust them to keep it?</p> <p>The reality is almost no one outside of the ABS was surprised the site crashed. It was utterly foreseeable.</p> <p>And suggestions of a DDoS attack are completely beside the point. When shifting to an online survey of such a size the first item on the risk management list would have been the ability to cope with large numbers, and the second would be the ability to cope with a DDoS attack.</p> <p>Being told that a router overloaded just screams incompetence. </p> <p>The signs were evident long ago that the ABS was struggling.</p> <p>Early last year \u2013 in what was mostly understood to be a desperate attempt to wake up the government \u2013 the ABS <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/feb/19/census-in-2016-in-doubt-as-10-year-data-collection-considered\">floated the idea</a> of moving the census from every five years to every 10 years.</p> <p>The problem had nothing to do with efficacy of a five-yearly census, but was all about funding. After years of \u201cefficiency dividends\u201d the ABS was holding itself together with duct tape and prayers.</p> <p>The census in 2011 cost $440m, so for an agency under severe budget constraint, stopping a half a billion dollar exercise is not just one way to save money, but given the importance of the census, is also a good way to make the issue of ABS funding very public.</p> <p>And it worked \u2013 in <a href=\"http://www.budget.gov.au/2015-16/content/bp2/html/bp2_expense-21.htm\">the 2015 budget</a> the government included $234.7m in funding over five years to the ABS.</p> <p>But it was too late to help this year\u2019s census and too late to undo what has been a long running and bipartisan approach.</p> <p>The ALP under Kevin Rudd in 2008 cut funding to the ABS along with other government agencies as part of its \u201cefficiency dividends\u201d. As a result the ABS cut the job vacancy survey.</p> <p>It meant they cut the survey in August 2008 just as the global financial crisis was about to hit, and thus at the precise moment the figures would have been most useful, given job vacancies are a leading indicator of employment:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Monthly job vacancies\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/qBkyt/1/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>Other funding cuts meant the ABS had to find savings elsewhere. </p> <p>One saving was in the labour force figures. In 2013 it reduced the sample size of the survey, which meant that whereas from February 1978 to <a href=\"http://www.abs.gov.au/AUSSTATS/abs@.nsf/allprimarymainfeatures/2CB5DE7E65604164CA257BC00013E7DB?opendocument\">June 2013</a> the unemployment rate had a 95% confidence interval of plus or minus 0.2 percentage points, since <a href=\"http://www.abs.gov.au/AUSSTATS/abs@.nsf/allprimarymainfeatures/8BF7E9F356270F54CA257BE3001DDD2F?opendocument\">July 2013</a> it has been plus or minus 0.4 percentage points:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Unemployment rate with 95% confidence intervals\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/lkW5h/1/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>Soon after the change a number of pretty bizarre employment figures began to get released \u2013 something I noted <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/grogonomics/2014/mar/17/labour-reports-taken-pinch-salt\">in March 2014</a>.</p> <p>The funding cuts continued under the Abbott government. In June 2014, <a href=\"http://www.abs.gov.au/ausstats/abs@.nsf/products/745695D9AEBEFE64CA257CEE0004715C?OpenDocument\">the ABS announced</a> it would cut a number of surveys in order to reduce its spending by $50m over three years.</p> <p>The funding cuts were bad enough, but the ABS was also becoming rather cavalier as well \u2013 never a good thing given data is meant to be dull and sensible (and trustworthy).</p> <p>In the middle of 2014, the ABS, presumably not satisfied with tinkering with the labour force figures enough, began to change the way it collected the data \u2013 shifting to an online survey with a lower response rate, and also slightly changing some of the <a href=\"http://www.abs.gov.au/AUSSTATS/abs@.nsf/Previousproducts/6202.0Main%20Features3Jul%202014?opendocument&amp;tabname=Summary&amp;prodno=6202.0&amp;issue=Jul%202014&amp;num=&amp;view=\">questions being asked</a>.</p> <p>The ABS didn\u2019t first run the old and new systems together to test the changes. The result was a complete shemozzle.</p> <p>In <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/grogonomics/2014/sep/15/abs-employment-figures-for-august-statistical-aberration-or-recovery\">August 2013, the ABS</a> reported that employment in one month grew by 121,000 \u2013 the biggest jump ever recorded:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Monthly employment growth - August 2014\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/LwG2L/1/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>No one believed it, and neither did the ABS. <a href=\"http://www.abs.gov.au/AUSSTATS/abs@.nsf/Previousproducts/6202.0Main%20Features2Sep%202014?opendocument&amp;tabname=Summary&amp;prodno=6202.0&amp;issue=Sep%202014&amp;num=&amp;view=\">The next month</a> it admitted its seasonally adjusted figures from July to September 2014 were complete bollocks and to be ignored.</p> <p>It was a major indictment for an organisation to admit that the most high profile of its surveys was not to be trusted. Perhaps the only survey the ABS does which is more high profile is the census, and this time round we have a similar result.</p> <p>Due to abject failure to consult openly about its proposed changes of the holding of people\u2019s names, and an utter inability to explain the reasons for those changes, a mistrust of the census began to arise.</p> <p>Now mistrust of the census is almost an Australian tradition, but this time round there was little heed of what were legitimate (if, in my view, overstated) concerns. </p> <p>While the ABS itself was shown to be incapable of adequately responding, so too was the government. From December 2014 to September 2015 Kelly O\u2019Dwyer had oversight of the ABS. In her time on the front bench, O\u2019Dwyer has not exactly met expectations. Her abilities, shall we say, seemed much more sparkling when they were not being used while she sat on the backbench, but she did at least secure that extra funding for the ABS. Prior to the election, Alex Hawke had carriage.</p> <p>But after the election, the prime minister also showed a complete disregard of the census.

                "bodyText":"The complete balls-up of the census on Tuesday night should be absolutely no surprise to anyone who has been paying attention to the way the Australian Bureau of Statistics has been run and how it has been treated by the government. It is the story of what happens when governments believe cutting funding has no consequence and that paying fewer people to do the same work is an \u201cefficiency\u201d regardless of quality. I am probably among the top 0.1% users of the ABS website. I spend whole days looking at data, and as one who will mine the census data when it is finally released I had no issue with completing my census form. I wasn\u2019t very much persuaded by those arguing I should boycott the census due to privacy fears, mostly because I found the arguments pretty weak and covered in layers of smugness towards anyone who dared to suggest the concerns were overstated. But the failure of the census site last night unfortunately will only serve to bolster those arguments. It rather easily raises the question: if the ABS can\u2019t even be trusted to properly collect our data, how can we trust them to keep it? The reality is almost no one outside of the ABS was surprised the site crashed. It was utterly foreseeable. And suggestions of a DDoS attack are completely beside the point. When shifting to an online survey of such a size the first item on the risk management list would have been the ability to cope with large numbers, and the second would be the ability to cope with a DDoS attack. Being told that a router overloaded just screams incompetence. The signs were evident long ago that the ABS was struggling. Early last year \u2013 in what was mostly understood to be a desperate attempt to wake up the government \u2013 the ABS floated the idea of moving the census from every five years to every 10 years. The problem had nothing to do with efficacy of a five-yearly census, but was all about funding. After years of \u201cefficiency dividends\u201d the ABS was holding itself together with duct tape and prayers. The census in 2011 cost $440m, so for an agency under severe budget constraint, stopping a half a billion dollar exercise is not just one way to save money, but given the importance of the census, is also a good way to make the issue of ABS funding very public. And it worked \u2013 in the 2015 budget the government included $234.7m in funding over five years to the ABS. But it was too late to help this year\u2019s census and too late to undo what has been a long running and bipartisan approach. The ALP under Kevin Rudd in 2008 cut funding to the ABS along with other government agencies as part of its \u201cefficiency dividends\u201d. As a result the ABS cut the job vacancy survey. It meant they cut the survey in August 2008 just as the global financial crisis was about to hit, and thus at the precise moment the figures would have been most useful, given job vacancies are a leading indicator of employment: Other funding cuts meant the ABS had to find savings elsewhere. One saving was in the labour force figures. In 2013 it reduced the sample size of the survey, which meant that whereas from February 1978 to June 2013 the unemployment rate had a 95% confidence interval of plus or minus 0.2 percentage points, since July 2013 it has been plus or minus 0.4 percentage points: Soon after the change a number of pretty bizarre employment figures began to get released \u2013 something I noted in March 2014. The funding cuts continued under the Abbott government. In June 2014, the ABS announced it would cut a number of surveys in order to reduce its spending by $50m over three years. The funding cuts were bad enough, but the ABS was also becoming rather cavalier as well \u2013 never a good thing given data is meant to be dull and sensible (and trustworthy). In the middle of 2014, the ABS, presumably not satisfied with tinkering with the labour force figures enough, began to change the way it collected the data \u2013 shifting to an online survey with a lower response rate, and also slightly changing some of the questions being asked. The ABS didn\u2019t first run the old and new systems together to test the changes. The result was a complete shemozzle. In August 2013, the ABS reported that employment in one month grew by 121,000 \u2013 the biggest jump ever recorded: No one believed it, and neither did the ABS. The next month it admitted its seasonally adjusted figures from July to September 2014 were complete bollocks and to be ignored. It was a major indictment for an organisation to admit that the most high profile of its surveys was not to be trusted. Perhaps the only survey the ABS does which is more high profile is the census, and this time round we have a similar result. Due to abject failure to consult openly about its proposed changes of the holding of people\u2019s names, and an utter inability to explain the reasons for those changes, a mistrust of the census began to arise. Now mistrust of the census is almost an Australian tradition, but this time round there was little heed of what were legitimate (if, in my view, overstated) concerns. While the ABS itself was shown to be incapable of adequately responding, so too was the government. From December 2014 to September 2015 Kelly O\u2019Dwyer had oversight of the ABS. In her time on the front bench, O\u2019Dwyer has not exactly met expectations. Her abilities, shall we say, seemed much more sparkling when they were not being used while she sat on the backbench, but she did at least secure that extra funding for the ABS. Prior to the election, Alex Hawke had carriage. But after the election, the prime minister also showed a complete disregard of the census. It wasn\u2019t until Wednesday last week that it was clear that Michael McCormack was the minister responsible \u2013 less than a week before the census. And even worse, his attempts to assuage public fears were pathetic. He suggested that worries about the privacy fears about the census were not a big deal given the people worried were also using Facebook. Such a statement indicates that McCormack is woefully out of his depth and totally unqualified to handle this responsibility. His attempts this morning to suggests the DDoS attack was not an attack because the attack didn\u2019t succeed, even though it did, does nothing to allay fears that our government is run by fools. But really when you get down to it, the failure of the census on Tuesday night is not just about poor risk management, poor government oversight, poor administration; rather it is as the ABS\u2019s head, David Kalisch suggested part of a \u201cconfluence of events\u201d. But that confluence of events is not about DDoS attacks and the failure of a router (god help us, really?) but of a generation of thinking that the public sector can be cut every year and somehow continue to fulfil all its functions. It is the culmination of thinking that paying fewer people to do the same work and to put off spending to upgrade IT systems to \u201csave money\u201d is good budgeting. It is part of the belief that a generation of privatising and outsourcing work to the private sector does not have institutional impacts on talent and quality of service in the public sector. The ABS does work that for the most part could not be done with the same level of trust by the private sector. Yes the funding cuts and \u201cefficiency dividends\u201d have helped save some money over the past few years, but the cost to the reputation of the ABS from this bungle is enormous. And the ABS, above all, relies on its reputation. There will no doubt be the desire to call for someone to be sacked due to this failure \u2013 and rightly so. But unless there is a change in how governments treat and regard the public sector, such failures will only continue.",

That will boost Ireland\u2019s public purse, but in the longer term it may damage its reputation as one of the most attractive places for multinational companies such as Facebook and Google to locate their operations.<br></p> <h2>Will Ireland cease to be a tax haven for multinationals?</h2> <p>Ireland has been under pressure to ditch its most aggressive tax deals for multinationals for many years. Pressure comes not just from other European countries, but also from the US, where Ireland has been heavily criticised for helping big businesses hoard profits offshore, beyond the reach of the US tax authorities. The so-called \u201cdouble Irish\u201d tax structure, which has been used by Google, Facebook, Microsoft and Apple, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/14/ireland-abolish-double-irish-tax-scheme-apple\">is being phased out</a>. However, Ireland has made sure it has other replacement tax breaks to keep multinationals from moving elsewhere. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2016/aug/30/reports-to-offer-latest-clues-on-brex--business-live\">EU orders Apple to pay up to \u20ac13bn in Irish taxes - business live</a> </p> </aside>  <h2>Will this make US multinationals bring their cash piles home?</h2> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/apr/14/us-corporations-14-trillion-hidden-tax-havens-oxfam\">The last place American multinationals want to move profits is back home to the US</a>, where the 35% headline tax rate is one of the highest in the world. While many big firms worry that Brussels may try to chase these huge cash reserves, they would prefer to be taxed in Europe than America so are unlikely to repatriate funds.</p> <h2>Can Apple afford to pay back \u20ac13bn?</h2> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/feb/02/apple-cash-mountain-grows\">Yes it can. </a>The technology group \u2013 valued at $570bn on the stock market \u2013 has a cash stockpile of more than $230bn, of which more than 90% is kept outside the US so that it does not attract US tax. Therefore the ruling should not have a material impact on the group\u2019s finances or its considerable research and development spending. </p> <p>The \u20ac13bn represents more than a quarter of its last full year profits, which were $53.4bn and is equal to sales of 20m iPhone6 Plus handsets, at a current UK cost price of \u00a3539.</p> <h2>What does \u20ac13bn mean to Ireland?</h2> <p>It is a huge sum \u2013 more than the \u20ac12.9bn annual government spending on the Irish health service and nearly one-third of Ireland\u2019s total government tax revenue in 2015, which was \u20ac45.6bn.</p> <p>It is also the equivalent of \u20ac2,830 for every one of Ireland\u2019s 4.6 million population.</p> <h2>Could a post-Brexit UK now offer such generous tax deals?</h2> <p>Brussels has no power over corporation tax rates, which member states have always been able to set themselves. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jul/03/george-osborne-looks-at-corporation-tax-cut-to-attract-overseas-investors\">The former chancellor, George Osborne, had pledged to make Britain the most competitive G20 country in terms of corporation tax</a>. That has seen him set a roadmap that, unless it is adjusted by his successor, Philip Hammond, will soon take the UK corporate tax rate down to 17%. Once it is outside the EU, Britain would have even more leeway to offer special deals to multinationals in the hope they would invest in the UK. That said, such moves could leave Britain looking more and more like a tax haven, and could hamper the willingness of other countries to trade openly with the UK.<br></p>",

As such, competition officials in Brussels have found it amounted to unlawful state aid under EU rules. The sweetheart deal allowed Apple to shift up to two-thirds of its global profits through a handful of Irish-registered companies that routinely paid less than 1% tax. Are other companies in the line of fire? Over the past four years the commission has been looking at similar generous tax deals handed out to multinationals, questioning whether they too amount to unlawful state aid. Tax rulings from Luxembourg and the Netherlands \u2013 granted to Fiat and Starbucks respectively \u2013 have already been found unlawful. In both cases the companies are appealing against the commission\u2019s findings. Meanwhile, competition regulators are also investigating a tax deal from Luxembourg awarded to both McDonald\u2019s and Amazon. Will EU taxpayers benefit and will multinationals become more transparent with tax? If the commission\u2019s decision is not overturned on appeal, then Ireland will have to recalculate years of back taxes and send Apple a large bill. That will boost Ireland\u2019s public purse, but in the longer term it may damage its reputation as one of the most attractive places for multinational companies such as Facebook and Google to locate their operations. Will Ireland cease to be a tax haven for multinationals? Ireland has been under pressure to ditch its most aggressive tax deals for multinationals for many years. Pressure comes not just from other European countries, but also from the US, where Ireland has been heavily criticised for helping big businesses hoard profits offshore, beyond the reach of the US tax authorities. The so-called \u201cdouble Irish\u201d tax structure, which has been used by Google, Facebook, Microsoft and Apple, is being phased out. However, Ireland has made sure it has other replacement tax breaks to keep multinationals from moving elsewhere. Will this make US multinationals bring their cash piles home? The last place American multinationals want to move profits is back home to the US, where the 35% headline tax rate is one of the highest in the world. While many big firms worry that Brussels may try to chase these huge cash reserves, they would prefer to be taxed in Europe than America so are unlikely to repatriate funds. Can Apple afford to pay back \u20ac13bn? Yes it can. The technology group \u2013 valued at $570bn on the stock market \u2013 has a cash stockpile of more than $230bn, of which more than 90% is kept outside the US so that it does not attract US tax. Therefore the ruling should not have a material impact on the group\u2019s finances or its considerable research and development spending. The \u20ac13bn represents more than a quarter of its last full year profits, which were $53.4bn and is equal to sales of 20m iPhone6 Plus handsets, at a current UK cost price of \u00a3539. What does \u20ac13bn mean to Ireland? It is a huge sum \u2013 more than the \u20ac12.9bn annual government spending on the Irish health service and nearly one-third of Ireland\u2019s total government tax revenue in 2015, which was \u20ac45.6bn. It is also the equivalent of \u20ac2,830 for every one of Ireland\u2019s 4.6 million population. Could a post-Brexit UK now offer such generous tax deals? Brussels has no power over corporation tax rates, which member states have always been able to set themselves. The former chancellor, George Osborne, had pledged to make Britain the most competitive G20 country in terms of corporation tax. That has seen him set a roadmap that, unless it is adjusted by his successor, Philip Hammond, will soon take the UK corporate tax rate down to 17%. Once it is outside the EU, Britain would have even more leeway to offer special deals to multinationals in the hope they would invest in the UK. That said, such moves could leave Britain looking more and more like a tax haven, and could hamper the willingness of other countries to trade openly with the UK.",
