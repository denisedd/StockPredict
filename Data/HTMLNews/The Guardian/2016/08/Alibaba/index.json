                "bodyText":"After a rollercoaster day - exaggerated by thin trading during the summer lull - European markets showed some substantial gains. It was an opening surge on Wall Street to a new record, following better than expected results from the likes of department store group Macy\u2019s as well as a 3% jump in the oil price, that helped pull European shares sharply higher. The FTSE 100, in negative territory for much of the day, managed to end the day at a new 14 months high. Tony Cross, market analyst at Trustnet Direct, said: The FTSE-100 has certainly been in for a volatile session...and once we take into account the toll stocks moving ex-dividend have exacted on the index, we\u2019re looking at a rather upbeat performance. That said, we\u2019re in the midst of the summer lull so thinner volumes will lend themselves to exaggerated market moves, but with more positive noises being made over oil prices stabilising, Wall Street has opened in an upbeat mood too \u2013 if these tailwinds continue, then it seems that soon enough the FTSE-100 will once again be starting with a \u201c7\u201d. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished up 48.29 points or 0.7% at 6914.71, its best level since 3 June 2015 Germany\u2019s Dax added 0.86% to 10,742.84 France\u2019s Cac closed up 1.17% at 4503.95 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB rose 1.06% to 16,969.69 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended up 0.7% at 8719.5 In Greece, the Athens market added 0.89% to 572.33 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 129 points or 0.7%. Oil continues to rise, with Brent crude climbing 5% at one point. It is now up 4.5% at $46.05 a barrel. As for the pound, it is now down 0.36% at $1.2961 and 0.21% lower at \u20ac1.1614. On that note, it\u2019s time to close for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. Oil continues to rise, in turn supporting global stock markets. As well as the International Energy Agency saying markets would rebalance, crude has also been boosted by comments from the Saudi oil minister about possible action to stabilise prices. Khalid al-Falih said OPEC members and non-members would discuss the market situation and any action needed at their meeting at the end of September in Algeria. Traders had been sceptical about the prospects of the OPEC meeting taking any action to stem production, especially since Saudi Arabia reported record output in July. But these new comments have helped send Brent crude up 3.4% to $45.57, while West Texas Intermediate is 3.5% higher at $43.21. So on Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has been testing new highs, and is currently up 131 points or 0.7%. The pound continues to weaken. It is now at around \u20ac1.1600 against the euro, down 0.33% and at its lowest level since 6 July. In the wake of the Brexit vote it hit a post referendum low of \u20ac1.1575 on that date, according to Caxton FX analyst Alexandra Russell-Olive. Against the dollar, sterling is down 0.35% at $1.2965. US markets are in buoyant mood after the oil price steadies, US weekly jobs claims fell again and a number of companies including department store group Macy\u2019s and US listed Chinese internet group Alibaba issued positive updates. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 49 points or 0.26%, while the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq are also moving higher. Oil prices have edged higher after the International Energy Agency said crude markets would rebalance in the coming months. In its latest monthly report, it predicted oil stocks would reduce in the third quarter for the first time in more than two years. It said: Oil\u2019s drop...has put the \u2018glut\u2019 back into the headlines even though our balances show essentially no oversupply during the second half of the year. Brent crude is currently up 0.6% at $44.32 a barrel, having earlier fallen as low as $43.46. The US benchmark, West Texas Intermediate, is up 0.5% at $41.93 a barrel after hitting $41.1. Former deputy governor of the Bank of England, Sir Charles Bean, has been nominated by UK chancellor Philip Hammond to the Budget Responsibility Committee of the Office for Budget Responsibility. The vacancy at the independent OBR, which scrutinises the government\u2019s finances, comes because Sir Stephen Nickell is due to step down in December. Sir Charles said: I am delighted that the Chancellor has nominated me for appointment to the OBR\u2019s Budget Responsibility Committee. Sir Stephen Nickell and the rest of the BRC have done excellent work in establishing the credibility and reputation of the OBR, and I will be honoured to take up the post should the Treasury Committee wish me to do so. Earlier it was announced that the Office for National Statistics had begun recruiting its first data analytics apprentices, following a critical review into the quality of economic data by Sir Charles. Over to Russia, and a preliminary report from the Federal Statistics Service showed a 0.6% fall in GDP in the second quarter. But this is an improvement on recent quarters: Back with Brexit, and another suggestion that the UK economy is suffering after the vote to leave the European Union. A Reuters poll of nearly 60 economists indicated they expected the economy to contract by 0.1% in the third and fourth quarters. Ahead of the vote, they had expected similar growth to the 0.6% recorded in the second quarter. Most of those surveyed also thought the Bank of England would reduce interest rates again in November to just 0.1% after this month\u2019s reduction in borrowing costs. Two thirds of those who answered a question on fiscal measures expected the government to come up with some sort of fiscal stimulus in the Autumn statement. Back to Mongolia! The FT points out that the country\u2019s currency, the t\u00f6gr\u00f6g*, has hit a new record low today, thanks to those worries over its economy. * - bonus mark to anyone who knew that 1 t\u00f6gr\u00f6g = 100 m\u00f6ng\u00f6s If job creation was an Olympic sport, then the USA would be taking home yet another medal. The weekly job figures, just released, show that the number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefit fell by 1,000 last week, to 266,000. That suggests that the US labour market is in robust health, with employers still creating new jobs. This is the 75th week running in which the initial claims figure has been below 300,000, the traditional threshold for a strong labour market. Bloomberg\u2019s Joe Weisenthal has more details: Today is so quiet that we\u2019d happily trek to Outer Mongolia for a decent bit of news..... ...and, bang on cue, Mongolian bonds are suffering a serious rout, after the government warned it faces an economic crisis. Reuters has the details: Bonds maturing in 2021 and 2022 fell 4.6 cents and 5 cents respectively, to their lowest since end-June . The 2018 bond fell 1.8 cents to 2-1/2-month lows. The selloff was sparked by the new finance Minister Battogtokh Choijilsuren, who warned earlier this week that the government may struggle to pay public sector wages. The Mongolian People\u2019s Party won a sweeping victory last month. But the honeymoon didn\u2019t last long, with Choijilsuren warning that: \u201cThe economic situation is difficult but our government is optimistic that we can develop a comprehensive plan to get out of this crisis.\u201d Choijilsuren also spoke about \u201ca deep state of economic crisis\u201d, leading investors to worry about Mongolia\u2019s ability to avoid a default. Mongolia is rich in minerals, and commodities such as coal and copper, but has been hit by falling demand from emerging economies such as China. It\u2019s shaking up to be a calm day on Wall Street, where traders expect the main share indices to open slightly higher in 80 minutes time. Sofa maker DFS isn\u2019t worried about Brexit, though. The company has hiked its profit forecast this morning, and hopes to get a sales boost out of sponsoring the Olympics (a curious tie-up, until you remember where most of us watch the action). CEO Ian Filby has told us that he expects the consumer market to remain quite resilient, despite the EU referendum uncertainty. A new survey has shown that consumer confidence has dipped in August to a two-year low. The Thomson Reuters/Ipsos Primary Consumer Sentiment Index (PCSI) eased to 49.2 from 49.4 in July. That level was last seen in early 2014. The survey found that Brits are more concerned about losing their jobs, but actually less pessimistic about the wider economy. Rating agency Moody\u2019s has joined the chorus of concern over Britain\u2019s property sector. In a new report, it predicts that the buy-to-let sector will be particularly badly hit by the Brexit vote. Recent changes to stamp duty rules, which hit second home owners, will also hurt BTL prices. Kamran Sabir, a Moody\u2019s vice president, says: \u201cWith reduced demand for credit and downward pressure on house prices, economic uncertainty will likely reverse previously positive market conditions for the UK mortgage market.\u201d The weakening pound is going to hit British holidaymakers in the pocket. Holiday group TUI has warned that sterling\u2019s recent tumble will inevitably make package tours more expensive: It\u2019s one of those days... Capital Economics predict that UK house price inflation will fall to 2% by the end of this year. They do see some glimmers of light in today\u2019s report by Britain\u2019s surveyors: This morning\u2019s RICS survey reported that the new buyer enquiries balance improved a little, from minus 36% in June to minus 27% in July. (See Chart.) And the new sales instructions balance rose from minus 45% to minus 33%. But the big picture is that the market is softening. After all, most of the readings from June were deep in negative territory and multi-year lows. So despite the modest improvements seen this month, the survey still points to fewer new buyers and sellers in July than in June. And, with the newly agreed sales balance at minus 34% and the past prices balance at 5%, the data are consistent with falling sales and low, single-digit house price growth. Swiss bank USB reckons that the pound will fall to $1.25 in the next three months, as the Bank of England launches more stimulus measures: UBS strategists Constantin Bolz and Thomas Flury say: \u201cIn our view, it is very likely that further monetary easing will be delivered in the coming months, which would weaken sterling.\u201d Ouch. Sterling has fallen to its lowest level against the US dollar since July 7. The pound has shed more than half a cent to $1.295, as traders react to the slowdown in UK housing market. Sterling is also suffering from the Bank of England\u2019s new QE programme. That\u2019s because the BoE will sending a lot of pounds overseas, to buy UK government debt from foreign investors. Kit Juckes, currency expert at French bank Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale, explains: The foreign exchange conclusion of the BOE buying bonds off foreigners is very simple and sterling-negative. Throw in a soft RICS housing survey released overnight and the pound\u2019s woes don\u2019t get any less. More property gloom, via the FT.... Derwent London, the UK property landlord, has become the latest real estate group to caution that Britain\u2019s vote to leave Europe is likely to lower demand for office space in London and it has cut its expectations for growth in rental income for this year. The group, which has assets in London locations such as Clerkenwell and Fitzrovia, is braced for a slowdown in momentum in the second half of the year and has reduced its estimate of rental growth for the whole of 2016 to 1-5 per cent from a previous forecast of 5-8 per cent. Ana Thaker, market economist at PhillipCapital UK, predicts the UK housing market will suffer from the Brexit vote for some time: RICS housing prices showed that prices dipped by a drop to +5 for the month of July indicating one of the most significant drops since the middle of 2013. This trend looks set to continue as the UK struggles with the fallout and the housing market is likely to be a crucial gauge of consumer sentiment following its rapid rise over the last two years. A weaker currency is likely to fuel demand from abroad but the domestic market looks set to suffer which will permeate other crucial areas of the economy. The government should look to act swiftly to stem any unrest in these sectors so as not to cause panic amongst consumers. The former head of London estate agent Greene &amp; Co reckons buyers should be cautious: Some more context: Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 index had tumbled by 50 points, or almost 1%, in early trading. And housebuilding companies are leading the selloff, following the news that house price growth has hit a three-year low. Berkeley Group has fallen by 5.4%, Taylor Wimpey are down 2.1% and Barratt Development has lost 1.9%. Travis Perkins, which supplies building products, are down 2.5%. Today\u2019s report from RICS contains several charts, showing how the UK housing market slowed sharply in July. These two illustrates how house price growth slowed in July, and the number of people enquiring about properties. The slowdown is worst in the East and West midlands: And this chart shows how RICS\u2019s survey is often a good leading indicator of where the housing market is headed: Britain\u2019s house prices rose at the slowest rate in three years in July, in the latest sign that the EU referendum has hurt the economy. The Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors reports this morning that house price growth, and transaction levels, fell sharply last month following the Brexit vote. RICS\u2019s headline price balance fell to +5 in July from +15 in June, its lowest level since April 2013. This means that just 5% more respondents nationally saw a rise rather than fall in prices. RICS says: \u2022 House price growth falters in July and near term expectations remain negative \u2022 Sales and enquiries drop further - although expectations point to a more stable picture in the coming months \u2022 Stock levels at record lows in most parts of the UK as new instructions decline markedly The decline was particularly sharp in London, reflecting concerns that the capital will suffer from the June 23 vote to leave the EU. But.... RICS also reckons that the property sector is only suffering a wobble, rather than a full-blown meltdown. Most surveyors expect prices to be higher in 12 months time, and a majority expect to be handling more sales too. That\u2019s partly because Britain still suffers from an \u201cacute shortage of property for sale\u201d. Simon Rubinsohn, chief economist at Rics, remains optimistic, saying: \u201cThe rebound in the key 12 month indicators in the July survey suggest that confidence remains more resilient than might have been anticipated.\u201d Noble Francis, economics director at the Construction Products Association, flags up that house prices in some London areas are already falling: Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the financial markets, the world economy, the eurozone and business. Today, City investors are fretting about the Bank of England\u2019s new stimulus programme after its new bond-buying spree drove UK borrowing costs to record lows. Some gilts yields turned negative yesterday after the BoE bought up \u00a31.17bn of government bonds. That\u2019s very bad news for pension funds who rely on government debt for their income. As we report this morning: Anticipation that the Bank will keep buying bonds has helped push up their price \u2013 which in turn pushes down on the yield \u2013 and for some three- and four-year bonds the price rose so much that the yield turned negative. Negative yields have happened once before since the 23 June vote, effectively meaning that the government does not have to pay any money to encourage investors to buy its debt. Pensioners face a double-whammy right now, with the BoE also slashing interest rates to just 0.25%. Ros Altmann, the former pensions minister, fears that Mark Carney and colleagues are wilfully ignoring savers, saying: The Bank wants to stimulate the economy by bringing down interest rates, but the Bank is not acknowledging the negative impact these measures are having on pension deficits, and neither is the government. It\u2019s possible that gilt yields could hit fresh record lows today, given that pension funds are reluctant to give up their precious long-dated government debt. Also coming up today.... Holiday firm TUI is updating the City on its financial performance, in the light of the Brexit vote. The oil price is under pressure after the OPEC cartel warned that demand could be weak in 2017. We get another insight into the US economy at 1.30pm BST, when the weekly jobless report is released. Traders are expecting European stock markets to drop a little in early trading: And so far, that\u2019s it. Fingers crossed for more news....",
