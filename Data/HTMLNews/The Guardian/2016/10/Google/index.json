It comes weeks after the Prime Minister\u2019s own talks with Wall Street bankers and is the latest in a series of international visits from UK ministers in an attempt to allay fears over Brexit and drum up support for new trade. Although previously met with scepticism due to the uncertainty surrounding the UK\u2019s exit from the EU, Hammond\u2019s visit will be the first since the likelihood of a \u2018hard\u2019 Brexit by early 2017 was confirmed. </p> <p>The Chancellor is expected to tell Wall Street that the UK is still a financial hub for global business. The challenge he will face will be in reassuring banks that the UK is indeed still a safe-bet investment in a week that has seen the pound plunge to a new three decade low against the dollar on the prospect of \u2018hard\u2019 Brexit and businesses within the City of London warn that it could cost the city \u00a338 billion.

That could be compounded by a drop in physical exports, depending on the trade terms that Britain agrees with the rest of the world.</p> <p>Desmond Lachman, a resident fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, fears that the current account deficit will get even worse, pushing the pound down. He writes:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>There appear to be at least two reasons to believe that market fears about the consequences of a hard Brexit for continued large capital flows to the UK are not misplaced. The first is that, were the UK no longer to have ready access to Europe\u2019s single market for its exports, it would lose its attractiveness as a location for foreign companies\u2019 European investments. This was precisely the point that the Japanese government made at the September G20 meeting in China \u2013 when it publicly warned its UK counterparts of the likelihood that Japanese companies would relocate out of the UK in the event of a hard Brexit.</p> <p>The second reason is that a hard Brexit would almost certainly result in the loss of the \u2018financial passport\u2019 that City of London financial institutions currently enjoy for accessing the European market. A Financial Conduct Authority report in September suggested that as many as 5,500 UK financial firms could be affected by such a loss of passport rights. Major international banks including JP Morgan Chase and Goldman Sachs have warned that, if the City loses its financial passport, they will need to conduct at least part of their European operations from outside the UK.</p> <p>A key point that those in favour of a hard Brexit overlook is that a rapid drying up of foreign capital flows to the UK would have dire consequences for domestic living standards. A further currency dip would raise import costs and increase inflation. Moreover, there is a likelihood that domestic economic policy would need to be tightened \u2013 both to contain inflation and to make room for a large narrowing in the external current account deficit that foreigners would no longer be prepared to finance.

                "bodyText":"With investors cautious ahead of the US non=farm payroll numbers on Friday, markets slipped back once more. Brexit concerns and continuing weakness in the pound added to the nervousness, amid growing anxiety about whether the UK would stay in the single market. Things were not helped by a profit warning from budget airline easyJet. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished down 0.47% or 33.29 points at 6999.96 Germany\u2019s Dax dipped 0.16% to 10,568.80 France\u2019s Cac closed down 0.22% at 4480.10 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB was the exception, up 0.09% at 16,491.62 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended down 0.24% at 8757.4 In Greece, the Athens market slipped 0.20% to 574.22 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 19 points or 0.1%. Meanwhile the pound is down 0.85% at $1.2640 - off its worst level of $1.2623 - and 0.42% lower against the euro at \u20ac1.1324. On that note it\u2019s time to close for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. At the IMF and World Bank meeting, there has been a strong defence of globalisation. Larry Elliott reports: The leaders of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank have launched a strong defence of open markets and free trade, as concern grows that the Brexit vote and calls for protectionism in the US presidential election represent a backlash against globalisation. Christine Lagarde, the IMF\u2019s managing director, said international trade had been a force for good in the past few decades but that without a more equal division of the benefits of growth there was a risk of barriers going back up. As part of a concerted push back against protectionism, the World Bank\u2019s president, Jim Yong Kim, said China had lifted 700 million people out of poverty as a result of trade and opening its economy to competition. Kim said the UK\u2019s vote to leave the European Union, the US presidential race and looming elections in Europe were adding to uncertainty. \u201cThese are all risks. Uncertainty is normally very bad for most developing countries.\u201d Outlining her global policy agenda, Lagarde said: \u201cPolicymakers should act and use a balanced mix of all policy levers to revive demand and raise productivity, and ensure the gains from technology and globalisation \u2013 which have led to unprecedented global welfare gains in recent decades \u2013 are shared more broadly. \u201cA retreat from globalisation and multilateralism is a serious risk at a time when international cooperation and coordination are as critical as ever.\u201d The full story is here: Following UK prime minister Theresa May criticising the Bank of England\u2019s quantitative easing programme and chancellor Philip Hammond\u2019s subsequent comments backing Mark Carney to stay on at the Bank of England, the governor is defending himself in Washington. He said he agreed with the spirit of May\u2019s comments on QE and admitted monetary policy had \u201cdistributional consequences\u201d but said it was not the job of the central bank to offset those. And he said May\u2019s comments were absolutely not an attack on the Bank\u2019s independence. As a reminder, this is what May said: Because while monetary policy \u2013 with super-low interest rates and quantitative easing \u2013 provided the necessary emergency medicine after the financial crash, we have to acknowledge there have been some bad side effects. People with assets have got richer. People without them have suffered. People with mortgages have found their debts cheaper. People with savings have found themselves poorer. A change has got to come. And we are going to deliver it. Just days after all the excitement about the UK\u2019s leading index soaring through the 7000 barrier and heading towards a new high, it has sagged back below that level with a bit of a whimper. It has closed down 33.29 points at 6999.96 as the uncertainty over Britain\u2019s exit from the European Union continued, with the trade off between migration controls and remaining in the single market still unresolved. Fears of a hard Brexit continued despite chancellor Philip Hammond maintaining the government would seek the right Brexit for both the UK and EU. Better than expected US weekly jobless claims - coming ahead of Friday\u2019s non-farm payroll numbers - have renewed talk that the Federal Reserve would have leeway to raise interest rates, and thus helped push the dollar higher. That of course means the pound continues to be pressured, as if there were not enough negative noises around the UK currency. Jasper Lawler, market analyst at CMC Markets, said: There were three G\u2019s selling off in markets; the Great British pound, gilts and gold. An apparent shift in UK politics under the wing of Teresa May towards an interventionist and anti-business agenda was not received well in markets. The pound slid again in what has become a relentless barrage of selling, UK government bonds were sold and the FTSE 100 underperformed its European peers. Comments from the German chancellor have also been taken as another sell signal for the pound. Connor Campbell at Spreadex said: It seems that we are firmly back in Brexit-dominating territory \u2013 even the mildest squawkings from the news-wire are causing pain for the pound. Today it was the turn of Angela Merkel to make sterling\u2019s life even more difficult, the German leader resolute in her claim that freedom of movement is a must if Britain wants to stand any chance of remaining in the single market. This, alongside seemingly the very idea that Chancellor Phillip Hammond has had to make a trip to Wall Street to reassure US banks about London\u2019s position as a financial hub post-Brexit, has led the pound to its latest 31 year nadir against the dollar and a 5 year low against the euro. At the moment the pound is down 0.8% at $1.2646 and 0.47% lower against the euro at \u20ac1.1319. Philip Hammond has also been on CNBC, reports Reuters: Any future decision on whether the British government should approve another round of quantitative easing to spur the economy will be taken \u201ccarefully and cautiously,\u201d finance minister Philip Hammond said on Thursday. \u201cI approved a round of quantitative easing back at the beginning of August as a response to the shock that the economy had felt, but we are conscious of the impacts that QE has and we will use it carefully and cautiously,\u201d Hammond, who is currently in New York, said in a television interview with CNBC. On Wednesday British Prime Minister Theresa May said low interest rates and quantitative easing have bad side-effects. And Reuters: British finance minister Philip Hammond said on Thursday that he would focus on increasing the country\u2019s economic output by improving productivity, but that overall growth could slow as Britain barred most low-skilled European Union migrants. \u201cWhat we need to drive is a growth in GDP per capita. We need to see our economic expansion coming from an improvement in productivity, not simply from bringing ever larger numbers of low skilled people into the economy,\u201d Hammond said in an interview with Bloomberg TV in New York. Economic data earlier on Thursday showed British productivity continued to lag other countries after several years in which growth has been driven by a growing workforce, which includes higher numbers of EU migrants. Hammond also said Britain\u2019s government was looking at the costs and benefits of remaining in a customs union with the EU, as being outside would have \u201cfrictional costs\u201d for manufacturers such as carmakers. Here\u2019s Bloomberg\u2019s take on their interview with chancellor Philip Hammond: The U.K. will use Brexit to build on historic trading relationships outside of the EU, Chancellor of the Exchequer Philip Hammond told Bloomberg TV in New York. \u201cWe want to get the right Brexit for Britain,\u201d Hammond told Bloomberg Editor-in-Chief John Micklethwait. He described the U.K. as \u201cmid-Atlantic in the way it does business,\u201d and said capitalism faced problems across the developed world. \u201cWe have a problem, not just a British problem but a developed world problem, in keeping our populations engaged and supportive of our market capitalism economic model,\u201d Hammond said. Hammond, who is on a visit to U.S. to meet Wall Street bosses and attend meetings of the International Monetary Fund, said he would make protecting London\u2019s financial sector a priority for him. \u201cIt will be one of the U.K. government\u2019s objectives to ensure that parts of the financial services sectors that are Europe-facing are able to continue doing business in Europe.\u201d Philip Hammond may not want to disclose whether he thinks the value of sterling is too high or too low, but he might be pleased to know it has come off its lows of the day. The pound is currently at $1.2646, down 0.8% on the day but above the new 31 year low of $1.2623 it reached earlier. Question: Should Mark Carney (one of Britain\u2019s best known foreign workers) stay on longer as Bank of England governor? I think the governor is doing a good job. The bank is fulfilling its remit very effectively. It helped us recover from the financial crisis and helped us smooth the shock that came on 23rd June. It is Mark Carney\u2019s decision...I would welcome his decision to stay if that\u2019s the decision he makes. And there the interview ends. Question: isn\u2019t UK economy doing ok? Media is focussing on backward data. UK economy was stronger than we thought.. but the concensus of forecasters is suggesting growth will slow as we go through period of negotiation until we have certainty over our position with EU. Business investment is the key focus. Business postpones decisions if climate is uncertain. We want to bring back certainty as soon as we can. Question: Investment outside London? We have a productivity problem in UK, and one of drivers is regional disparity. We are hugely underinvested in transport links [in northern region]. We will continue to support Northern powerhouse and other regions. On infrastructure, lot is done by private sector. In public sector, we have an opportunity to borrow cheaply and we have further capacity for targeted investments in productive infrastructure. But with our debt to GDP ratio we cannot have unrestrained programme of public spending. After shock of Brexit decision there will be a period of uncertainty, we have to support the economy through that. Question: Sterling gone down since Brexit. Does UK economy work at this level? We don\u2019t target exchange rate level. Market makes its judgement, and that can change quickly. The market determines the appropriate level and we are committed to free floating exchange rate system. Question: Theresa May seemed more critical of business than previous PMs. Is government anti-business? Absolutely not. We are pro-business. But we [Western economies} have a problem in keeping populations supportive of capital market model. People feel economy is not working for them, they are losers. We have to re-engage those people who feel they do not have a stake any more. We have to address signs of a sizeable amount of people becoming disenchanted. We have to deal with rogue operators. We have examples in UK of companies abusing market power, abusing workers. We have to deal with that. PM said there is a limit to the power of government but doesn\u2019t mean they have no power at all. They have to make sure markets work properly. Sending out strong message that best way to make people free and prosperous is to have a free liberal economy. Question: is there any economic advantage to Brexit? In the long term yes and outside the EU we will build on historic trading links. Our economy is more mid-Atlantic than Europe. One reaction so far: Question: EU will say you either get migration controls or single market. From conference it appears migration is more important. Hammond: I don\u2019t agree. There will be discussions and there will have to be give and take on both sides... if there is a solution that is advantageous to both sides. We don\u2019t delude ourselves our European partners owe us any favours. They still want access to UK market. It has to be a win-win solution. But we have to realise the Brexit vote said implicitly that we should not have freedom of movement in way we had in the past. That is about control, not saying people from Europe cannot come into the UK. This is a negotiation, we both have our starting positions and will discuss it. We have an economy heavily integrated with the EU after forty years. One of things we have to do is analyse benefits and costs of being in a customs union. Question: could we not have a longer transition period that 2 years? No doubt the process of negotiation is something we will begin to discuss. The arrangements for UK\u2019s exit, and arrangements for future relations. No one thought Article 50 would be used, it does not answer a lot of the questions. On passporting, allowing banks etc to trade across Europe: There are different options, passporting, equivalents. It will be one of our objectives that financial services companies doing business in Europe can continue to do so. On the number of foreign workers being limited: The problem is not highly skilled workers, banks, surgeons.. coming to the UK. The issue is people with low skills competing for entry level jobs. Our economy is growing but GDP per capita is not. Have to drive that. We will need some low skilled people but our demographics are different to elsewhere in Europe. We have population still growing before immigration. Hammond\u2019s interview is live, and begins with Brexit and the worries of financial firms about what it will mean for them. He says we don\u2019t recognise a distinction between hard and soft Brexit. It has to be the right Brexit for UK and EU. On financial services, he says it is an important part of the UK economy. We\u2019ll place high priority on right solution. There are some specific needs and issues we have to understand. On euro clearing, he said ECB tried before to force clearing to take place within EU, and the court said it had no power to make such a rule. When Britain leaves EU, there will be countries not in euro but in EU requiring protection of single market. So not clear ECB could require euro clearing to be moved. And after Theresa May\u2019s comments seen as critical of the Bank of England, Hammond seems more positive on governor Mark Carney: Philip Hammond\u2019s interview should be available to watch here shortly. And on the state of the UK economy following the Brexit vote: And following the UK productivity figures earlier: Interviewer John Micklethwait tackles Theresa May\u2019s criticism of business in her Conservative party conference speech on Wednesday: So Hammond is reinforcing the comments made by Theresa May over the weekend, which suggested immigration controls would take priority over remaining in the single market. (Those comments of course started this week\u2019s slide in the pound.) Earlier German chancellor Angela Merkel said that Europe\u2019s four freedoms of movement \u2013 for labour, capital, services and goods \u2013 could not be split up. If Europe didn\u2019t stick to the position that full access to the internal market is conditioned on freedom of movement, Merkel said, each member state would start doing what it wanted. UK chancellor Philip Hammond is speaking at Bloomberg and journalist Heidi Moore is tweeting the highlights: And on whether euro-clearing activities would move out of the City of London after Brexit, he said: IMF managing director Christine Lagarde has been giving her press conference ahead of the fund\u2019s meeting in Washington. And in the wake of UK prime minister Theresa May calling for the benefits of globalisation to be shared by all, Lagarde said: The value of British government debt is falling today, matching sterling\u2019s selloff. This has pushed up the interest rate, or yield, on 10-year gilts to 0.89%, from 0.82% yesterday. That implies it would cost the government more to issue new debt. America\u2019s labour market continues to improve. Just 249,000 US citizens filed new claims for unemployment benefit last week, down from 255,000. That\u2019s the lowest since April, and means the \u2018four-week moving average\u2019 of new claims has hit its lowest level in over 40 years;. And that\u2019s likely to help the US dollar strengthen, and mean more pain for the pound. Over in Germany: Deutsche Bank has announced plans to cut 1,000 jobs in its domestic market, as part of a restructuring plan. This takes the total of jobs being cut to 9,000, including 4,000 in Germany itself. The restructuring is meant to cut Deutsche\u2019s costs, and help it build up its capital reserves. There\u2019s still no word on the ongoing negotiations with the US authorities over a fine for mis-selling toxic mortgage-backed securities before the 2008 crisis. Over in New York, traders are expecting Twitter\u2019s shares to tumble when trading begins in one hour\u2019s time. Twitter\u2019s shares are down 17% in pre-market trading, after the Recode website reported that Google is unlikely to bid for the social media platform. The pound\u2019s still falling... down a whole cent today at $1.2640. Naeem Aslam, chief market analyst at Think Markets UK, reckons sterling is being hit hard by speculators who are determined to drive it lower. He says further losses are a real possibility: Bears are out for blood and they want to squeeze every single drop out of this trade. Although this is the most crowded trade on the street today, but it is not preventing them to keep piling up their bets. My biggest worry is that short squeeze can happen soon as we are approaching towards an important level of support which is at $1.25. However, if the selling pressure remains this aggressive, we could easily break this support and we could be looking at the level of $1.22. A wave of selling has just swept the pound down to a fresh 31-year low against the US dollar, just $1.2664. That\u2019s the weakest level since June 1985, and means sterling has lost more than three cents since Theresa May pledged to trigger article 50 by March 2017. Here\u2019s some chart action from the Financial Times\u2019s Katie Martin: Mohamed El-Erian, chief economic adviser to German investment giant Allianz, says Philip Hammond faces a very tricky mission today. Speaking on Bloomberg TV, El-Erian says Hammond will have to justify Theresa May\u2019s conference speech yesterday: I would hate to be the chancellor right now. He has a hard job explaining what his prime minister just said. Hammond has three tasks, El-Erian adds: He has to explain the notion of hard Brexit, explain PM\u2019s comments about the rootless international elite and the harm they create, and explain the criticism of the Bank of England. Wall Street may find some of this surprising, El-Erian adds, given that (in his view) the UK has benefitted a lot from globalisation, and the government has benefitted from the Bank of England\u2019s stimulus programme. Without low interest rates and QE, May would be facing an economic mess, he concludes. Sterling is coming under more pressure, falling by 0.6 of a cent to $1.2690, close to yesterday\u2019s 31-year low. Paresh Davdra, chief executive of foreign exchange firm RationalFX, says chancellor Hammond may get a sceptical reception from Wall Street bankers today: Philip Hammond\u2019s visit to Wall Street later today will see the Chancellor try to convince the US\u2019s biggest banks that Britain is open for business. It comes weeks after the Prime Minister\u2019s own talks with Wall Street bankers and is the latest in a series of international visits from UK ministers in an attempt to allay fears over Brexit and drum up support for new trade. Although previously met with scepticism due to the uncertainty surrounding the UK\u2019s exit from the EU, Hammond\u2019s visit will be the first since the likelihood of a \u2018hard\u2019 Brexit by early 2017 was confirmed. The Chancellor is expected to tell Wall Street that the UK is still a financial hub for global business. The challenge he will face will be in reassuring banks that the UK is indeed still a safe-bet investment in a week that has seen the pound plunge to a new three decade low against the dollar on the prospect of \u2018hard\u2019 Brexit and businesses within the City of London warn that it could cost the city \u00a338 billion. Whilst a timetable for Brexit makes Hammond\u2019s job easier in some respects, it remains to be seen if Wall Street can be convinced by him.\u201d The pound has dropped by 0.25% today but is still clinging onto the $1.27 level. That\u2019s above yesterday\u2019s 31-year low, despite worries about a hard Brexit. Theresa May\u2019s broadside at ultra-low interest rates appears to be propping up sterling. Over in Greece, the unemployment rate has dropped to a four-year low, but remains far too high. The Greek jobless rate dipped to 23.2% in July from 23.4% in June \u2013 the lowest since March 2012, but more than double the eurozone average after years of austerity. The pound continues to bob around the $1.273 mark, as traders wait for news of Philip Hammond\u2019s meetings in New York. That\u2019s about half a cent above the 31-year low struck on Wednesday. Angela Merkel\u2019s comments about freedom of movement being intrinsic to the EU haven\u2019t eased concerns about a \u2018hard Brexit\u2019. And Theresa May\u2019s attacks on the wealthy \u2018global elite\u2019 have also left City investors feeling vulnerable. Chris Turner, the head of currency strategy at ING, explains: May has pushed her party way across the centre ground \u2013 taking issue with self-serving individuals and businesses and appealing to the non-metropolitan voter. That does not bode well for financial services in Brexit discussions. (Thanks to Reuters for the quote) Newsflash from Berlin: the German chancellor Angela Merkel is telling industry leaders that Brexit is a \u201cwatershed moment\u201d for the EU. Merkel also says negotiations won\u2019t be easy and will determine what access each side has to the other\u2019s market. Talks cannot start until Britain triggers article 50, she says. The chancellor also warns that Europe\u2019s four freedoms of movement \u2013 for labour, capital, services and goods \u2013 can\u2019t be split up. If Europe doesn\u2019t stick to the position that full access to the internal market is conditioned on freedom of movement, Merkel says, each member state will start doing what it wants. Earlier today, Germany reported that factory orders jumped by 1%, thanks to a surge of domestic orders. This suggests that Europe\u2019s largest economy isn\u2019t being dragged back by Brexit fears (yet, anyway). City traders are speculating about how long Mark Carney will remain as Bank of England governor, after Theresa May attacked the Bank\u2019s loose monetary policy stance yesterday. Carney is expected to decide by the end of 2016 whether to do five years at the Bank (the original plan), or sign up for an extra three years. He arrived in July 2013. May\u2019s criticism could, perhaps, encourage Carney to exit gracefully in 2018 after all. Or he might decide that London remains the place to be, as the Brexit story plays out. May surprised the City by telling the Conservative party conference that ultra-low interest rates and quantitative easing had disproportionately helped the rich. Charalambos Pissouros, a senior analyst at IronFX Global, told Reuters that this could signal a change of approach to monetary policy: In our view, this suggests that once (BoE chief) MarkCarney\u2019s term is finished at the BoE, he may be replaced by someone more hawkish on policy. One of the prime minister\u2019s advisers has hinted that the government is considering using the fiscal levers of spending and borrowing to generate growth. George Freeman told Newsnight: We have to think about, with money available at nought percent (how to) ... drive an industrial strategy, get infrastructure built. We need to make sure we are looking at all the mechanisms to making sure that money flows properly. Fears that the City will lose its EU \u2018passporting rights\u2019 have undermined the pound since June\u2019s referendum. Britain is already running a sizeable current account deficit of about 6% of GDP, due to the persistent gap between imports and exports. So if London financial companies are locked out of the EU, Britain will suffer a fall in \u2018invisible earnings\u2019. That could be compounded by a drop in physical exports, depending on the trade terms that Britain agrees with the rest of the world. Desmond Lachman, a resident fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, fears that the current account deficit will get even worse, pushing the pound down. He writes: There appear to be at least two reasons to believe that market fears about the consequences of a hard Brexit for continued large capital flows to the UK are not misplaced. The first is that, were the UK no longer to have ready access to Europe\u2019s single market for its exports, it would lose its attractiveness as a location for foreign companies\u2019 European investments. This was precisely the point that the Japanese government made at the September G20 meeting in China \u2013 when it publicly warned its UK counterparts of the likelihood that Japanese companies would relocate out of the UK in the event of a hard Brexit. The second reason is that a hard Brexit would almost certainly result in the loss of the \u2018financial passport\u2019 that City of London financial institutions currently enjoy for accessing the European market. A Financial Conduct Authority report in September suggested that as many as 5,500 UK financial firms could be affected by such a loss of passport rights. Major international banks including JP Morgan Chase and Goldman Sachs have warned that, if the City loses its financial passport, they will need to conduct at least part of their European operations from outside the UK. A key point that those in favour of a hard Brexit overlook is that a rapid drying up of foreign capital flows to the UK would have dire consequences for domestic living standards. A further currency dip would raise import costs and increase inflation. Moreover, there is a likelihood that domestic economic policy would need to be tightened \u2013 both to contain inflation and to make room for a large narrowing in the external current account deficit that foreigners would no longer be prepared to finance. UK households would be forced to reduce their consumption levels painfully, while businesses would be forced to cut back on their investment plans, to the detriment of future UK growth prospects. More here. HSBC has knocked up a handy chart showing some of the possible relationships that Britain could have with the EU (and what it is giving up): Philip Hammond needs to reassure Wall Street that London still wants to be a major financial centre, says the currency expert Kit Juckes of Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale. He\u2019s concerned that the pound hasn\u2019t managed even a small rally this week, even though the latest economic data has been quite encouraging: The FX market, for one, needs a lot of reassurance. Sterling really ought to have managed some sort of short-covering rally in the last day or two, as the market slowly gives up all hope of a further rate cut in 2016. From here, in the absence of new news and with the major (depressing from the currency\u2019s point of view) speeches from the Conservative party conference behind us, the fall in the pound versus the US dollar will probably be slow. But steady ... Politics, eh? Ouch! Shares in easyJet have fallen by 6% in early trading, and the Brexit vote is party to blame. The budget airline has told shareholders that it expects pre-tax profit to fall by about 28% this year, due to the slump in the pound, recent terror attacks and industrial action. My colleague Angela Monaghan has the details: The British airline said currency movements would cost the company \u00a390m in the full year, largely because of the the sharp fall in the value of the pound since the Brexit vote on 23 June. EasyJet reports in pounds, but mosts of its costs are in dollars and euros. It buys fuel in dollars and pays air traffic costs and landing charges on its many European routes in euros. The Wall Street Journal has a grim chart this morning showing how the pound is close to its weakest level (when measured against a basket of currencies): London\u2019s stock market has opened without drama, with the FTSE 100 index gaining 10 points to 7,041. That\u2019s about 63 points below its record closing level. Bank shares are among the risers, after officials from the International Monetary Fund tried to downplay worries about Deutsche Bank\u2019s financial health yesterday. The chancellor, Philip Hammond, is scrambling to New York today in an attempt to reassure America\u2019s biggest banks about Brexit. He is due to meet with Wall Street powerbrokers (the kind of elite savaged by Theresa May yesterday). He will say London plans to keep its position as the world\u2019s leading financial centre once the break from the EU is complete. Hammond will arrive hot from the Tory conference and is expected to say: One of Britain\u2019s great strengths is the ability to offer and aggregate all the services the global financial services industry needs. This has not changed as a result of the EU referendum and I will do everything I can to ensure the City of London retains its position as the world\u2019s leading international financial centre. Whether it\u2019s British employers or US firms who support thousands of highly skilled jobs in the financial sector, we are listening and taking the time to understand the issues thoroughly, in advance of opening negotiations with the EU. We will continue to welcome the best and brightest talent and organisations from around the world, including the US. While the government has not finalised its future approach to our relations with the EU, the government\u2019s position is clear; we want the best deal for trade in UK goods and services, including our world leading financial services industry.\u201d He\u2019ll be meeting with top executives from Citi, BNY Mellon, Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs and others with operations in the City. A report this week warned that a \u2018hard Brexit\u2019 could wipe out 70,000 jobs and cost \u00a310bn in tax receipts. That\u2019s the worst-case scenario, if City firms lose their passporting rights, which let them sell services across the EU. Wall Street executives will want to hear that their concerns are taken seriously, following Theresa May\u2019s attack on \u201ccitizens of the world\u201d yesterday. They could also press Hammond on the idea that UK-based companies should provide a list of any foreigners on their books ... Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Concerns over Britain\u2019s exit from the EU continue to weigh on sterling this morning. The pound has sidled back to the $1.271 mark in early trading, close to the 31-year lows plugged yesterday. Against the euro, sterling is close to a five-year low at \u20ac1.135. This week\u2019s tumbles have already forced Britain to surrender the title of fifth-largest economy (in local currency terms) to France. Yesterday, the prime minister, Theresa May, promised to build a \u201cglobal Britain\u201d after Brexit, telling the British public: \u201cCome with me and we\u2019ll write that brighter future.\u201d But is the UK going to lose its prized membership of the single market, in return for immigration controls? Analysts at PNC Bank explain why this is a worry: May\u2019s position substantially increases the possibility that the UK will give up its right to export financial and other services to EU markets in exchange for control over immigration \u2013 a \u201chard Brexit\u201d. The UK\u2019s exports of services to the EU account for more than 4% of the UK\u2019s GDP, so trade barriers to them would cause a serious negative shock to the British economy. Also coming up today.... Global policymakers are gathered in Washington for the International Monetary Fund\u2019s annual meeting. World investors are pondering whether America\u2019s central bank might raise interest rates in November, following strong service sector data yesterday. They\u2019re also wondering whether the European Central Bank could start to \u201ctaper\u201d its bond-buying programme soon. In the City, budget airline easyJet, defence firm BAE Systems and furniture group DFS are reporting results. On the economic front, Germany has just reported a 1% jump in factory orders (more on that shortly). And at 1.30pm, we get the latest US weekly unemployment figures. That will set the scene for tomorrow\u2019s monthly jobs report. We\u2019ll be tracking all the main events through the day ...",

Investors took fright at the prospect of a hard Brexit and the currency has declined more than 6% against the dollar since then.</p> <p>A flash crash last Thursday, when the pound fell by 6% in 10 minutes, heightened concerns that investors had lost faith in sterling as a major currency. A year ago a pound bought $1.55.<br></p> <p>However, the pound\u2019s decline had the opposite effect on the UK\u2019s leading share index. The FTSE 100 touched a new intra-day record of 7,129.83 during afternoon trading, although it closed nearly 60 points lower after a late bout of selling, below the record closing figure of 7,104 reached last year. The driving force for the UK market\u2019s recent surge has been the <a href=\"https://viewer.gutools.co.uk/business/2016/oct/10/pound-continues-to-fall-against-dollar-and-euro-amid-hard-brexit-fears\">rapid decline in the pound</a>, which has boosted the value of companies that earn much of their revenues in dollars.</p> <p>Michael Saunders, a former investment banker who joined the monetary policy committee in August, said Britain\u2019s large current account deficit was adding to the anxiety about the ability of the nation to pay its way once it quits the European Union.</p> <p><a href=\"https://viewer.gutools.co.uk/business/2016/oct/04/weak-post-brexit-growth-forecast-likely-wrong-bank-michael-saunders\">Saunders said the current account</a>, which measures the balance of trade, cash transfers and investment income with other countries, was already undermining confidence in the UK\u2019s ability to pay its way before the EU referendum.</p> <p>Speaking to MPs on the treasury select committee, Saunders warned it was now a major issue and compounding the already weak sentiment on currency markets towards sterling.</p> <p>Saunders told MPs:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\u201cGiven the scale and persistence of the UK\u2019s current account deficit, I would not be surprised if sterling falls further, but I am fairly agnostic as to whether any further depreciation is likely,\u201d </p> </blockquote> <p>Saunders, who joined the MPC from the US investment bank Citi, where he was chief economist, said investors were weighing up the implications of Britain leaving the EU.<br></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\u201cThe work done by the International Monetary Fund and the OECD suggests that the long-run effects of the UK\u2019s exit from the EU is that growth will be lower. If all we are doing is adjusting to a new equilibrium, that is not a concern.\u201d</p> </blockquote> <p>Only if the pound plummets or triggers falls in other markets would the Bank of England need to consider cutting rates to bolster confidence and growth, he added.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\u201cIf such a scenario were to materialise then, provided inflation expectations and pay growth remain well-contained, I would expect the mpc to largely look through any such direct effects on inflation of sterling weakness, even if they extend for several years.\u201d</p> </blockquote> <p>But the lower pound, which reduces the cost of UK goods and services sold abroad, could boost exports and offset much of the anxiety caused by the Brexit vote.</p> <p>A fall in imports would also help to reduce the current account deficit, he said, adding that the government could take advantage of the current depressed situation to boost growth with extra spending.</p> <p><a href=\"https://viewer.gutools.co.uk/politics/2016/oct/09/theresa-may-rules-out-commons-vote-on-single-market-exit\">Several Tory MPs, including supporters of the Leave campaign, have warned that leaving the single market</a> will harm the economy and have demanded ministers make every effort to negotiate continued access.<br></p> <p>But the hardline taken by Downing Street and an equally robust response from European leaders, who have emphasised the free movement of labour as a pillar of the single market, have heightened concerns in the City that Britain will eventually leave all the EU\u2019s major institutions.</p> <p>Kathleen Brooks, research director at financial betting firm City Index and Forex.com, says traders fear the UK could be dragged back by Brexit uncertainty.</p> <p>She told BBC News that: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\u201cThe weakness in the pound is really a sign that investors don\u2019t have confidence in a post-Brexit UK economic outlook. They think Brexit is going to be very negative for the UK economy, and UK GDP could contract going forward.\u201d</p> </blockquote> <p><em>And that\u2019s all for tonight.

This week we have seen the first evidence from the Prime Minister that Britain is heading for a clean break from the EU \u2013traditionally the least desirable option for the economy \u2013which has been a major factor behind the pound\u2019s slump. </p> <p>As we get closer to Article 50 being invoked, I think we will see the pound continue to fall further. In addition, we face added uncertainty over the US Election -there is a strong chance that if Hilary comes into power the US Dollar could gain a lot of strength on the back of that. In regards to the long-term, I think we could see the pound make a recovery, as we begin to see what a post-Brexit UK looks like. The biggest obstacle for the poundcurrently is the uncertainty and anxiety that surrounds the nature of divorce proceedings from the EU. But once we overcome that, we should begin to see the trend reverse.

Here\u2019s a flavour:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>So let\u2019s have some ugly facts. First of all, the crash in the pound is a reminder of one overriding danger that some of us have been warning about for years: Britain <a href=\"http://www.economist.com/node/21557494\">does not pay its way</a> in the world. It buys far more goods and services from other countries than it sells to them.</p> <p>That deficit is made up entirely by what Mark Carney, governor of the Bank of England, has called \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jan/26/mark-carney-fails-to-rule-out-eight-year-term-at-bank-of-england\">the kindness of strangers</a>\u201d. Which is fine, for as long as those foreign strangers consider London a safe haven for their cash. That shouldn\u2019t be taken for granted now that Britain is about to take a giant political and economic leap into the dark \u2013 and sterling has already plunged further this year than the Argentinian peso. Remember, Whitehall is only beginning to think seriously about the mechanics of leaving the EU: years of this mayhem are still to come.</p> <p>Ah, we\u2019re told: but all this currency weakness is just brilliant for British exporters. It makes their goods so much cheaper to sell abroad. True, but that is to overestimate the bag of bones that is the British manufacturing sector 30 years after the Thatcher revolution.</p> </blockquote> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/oct/11/crash-pound-delusion-brexit-britain-flourish\">The crash in the pound punctures the delusion that Brexit Britain will flourish | Aditya Chakrabortty</a> </p> </aside> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-10-11T16:38:44.324Z\">at 5.38pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-57fd0f1ee4b03b22b4fb2534\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/lisaocarroll\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-11T16:14:18.870Z\">5.14pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Back over in Dublin, the Irish government has unveiled a series of measures designed to protect the economy from a Brexit shock. </strong></p> <p>It aims to protect foreign investment, boost tourism and reduce the exposure of farmers in the wake of the collapse of sterling.</p> <ul> <li>Under the \u201cGetting Ireland Brexit Ready\u201d programme, announced by the finance minister, a \u201crainy day fund\u201d will be built up from surplus budgets for use as a contingency for public services in the event of a shock to the economy after Brexit Day, expected in 2019.<br></li> <li>A special \u20ac150m loan fund to help farmers with cash flow and short term borrowings is to be established amid concern many are struggling to cope with the sharp decline in the value of their exports to the UK,<br></li> <li>A special tax relief programme designed to help foreign investors with the smooth movement of staff from the US and elsewhere is to be extended until the end of 2020. <br></li> <li>This programme will allow employers to relocate state from overseas offices with minimal tax complications.</li> <li>A reduced nine per cent VAT rate is to be retained in the tourist sector to assist the competitiveness of the hospitality sector which is heavily dependent on UK tourists. </li> </ul> <p>The government says:<br></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\u201cThe measure acts to secure and embed investment, which can lead to sustainable growth and strengthens Ireland\u2019s innovative capabilities.\u201d</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>At the same time the government has released a sector by sector analysis of the impact Brexit could have on trade with Britain, the country\u2019s biggest trading partner.</strong> Agri-food and computer services are among the most exposed sectors. </p> <p>The Revenue commissioners have also been asked to scope out how potential customs with the UK and with Northern Ireland would work. </p> <p>Unveiling the package, finance minister Michael Noonan said the Brexit vote posed \u201cimportant challenges for the Irish economy\u201d and it needed to \u201cprotect the progress\u201d made to the economy since the crash of 2010. </p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57fd07ace4b03b22b4fb2506\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-11T15:53:14.161Z\">4.53pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">FTSE 100 falls back from record highs</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Breaking: Britain\u2019s stock market has failed to hit a new closing high, as the City frets about the costs of a hard Brexit.</strong></p> <p>A late afternoon selloff sent the FTSE 100 down by 0.38%, or 26 points, to 7070 points.

                "bodyText":"And finally, here\u2019s my colleague Philip Inman\u2019s summary of today\u2019s drama: The pound endured another day of pressure from investors on Tuesday after continued jitters on the foreign exchange markets pushed it down more than two cents to $1.21. Sterling recorded its worst four-day performance since the Brexit vote as a Bank of England official said he expected the pound to fall further in the coming weeks, driven by the referendum result and the UK\u2019s trade deficit with the rest of the world. The exchange rate with the US dollar stood at $1.30 last week when Theresa May opened the Conservative party conference and appeared to put regaining control of immigration above staying inside the EU\u2019s single market free trade area. Investors took fright at the prospect of a hard Brexit and the currency has declined more than 6% against the dollar since then. A flash crash last Thursday, when the pound fell by 6% in 10 minutes, heightened concerns that investors had lost faith in sterling as a major currency. A year ago a pound bought $1.55. However, the pound\u2019s decline had the opposite effect on the UK\u2019s leading share index. The FTSE 100 touched a new intra-day record of 7,129.83 during afternoon trading, although it closed nearly 60 points lower after a late bout of selling, below the record closing figure of 7,104 reached last year. The driving force for the UK market\u2019s recent surge has been the rapid decline in the pound, which has boosted the value of companies that earn much of their revenues in dollars. Michael Saunders, a former investment banker who joined the monetary policy committee in August, said Britain\u2019s large current account deficit was adding to the anxiety about the ability of the nation to pay its way once it quits the European Union. Saunders said the current account, which measures the balance of trade, cash transfers and investment income with other countries, was already undermining confidence in the UK\u2019s ability to pay its way before the EU referendum. Speaking to MPs on the treasury select committee, Saunders warned it was now a major issue and compounding the already weak sentiment on currency markets towards sterling. Saunders told MPs: \u201cGiven the scale and persistence of the UK\u2019s current account deficit, I would not be surprised if sterling falls further, but I am fairly agnostic as to whether any further depreciation is likely,\u201d Saunders, who joined the MPC from the US investment bank Citi, where he was chief economist, said investors were weighing up the implications of Britain leaving the EU. \u201cThe work done by the International Monetary Fund and the OECD suggests that the long-run effects of the UK\u2019s exit from the EU is that growth will be lower. If all we are doing is adjusting to a new equilibrium, that is not a concern.\u201d Only if the pound plummets or triggers falls in other markets would the Bank of England need to consider cutting rates to bolster confidence and growth, he added. \u201cIf such a scenario were to materialise then, provided inflation expectations and pay growth remain well-contained, I would expect the mpc to largely look through any such direct effects on inflation of sterling weakness, even if they extend for several years.\u201d But the lower pound, which reduces the cost of UK goods and services sold abroad, could boost exports and offset much of the anxiety caused by the Brexit vote. A fall in imports would also help to reduce the current account deficit, he said, adding that the government could take advantage of the current depressed situation to boost growth with extra spending. Several Tory MPs, including supporters of the Leave campaign, have warned that leaving the single market will harm the economy and have demanded ministers make every effort to negotiate continued access. But the hardline taken by Downing Street and an equally robust response from European leaders, who have emphasised the free movement of labour as a pillar of the single market, have heightened concerns in the City that Britain will eventually leave all the EU\u2019s major institutions. Kathleen Brooks, research director at financial betting firm City Index and Forex.com, says traders fear the UK could be dragged back by Brexit uncertainty. She told BBC News that: \u201cThe weakness in the pound is really a sign that investors don\u2019t have confidence in a post-Brexit UK economic outlook. They think Brexit is going to be very negative for the UK economy, and UK GDP could contract going forward.\u201d And that\u2019s all for tonight. Do tune in tomorrow for more coverage of the pound, the financial markets, the global economy and more.... Remember, tonight\u2019s ructions aren\u2019t JUST about Brexit. The dollar has hit an eight-month high against a basket of currencies, on speculation that US interest rates are heading higher soon: Some more thoughts from Duncan Weldon of Resolution Group: The FT\u2019s John Gapper is concerned that parliament doesn\u2019t have its eye on the ball.... This is a positively grim day for the pound, which just stuck its nose below the $1.21 mark as today\u2019s relentless selloff continues. More reaction to the pound\u2019s recent slump. Except, your average emerging market currency has performed an awful lot better than the pound this year. Brazil\u2019s Real, for example, has surged by almost 25%. Sterling is struggling to find a floor tonight \u2013 it just touched $1.2107, a decline of almost 2.5 cents against the US dollar today alone. Kathleen Brooks, Research Director at City Index and Forex.com, says traders fear the UK could be dragged back by Brexit uncertainty. She told BBC News tonight that: The weakness in the pound is really a sign that investors don\u2019t have confidence in a post-Brexit UK economic outlook. They think Brexit is going to be very negative for the UK economy, and UK GDP could contract going forward. If we have many more days like today, then talk of a Sterling Crisis won\u2019t seem far-fetched. So let\u2019s quickly recap, as City traders take a breather. The pound has suffered another day of heavy losses, shedding two cents against the US dollar to $1.214, and one euro cent to \u20ac1.098. The selloff was triggered by fresh worries about the cost of a hard Brexit, after leaked Treasury papers suggested leaving the single market would ultimately cost \u00a366bn in lost tax receipts. That forecast has been criticised by pro-Brexit ministers, who accuse the Treasury of scare-mongering. Labour, though, fear that \u201cjobs, livelihoods and public services\u201d are at risk. Two leading bankers, from Citi and Morgan Stanley, have warned they could start to move jobs out of London in 2017. Rob Rooney, CEO of Morgan Stanley International, was blunt about the consequences fo a hard Brexit: It really isn\u2019t terribly complicated. If we are outside the EU and we don\u2019t have what would be a stable and long-term commitment to access the single market then a lot of the things we do today in London, we\u2019d have to do inside the EU 27. And two Bank of England policymakers have issued warnings about the impact of Brexit. Michael Saunders, of the Monetary Policy Committee, predicted that the pound could fall further. And Anil Kashyap of the Financial Policy Committee warned that Britain could suffer a budgetary black hole if well-paid City jobs move overseas. The weak pound did push shares in London up briefly, to a new all-time high. But then a late selloff sent the FTSE 100 into the red. Analysts say the pound is also being squeezed by the recent strength of the US dollar, which is benefitting from speculation that Hillary Clinton will win next month\u2019s presidential election. Paresh Davdra, CEO of RationalFX, predicts a lot more volatility for sterling... \u201cIn the short term, I think we will see the pound continue to slide. A lot of what has been happening has been in reaction to political events, namely any update on Brexit that comes from the government. This week we have seen the first evidence from the Prime Minister that Britain is heading for a clean break from the EU \u2013traditionally the least desirable option for the economy \u2013which has been a major factor behind the pound\u2019s slump. As we get closer to Article 50 being invoked, I think we will see the pound continue to fall further. In addition, we face added uncertainty over the US Election -there is a strong chance that if Hilary comes into power the US Dollar could gain a lot of strength on the back of that. In regards to the long-term, I think we could see the pound make a recovery, as we begin to see what a post-Brexit UK looks like. The biggest obstacle for the poundcurrently is the uncertainty and anxiety that surrounds the nature of divorce proceedings from the EU. But once we overcome that, we should begin to see the trend reverse. Until then however, it will likely continue to a bumpy ride for the UK\u2019s currency.\u201d The pound is also suffering a late rout against the euro, as Brexit fears thump sterling again. It\u2019s fallen by one euro cent, or around 1%, to \u20ac1.098. Crumbs, make that $1.2153 -- which means the pound has lost two cents against the US dollar today! The pound is ploughing new lows, and is now down 1.75 cents at $1.2177. That\u2019s a new 31-year low, if you exclude the odd flash-crash last Friday... Sterling is now at an eight-year low against a basket of major currencies. And if it weakens much further, we could hit 40-year lows, according to Reuters journalist Jamie McGeever. Today\u2019s selloff means the pound has suffered its worst four-day run since late June, and the aftermath of the EU referendum vote. Back then, sterling was worth around $1.48. It has now shed around 17.5% of its value since. The selloff has intensified since Theresa May declared that she\u2019ll trigger article 50 by the end of March. The pound has dropped by 7 1/2 cents, or nearly 6%, since the start of the Conservative Party conference, from $1.2975 to $1.22-ish. That\u2019s a really sharp decline, as investors have faced up to the prospect of Brexit taking place by spring 2019. May\u2019s promises of immigration controls also pushed the pound down, as traders anticipated a Hard Brexit, which would deprive UK firms of membership of the single market. My colleague Aditya Chakrabortty has written a scorching piece about the sterling slump. Here\u2019s a flavour: So let\u2019s have some ugly facts. First of all, the crash in the pound is a reminder of one overriding danger that some of us have been warning about for years: Britain does not pay its way in the world. It buys far more goods and services from other countries than it sells to them. That deficit is made up entirely by what Mark Carney, governor of the Bank of England, has called \u201cthe kindness of strangers\u201d. Which is fine, for as long as those foreign strangers consider London a safe haven for their cash. That shouldn\u2019t be taken for granted now that Britain is about to take a giant political and economic leap into the dark \u2013 and sterling has already plunged further this year than the Argentinian peso. Remember, Whitehall is only beginning to think seriously about the mechanics of leaving the EU: years of this mayhem are still to come. Ah, we\u2019re told: but all this currency weakness is just brilliant for British exporters. It makes their goods so much cheaper to sell abroad. True, but that is to overestimate the bag of bones that is the British manufacturing sector 30 years after the Thatcher revolution. Back over in Dublin, the Irish government has unveiled a series of measures designed to protect the economy from a Brexit shock. It aims to protect foreign investment, boost tourism and reduce the exposure of farmers in the wake of the collapse of sterling. Under the \u201cGetting Ireland Brexit Ready\u201d programme, announced by the finance minister, a \u201crainy day fund\u201d will be built up from surplus budgets for use as a contingency for public services in the event of a shock to the economy after Brexit Day, expected in 2019. A special \u20ac150m loan fund to help farmers with cash flow and short term borrowings is to be established amid concern many are struggling to cope with the sharp decline in the value of their exports to the UK, A special tax relief programme designed to help foreign investors with the smooth movement of staff from the US and elsewhere is to be extended until the end of 2020. This programme will allow employers to relocate state from overseas offices with minimal tax complications. A reduced nine per cent VAT rate is to be retained in the tourist sector to assist the competitiveness of the hospitality sector which is heavily dependent on UK tourists. The government says: \u201cThe measure acts to secure and embed investment, which can lead to sustainable growth and strengthens Ireland\u2019s innovative capabilities.\u201d At the same time the government has released a sector by sector analysis of the impact Brexit could have on trade with Britain, the country\u2019s biggest trading partner. Agri-food and computer services are among the most exposed sectors. The Revenue commissioners have also been asked to scope out how potential customs with the UK and with Northern Ireland would work. Unveiling the package, finance minister Michael Noonan said the Brexit vote posed \u201cimportant challenges for the Irish economy\u201d and it needed to \u201cprotect the progress\u201d made to the economy since the crash of 2010. Breaking: Britain\u2019s stock market has failed to hit a new closing high, as the City frets about the costs of a hard Brexit. A late afternoon selloff sent the FTSE 100 down by 0.38%, or 26 points, to 7070 points. It had earlier hit a new all-time high of 7129 points (as covered here). Retail stocks rallied, with Next up 4% and Marks &amp; Spencer up 3.2%. But mining stocks fell, as the strengthening US dollar pushed down commodity prices. Now, in theory, the weak pound should have driven the FTSE 100 higher. But it appears that Brexit worries have pushed shares price down, especially predictions that leaving the single market would create a fiscal black hole. Top bankers from Citi and Morgan Stanley also dented confidence, by warning they could quit the City of London next year. Conner Campbell of SpreadEx explains: A lunchtime surge saw the FTSE smash through to 7129; now it\u2019s back hovering below 7100, that midday burst of energy proving to be brief. Perhaps reports that both Citi and Morgan Stanley have stated they will leave London if Britain appears to be heading for a hard Brexit have weighed on investors\u2019 appetite for the UK index; perhaps it was a bout of profit-taking. Either way the FTSE couldn\u2019t hold onto its highs for long. Wall Streeet is also in the red, with the Dow down around 1% after aluminium firm Alcoa disappointed the markets. Chris Beauchamp of IG says investors are also driving the US dollar higher, because they expect American interest rates to rise before Christmas. The blame for the general \u2018risk off\u2019 mood can be attributed partly to Alcoa, whose disappointing figures have put US markets on the defensive, but overall the equity rally is being knocked by a rising US dollar, as traders rush back to the greenback thanks to soaring expectations of a move by the Fed in December The pound is hitting new lows against the US dollar in late London trading. It has now shed almost 1.5 cents today, to just $1.221. That partly reflects fears over hard Brexit. It\u2019s also due to the fact the US dollar is strengthening against most currencies. Worth noting that the euro is also having a bad week. Traders are piling into the US dollar in anticipation that American interest rates might rise in December. Fujitsu says that its 1,800 planned job cuts are not a response to the Brexit vote, and it remains committed to the UK (that\u2019s hot off the Reuters terminal) The pound is taking another pummelling, now down its lowest point of the day at $1.223. It was briefly lower on Friday, during the flash crash that drove sterling to fresh 31-year lows. Bad news for UK workers at Fujitsu. The Japanese electronics firm is planning to cut up to 1,800 jobs as part of a \u2018transformation programme\u2019. That\u2019s via the Press Association. No word if it\u2019s Brexit-related.... Global stock markets are turning a little sour now, dragging the FTSE 100 away from today\u2019s record high. US aluminium firm Alcoa has disappointed investors, by missing revenue and profit forecasts today. That\u2019s a downbeat start to the latest earnings season, leaving Wall Street traders unimpressed. Naeem Aslam of Think Markets says: Expectations were that we will finally get a quarter when we can be confident to say that earning season will give us a number which will make the foundation a little more stronger for the US economy. But the number released from Alcoa was simply just a disaster and has made investors angry who are willing to liquidate their position. So, all the main markets are now in the red: The pound is still looking weak, too, down almost one cent today at $1.228 The government won\u2019t be lured on whether we\u2019re in a full-blown sterling crisis, or not, reports Paul Waugh of Huffington Post. Personally, I think $1.20 might be the trigger point for some serious \u201cSterling Crisis\u201d headlines; so we\u2019re still a few cents away. Two senior bankers have warned that they could start moving jobs out of the City, perhaps next year, if Britain appears to be heading for a hard Brexit. Speaking at a London conference today James Bardrick, the boss of Citi\u2019s UK operation, said his bank could trigger its contingency plan by early next year. Bardrick said: \u201cHow do we and when do we start making decisions ... knowing the plan is ready to go ... it could be in the first quarter of 2017.\u201d Rob Rooney, CEO of Morgan Stanley international, gave a blunt warning that jobs would have to move back into the EU, if Britain quit the single market. As Rooney put it: \u201cIt really isn\u2019t terribly complicated. If we are outside the EU and we don\u2019t have what would be a stable and long-term commitment to access the single market then a lot of the things we do today in London, we\u2019d have to do inside the EU 27.\u201d (thanks to Reuters for the quotes). This is what Bank of England policymaker Anil Kashyap was banging on about this morning, when he predicted a \u201cnon-trivial\u201d impact on the UK\u2019s fiscal plans if lots of well-paid City jobs moved overseas. Today\u2019s stock market surge is only a \u2018hollow victory\u2019, argues Laith Khalaf of financial services group Hargreaves Lansdown. He says it\u2019s being driven by currency movements rather than a fundamental improvement in UK companies. Nonetheless UK investors will still be cheered to see a boost to their pension pots and ISA valuations, as it represents a genuine increase to their wealth in pounds and pence. The concern will be that a reversal in fortunes for the currency could see the gains wiped off as quickly as they appeared. That may well be the case, though it\u2019s hard to see anything in the foreseeable future that\u2019s going to propel the pound back to its former glory. Having smashed through the intraday record high, City traders are now wondering if the FTSE 100 will do the double and close at a record high. And with two and a half hours to go, it\u2019s nip and tuck, frankly. The Footsie has dipped back a little, since hitting 7129 points two hours ago. It\u2019s now just 7097, compared to an alltime closing high of 7104 points. This is good, from the Press Association: The Irish government also warned that the Brexit vote is \u201ca real risk\u201d to the Republic\u2019s economy, due to the close trade ties. Dublin has already trimmed its growth forecast for 2017, as this statement from today\u2019s 2017 Budget explains: During the delivery of his budget to the Dail (Irish parliament) this lunchtime Ireland\u2019s Finance Minister Michael Noonan was quite bullish in defending the Republic\u2019s controversial low corporation tax regime. Despite the EU ruling that Apple owed billions in tax thanks to the taxation policy in Ireland, Noonan told the Dail: \u201cIreland\u2019s 12.5% corporation will not be changed and nobody in Europe or anywhere else is asking for it to be changed.\u201d On the Republic\u2019s international tax strategy, Noonan says it: \u201crestates our commitment to meet international tax principles and how our corporate tax regime remains fair but competitive into the future.\u201d Overall he has announced around \u20ac300m in tax cuts mainly for the lower paid. Around \u20ac1.7bn will be allocated to extra spending for the public services. Back in Dublin, crash barriers have been erected to prevent any surge of protestors demonstration over today\u2019s Irish budget 2017. So far there has been little sign of many demonstrators unlike in the days of the last recession when thousands congregated in Molesworth Street over austerity cuts and deals to recapitalise Ireland\u2019s busted banking system. (via US student Keela Sweeney) Neil Wilson of ETX Capital agrees that the weak pound is the main factor driving the FTSE 100 to an all-time high today. Brexiters might point to the FTSE\u2019s rise as a sign of strength but this is very much a story of sterling weakness boosting foreign earnings \u2013 which account for around two-thirds to three-quarters of FTSE 100 company revenues. Having said that today\u2019s gains largely come from UK-focused stocks like Next, Whitbread, Marks &amp; Spencer, Travis Perkins and Taylor Wimpey. He also believes that Bank of England policymaker Michael Saunders may have helped push shares higher, during his testimony to MPs (highlights are here) We also got comments today from one Bank of England policymaker that the MPC would not be too fussed if inflation overshoots \u2013 the market seems to have taken this as a clear indication that rates are staying on the floor for a while yet. A weak pound and lower-for-longer interest rates is generally good for equities. Duncan Weldon, head of research at City firm Resolution Group, points out that the FTSE 100 isn\u2019t a great barometer of the UK economy. The index\u2019s 10 biggest companies are (in order), Royal Dutch Shell, HSBC, Unilever, BP, British American Tobacco, GlaxoSmithKline, BHP Billiton, AstraZeneca, Vodafone and Diageo. That\u2019s two oil giants, two pharmaceuticals firms, a global bank, a tobacco firm, a consumer goods titan, a major mining company, an international drinks business and a major telecoms group. Ben Chu of the Independent is tweeting some interesting graphs about the FTSE: We\u2019re calling it a record high... but The Telegraph\u2019s Tara Cunningham points out that the Footsie is 6% down this year, when priced in US dollars. That means UK shares are attractive for American investors, another factor that has driven the market up since the Brexit vote. Boom! The pound is falling further as lunchtime approaches in the City, driving shares in London up to their highest ever level. The FTSE 100 index has just smashed through to a new all-time intraday high, up 30 points at 7129. That breaks the previous record set in April 2015. It\u2019s being driven by retailers such as Next (+4.2%) and Marks &amp; Spencer (+3.1%), plus building companies. The smaller FTSE 250 index, which contains more UK focused companies, has gained 0.7% - close to the record high struck last week. But there is a proviso.... share prices are partly being driven up by the weakness of the pound (which makes overseas earnings more valuable). And the pound is continuing to slide today, now down another cent at $1.225. This graph, from Bloomberg, shows how the FTSE 100 has pushed higher as the pound has weakened since June: Chris Beauchamp, Chief Market Analyst at IG, says the weak pound is \u201cworking its magic\u201d on share prices again. UK investors will once again be cheering the impact of a falling pound, as the drop in sterling once again works its magic on the FTSE 100. The index has hit its all-time high, although this will doubtless bring out the legions armed with their charts of the FTSE rebased into a variety of currencies to paint the index in a less flattering light. Of course, most UK investors will simply be pleased to see their portfolios rise, and will worry about the currency later. Good numbers from luxury firm LVMH have helped Burberry to rise steadily this morning, with the stock touching its highest level since August 2015. There are also protesters outside government buildings in Ireland today, ahead of the budget: A local entrepreneur and founder of a Irish startup company called Parkio has welcomed Dublin\u2019s decision to halve capital gains tax for entrepreneurs, to 10%, to help cushion the impact of the Brexit vote. His accountant had estimated he was going to be paying approximately 33%. (thanks to journalism student Lucas Nolan) Back in Ireland, the government\u2019s new budget is now expected to contain some measures to counteract and indeed exploit the impact of Brexit. There will be additional funding for the Republic\u2019s Industrial Development Authority, which over four decades has attracted multi-national corporations from Dell to Apple, Microsoft to Google to the country. The extra money for the IDA will enable it to try and woo even more global hi-tech giants to low corporation tax Ireland (12.5%) especially those companies who are worried that the UK out of Europe means Britain is no longer a beachhead into the EU single market. It is part of moves to portray Ireland globally as the only English-speaking country still in the the EU and mainly for the benefit of American hi-tech multi nationals in particular. One potential \u2018Brexit shock absorber\u2019 in this year\u2019s budget is the dramatic halving of capital gains tax for home-grown entrepreneurs from 20% to just 10%. This is another move designed to boost indigenous Irish firms to cope with any potential collateral damage Brexit could cause to the Republic\u2019s economy. Anil Kashyap refuses to say whether he thinks the pound is likely to suffer further falls over the next few years. I\u2019d have to resign from the University of Chicago if I started forecasting currency moves, Kashyap tells the Treasury committee -- we\u2019re known for our position that the market sets these prices. The newest member of the Bank of England\u2019s Financial Policy Committee adds: Until we see what the relations are between the UK and the EU, it\u2019s very hard to know where any of this is going to settle Q: But what about if we knew we were getting a hard Brexit? Then the pound would probably weaken further, Kashyap. But it still depends exactly what \u2018hard Brexit means\u2019. Q: Hard Brexit is taken to mean a swift exit from the EU, and a fallback to WTO rules..... Kashyap replies that this could have serious consequences for the Treasury: If you lose a bunch of financial services jobs... then the fiscal consequences of that is non-trivial, as those jobs are so high paying, and [generate] so much tax. 3.7% of total UK employment is in financial services, and 11.5% of fiscal revenues come from financial services, he adds. You don\u2019t have to lose lots of that before you have a hole in the budget that could be meaningful. And that could have some knock-on effects for the exchange rate. Reminder: A leaked Treasury paper has predicted that the UK could eventually lose \u00a366bn of tax revenues after Brexit: The Treasury Committee is now questioning Anil Kashyap, a US academic who is joining the Bank of England\u2019s Financial Stability Committee. They\u2019re not best pleased that Kashyap is planning to miss one FPC meeting due to teaching commitments at the University of Chicago (but to be fair, he\u2019s squeezing his teaching commitments into just 10 weeks). Kashyap is also being quizzed about the huge fine hanging over Deutsche Bank. Is that a threat to financial stability? Kashyap argues that letting banks get away with malpractice would be a bigger threat to stability. And he denies that the problems in the European banking system start with US fines. He blames low growth, and badly capitalised banks -- such as in Italy. If the size of the problem in Italy was as small as some people have claimed, they\u2019d have fixed it by now, Kashyap adds. And that\u2019s the end of Michael Saunders\u2019 session at parliament, to rubberstamp his appointment to set interest rates on the Monetary Policy Committee. The big news is that Saunders thinks the pound could extend its recent losses since the Brexit vote. He told MPs that: \u201cGiven the scale and persistence of the UK\u2019s current account deficit, I would not be surprised if sterling falls further, but I am fairly agnostic as to whether any further depreciation is likely.\u201d Also: He thinks the Bank will \u2018look through\u2019 the inflationary consequences of the weak pound. He\u2019s not terribly worried by the speed of the pound\u2019s decline, arguing that the currency is adjusting to the reality of Brexit. He thinks the slump in sterling could push import prices up by 13%, potentially pushing inflation up by 1.5 percentage points a year. He thinks the UK economy will grow faster over the next few quarters than previously thought, but this doesn\u2019t tell much about the long-term. Saunders said: I think the economy will do better over the next few quarters. I don\u2019t think that tells you about the long run effects. It\u2019s important not to make judgements on the long run based on the short run view. What the economy does in the next few years is crucial. Q: Is the Bank of England now \u2018out of ammunition\u2019 to stimulate the economy? Saunders says not. Interest rates could be cut again (although they\u2019re already only 0.25%), and the Bank could also boost its asset purchase scheme (buying bonds with newly created money). We\u2019ve still got tools, if needed, he insists. Michael Saunders say the UK economy will probably perform better than expected over the next few quarters (echoing a point he made in a speech last week). But that doesn\u2019t tell us much about the long-term effects of Brexit. Q: Were the Bank of England\u2019s warnings before the EU referendum justified? Saunders only joined the Bank of England this summer, so he was still working in the City during the Brexit vote. He says most City experts expected a Brexit vote to lead to a weaker currency and lower growth, but no-one knew if this would lead to financial instability. So as a player in the market, Saunders was reassured by Mark Carney\u2019s comments -- as it showed the Bank would act to stabilise the markets. The Brexit vote isn\u2019t the only thing pushing the pound down, Michael Saunders adds. The UK\u2019s current account deficit (around 6% of GDP) is also weighing on sterling. And Saunders admits that he wouldn\u2019t be surprised to see the pound fall further! He also explains that a 20% drop in the pound (slightly more than what we\u2019ve seen since June) would probably push import prices up by 12-13%, which would add 4 percentage points to inflation over a few years. That could mean inflation is 1.5 percentage points higher than otherwise at its peak (so 3.5% rather than 2%, for example). And Saunders thinks the Bank of England could \u2018look through\u2019 this, rather than raise borrowing costs to squeeze it out. Q: Are you worried about the recent volatility in the pound? Michael Saunders says sterling is adjusting to the reality that Britain is leaving the European Union, and the likely impact on growth. If the speed at which the currency falls creates ripples in other asset markets, then that is a problem. But...if we are just adjusting to a new equilibrium, then the speed of the adjustment is not a problem. Saunders also insists that the Bank does not have any target for the pound, or a level where it would intervene to support sterling. The Bank has \u201clong ago learned its lesson\u201d here, he smiles (a reference to Black Wednesday in 1992 when speculator George Soros forced the pound out of the European Exchange Rate Mechanism). Over in parliament, new Bank of England policymaker Michael Saunders is being questioned by the Treasury Committee. It\u2019s being streamed live here. Saunders has been asked about Theresa May\u2019s recent criticism of the BoE\u2019s stimulus policies, for making people who own assets richer, but penalising savers and the poor. He defends the current policy of record low interest rates, plus a quantitative easing programme. I don\u2019t think we at the Bank of England can tackle the distributional effects of monetary policy. We can\u2019t set interest rates for different groups. If the Bank raised interest rates to support savers, then the economy would be weaker, unemployment would be higher, asset prices over time would be weaker, and over time, interest rates would eventually be lower too, Saunders claims. Q: So should you set QE and monetary policy blind to the distributional effects? Yes, Saunders replies, unless those distributional effects obstruct the impact of monetary policy. Big news out of South Korea: Samsung is \u201cpermanently halting production of its Galaxy Note 7. Killing off the smartphone is a \u201cdrastic step\u201d, says Bloomberg, after several customers reported that replacement devices have caught fire. Bloomberg explains: After halting sales of the new versions of the large-screen smartphone that failed to fix exploding batteries, Samsung finally pulled the plug on a key product that was supposed to compete with Apple Inc.\u2019s iPhones and other high-end smartphones during the U.S. holiday shopping season. Production will stop, Samsung said in a statement Tuesday. At $1.229, the pound has shed almost seven cents against the US dollar since Theresa May announced she\u2019d trigger article 50 by next March. That\u2019s a fall of around 5%, in less than seven trading days, and means the pound is now 17% lower than on referendum day. Reuters reckons the pound is suffering its worst four-day run since immediately after the Brexit vote. That\u2019s bad for import prices, and Brits heading abroad. But Peter Rosenstreich, head of market strategy at Swissquote Bank, believes exporters should soon benefit. A Brexit is definitely not the end of the world. Moreover, the devalued pound will see exports gain momentum within the next few month. Over in Germany, investor confidence has risen this month: John McDonnell MP, Labour\u2019s Shadow Chancellor, has responded to the warning that a \u201chard Brexit\u201d could cost the Treasury \u00a366bn a year in tax revenues. \u201cLosing access to the single market would be devastating for jobs, livelihoods and our public services yet the Tory government are prepared to take this desperate step, despite being warned by their own experts of the consequences. The British people voted to leave the European Union and all sides must respect that decision, but what they certainly didn\u2019t vote for was economic misery and the loss of jobs.\u201d After coming tantalisingly close to a new alltime high, the FTSE 100 has now shed all those early gains. Despite today\u2019s selloff, sterling isn\u2019t the worst-performing currency today. That honour has been grabbed by the South African rand, which just tumbled by 3% against the US dollar. There are reports that finance minister Pravin Gordhan has been issued with a summons for fraud, over a surveillance unit which was set up when he led the national tax agency. South African government bonds, and bank shares, are also falling in value. Over in parliament, MPs on the Business Committee are holding a session on Britain\u2019s industrial strategy. They\u2019ll hear from former chancellor George Osborne, former deputy PM Lord Heseltine and Sir Vince Cable, who ran the BIS department before the last election. Our Politics Live blog is tracking the action: The UK jobs market is also suffering from the Brexit vote, according to recruitment firm PageGroup. Gross profits at its UK division fell by 4.7% in the last three month, it told the City today. PageGroup blames on \u201cfragile market conditions\u201d following June\u2019s referendum, particularly in the financial services sector. Steve Ingham, PageGroup\u2019s CEO, says: In the UK, confidence levels remained fragile and below levels seen earlier in the year.... With the prevailing uncertainty in the UK, the challenges in some of our other larger markets and the unpredictable nature of the current cycle, we remain cautious in our short-term outlook. The official unemployment data since the Brexit vote has been quite encouraging, with the jobless rate still just 4.9%. But the claimant count did rise in August, suggesting some weakness. It\u2019s been a while since we last had a full-blown currency crisis, everyone panicking because the pound is falling through the floor. Well, we\u2019re having one now. So says John Humphrys, Today Programme presenter, with a certain amount of relish. But is it really a crisis? Gerard Lyons, former chief economic advisor to Boris Johnson, says it\u2019s not. He believes we should welcome the cheaper pound. Sterling has been seen as overvalued for some time - and the scale of the current account deficit, at 7%, is huge. In an era of low inflation and low growth, a weaker pound is a good thing, Lyons adds. But Ngaire Woods, professor of Global Economic Governance at the University of Oxford, is much more concerned. The cost of importing machines, or medical equipment for the NHS, from the US has immediately gone up, she says, and that will hurt the economy down the road. Firms also face new uncertainties --over the future of foreign workers, and the UK\u2019s future trade links \u2013 says Woods, adding: Here at Oxford University we have top international professors saying they might not move to Oxford.... It\u2019s budget day in Ireland and the first for the new coalition led by Fine Gael but propped up by Independent members of the Dail, and supported for the first time in terms of the national financial plans by the main opposition party Fianna Fail. Irish budgets of recent past have been cost-cutting austerity driven events as the last Fine Gael-Labour government sought to restore the black hole in Irish public finances caused by the banking crash and the collapse of the Celtic Tiger economy. In recent years Ireland has been the leading country in the EU in terms of growth but the state is still borrowing heavily on international markets to pay for its public services. There are some small give-away measures in this year\u2019s budget and they include: An extra \u20ac5 per week for the nation\u2019s pensioners. An additional \u20ac900 per year to each child if he or she is in 40 hours of childcare per week. Extra spending for an additional 1,000 nurses and 800 more garda officers. A 50 eurocent hike in the price of cigarettes.  A reduction of \u20ac5 in the cost of prescription charges for the over 70s. All in all they are modest adjustments and extra spending indicating the cautious approach taken by Finance Minister Michael Noonan. He presents his budget to the Dail at 1pm and it will be interesting to see if he introduces any other measures aimed at absorbing future shocks to the economy caused by Britain\u2019s planned exit from the European Union. With the UK still Ireland\u2019s largest trading one commentator in Dublin yesterday even called for the creation of an Irish Minister in charge of Brexit-affairs given the impact the British leaving the UK may have on the Republic\u2019s economy. Neil Wilson of City firm ETX Capital is alarmed by the \u201csharp moves\u201d in the value of the pound this morning. He fears that Brexit angst could drive sterling down to $1.20. GBP/USD crashed through the $1.23 handle to around 1.2284, its lowest level since last week\u2019s gyrations. It\u2019s not unreasonable to think that ferocious flash crash was just a very tentative toe in the water and the pound is now plunging headlong into the abyss. Sterling seems to be looking for a level and it\u2019s really unclear where that could be and so bargain hunting is a risky game to play at the moment. The $1.20 handle earmarked by many before the referendum is definitely in play as everyone seems to be short sterling at present. The weak pound is helping to drive the London stock market close to record highs. The FTSE 100 index of top blue-chip shares has risen by almost 20 points, or 0.25%, to 7118 points. That would be a record closing high, and is only 6 points away from the all-time intraday high. Exporters, such as fashion firm Burberry, are benefitting from the cheapness of sterling. It\u2019s also good for mining companies, who earn their money in dollars. Sterling is now at its weakest level since the financial crisis broke out, when measured against a basket of other top currencies. Reuters has the details: Trade-weighted sterling hit a nearly-eight-year low of 74.0 at the Bank of England\u2019s first morning print of the index, which measures the pound\u2019s broader strength. It was also half a percent weaker at 90.51 pence per euro. Some traders cited a Financial Times report that Russian bank VTB may move its European hub to Frankfurt, Paris or Vienna as having added to worries of financial sector cutbacks inLondon due to Brexit. \u201cThere is nothing to go on on the data front today, but concerns surrounding our ever increasing current account deficit have reignited discussion around the widespread impact such a hole can create,\u201d said Tobias Davis, head of corporate treasury sales at Western Union in London. Kit Juckes, currency expert at Societe Generale, fears that the weakness of the pound could spread to other assets, such as government bonds and shares. In real effective terms, sterling is 10% lower than it was in 1992 after leaving the ERM and is now weaker than it was after Lehman. Press comment is now shifting to embracing the positive effects of a weak pound and in due course that\u2019ll be true but any further weakness from here might simply reflect loss of confidence and be bad for UK assets (gilts, equities, house prices, you name it...) in general. Although a weak pound means Britain is poorer, it could also help the economy ride out the Brexit storm. Ashoka Mody, the IMF\u2019s former deputy-director for Europe, has told the Daily Telegraph that we should be celebrating sterling\u2019s slump. Mody argues that the pound was overvalued before June\u2019s vote, and has simply dropped to a more suitable level. \u201cIt is desirable from every point of view. The idea that Britain is in crisis or is on its knees before the exchange rate vigilantes is ludicrous. \u201cThe UK economy is rebalancing amazingly well. It is a stunning achievement that a once-in-fifty-year event should have gone to smoothly.\u201d More here. The pound\u2019s weakness is being exacerbated by traders piling into the US dollar. The dollar is in demand, as Donald Trump is seen as increasingly unlikely to become US president in November. Tape recordings of Trump boasting about groping women have dealt another blow to his campaign, prompting more top Republicans to withdraw their endorsements: Kathleen Brooks of City Index says Trump\u2019s \u201ccrash and burn\u201d is boosting the dollar, The latest election polls in the US suggest that Hillary Clinton is extending her lead over Donald Trump, which is considered dollar positive. The most senior Republican in Congress, Paul Ryan, has abandoned Trump after the latest debate against Clinton, further signs that his campaign is losing momentum at this crucial stage of the election race. It\u2019s looking like another bad morning for sterling, as the British currency continues to weaken in the face of Brexit worries. The pound has dropped by over half a cent this morning to $1.229 -- which would be a 31-year low, if you ignored the flash crash that sent sterling tumbling on Friday. Sterling has also lost fresh ground against the euro, down 0.33% to \u20ac1.106. This latest selloff follows reports that Britain could lose \u00a366bn of tax revenues each year if the UK takes the plunge with a \u2018hard Brexit\u2019 Here\u2019s the story: Leaked government papers suggest that leaving the single market and switching to World Trade Organisation (WTO) rules would cause GDP to fall by up to 9.5% compared with staying in the EU. The draft cabinet committee paper seen by the Times is based on forecasts from the controversial study into the predicted impact of quitting the EU published by George Osborne in April during the referendum campaign. Although the then chancellor faced widespread criticism over the report, the Treasury stands by its calculations, according to the Times. The documents says: \u201cThe Treasury estimates that UK GDP would be between 5.4% and 9.5% of GDP lower after 15 years if we left the EU with no successor arrangement, with a central estimate of 7.5%. Some pro-Brexit ministers have dismissed the report, saying the Treasury is being unduly pessimistic and going over the top. Sam Coates, the Times journalist who broke the story, explains that the report uses the same Treasury forecasts produced in April. This may heighten concerns among businesses that they could be locked out of the single market by March 2019.... Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Coming up today.... Brexit fears continues to swirl around the City this morning, as the pound continues to be buffered by concerns over Britain\u2019s exit strategy from the EU. Overnight, Russia\u2019s VTB Bank has become the first big lender to publicly say it will move its European headquarters out of the UK. Herbert Moos, deputy chairman, told the Financial Times that VTB is now eying up Frankfurt, Vienna and Paris as alternative sites for its European hub. Moos says: \u201cWe did have bigger plans for the London office, but after Brexit we are scaling them down and building them up elsewhere. \u201cOur board will decide where by the end of the year.\u201d More here: Brexit pushes VTB\u2019s Europe HQ out of London That kind of talk is likely to weigh on UK assets, as all the major banks plan their own strategies... Brexit will also be on the minds of MPs on the the Treasury Select Committee. They will be questioning Michael Saunders, the new member of the Bank of England\u2019s monetary policy committee, from 10am. They\u2019ll then hear from Anil Kashyap, who is joining the Bank\u2019s Financial Policy Committee. Saunders has already said that the UK economy has performed better than the Bank expected, since the Brexit vote. Also coming up.... Tech giant Samsung is in a full-blown crisis, after pulling all its Galaxy Note 7 smartphones from sale around the globe. Several customers have reported that replacement devices have overheated, or caught fire: The oil price has hit a one-year high overnight, after Russia backed the output curbs proposed by the Opec cartel. Oil ministers are gathering in Istanbul this week for the World Energy Conference, so further developments are possible. Ireland\u2019s government is presenting its budget today; the first since Britain voted to leave the EU. And European stock markets are expected to dip in early trading, after London\u2019s FTSE 100 closed at a 15-month high last night. We\u2019ll be tracking all the main events through the day....",

They were giving evidence to MPs on the business, energy and industrial strategy committee, which is going on a roadshow around the country to study what the government\u2019s industrial strategy should be.</p> <p>Hamid Mughal, the director of global manufacturing at Rolls-Royce, the FTSE 100 engineering group, told the MPs that industry was facing a \u201cradical shift\u201d because of dramatic advancements in technology. As well as 3D printing, robots and driverless cars, Mughal referred to Google Earth-like technology that would allow company bosses to monitor the inside of their factories around the world from the comfort of their desk. \u201cWhen people talk about an industrial revolution, there really is [one],\u201d Mughal said. \u201cThere is breathtaking technology that is coming together.\u201d</p> <p>This fourth industrial revolution would revolve around innovation and knowledge, he added, meaning that the UK, with its world-leading universities and advanced manufacturing companies such as Rolls, was well placed. \u201cFor once it plays to the UK\u2019s strength,\u201d Mughal said. \u201cI am absolutely convinced it will play to our strengths, but we need to get organised.\u201d</p> <p>The Rolls executive warned that countries around the world were \u201cinvesting huge amounts of political and economic resources\u201d into trying to attract manufacturers to open new facilities and turn their region into a global base for new technologies. \u201cManufacturing has become as popular as football,\u201d Mughal added.</p> <p>The comments provide a fascinating context to the prime minister\u2019s courting of Nissan, the Japanese carmaker.

                "bodyText":"A collection of MPs and leading figures from British industry gathered at a business park in Coventry last Thursday to discuss the future of manufacturing and the government\u2019s industrial strategy. Little did they know that 200 miles up the road in Sunderland, Nissan was about to make a major announcement with significant implications for the British economy that showed Theresa May\u2019s new government had already activated its industrial strategy. The guests in Coventry included senior executives from Rolls-Royce and Aston Martin, trade union leaders and council bosses. They were giving evidence to MPs on the business, energy and industrial strategy committee, which is going on a roadshow around the country to study what the government\u2019s industrial strategy should be. Hamid Mughal, the director of global manufacturing at Rolls-Royce, the FTSE 100 engineering group, told the MPs that industry was facing a \u201cradical shift\u201d because of dramatic advancements in technology. As well as 3D printing, robots and driverless cars, Mughal referred to Google Earth-like technology that would allow company bosses to monitor the inside of their factories around the world from the comfort of their desk. \u201cWhen people talk about an industrial revolution, there really is [one],\u201d Mughal said. \u201cThere is breathtaking technology that is coming together.\u201d This fourth industrial revolution would revolve around innovation and knowledge, he added, meaning that the UK, with its world-leading universities and advanced manufacturing companies such as Rolls, was well placed. \u201cFor once it plays to the UK\u2019s strength,\u201d Mughal said. \u201cI am absolutely convinced it will play to our strengths, but we need to get organised.\u201d The Rolls executive warned that countries around the world were \u201cinvesting huge amounts of political and economic resources\u201d into trying to attract manufacturers to open new facilities and turn their region into a global base for new technologies. \u201cManufacturing has become as popular as football,\u201d Mughal added. The comments provide a fascinating context to the prime minister\u2019s courting of Nissan, the Japanese carmaker. But they also show how ill-timed Brexit is for manufacturers and why it threatens to derail a revival in British manufacturing.
