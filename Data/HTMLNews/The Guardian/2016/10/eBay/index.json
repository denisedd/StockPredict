                "bodyText":"He\u2019s jumping without a parachute. After 31 years in the cosy world of John Lewis, the employee-owned department store\u2019s \u00a31m-a-year managing director, Andy Street, is checking out with no payoff in a bid to become mayor of the West Midlands. It is a mission of passion for the Birmingham-born Street, who is fascinated by politics and has high-profile friends in the House of Commons. The politics, philosophy and economics graduate privately expresses his admiration for London mayor Sadiq Khan, who switched from a high-flying law career to try to bring about real change through politics. Now Street, who will speak at the Tory conference starting in Birmingham , is clearly keen to do the same. But in his bid to become a Tory mayor in a Labour stronghold, Street is also leaving behind a department store heading into stormy waters. Operating profits at the chain, which is regarded as a bellwether for the UK economy, slumped 31% to \u00a332m in the first half of this year as it struggled to adapt to a fast-changing market in which shoppers increasingly expect to buy online for convenient delivery. Street\u2019s lack of pay-off contrasts strongly with the \u00a31.9m golden goodbye cheque collected by his former colleague Waitrose boss Mark Price when he exited - to become a Tory peer and trade minister - earlier this year. One source close to the business said Street\u2019s lack of a payoff could reflect the group\u2019s reluctance for him to leave at such short notice: he will be out of the business on 28 October, just a month after the company confirmed he would be leaving, while Price stayed on for six months after his resignation. But it\u2019s big leap for Street who is thought to be paid around \u00a31.1m a year. In his decade running the department store, Street has overseen major expansion and helped transform its image from a fusty middle-aged brand into Middle England\u2019s favourite shop. John Lewis only began advertising on TV the year that Street took over. Now its Christmas ad is a big event attracting millions of hits on social media.

In a dismal update that sent its shares down 10% in early trading on Monday, the accountancy firm BDO said it did not have sufficient evidence to perform a proper audit and warned of \u201csignificant doubt about the group\u2019s ability to continue as a going concern\u201d. The group is undergoing what it described as an \u201cunsettling\u201d restructuring effort, which forced it to restate results from previous financial years, scrap its dividend and shut its online marketplace. The collectibles firm, which was founded in 1856, has also cut jobs, reduced its office space and overhauled its management team. Its chairman Harry Wilson, who was appointed in May, commissioned a review after a dire year that led it to issue two profit warnings and tap shareholders for cash. In his latest sombre update, Wilson said the business had gone \u201cbadly adrift\u201d under previous directors, almost all of whom have left the business. Stanley Gibbons lost \u00a329m before tax in the year to the end of March on revenues of \u00a359m, after taking one-off charges of \u00a324m. The firm issued a lengthy confessional note entitled \u201cWhat went wrong?\u201d, explaining its woes to shareholders, who it said \u201cdeserve an explanation of the combination of events leading to the severely disappointing trading result\u201d. It follows a review by accountants at BDO, who discovered mistakes in the way Stanley Gibbons reported revenue banked from the sale of investment plans in its stamp-trading business. The resulting restatement of figures from previous years led to the value of its assets being slashed by 43%, while its bank debt nearly doubled to \u00a321.9m. It was forced to take \u00a324m of one-off charges, including the write-off of its online collectibles business, The Marketplace, launched as a rival to eBay for trading items such as commemorative coins and stamps. Stanley Gibbons said the business, started only last year, was an \u201cill-conceived, badly managed project which was allowed to severely over-run budgeted expenditure\u201d. The firm parted company with almost its entire boardroom over the summer, with the chief executive, Mike Hall, and finance director, Donal Duff, leaving in July. The new team wasted no time in outlining their predecessors\u2019 failings. The firm highlighted the twin acquisitions of the fine wine, jewellery and antiques trader Noble Investments as well as Mallett, which specialises in art and furniture. The company said the acquisitions were \u201cpoorly managed and, as a result, failed to instil a cohesive, UK-based management structure with adequate challenge and competition for capital\u201d. The firms were not properly integrated, left the group too reliant on certain customers, ate up investment and left the business in too much debt, it added. The firm\u2019s previous auditors, Nexia Smith &amp; Williamson, quit last month, saying the risks of the audit \u201cexceed the level that they are willing to accept\u201d.

This effectively approves the group\u2019s controversial European tax structure. \u201cWe benefit from tax rulings concluded in several different jurisdictions, most significantly Switzerland and Luxembourg,\u201d eBay Inc explained in the small print of its annual report. \u201cThese rulings provide for significantly lower rates of taxation on certain classes of income and require various thresholds of investment and employment in those jurisdictions.\u201d As a result of these arrangements, the group said it made tax savings of $319m last year, and $986m over the last three years. eBay Inc enjoyed an effective tax rate for 2015 of 19%, well below headline rates in its three largest markets: the US, UK and Germany. eBay Inc confirms in its annual report that some tax authorities have called some of its arrangements into question, and that the years 2003 to 2012 remain under scrutiny. Further tax audits are possible in several major markets including the US, UK, Germany and Korea, it said. Accounts for eBay (UK) Ltd show revenues for 2015 down 2% at \u00a3185m, and pretax profits down almost 9% at \u00a38.1m. The tax charge for the year was \u00a31.07m, not all of which was due in the UK because the company is active elsewhere in Europe and in Australia. eBay (UK) Ltd is not the only British company within the eBay group. Another UK unit is Gumtree.com Ltd, the free-to-advertise online marketplace. It reported pretax profits of \u00a320.2m on sales of \u00a358.7m last year, and tax of \u00a34m. eBay also owns the music and sports ticket-trading website Stubhub.co.uk, but this UK-facing web business is run by eBay International AG. eBay also owned the payment processing business PayPal until it was de-merged in July last year.",

Passengers pay their fares directly to drivers, who automatically hand over a commission fee to Uber that ultimately appears in the group\u2019s Dutch accounts. </p> <p>Uber International BV is one of a handful of companies in the Netherlands that together form the core of the group\u2019s complex tax planning arrangements, helping minimise its tax bills around the world.<br></p> <p>Details about Uber\u2019s aggressive tax planning come as the group separately fights claims that it is aggressively exploiting UK employment laws. The US corporation is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/jul/19/uber-drivers-court-tribunal-self-employed-uk-employment-law\">being sued by a group of UK drivers</a> who say they should be classified as employees of Uber, which would allow them to receive a range of benefits. A court judgment in the case is expected to be release this month. </p> <p>Alex Cobham, research director at campaign group Tax Justice Network, said: \u201cUber\u2019s UK accounts confirm the extent to which major multinationals are impervious to policymakers\u2019 rhetoric, and willing to take full advantage of both the weaknesses of international tax rules and of the absence of transparency.\u201d<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Anneliese Dodds, Labour MEP and tax campaigner, said: \u201cCompared to the way you pay for ordinary taxis, this kind of structure [used by Uber] is ridiculous \u2026 There is quite a lot of evidence it depresses wages and taxes.\u201d <br></p> <p>In a statement, Uber said: \u201cThe vast majority of the revenue generated by our technology goes straight into the pockets of drivers who use our app and so stays in the local economy. We look forward to expanding to more cities and creating more economic opportunities in the months to come.</p> <p>\u201cWhile we recorded a profit here last year, globally we make a loss as we are a young company that is still expanding and investing heavily. Uber is also creating thousands of economic opportunities in every city we operate in.\u201d</p> <p>Uber is the latest US tech company to resist pressure from British politicians to abandon its controversial tax structure and bring its UK business onshore.</p> <p>In her <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/05/theresa-may-consigns-cameron-to-history-in-populist-speech\">speech to Conservative party conference this month</a>, Theresa May said she was determined to tackle tax avoidance. \u201cIf you\u2019re \u2026 an international company that treats tax laws as an optional extra,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m putting you on warning. This can\u2019t go on any more. A change has got to come.\u201d</p> <p>Similar threats have been made by previous leaders. In 2013, David Cameron said: \u201cWhen some businesses aren\u2019t seen to pay their taxes that\u2019s corrosive to the public trust. Some forms of avoidance have become so aggressive that I think it is right to say these are ethical issues and it is time to call for more responsibility. This is an issue whose time has come \u2026 [Multinational companies should] wake up and smell the coffee.\u201d</p> <p>A year later, the then chancellor, George Osborne, said: \u201cSome technology companies go to extraordinary lengths to pay little or no tax here \u2026 If you abuse our tax system, you abuse the trust of the British people. And my message to those companies is clear: we will put a stop to it.\u201d</p> <p>In the run-up to the 2015 general election, Osborne announced the introduction of a punitive tax on those multinationals artificially shifting revenues from Britain to overseas operations in order to lower their tax bills. </p> <p>However, reaction from big international businesses to this measure \u2013 known as the diverted profits tax \u2013 has been mixed. Amazon and Facebook have unwound their controversial arrangements for shifting UK sales overseas.

The latest accounts for Uber London Ltd show the UK company\u2019s turnover doubled to \u00a323.3m last year, but all of this income was earned by providing unspecified \u201csupport\u201d to other companies within the taxi-app group, and not from driver commissions. After deducting expenses, this small subsidiary, which employs 105 staff, made a profit of \u00a31.8m and paid tax of \u00a3411,000. Meanwhile, accounts for the company\u2019s international sales hub in the Netherlands reveal that commissions from drivers in London and scores of other cities around the world were booming in 2015, pushing revenues up to $520m (\u00a3420m). This was more than seven times the figure for 2014. Passengers pay their fares directly to drivers, who automatically hand over a commission fee to Uber that ultimately appears in the group\u2019s Dutch accounts. Uber International BV is one of a handful of companies in the Netherlands that together form the core of the group\u2019s complex tax planning arrangements, helping minimise its tax bills around the world. Details about Uber\u2019s aggressive tax planning come as the group separately fights claims that it is aggressively exploiting UK employment laws. The US corporation is being sued by a group of UK drivers who say they should be classified as employees of Uber, which would allow them to receive a range of benefits. A court judgment in the case is expected to be release this month. Alex Cobham, research director at campaign group Tax Justice Network, said: \u201cUber\u2019s UK accounts confirm the extent to which major multinationals are impervious to policymakers\u2019 rhetoric, and willing to take full advantage of both the weaknesses of international tax rules and of the absence of transparency.\u201d Anneliese Dodds, Labour MEP and tax campaigner, said: \u201cCompared to the way you pay for ordinary taxis, this kind of structure [used by Uber] is ridiculous \u2026 There is quite a lot of evidence it depresses wages and taxes.\u201d In a statement, Uber said: \u201cThe vast majority of the revenue generated by our technology goes straight into the pockets of drivers who use our app and so stays in the local economy. We look forward to expanding to more cities and creating more economic opportunities in the months to come. \u201cWhile we recorded a profit here last year, globally we make a loss as we are a young company that is still expanding and investing heavily. Uber is also creating thousands of economic opportunities in every city we operate in.\u201d Uber is the latest US tech company to resist pressure from British politicians to abandon its controversial tax structure and bring its UK business onshore. In her speech to Conservative party conference this month, Theresa May said she was determined to tackle tax avoidance. \u201cIf you\u2019re \u2026 an international company that treats tax laws as an optional extra,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m putting you on warning. This can\u2019t go on any more. A change has got to come.\u201d Similar threats have been made by previous leaders. In 2013, David Cameron said: \u201cWhen some businesses aren\u2019t seen to pay their taxes that\u2019s corrosive to the public trust. Some forms of avoidance have become so aggressive that I think it is right to say these are ethical issues and it is time to call for more responsibility. This is an issue whose time has come \u2026 [Multinational companies should] wake up and smell the coffee.\u201d A year later, the then chancellor, George Osborne, said: \u201cSome technology companies go to extraordinary lengths to pay little or no tax here \u2026 If you abuse our tax system, you abuse the trust of the British people. And my message to those companies is clear: we will put a stop to it.\u201d In the run-up to the 2015 general election, Osborne announced the introduction of a punitive tax on those multinationals artificially shifting revenues from Britain to overseas operations in order to lower their tax bills. However, reaction from big international businesses to this measure \u2013 known as the diverted profits tax \u2013 has been mixed. Amazon and Facebook have unwound their controversial arrangements for shifting UK sales overseas. But others, including Google, eBay and Uber, appear to have left their arrangements largely unchanged.",
