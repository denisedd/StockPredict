Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at IG, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Stock markets are in rude health this afternoon, with the FTSE moving back over the 7000 mark, as earnings season continues to come in ahead of expectations.

Since the beginning of September, sterling has fallen a further 8 percent or so against the euro and the dollar. This will continue to push up inflation in the months ahead. A stronger oil price will add further to price rises for energy and transport. <br></p> <p>\u201cOver the course of next year, we should expect inflation to rise above the Bank of England\u2019s 2 percent target.

                "bodyText":"Sterling has enjoyed a good day, with the higher than expected UK inflation figures dampening speculation that the Bank of England would cut interest rates in November. The suggestion from government lawyer James Eadie that parliament could have a bigger role in Brexit proceedings also helped support the UK currency. So against the dollar the pound has gained 0.9% to $1.2295, while it has also climbed against the euro, up 1% to \u20ac1.1185. On that note, it\u2019s time to close for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. Although they have come off their best levels, it has been a good day for European stock markets. The FTSE 100 has just squeezed back above the 7000 level, albeit lagging behind European peers, after a revival in sterling and bond prices. Some positive corporate news, from building group Bellway in the UK to Goldman Sachs and Netflix in the US, has helped support sentiment. Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at IG, said: Stock markets are in rude health this afternoon, with the FTSE moving back over the 7000 mark, as earnings season continues to come in ahead of expectations. We can also point to weakness in the US dollar for the gains over the past few hours, as markets take the cue from Fed officials and note that there are still hurdles to a possible December move. Earnings season has given investors the chance to look under the bonnet of the US economy, and so far they like what they see, especially in financial stocks. Couple that with some excellent figures from Netflix which indicate that consumer spending is holding up well across the globe, and we have a potent recipe for stock market gains, as the traditionally strong fourth quarter performance reasserts itself. The final scores in Europe showed: The FTSE 100 finished up 52.51 points or 0.76% at 7000.06 Germany\u2019s Dax rose 1.22% to 10,631.55 France\u2019s Cac closed up 1.32% at 4508.91 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB climbed 2.02% to 16,966.61 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended up 1.43% at 8865.3 In Greece, the Athens market added 1.33% to 593.83 On Wall Street the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 96 points or 0.5%. Back with exchange rates, and the effect of the day\u2019s inflation figures, financial analyst Connor Campbell at Spreadex said: It seems that the pound\u2019s pleasure at a potentially delayed Bank of England rate cut is outweighing the hopes of a US rate hike this Tuesday afternoon. With US inflation coming in as expected at 0.3% at a monthly basis and 1.5% annually, the Federal Reserve seemingly got another green light to raise rates before the end of 2016 \u2013 Clinton-election win permitting, that is. However, the usual boost this would have given the dollar was largely lost this afternoon, the pound instead holding strong with a 0.8% increase against the greenback, taking it back towards 1.23 as sterling cheered the fact that Mark Carney and co. likely won\u2019t cut rates in November. Hopes that oil producers can reach agreement on limiting output have received a boost. Reuters reports: OPEC should be able to reach a deal next month to limit oil production without too much disagreement about individual countries\u2019 output levels, the producer group\u2019s secretary-general said on Tuesday. Mohammed Barkindo also told journalists on the sidelines of the Oil &amp; Money conference that Russia, which is not in OPEC, was not backtracking on its pledge to contribute to output limits should OPEC reach a deal at its next meeting on Nov. 30. \u201cWe expect that all the building blocks will be in place in a timely fashion for the implementation,\u201d Barkindo told the conference, an annual London gathering of top oil officials and company executives. \u201cI am optimistic we will have a decision,\u201d he said. Despite this optimism on the part of producers, crude prices have edged lower. Brent crude is down 0.16% at $51.44 a barrel while West Texas Intermediate is off 0.02% at $49.93. US inflation figures have added to the idea that the Federal Reserve may raise interest rates before the end of the year. James Knightley, a senior economist at ING Bank, said: Today\u2019s inflation numbers are certainly no barrier to Federal Reserve rate hikes. Assuming the presidential election doesn\u2019t result in significant financial market volatility and the employment numbers continue to post reasonable 150,000 or so gains, the likelihood of a December rate hike will look strong. This has supported the dollar, which hit a high for today of $1.0983 against the euro. Despite this, the pound continues to hold most of its gains against the dollar, up by 0.9% at $1.2290, as UK inflation figures suggest that the Bank of England will not cut interest rates further in November. US markets have opened sharply higher, lifted by well-received updates from Goldman Sachs and Netflix. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 109 points or 0.6%, while the S&amp;P 500 opened 0.7% higher and the Nasdaq Composite about 1%. European markets have remained buoyant, with Germany\u2019s Dax and France\u2019s Cac both about 1.4% higher. The FTSE 100, meanwhile, is up 0.8%, with continuing worries about Brexit taking some of the shine off. Here\u2019s a handy summary of today\u2019s UK inflation report, for anyone just tuning in: And here\u2019s a chart showing that British companies are being charged much more for their raw materials since the pound dropped: The prospect of poor families suffering a tighter inflationary squeeze hasn\u2019t dampened the mood in the City. The pound is up by almost one cent to $1.228. The FTSE 100 has jumped back over the 7,000 mark, gaining 76 points (1.1%). Joshua Mahony, a market analyst at IG, says: Recent worries appear to have been dismissed this morning, with the FTSE gaining ground at a rapid rate, despite the negative implications of this morning\u2019s UK inflation update. Fears over a hard Brexit certainly seem overdone, given that we are still months from even entering negotiations, let alone close to finding any trade solutions. Equity markets are recovering across the board, with sentiment no doubt helped along by Netflix\u2019s standout figures last night. Newsflash: Britain isn\u2019t the only country experiencing higher inflation. Consumer prices in the US rose by 1.5% annually in September, figures show, up from 1.1% in August. As in the UK, fuel prices were a major factor, increasing by 5.8%. On a monthly basis, prices rose by 0.3%, broadly in line with expectations. Core inflation, which strips out food and energy costs, came in at 2.2%. That\u2019s down from 2.3% and a little weaker than Wall Street expected. Phil Aldrick of the Times also fears that inflation will jump as the increase in prices charged by producers (factory gate prices) hits consumers. The chancellor, Philip Hammond, could potentially help some of those hurt by inflation by changing the way in-work benefits are uprated. The BBC\u2019s Kamal Ahmed has also written about how poorer families, including those in work, will suffer from higher inflation [as flagged earlier]. He writes: As Mark Carney, the Governor of the Bank of England, made clear on Friday, the first to feel the impact of a rise in inflation - at its most basic an increase in the price of essentials like food and fuel - are the \u201cjust managing classes\u201d who spend a high proportion of their income on daily staples. These are people in work but who feel very far from comfortably off. Add to that the benefits freeze announced by the government last year, and the toxicity of even relatively low levels of inflation becomes clear. Before the freeze, those on working age benefits or tax credits would be shielded to an extent from inflation by an automatic increase in benefits in line with the headline figure. With that connection broken, real incomes for those on benefits and in work will be more adversely affected. As the Institute for Fiscal Studies said this morning: \u201cThis policy [the benefits freeze] represented a significant takeaway from a large number of working age households. \u201cBut it also represented a shifting of risk from the government to benefit recipients. \u201cPreviously, higher inflation was a risk to the public finances, increasing cash spending on benefits. \u201cNow the risk is borne by low-income households: unless policy changes, higher inflation will reduce their real incomes.\u201d As we mentioned earlier, the Office for National Statistics has played down suggestions that the fall in the pound is fuelling the jump in inflation. Mike Prestwood, head of inflation at the ONS, said this morning that: \u201cThere is no explicit evidence the lower pound is pushing up the prices of everyday consumer goods.\u201d That\u2019s probably because some UK firms used currency hedges to protect themselves against the pound dropping, and because companies are swallowing higher costs where they can. Our economics editor, Larry Elliott, predicts that the Bank of England won\u2019t be spooked into tightening monetary policy: Competition in the high street could spare consumers from some of the effects of the weak pound. But if businesses find they are operating with lower profit margins, they will seek to save money by tightly controlling wages. One way or another, living standards are going to be squeezed. Will higher inflation lead to the Bank of England raising interest rates? Almost certainly not. Threadneedle Street has already said it is prepared to accept a temporary overshoot of the 2% inflation target, rather than risk damaging the economy\u2019s growth prospects. Only if higher inflation looks to be becoming embedded will the Bank move. For the moment, that does not appear to be much of a risk. Here\u2019s his analysis: The jump in inflation will cost poorer households around \u00a3100 each, because their benefits will not rise in line with CPI. That\u2019s the grim warning from the Institute for Fiscal Studies. And it\u2019s all because George Osborne recently froze some benefits, breaking the traditional peg with inflation. The IFS explains: In the July 2015 Budget the Government announced that, as part of its attempt to cut annual social security spending by \u00a312 billion, most working-age benefit and tax credit rates would be frozen in cash terms until March 2020. This policy represented a significant takeaway from a large number of working age households. But it also represented a shifting of risk from the Government to benefit recipients. Previously, higher inflation was a risk to the public finances, increasing cash spending on benefits. Now the risk is borne by low-income households: unless policy changes higher inflation will reduce their real incomes. The government had expected this change to cost households \u00a3260 per year each. But with inflation higher than forecast, the real cost has jumped to \u00a3360. And remember, benefits such as tax credits go to poor working people, to help them achieve a minimum standard of living. The IFS concludes: While it is perfectly reasonable to argue \u2013 as the 2015 Conservative Party manifesto did \u2013 that the working age benefit system should be made less generous over this parliament, it is hard to see why the appropriate size of cut should be arbitrarily determined by the impact of movements in sterling on prices. The Treasury has taken a break from falling out with pro-Brexit government ministers, and sent over a response to today\u2019s inflation report. However, it doesn\u2019t really address the fact that consumer prices jumped by 1% in the last year. A spokesperson says: The economy is fundamentally strong, with a record number of people in employment. The government stands ready to support the adjustment to a new relationship with the European Union and is committed to building an economy that works for all.\u201d Hopefully they didn\u2019t send the wrong email out... We\u2019ll find out tomorrow morning, after the unemployment report is released.... Sterling is still rallying today, following the news that inflation jumped by more than expected last month. The pound has gained more than one cent to $1.229, the highest since last Wednesday. Traders ponder whether growth is going to suffer, and if the Bank of England will really \u2018look through\u2019 (ignore) the inflationary impact of the Brexit vote. Kallum Pickering of Berenberg Bank reckons that the Bank will resist cutting interest rates to new record lows in November. The bigger-than-expected drop in sterling has done a lot of the work for the Bank of England and with resilient economic performance since the Brexit vote, we expect the BoE to stay on hold for now, easing monetary policy again only if economic conditions deteriorate. Here\u2019s a link to the inflation report: ONS: UK consumer price inflation: Sept 2016 Andrew Sentance, senior economic adviser at PwC (and former Bank of England policymaker) also predicts inflation is going to jump over the 2% target. And that \u2018inflationary iceberg\u2019 is going to hit growth in 2017, he fears:. \u201cInflation has risen to 1.0 percent this month, as expected. Higher import prices are feeding through to consumers because of the fall in sterling since the EU referendum vote. This latest rise, however, is just the tip of the inflationary iceberg which is coming our way. Since the beginning of September, sterling has fallen a further 8 percent or so against the euro and the dollar. This will continue to push up inflation in the months ahead. A stronger oil price will add further to price rises for energy and transport. \u201cOver the course of next year, we should expect inflation to rise above the Bank of England\u2019s 2 percent target. This will squeeze household spending power and add to the slowdown in the economy in 2017. PwC is forecasting a slowdown in growth to around 1% next year, with investment cutbacks reinforcing the slowdown in consumer spending.\u201d We also have evidence that UK manufacturers are pushing up their prices, following the slide in sterling. Factory gate prices (what companies charge for their goods) rose by 1.2% in September, the highest annual rise in three years. And input prices (the cost of raw materials) jumped by 7.2% year-on-year That suggests that consumers will face higher prices when these goods reach the shops, says Shilen Shah, Bond Strategist at Investec Wealth &amp; Investment: \u201cThe September inflation print is a confirmation that the long period of low inflation is over, with year-on-year CPI increasing to 1% from 0.6% in August. The combination of higher input prices -rising 7.2% in September and a higher oil price is likely to put some upward pressure on future inflation prints in the coming months. Julien Lafargue, the head of equities strategy at JP Morgan Private Bank, isn\u2019t convinced that the weak pound is driving up inflation. Not yet, anyway ... We are seeing more and more signs that inflation is picking up in the UK, with today\u2019s release pointing to the highest year-on-year increase in consumer prices since November 2014. At this point though, this seems more linked to base effects from commodity prices, a continued decline in the pace of food deflation and higher prices in restaurant and hotels following a weak August, rather than the post-referendum drop in the pound. As such, we would expect inflation to increase further going forward, as the depreciation in the UK\u2019s currency will likely put additional upward pressure on prices over time. Tom Stevenson, an investment director at Fidelity International, blames the weak pound for driving up inflation: Inflation jumped to 1% in September, its highest level since late 2014. The significant leap in the CPI from August has primarily been as a result of the plummeting pound, which has pushed up fuel prices. Today\u2019s report shows that petrol prices jumped by 1.2p per litre between August and September. Lots of expert reaction to today\u2019s inflation numbers is flooding in. Nick Dixon, the investment director at pensions group Aegon, reckons inflation will soar above the 2% target soon. The renewed slide in the pound following \u2018hard Brexit\u2019 noise will flow through to higher inflation, potentially exceeding 3% during 2017. At 1%, inflation is only half the level targeted by the Bank of England. But several economists warn that prices are heading upwards. World First\u2019s Jeremy Cook predicts more inflationary pain in early 2017: Reuters\u2019 Jamie McGeever thinks the weak pound and higher energy prices will keep pushing the CPI up: Joel Hills of ITV also blames the weak pound: George Eaton of the New Statesman points out that families relying on welfare payments will suffer: There\u2019s been a lot of talk about food prices being pushed up by the weak pound. But ... prices actually fell by 0.3% month on month in September. The ONS said this fall was driven by \u201csugar, jam, syrups, chocolate and confectionery, oils and fats, meat, and bread and cereals\u201d. But fruit and vegetable prices rose, including potatoes. Clothes prices went up by 6% in September on the previous month. That\u2019s a larger move than usual, although clothing prices normally rise in September as shops bring in autumn ranges. So does that mean the Brexit vote is forcing prices up? Possibly not. The Office for National Statistics suggests that UK companies are protected from the slump in the pound. First, a rise in clothing prices in September is in line with normal trends and the comparatively large increase this year follows a sustained fall in prices between March and July, with a relatively small increase into August. Second, while the depreciation in sterling is likely to increase the cost of importing goods and outsourcing production, there are reports of businesses having measures in place to protect against exchange rate changes in the short term. Other reasons why inflation jumped: Restaurant and hotel prices increased by 0.7% between August and September. Miscellaneous goods and services prices rose by 0.5% between August and September, driven by \u201ccertain appliances and products for personal care\u201d. Overall prices for housing, water, electricity, gas and other fuels went up by 0.1% between August and September. The retail price index, a wider measures of inflation that includes housing costs, has also risen. RPI hit an annual rate of 2% last month, up from 1.8% in August. This jump in inflation is going to hit people in the pocket. Average earnings are only rising by 2.1% per year, according to the latest data. With inflation at 1%, real wages would only grow by 1.1%. This chart shows how the cost of living is rising at the fastest rate since late 2014. On a monthly basis, consumer prices rose by 0.2% in September. The Office for National Statistics says there is no \u2018explicit evidence\u2019 that the fall in the pound is pushing consumer prices higher (more on that shortly...) UK inflation was driven up by rising prices for clothing, overnight hotel stays and motor fuels, says the Office for National Statistics. These upward pressures were partially offset by a fall in air fares and food prices, the ONS adds. Breaking: The UK consumer price index jumped to 1% in September, higher than the City expected! That\u2019s the highest inflation rate since November 2014, and sharply up on August\u2019s figure of 0.6%. More to follow ... Today\u2019s inflation report will only be a foretaste of the full impact of the weaker pound, says the economist Rupert Seggins: Less than 30 minutes until we get the latest UK inflation report! Reminder: we\u2019re expecting the cost of living to have jumped by 0.9% in September, a near two-year high. Jeremy Cook of currency exchange company World First explains how energy costs are pushing consumer prices higher: The main piece of UK news this morning is the latest run of inflation data that is set to carry higher to as much as 0.9% on the year. That would be the highest since November 2014, when oil prices were still up near $90 a barrel. A year ago, oil prices were about 20% cheaper than they are now and therefore we have base effects there to take into account, but both consumer and producer price inflation measures seem to be showing the effects of the weaker pound. Inflation expectations for the medium term \u2013 five years away \u2013 have surged in recent weeks and are currently 3.4%; anything that starts with a four and we can expect [that] calls for the Bank of England to hike rates will increase, needlessly in our opinion. The pound has rallied a little this morning, and is currently up 0.5% at $1.225. However... that still means sterling is worth 21% than a year ago (when it traded at $1.55). That\u2019s a remarkable drop, only challenged by emerging market currencies like Malawi\u2019s Kwacha, or the battered Venezuelan boliva. Hiring fell sharply in London after the EU referendum, as financial and construction companies hunkered down, according to recruiter Hays. It reported a 10% drop in fees in the UK and Ireland in the previous quarter, as \u201ccontinued concerns about the economic outlook impacted client and candidate confidence\u201d. Budget airline Ryanair was a strong supporter of the remain campaign and even offered cheap flights to expats who wanted to fly back and vote in the EU referendum. That didn\u2019t swing the result, though. And this morning, the company said the slump in sterling would hit its earnings. Ryanair now expects full-year profit growth of 7%, down from 12% earlier this year. Gerald Lyons, a former chief economic adviser to (Burberry model) Boris Johnson, also expects UK inflation to rise this morning. The weak pound has been a boon to fashion group Burberry. It has reported a 30% jump in sales of luxury goods in the UK in the past six months, as the fall of sterling lured more foreign visitors to Britain. However, the Burberry chief executive, Christopher Bailey, warned that the \u201cexternal environment\u201d remains challenging. Underlying retail sales fell by 2%, while underlying wholesale revenues dropped by 14%. And the City isn\u2019t happy; Burberry shares have slumped by 7% in early trading. Kathleen Brooks of City Index suspects that UK inflation may have jumped by more than the City consensus of 0.9%. She says: We believe that the risks are to the upside, as the large decline in the pound starts to hit consumers in the pocket ... This is the worst time for inflation to rear its head \u2013 just as Brexit concerns dim the economic outlook. The slump in the pound has caused real pain in Britain\u2019s food markets, as well as the financial markets. The BBC\u2019s Colletta Smith reports that traders at Manchester\u2019s New Smithfield Wholesale Market have been hit hard by weaker sterling, putting pressure on them to raise prises. Today\u2019s UK inflation report will be very closely watched in the City. If consumer prices jumped sharply in September, the Bank of England could be deterred from cutting interest rates at its next meeting in early November. That could help the pound rally (although not if traders worry about the health of the economy). But higher inflation will worry bond traders. Yesterday, the value of some UK government debt (gilts) hit the lowest level since the EU referendum in June, suggesting that investors are worried about the UK\u2019s economic prospects. Naeem Aslam, the chief market analyst at Think Markets UK, explains: Fears that inflation may be rising at a much faster pace is something that is making the headlines over and over again. This is especially more relevant when we focus on the UK\u2019s economy, where the sudden fall in the currency is making an impact on the UK gilt market. What investors are most worried about is how quickly these UK gilt yields are rising, and this is eroding any remaining confidence among investors. Good morning. After weeks of headlines about the tumbling pound, we\u2019re about to discover what impact it has had on families and businesses. September\u2019s inflation report, due at 9.30am, is expected to show that prices jumped last month, as the cost of imports was driven up by weaker sterling. Economists believe the consumer price index (CPI) could rise as high as 0.9%, from 0.6% in August. That would drive up the cost of living and eat into real wages. The recent rise in the oil price is also a factor, pushing up the cost of petrol at the pumps. Howard Archer, the chief UK and European economist at IHS Markit, sets the scene: Inflation is expected to have been lifted in September by higher petrol prices and by some services companies and manufacturers raising their prices, as a consequence of increased input costs resulting from sterling\u2019s overall substantial weakening. Last week\u2019s row between Tesco and Unilever (over proposed price rises for Marmite, Pot Noodle, Lynx deodorant etc) has highlighted the pressures cause by sterling\u2019s tumble to record lows since the Brexit vote. Some analysts fear that prices are going to keep rising until the end of next year, as the effect of the cheaper pound feeds through to the UK economy. The Office for National Statistics will also release new \u201cproducer prices\u201d figures at 9.30am, showing how much British firms are paying for raw materials. That could reveal a chunky rise. Also coming up today ... The latest US inflation report is released at 1.30pm BST (8.30am EDT). Economists expect the CPI to rise to 1.5% from 1.1%, putting more pressure on the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates this year. And we get corporate results from fashion chain Burberry, budget airline Ryanair and recruitment group Hays. They should all have something to say about business conditions since the Brexit vote.",

                "bodyText":"Time for a recap, after a very busy few hours. Britain\u2019s economy has defied fears that it would be dragged into an immediate recession following the EU referendum. The first official healthcheck of growth in the last quarter showed that GDP rose by 0.5% between July and September. That\u2019s slower than the 0.7% recorded in April-June but faster than expected. The services sector provided all the expansion, though, with growth of 0.8%. Manufacturing, construction and agriculture all shrank, showing that the UK economy remains unbalanced. Interestingly, film and production provided a major boost to growth. That suggests Britain is benefitting from the new wave of streaming services: Chancellor Philip Hammond welcomed the news, saying it shows the UK economy is resilient as it begins Brexit negotiations. But a series of economists have warned that growth will slow further in 2017. Higher inflation will eat into real wages too. In another boost, Nissan has announced new investment plans for its Sunderland plant. The move guarantees 7,000 jobs, and eases concerns that production could be moved to France. Prime minister Theresa May says it\u2019s a vote of confidence in the UK. But what has the government offered Nissan? Ministers are refusing to give details, but that hasn\u2019t stopped the wider car industry seeking guarantees against damage from Brexit. Labour have warned the government against carving up deals behind closed doors, and instead provide a comprehensive plan for Brexit. And over in Brussels, Wallonia has dropped its opposition to Europe\u2019s new trade deal with Canada. That\u2019s probably all for today, unless anything else major happens. I\u2019ll be back tomorrow with more live coverage, including growth figures for France and the US. Thanks for reading and commenting. GW Greg Clarke, the UK business secretary, isn\u2019t revealing what the government has promised to Nissan. According to my colleague Peter Walker, Clarke just waffled through half a dozen questions on the World At One, despite being repeatedly asked if Nissan has been given a deal. The best we got out of Clarke is this nugget: There\u2019s no question of financial compensation over tariffs, because we\u2019ve said that what is necessary is that we are going to maintain the competitiveness of the sector. But otherwise, it was like a rerun of Just A Minute (but without the humour). Keep an eye on Politics Live for more reaction: Bang on cue.... Britain\u2019s car industry is demanding assurance that it will be protected from any trade tariffs or migration curbs following the UK\u2019s exit from the EU. Mike Hawes, chief executive of the Society for Motor Manufacturers and Traders, says: \u201cToday\u2019s announcement is good news for UK Automotive and jobs, confirming Britain as a leader in automotive production. To secure this position, however, we need government to provide public assurance to investors that our advantages will be maintained \u2013 namely, a competitive business environment, the ability to recruit talent from abroad and the continuation of all the benefits of the single market as we leave the EU.\u201d Carlos Ghosn is clutching a piece of paper, promising help from the government if Britain\u2019s exit from the EU hurts Nissan. So says Reuters, which reports: Britain has given Nissan a written commitment of extra support in the event that Brexit reduces the competitiveness of its Sunderland plant, in return for new production investments by the Japanese carmaker, a source with knowledge of the matter told Reuters. In addition to unconditional investment aid, Britain pledged in a letter to offer further relief if the terms of Britain\u2019s European Union exit ended up harming the plant\u2019s performance, the source said. That explains why Nisson has committed to making the Qashqai and the X-Trail in Sunderland. But surely other carmakers are going to want a similar deal, as Buzzfeed\u2019s Alberto Nardelli tweets: Our political reporter Jessica Elgot has full details of Labour\u2019s reaction to Nissan\u2019s announcement: John McDonnell, Labour\u2019s shadow chancellor, criticised the deal done with Nissan as a \u201cchaotic\u201d strategy. In a speech where he had criticised the government for appearing to prioritise financial services over manufacturing and small businesses, said there had been no public discussion of the deal hashed out for the car maker. \u201cWe know nothing about it,\u201d he said. \u201cAre they literally going to decide factory by factory which one gets support? We have to have a comprehensive plan, and this is chaos at the moment.\u201d \u201cWe are trying to get a consensus and heal the divisions the referendum brought and we cannot do that with secret deals behind closed doors. It will divide our country once more. The first deal looked like it would be protecting financial services, paid for by others. And now with Nissan, other manufacturers are saying what are we going to get? We have to have a comprehensive plan. What we need is more openness and transparency and accountability.\u201d The Unite union are understandably delighted that the 7,000 Nissan jobs in Sunderland are safe, along with thousands more in the supply chain. Unite assistant general secretary Tony Burke says it recognises the UK car industry\u2019s world-leading status. \u201cNissan\u2019s decision is a massive vote of confidence in the skills and expertise of a world-class workforce and testament to their hard work which has made the Sunderland plant one of the most productive in the Nissan family. Burke says the government must now secure tariff-free access to the single market, to help all UK car markets. Here\u2019s Labour MP Matthew Pennycook on the Nissan announcement: More news! The deadlock in Belgium that was preventing the EU signing a trade deal with Canada has been broken! Prime Minister Charles Michel has declared that \u201can agreement\u201d has been reached with the French-speaking communities in Wallonia who sensationally blocked the deal last week. Cecilia Malmstr\u00f6m, the Eu trade commissioner, says it\u2019s an important breakthrough, that could mean the deal can now be signed. Unfortunately, Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau has already cancelled his trip to Brussels to sign the deal. (he was due to land today). And he needn\u2019t pack his suitcase just yet. European Council chief Donald Tusk says he won\u2019t be in touch until all the paperwork is definitely ready. Here\u2019s our news story about Nissan\u2019s new commitment to Sunderland: John McDonnell, Labour\u2019s shadow chancellor, isn\u2019t impressed that Nissan have apparently cut a deal to stay in Sunderland. Sky\u2019s Faisal Islam has the details: Nissan\u2019s surprise announcement came just as McDonnell was giving a speech about the economy, which is rather bad luck for Labour (unless the dark arts of political spin are in play...). Our Politics Live blog has been tracking it though: Prime minister Theresa May says Nissan has given Britain a \u201cvote of confidence\u201d, but she doesn\u2019t reveal what promises she has given the carmaker..... Conservative MP Michael Fabricant is rather pleased by Nissan\u2019s announcement: It\u2019s official! The next Qashqai will indeed be build in Sunderland, despite the uncertainty over Britain\u2019s future. Nissan is also pledging to build its next 4x4 X-Trail vehicle there too. And the company also confirms that Theresa May\u2019s government has given a \u2018commitment\u2019 that the plant\u2019s competitiveness won\u2019t be damaged by Brexit. Here\u2019s the official statement: Nissan Motor Company Ltd. today announced, following its Executive Committee meeting, that it will produce the next Qashqai and will add production of the next X-Trail model at its Sunderland, U.K. Plant. Nissan\u2019s decision follows the U.K. government\u2019s commitment to ensure that the Sunderland plant remains competitive. As a result, Nissan will increase its investment in Sunderland, securing and sustaining the jobs of more than 7,000 workers at the plant. \u201cI am pleased to announce that Nissan will continue to invest in Sunderland. Our employees there continue to make the plant a globally competitive powerhouse, producing high-quality, high-value products every day,\u201d said Carlos Ghosn, Chairman and CEO of Nissan. \u201cThe support and assurances of the U.K. government enabled us to decide that the next-generation Qashqai and X-Trail will be produced at Sunderland. I welcome British Prime Minister Theresa May\u2019s commitment to the automotive industry in Britain and to the development of an overall industrial strategy.\u201d Nissan\u2019s Sunderland plant opened in 1986 and has produced almost 9 million cars since. One in three British cars are produced in Sunderland, which is the UK\u2019s largest car plant of all time. In addition, 80% of production from Sunderland is exported to over 130 international markets. More than 2 million Qashqai\u2019s have been built in Sunderland in less than 10 years. In addition to the 7,000 direct employees at Sunderland, the plant supports a further 28,000 British automotive supply chain jobs. To date, Nissan has invested more than \u00a33.7 billion in Sunderland. Sunderland voted decisively to leave the EU back in June, by 61% to 39%. So Brexit voters may feel vindicated by Nissan\u2019s decision not to move Qashqai production abroad. Paul Brand of ITV tweets: Downing Street will be very pleased by Nissan\u2019s move, says City AM editor Christian May. Has Nissan managed to get the UK government to promise compensation, if the EU imposes tax barriers on car imports after Brexit? CEO Carlos Ghosn was pretty clear that he wanted protection from any new tariffs, once Britain leaves the European Union. After meeting Theresa May on October 14, Ghosn said: If there are tax barriers being established on cars, you have to have a commitment for car-makers who export to Europe that there is some kind of compensation. The BBC\u2019s Simon Jack says that Nissan has received \u201csupport and assurances\u201d from Theresa May\u2019s government, encouraging it to build the new Qashqai in Sunderland. The FT\u2019s Peter Campbell predicts an official announcement soon: Reuters are reporting that Nissan, the Japanese carmaker, has decided that it will build its next Qashqai SUV in Sunderland. That would be a significant boost for the region, and one of the first major investment decisions since June. The Nissan plant at Sunderland employs around 7,000 people, and is Britain\u2019s biggest car factory. Last week Nissan\u2019s chief executive Carlos Ghosn met prime minister Theresa May, and warned that his company could stop investing at Sunderland unless it was protected from any adverse impact from the Brexit vote. We\u2019ve called Nissan for comment..... Today\u2019s growth report shows that the \u201cBrexit bogeyman\u201d hasn\u2019t yet been as scary as initially feared, says Nancy Curtin, Chief Investment Officer at Close Brothers Asset Management. She writes: Any lingering concerns over an immediate collapse in growth in 2016 have been officially put to bed, with output continuing to grow in the first major assessment of domestic activity post-referendum. Supportive monetary policy has played a part, while the softer pound has kept factory orders ticking along. These, along with robust consumption, will be key levers of growth. But Curtin also predicts a slowdown next year: The quarter on quarter slowdown in the growth rate suggests Brexit uncertainty is having some bite, and it\u2019s likely the ambiguity around the UK\u2019s exit from the EU will take some of the steam out of the long-term growth rate, with anaemic growth likely to become status quo while Article 50 negotiations rumble on. I\u2019ve quickly truffled through today\u2019s GDP report to get some colour on how the UK economy performed 1) Services: The only sector to grow, by a punchy 0.8%. All four sub-sectors expanded (that\u2019s distribution, hotels and restaurants; transport, storage and communication; business services and finance; and government and other services). Growth was particularly strong in the \u201cmotion picture, video and TV programme production, sound recording and music publishing activities, and computer programming industries\u201d, apparent.y 2) Industrial production: It suffered a 0.4% contraction. That\u2019s mainly because manufacturing output shrank by a whole 1%. Energy supply fell by 3.6%, water and waste management dropped by 0.2%, while mining and quarrying increased by 5.2% 3) Construction: Output fell by 1.4%, which is the biggest decline since 2012. That\u2019s partly because construction of new housing fell, for the first time in a year. 4) Agriculture: Philip Hammond has also told the BBC that the UK economy is looking strong, as the EU exit talks loom: TUC general secretary Frances O\u2019Grady says the government needs to do more to help UK manufacturing (which contracted by 1% after the Brexit vote): \u201cWe can\u2019t yet say what impact Brexit will have on our economy, but these figures show there\u2019s no room for complacency. British manufacturing is still struggling, and now faces real uncertainty following the vote to leave the EU. \u201cThe government must use next month\u2019s Autumn Statement to boost Britain\u2019s jobs and wages. This means investing in infrastructure like roads, rail and homes, and raising the national minimum wage.\u201d Today\u2019s GDP report is an important measure of the health of Britain\u2019s economy after June\u2019s historic referendum. But several economists say the real test of the Brexit vote will come in 2017, not today. Here\u2019s PwC\u2019s Andrew Sentance: Geoffrey Yu, head of UK Investment Office at UBS Wealth Management, predicts that growth will keep slowing: Anecdotal evidence supports the view that we\u2019re yet to see any meaningful damage as a result of the Brexit vote, at least in the short-term. \u201cOf course, we should not overlook the lingering sense of uncertainty. Though the economy has fared better than initially feared, we expect that economic growth will slow down relative to the early part of this year. Jeremy Cook, chief economist at the international payments company World First, says we\u2019ll have a better picture once Theresa May has triggered article 50: \u201cWe have called the UK consumer a hardy beast in the past and in Q3 the beast was back. The services sector singlehandedly drove growth to a 15th consecutive positive quarter and while the \u2018little evidence of a pronounced effect\u2019 from the Brexit vote is being seen yet, we think that it will be as gradually obvious as the year comes to an end. The beast will tire as inflation fires arrows at its increasingly weakening hide.\u201d Thomas Laskey of Aberdeen Asset Management argues that the Bank of England should get some credit for today\u2019s growth report: \u201cThe data shows that the UK economy fared well in the aftermath of the EU referendum. It confirms what most investors thought: that sentiment bounced back after the initial shock of the result. Growth was fairly strong, at least in part because the Bank of England restarted its bond buying programme and the fact that changes to investment plans take time to play out. But he predicts slower growth next year: \u201cThe outlooks for growth is pretty uncertain. Brexit has the potential to be extremely costly to the UK and the country could be poorer as a result. We\u2019ve already seen this reflected in sterling\u2019s dramatic drop. Growth will probably slow as import costs increase and people\u2019s incomes fall as inflation rises. We are not out of the woods yet by any means.\u201d You can see the GDP report online, here: Gross Domestic Product, preliminary estimate: July to Sept 2016 Chancellor Philip Hammond says today\u2019s report shows that the UK economy is resilient, and \u2018well-placed\u2019 to deal with the challenges and opportunities created by the EU referendum. We are moving into a period of negotiations with the EU and we are determined to get the very best deal for households and businesses. The economy will need to adjust to a new relationship with the EU, but we are well-placed to deal with the challenges and take advantage of opportunities ahead.\u201d Anyone remember George Osborne\u2019s plan to rebalance the economy and create a March of the Makers? Five year\u2019s later, Britain is as dependent on service sector growth as ever: Britain\u2019s economy has now grown for 15 quarters in a row, and is 8.2% higher than the pre-economic downturn peak in early 2008. Today\u2019s report shows that Britain has not suffered a Brexit shock, according to Joe Grice, head of the Office for National Statistics. Grice says: There is little evidence of a pronounced effect in the immediate aftermath of the vote\u201d The pound has rallied a little, to $1.225, as traders welcome the GDP report. Britain\u2019s service sector, which makes up three quarters of the economy, is the only part which grew in the last three months. Service sector output grew by 0.8% in July-September. Construction shrank by 1.4% Agriculture shrank bu 0.7% Industrial production shrank by 0.4% And manufacturing (part of production) shrank by 1% At first glance, this report suggests that the UK economy has shrugged off the immediate shock of the EU referendum. It has grown faster than predicted in the gloomier forecasts ahead of June\u2019s vote. Remember, the Treasury said the economy would shrink by 0.1% after a Brexit vote. On an annual basis, the UK economy grew by 2.3% during the last quarter. Again, that\u2019s stronger than expected. HERE WE GO! Britain\u2019s economy grew by 0.5% in the three months after the Brexit vote. That\u2019s down from 0.7% in the second quarter of 2016, showing that growth has slowed. But it\u2019s also stronger than the 0.3% which economists has expected. More to follow! The pound has risen back to $1.224... Tension is building, with just four minutes until we learn how the UK economy performed after the EU referendum.... Back in April, the Treasury claimed that the economy would shrink by 0.1% for four quarters in a row, if Britain voted to leave the EU. Today\u2019s GDP report is the first test of that assessment.... [UPDATE: This forecast may have assumed Britain had triggered Article 50 immediately after the referendum]. A flash of good news from Madrid: the Spanish unemployment rate hit its lowest level since 2009 in the last quarter. But it\u2019s still 18.9%, despite a surge in summer hiring to handle the tourist trade. Economist Rupert Seggins has tweeted a nice graph, showing how uncertainty spiked after the referendum,but has been dropping to less jittery levels since. Today\u2019s Q3 growth report is only \u2018preliminary\u2019, as it\u2019s mainly based on data from July and August. That makes it harder to predict, says Jeremy Cook of World First: Surveys are suggesting a number between 0.1% and 0.4% with consensus estimates looking for a figure of around 0.3% but this is the muddiest figure we will have seen in a while given the collapse in expectations in July and the rebound in August. Manufacturing may be optimistic but services are not sharing in that joy. The pound has dropped by almost half a cent this morning, to $1.2202, as traders await the UK GDP report. Just 45 minutes until we get the UK GDP report for the last quarter! Bloomberg\u2019s Maxime Sbaihi predicts it will get a mixed reception: Although the City consensus is that UK growth fell to 0.3% in the last quarter, some forecasts are plumping for a rosier +0.4%. Ross Finley of Reuters has the details: HSBC are in the camp predicting that UK growth dipped to 0.3% in the last three months. But they aren\u2019t ruling out a higher figure, saying: \u201cThe U.K. economy has held up in Q3, defying expectations of a pronounced uncertainty-driven slowdown following the referendum. Given fairly robust indicators, our forecast is for growth of 0.3% qoq, with risks to the upside.\u201d Christine Lagarde, the head of the International Monetary Fund, has warned that the uncertainty over Brexit is bad for the economy. Speaking on Bloomberg, Lagarde says firms want to know whether London-based banks will lose their rights to \u2018passport\u2019 services across the EU single market. Britain\u2019s future trade deals are another question mark, making it harder for companies to invest and create jobs. This uncertainty is \u201cnot healthy\u201d, says Lagarde. But she does welcome the government\u2019s commitment to trigger article 50 by the end of March 2017. One thing we know now is the timetable. So for the next two and a half years nothing changes, but everything is changed. Don\u2019t get too excited if today\u2019s GDP report shows that the economy is still growing, says Kathleen Brooks, research director at City Index. She predicts that consumer spending will provide the bulk of the growth in the last quarter, as industry and construction struggles over the summer Industrial production has fallen sharply in recent months; it fell by 0.4% in August. Construction is facing a steeper decline, the latest Office for National Statistics data on construction output has fallen 2% since June. In contrast, the service sector PMI bounced back after a sharp decline in service sector sentiment in July. We expect this pattern to be repeated in the Q3 GDP report. And Brooks also fears that 2017 will be tough, as higher inflation eats into real wages. The Bank of England has slashed its growth forecasts for 2017 to a mere 0.8%, compared with 2.2% for 2016. Consultancy firm PWC is forecasting a gloomier outcome at 0.6% for 2017. The biggest risk for UK growth is a sharp slowdown in business investment that could become more pronounced in the coming months, once the UK government has triggered Article 50. If the UK looks set to lose its access to the single market, then we may see the consumer show signs of stress, which could knock the UK economy seriously off course, and potentially plunge us into recession. Today\u2019s GDP figures are the most eagerly awaited since the British economy returned to growth four years ago. Eric Lascelles, chief economist at RBC Global Asset Management, says. \u201cThis is an extremely high stakes report \u2013 the British economy appears to have been surprisingly resilient to the Brexit upset. \u201cTo be clear, some economic damage is still expected, if not of a recession-inducing magnitude.\u201d That\u2019s via Bloomberg, who reckon the report will \u201cswing the mood of consumers and provide a tool for politicians pushing their view on how tough to be when it comes to actually removing the U.K. from the EU\u201d. Good morning. We\u2019re about to find out how well, or badly, Britain\u2019s economy fared in the immediate aftermath of June\u2019s historic vote to quit the European Union. At 9.30am, the Office for National Statistics will whip the official growth figures for the third quarter of this year out of its hat. And we\u2019re expecting to learn that the economy slowed sharply in the July to September quarter. But, GDP probably didn\u2019t go into reverse, despite fears that a Brexit vote would trigger an immediate recession. Economists predict that the quarterly growth rate probably slowed to around 0.3%, or perhaps 0.4%, down from a healthier 0.7% in the April-June quarter. That would mean that Britain\u2019s economy has been growing for 15th consecutive quarters. The breakdown of the GDP report will also show how the service sector, manufacturers and construction firms all fared during the last quarter. The figures are likely to shift the pound, and move the stock markets, especially if growth is markedly stronger or weaker than the City expects. Other data released since June has suggested that the economy has taken the uncertainty pretty well, with the unemployment rate sticking at 4.9% and consumer spending resilient. As RBC Capital Markets put it: It does seem that the impact of the referendum won\u2019t have been as immediate as we and many others had initially expected. But, the true impact of Brexit will be seen over years, of course, not months, as Robin Bew of the Economist Intelligence Unit tweets: GDP is obviously the main event. But we\u2019ll also keep an eye on financial results from Barclays and Deutsche Bank, plus cider maker C&amp;C, retailer Debenhams and telecoms group BT.",
