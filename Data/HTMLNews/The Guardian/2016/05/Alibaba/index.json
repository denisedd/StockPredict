                "bodyText":"An anti-counterfeiting group said on Friday it was suspending Alibaba\u2019s membership following an uproar by some companies that view the Chinese e-commerce giant as the world\u2019s largest marketplace for fakes. The International Anti-Counterfeiting Coalition also told members it had failed to inform the board of directors about conflicts of interest involving the group\u2019s president, Robert Barchiesi. Earlier it was reported Barchiesi had stock in Alibaba, had close ties to an Alibaba executive and had used family members to help run the coalition. The coalition, in a letter to members sent after the report came out, said conflicts were not disclosed to the board \u201cbecause of a weakness in our corporate governance procedures.\u201d It said the failure was not because of \u201cinaction on Bob\u2019s part,\u201d referring to Barchiesi. The coalition said it is hiring an independent firm to review its corporate governance policies. In its letter, the board said as a result of members\u2019 concerns, it was suspending a new class of membership under which Alibaba had recently joined. The move would affect two other companies that signed up under the new rules. Jennifer Kuperman, Alibaba\u2019s head of international corporate affairs, said companies such as Alibaba were important for solving the problem of counterfeiting. \u201cWhether or not we are a member of the IACC, we will continue our productive and results-oriented relationships with brands, governments and all industry partners,\u201d she said.

In recent weeks Gucci America, Michael Kors and Tiffany have quit the Washington DC-based coalition, which has more than 250 members. Several ties between the group\u2019s president and Alibaba have been found: Barchiesi has owned Alibaba stock since its 2014 listing in New York. The IACC said the holdings represent \u201ca small percentage of his investment portfolio.\u201d Matthew Bassiur, who took over as vice president of global intellectual property enforcement at Alibaba in January, hired Barchiesi\u2019s son, Robert Barchiesi II, to work at Apple in 2011.

Kuperman said Bassiur\u2019s expertise would help the company \u201cfurther instill trust in our marketplaces\u201d. \u201cWe are highly confident in his abilities and proud to have him at Alibaba in this critical global role,\u201d she said.
