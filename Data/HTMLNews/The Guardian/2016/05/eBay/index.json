                "bodyText":"The alternative, cheaper scheme to expand Heathrow airport should be put back on the table if the government gives the go-ahead for a new runway, according to the boss of British Airways\u2019 owner. Willie Walsh, the chief executive of IAG, whose airlines, including BA, operate the majority of services at Heathrow, said he did not expect a decision soon \u2013 but the \u201cprohibitive costs\u201d meant ministers should not be bound to the airport\u2019s own proposals for a third, north-west runway. The Airports Commission gave a clear recommendation in 2015 to go ahead with Heathrow\u2019s official scheme rather than the independent hub proposal, which would double the length of the existing northern runway to allow landing and takeoff on the same strip. However, the Heathrow hub was shortlisted as a viable proposition in the commission\u2019s interim report alongside a second runway at Gatwick, an option that the government said it is still considering.

Walsh warned bluntly on Gatwick: \u201cI don\u2019t think the business case exists.\u201d He said most airlines only chose to operate at Gatwick if they could not get in to Heathrow, particularly on business routes. The IAG chief executive was speaking aboard British Airways\u2019 inaugural flight from Heathrow to San Jose in California \u2013 the first direct link from Europe to the airport closest to the Silicon Valley HQs of Apple, eBay, Google and other tech companies. \u2018I\u2019m not leaving IAG.
