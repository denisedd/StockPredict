                "bodyText":"The alternative, cheaper scheme to expand Heathrow airport should be put back on the table if the government gives the go-ahead for a new runway, according to the boss of British Airways\u2019 owner. Willie Walsh, the chief executive of IAG, whose airlines, including BA, operate the majority of services at Heathrow, said he did not expect a decision soon \u2013 but the \u201cprohibitive costs\u201d meant ministers should not be bound to the airport\u2019s own proposals for a third, north-west runway. The Airports Commission gave a clear recommendation in 2015 to go ahead with Heathrow\u2019s official scheme rather than the independent hub proposal, which would double the length of the existing northern runway to allow landing and takeoff on the same strip. However, the Heathrow hub was shortlisted as a viable proposition in the commission\u2019s interim report alongside a second runway at Gatwick, an option that the government said it is still considering.

Walsh warned bluntly on Gatwick: \u201cI don\u2019t think the business case exists.\u201d He said most airlines only chose to operate at Gatwick if they could not get in to Heathrow, particularly on business routes.

The diagnosis came just before his son Raphael\u2019s second birthday and his wife was seven months pregnant with their daughter, Isabella. In true \u2018Danny Gabay spirit\u2019 he wasn\u2019t going to take it lying down and fought it, tooth and nail, with dignity and incredible bravery. He defeated all the odds and had four and a half good years after his initial operation. Sadly the tumour returned last summer and appeared again in the last couple of months when he finally succumbed to it.</p> <p><strong>Erik Britton</strong>, friend and Co-Director at Fathom Consulting commented: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\u201cHis passing is a great loss not only to his family, friends and colleagues, but also to the wider economics community. Fathom Consulting is committed to continuing Danny\u2019s great work and to commemorate his passing will be making a donation to the Marie Curie Hospice in Hampstead where he spent his last few days.\u201d</p> </blockquote> <p>His sister <strong>Dalia</strong> added: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\u201cDanny was a sharp, astutely intelligent, loving and caring individual with an outrageous sense of humour. He was also a huge inspiration to many. However, his greatest achievement in life, in fact, his pride and absolute joy, were his two beautiful children that he has left behind: Raphael and Isabella. My pledge to my brother was to always be there for his children and to never, ever let them forget what a wonderful father, husband, son, brother, uncle, nephew, cousin and friend he was to all who met him.\u201d</p> </blockquote> <p>Danny had an impressive career, advising government ministers in his early 20s before moving to the Bank of England, and later JP Morgan, before founding Fathom.</p> <p>Simon Kennedy of Bloomberg tweets:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/simonjkennedy/status/730758304356519936\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Saddened by the passing of Danny Gabay, a provocative and innovative economist.

                "bodyText":"That\u2019s all for tonight. Here\u2019s our latest news story on the Bank of England\u2019s Brexit intervention: Goodnight! GW Mark Carney dire warnings over Brexit didn\u2019t help the mood in the stock markets today. The FTSE 100 has just closed for the night, down 58 points or almost 1% at 6104. That\u2019s the lowest level in 5 weeks. Mining stocks are down, led by Anglo American (-6.8%), which usually shows worries about the global economy, along with tech firm ARM (-4%) and pharma group Shire (-3%). Chris Beauchamp, Senior Market Analyst at IG, says: The weakness in London has been broad-based, which should raise warning signs that this is not just a mining-related selloff. Instead, it seems investors are heading for the exits once again, threatening a further unwind of the gains made since mid-February. Over in New York, Apple\u2019s shares have slid below the $90 mark for the first time since 2014. That means it\u2019s worth slightly less than Alphabet (parent company of Google). Dean Turner, Economist at UBS Wealth Management, predicts that UK interest rates could be raised before Christmas -- if the Remain campaign wins next month. \u201cWith inflation marginally above the Bank\u2019s target two-years forward, our long-held belief that market expectations on interest rate hikes are far too pessimistic has been confirmed. Assuming the economy recovers in the second half, we expect to see a UK interest rate rise near the end of 2016 or soon after.\u201d Back to the Bank of England, and Joe Rundle, head of trading at ETX Capital, has a good take on Mark Carney\u2019s Brexit dilemma: The central problem facing the Bank in the event of a Brexit is to balance rising inflation from a weak pound with the downward pressures from a slump in demand. The assumption is that rates will have to rise in the event of a Brexit to stem a run on the pound, but Carney\u2019s suggesting something rather different. His point is sensible \u2013 we may not get the runaway inflation that many are expecting if the shock of Brexit means households stop spending. Moreover, a vote to leave would hit the euro hard, which would offset a decent amount of pound weakness. He also reckons correctly that the impact of lower rates on prices will not be felt instantly, meaning he has time on his hands to cut rates to temper the effects on aggregate demand that a Brexit shock would entail. Effectively he could cut rates immediately after the referendum to support demand, and then look to raise them afterwards if inflation does start to overshoot.\u201d Here\u2019s JP Morgan\u2019s Stephanie Flanders: This is from the BBC\u2019s business journalist Adam Parsons: We have some sad news to report. Danny Gabay, the respected City economist who founded Fathom Consulting, has passed away at the age of 47. Fathom have issued this statement: Danny, whose funeral took place yesterday, was diagnosed with a particularly aggressive form of brain cancer five and a half years ago. The diagnosis came just before his son Raphael\u2019s second birthday and his wife was seven months pregnant with their daughter, Isabella. In true \u2018Danny Gabay spirit\u2019 he wasn\u2019t going to take it lying down and fought it, tooth and nail, with dignity and incredible bravery. He defeated all the odds and had four and a half good years after his initial operation. Sadly the tumour returned last summer and appeared again in the last couple of months when he finally succumbed to it. Erik Britton, friend and Co-Director at Fathom Consulting commented: \u201cHis passing is a great loss not only to his family, friends and colleagues, but also to the wider economics community. Fathom Consulting is committed to continuing Danny\u2019s great work and to commemorate his passing will be making a donation to the Marie Curie Hospice in Hampstead where he spent his last few days.\u201d His sister Dalia added: \u201cDanny was a sharp, astutely intelligent, loving and caring individual with an outrageous sense of humour. He was also a huge inspiration to many. However, his greatest achievement in life, in fact, his pride and absolute joy, were his two beautiful children that he has left behind: Raphael and Isabella. My pledge to my brother was to always be there for his children and to never, ever let them forget what a wonderful father, husband, son, brother, uncle, nephew, cousin and friend he was to all who met him.\u201d Danny had an impressive career, advising government ministers in his early 20s before moving to the Bank of England, and later JP Morgan, before founding Fathom. Simon Kennedy of Bloomberg tweets: City grandee Lord Paul Myners, who was a government minister during the 2008 financial crisis, has welcomed Mark Carney\u2019s comments: Myners (a Remain supporter), says: \u201cThe Governor of the Bank of England could not be clearer: leaving the EU would lead to lower growth and a plummeting pound. It is a risk we cannot afford to take. \u201cThe evidence is now overwhelming that staying in Europe will mean more jobs, lower prices and more financial security for British families.\u201d Lord Lamont, who was chancellor of the UK from 1990 to 1993, has blasted Mark Carney for his Brexit comments. In a statement just released, Lamont suggests Carney\u2019s remarks could spook the economy: The Governor should be careful that he doesn\u2019t cause a crisis. If his unwise words become self-fulfilling, the responsibility will be the Governor\u2019s and the Governor\u2019s alone. A prudent Governor would simply have said that \u201cwe are prepared for all eventualities\u201d. \u2018There are huge opportunities for the UK outside the EU. We are a strong economy and can stand on our own two feet like all other modern, independent countries.\u2019 Lamont, who is campaigning for Britain to leave the EU, knows a thing or two about crises. He was running the Treasury during Black Wednesday in 1992, when Britain crashed out of the European Exchange Rate Mechanism. A young David Cameron was an advisor, as this famous photo shows: The Institute of Directors is urging businesses to listen to Mark Carney. James Sproule, the IoD\u2019s chief economist, says: \u201cThe Bank of England has highlighted its concerns over the impact the referendum is having on business, and the even greater impact that it could still have on the economy. No matter what they eventually decide, every business in Britain should be giving very serious consideration to the concerns the Bank articulates.\u201d The editor of the FT, Lionel Barber, tweets that the BoE governor has given up being impartial: Rain Newton-Smith, CBI Economics Director, has welcomed Mark Carney\u2019s comments: \u201cThe evidence that a vote to leave the EU would make a serious dent in our economy, jobs and prosperity is overwhelming and still growing. \u201cThe continued lack of a realistic argument on how the UK economy would be better off outside the EU is revealing. \u201cIf a different conclusion could be credibly shown, leave campaigners would have done so by now with fewer than 50 days before the vote.\u201d Iain Duncan Smith, the pro-Brexit former Work and Pensions secretary, has dismissed the Bank of England\u2019s concerns: We had expected some comments on Brexit today, but the Bank of England has gone rather further than expected. By saying that voting to leaving the EU could prompt a recession, Mark Carney has handed the government another weapon against the Brexit campaign. He predicted a material slowdown in growth and a notable increase in inflation. \u201cOf course there\u2019s a range of possible scenarios around those directions, which could possibly include a technical recession.\u201d Carney also revealed that he gets buttonholed about Brexit, a lot. This issue is the number one issue that is raised with me and my colleagues every time we meet another central banker, a finance minister, the head of a major corporation, and most small business owners. Such comments are going to fuel criticism that the Bank of England is failing to be independent and impartial. Carney denied this, saying: It is a judgement not based on a whim... It is the judgement of the independent MPC and it is the judgement of all members of the MPC. He\u2019s also reminded us that central bankers cannot be expected to solve every crisis -- monetary policy is not unlimited, and its effects are not instantaneous. As he put it: There are limits, however, to what monetary policy can deliver... monetary policy cannot immediately offset all the effects of a shock.\u201d Final question. Q: Vote Leave\u2019s official position is that Britain would leave the single market; is that a worry? Carney says there would be implications for the level of financial service activity in the UK if we had a \u2018WTO relationship\u2019 with the EU. [I think that\u2019s because of the \u2018passporting\u2019 arrangements that currently allow banks to base in London and then offer financial services across the EU] Carney also admits that the Bank can\u2019t be sure how the underlying economy is performing, because of the uncertainty created by the Brexit vote. Q: Should the Bank of England really be changing its schedule to only hold eight meetings a year, not 12, given the threats to the economy? Carney says it\u2019s not a problem. We could meet anytime, if needed, he says, indeed the MPC could hold a meeting right now! Q: Will the Bank be announcing further measures to protect the economy around the referendum vote? Never say never, Carney replies. But we learned with Scotland that it\u2019s best to release liquidity facilities well in advance, so people don\u2019t think we\u2019re signalling potential threats. The bank\u2019s PRA (Prudential Regulatory Authority) is also working with financial firms to ensure they are taking precautions. Q: How long would it take for the uncertainty over the EU referendum to fade? Deputy governor Ben Broadbent says that the Bank has done some work on this. It believes that the uncertainty should fade relatively quickly, as we know exactly when the vote takes place. But it still believes the effects could still be felt early into next year, even if Remain win. Carney pledges there will be no shortage of liquidity for banks if Britain votes to leave the EU. Q: Isn\u2019t this more Project Fear? Why has the Bank not considered the benefits from Brexit, such as a cheaper pound helping exports and less regulation? Carney reiterates that the Bank is just following its mandate by explaining its concerns about the EU referendum. Q: Are you saying that the Bank would be powerless to stop Britain falling into recession? Monetary policy has a lag, so if there is a sharp drop in activity from any event it takes time for stimulus to feed through and cushion that demand, Carney replies. (That sounds like a yes). He also points out that it\u2019s not automatically clear whether the Bank would raise or lower interest rates in the event of a Brexit vote. Q: Did the MPC discuss the impact that a Leave vote would have on the international markets and the global economy? There is a risk of a spillover to the international markets from the uncertainty around the EU referendum, Carney responds. He then says that almost everyone he meets wants to talk about Brexit: This issue is the number 1 issue that is raised with me and my colleagues every time we meet another central banker, finance ministers, the head of a major corporation, and most small business owners. Q: What tools could the Bank use to stimulate the economy if it suffered a \u2018sudden stop\u2019? Our judgement is that we can lower interest rates further, before turning to unconventional measures, says Mark Carney. Those unconventional measures include quantitative easing (buying government bonds from banks with newly created money), and credit easing. Deputy governor Minouche Shafit then explains that the Bank is holding three liquidity auctions around the referendum date, to ensure banks don\u2019t run short of cash. There are also \u2018swap lines\u2019 with other central banks, which could be used to get more foreign currency into the system if needed. Q: Is George Osborne right to say that the Bank is warning that Brexit would be a \u2018lose-lose\u2019 for Britain? Carney declines to comment on the chancellor\u2019s tweet (see earlier), saying Osborne answers for himself. The Bank is just trying to outline its views on the economy, and explain how it might react. Q: Can you give more detail about how the pound would fall after a Brexit vote, and would it bounce back? Deputy governor Ben Broadbent says the Bank hasn\u2019t made any numerical forecasts about Brexit, including for the exchange rate. But the prospect of Britain leaving the EU has had a \u2018dampening effect\u2019 on sterling already. There\u2019s a wide range of factors, Broadbent says, making it very hard to make forecasts. If there were changes to tariffs, that could have a long-term impact on the pound. While if the risk-premium on UK assets rose, sterling could \u2018overshoot\u2019 in the short term. Q: Your comments on Brexit go much further than during the Scottish independence compaign - why, and why today? Carney defends his comments - the EU referendum is the biggest domestic risk to the UK, so the MPC has a duty to talk about how it would respond. We have to communicate those risks - it would be a political decision if our views were suppressed. During the Scottish referendum campaign, the Bank was mainly concerned with the impact of banks moving their headquarters from Scotland to London. And we\u2019re talking about it today because the quarterly inflation report is being published. A technical recession means two quarters of negative growth, so Carney appears to be suggesting that the UK could contract through the second half of this year if the Leave campaign wins June\u2019s referendum. Onto questions, and the BBC\u2019s Kamal Ahmed grabs the \u2018elephant in the room\u2019 by the ears: Q: Can you rule out Britain falling into recession if we vote to leave EU? Mark Carney says the bank\u2019s central forecast is based on the conclusion that Britain remains in the EU, and that the uncertainty over the vote dissipates fairly quickly If there were a vote to leave, there would be a material impact on growth and demand, and unemployment. We are trying to explain how we would react to that. Q: Does \u2018materially lower growth mean recession? Carney says there are a range of views contained within the forecasts, and then admits that \u201cit could possibly include a technical recession\u201d. Carney concludes his statement by saying that the people of Britain will make a significant decision on June 23, and they will consider a much wider range of issues than just monetary policy. Whatever the public decides, the MPC will address the consequences for growth and inflation. But there are limits to what monetary policy can do. The Bank cannot offset the full impact of a Brexit vote. The EU referendum is the \u2018elephant in the room\u2019, says Mark Carney. He warns that it is making it hard for the Bank to read the current economic data . There is a risk that we could be over, or under-estimating the underlying momentum in the economy in the event that Britain remains in the EU says Carney. A vote for Brexit would have a \u201cmaterial\u201d impact on the economy, he says. Mark Carney begins the press conference with some history - reminding us that the UK recovery began three years ago, making Britain the fastest growing G7 country. But growth has slowed at the start of this year, and appears to be decelerating further This reflects the EU referendum, Carney declares, which has \u201cpushed up uncertainty measures to levels not seen since the eurozone crisis.\u201d He cites the Bank\u2019s conclusion that Brexit fears are responsible for half of the fall in pound since November. The Bank of England is giving a press conference on the inflation report right now. It\u2019s being streamed online here. Here\u2019s Katie Allen\u2019s news story on the Bank of England\u2019s warning: This chart, from the inflation report, shows how the pound has slumped by 9% in the last six months - partly due to the EU vote. The report is online here. This looks like the Bank of England\u2019s most significant intervention yet in the EU referendum debate. As well as warning about the impact on unemployment and growth, the BoE has also admitted that it will face a tricky balancing act whether to cut or raise interest rates in the event of Brexit. From the Bank, my colleague Katie Allen reports: A vote to leave the EU risks sending the pound sharply lower, stoking inflation, raising unemployment and denting economic growth, the Bank as England warned as its policymakers voted unanimously to keep interest rates at their record low. Describing the 23 June referendum on EU membership as \u201cthe most immediate and significant risk\u201d for the UK\u2019s economic outlook, the central bank said it would face a difficult balancing act in deciding whether to cut, hold or raise interest rates in the aftermath of a vote to leave the bloc. Updating financial markets against the backdrop of tight opinion polls, the Bank\u2019s policymakers warned that in the event of a so-called Brexit they would have to react to opposing forces of lower growth and higher inflation because a fall in sterling would raise import prices. Publishing a swathe of documents, including minutes to the latest rate-setting meeting and new quarterly forecasts, the Bank made its most forthright remarks yet on the possible impact of a leave vote. With the referendum clouding the economic outlook and weighing on business confidence, the Monetary Policy Committee\u2019s (MPC) nine members all voted to leave rates at 0.5%. The minutes revealed the MPC discussed the implications of both a vote to remain in the EU \u2013 currently seen as the more likely outcome based on polls \u2013 and a vote to leave. \u201cA vote to leave the European Union could materially affect the outlook for output and inflation. In the face of greater uncertainty about the UK\u2019s trading relationships, sterling was likely to depreciate further, perhaps sharply. \u201cIn addition, households could defer consumption and firms could delay investment decisions, lowering labour demand and increasing unemployment.\u201d The Bank noted the pound had already depreciated 9% since a November peak and that half of that was down to the \u201crisks associated with a vote to leave the European Union\u201d. The prime minister is also tweeting: Chancellor George Osborne has swiftly responded to the Bank\u2019s concerns about Brexit, arguing it bolsters the Remain campaign. The Bank of England has reiterated its worries about Britain leaving the European Union. In the minutes of this month\u2019s meeting, it says that the risk of Brexit is already hurting the economy: There are increasing signs that uncertainty associated with the EU referendum has begun to weigh on activity. And the BoE fears that the economy could suffer a stark shock if Britain votes to leave the European Union on June 23, which could drive unemployment up. A vote to leave the EU could materially alter the outlook for output and inflation, and therefore the appropriate setting of monetary policy. Households could defer consumption and firms delay investment, lowering labour demand and causing unemployment to rise. The minutes are online here. As feared, the Bank of England has also cut its growth forecasts. It now expects the UK to grow by 2.0% this year. That is a downgrade compared to February\u2019s forecasts, when it expected growth of 2.2%. Here we go! The Bank of England has voted 9-0 to leave interest rates at their current record low of 0.5%. Just 10 minutes to go until the Bank of England announces its interest rate decision, and publishes the quarterly inflation report. Economist Mark Astley, who used to work at the BoE, reckons dovish MPC members are unlikely to actually vote to cut rates. Mark Carney won\u2019t be able to avoid talking about the EU referendum at his 12.30pm press conference, predicts Peter Rosenstreich, head of market strategy at Swissquote Bank. Concerning the press conference, questions will be geared towards the BoE view on \u201cBrexit\u201d. Carney will be undoubtedly prepared for this and will tread cautiously over every neutral, unbiased response. This minefield should generate pound volatility but nothing lasting, barring Carney going rogue. The focus of the inflation report will be the extent of the BoE adjustment of forecasts and contingency plans after the \u201cBrexit\u201d vote. We expect that any mention of the event will be limited due to the Bank\u2019s effort to appear neutral. Yet, it will be difficult for BoE\u2018s Carney to stay balanced as his prior views suggest that \u201cBrexit\u201d poses a massive economic risk to the UK. Rosenstreich also predicts that the MPC will vote 9-0 to leave interest rates unchanged. City AM have written a handy Super Thursday checklist, here. Basically, we should watch out for: A rate hike (Spoiler alert: this won\u2019t happen) Whether the decision is unanimous -- some economists predict one, or even two, votes for a rate cut New forecasts - including a likely downgrade to 2016 growth from 2.2% to 2% Messages to the market: perhaps a hint that rates will rise faster than investors expect (a trick the Bank tried back in 2014) Any Brexit comments from Mark Carney - he won\u2019t want to say anything overtly political, but can hardly ignore June\u2019s vote Mark Carney will probably also be quizzed about the UK housing market today. A new report shows that the average London house price has virtually doubled since 2009, to an eye-watering \u00a3600,000. House prices in the capital are rising by 11%, outpacing the rest of the UK. And astonishingly, an old garage in Hammersmith was just auctioned for \u00a3466,000 - possibly to someone planning to build the house of their dreams. Two years ago, Carney said rising house prices were the biggest risk to the recovery, and he recently hinted that the Bank could rein in buy-to-let lending. However, there are also signs that the market is cooling. LSL, which owns Your Move and Reeds Rains estate agents, says it handled 20,000 fewer sales in April, as demand dropped in the weeks after the introduction of higher stamp duty for buyers of second homes and investment properties. Every City economist polled in the run-up to today\u2019s meeting expects the Bank of England to leave interest rates on hold. Borrowing costs have been pegged at 0.5% since March 2009, so the \u2018rate hike\u2019 button is looking pretty dusty: European stock markets have fallen in early trading as economic growth fears swirl through the City. The FTSE 100 has dropped by 46 points, or 0.75%, to 6115 points, and there are heavier losses in Paris and Frankfurt. Traders are expecting a gloomy Super Thursday, once the Bank of England releases its quarterly inflation forecast and decision on interest rates. Connor Campbell of SpreadEx explains why: Whilst rates will inevitably remain unchanged the focus will be on whether any of the 9 Monetary Policy Committee members vote for a cut this afternoon, with Andy Haldane and Gertjan Vlieghe the likeliest candidates for a walk on the dovish side. Beyond the headline rate vote the central bank will reveal its revised forecasts for the UK\u2019s growth, and things don\u2019t look pretty. Following on from the weak Q1 GDP estimate [0.4%], the limp growth figures revealed by NIESR yesterday, and the sickly showing from the manufacturing and industrial sectors over the last few months, it is likely that the BoE will slash expectations for 2016 to 2% from 2.2%. The Brexit question will dominate the agenda at the Bank of England today, predict Bloomberg. They write: The pre-vote nerves are manifesting themselves in the pound. A gauge of hedging for sterling losses versus the dollar climbed to the highest since 2003. While sterling has recovered from the seven-year low against greenback that it reached in February, it\u2019s still the worst-performing Group-of-10 currency in 2016. This chart shows that many investors have been buying protection against the pound tumbling against the US dollar: Governor Mark Carney will endure a tricky press conference today, predicts Sam Hill of RBC Capital Markets. And that\u2019s because the looming Brexit vote will have a massive impact on interest rates. Hill explains: Essentially, neither Governor Carney, nor the MPC collectively, are likely to want to be drawn into issuing a significantly new or decisive message about the future path of monetary policy at this stage, if they believe the optimal path for rates (and asset purchases) is dependent on which way the vote goes Hill also predicts that the BoE will raise its inflation forecasts. That\u2019s because the oil price has recently recovered, the pound has weakened, and the markets expect interest rates to be lower for even longer (as this chart shows): City economists are adamant that the Bank of England will leave interest rates unchanged today: But there is chatter that at least one policymaker will vote for a cut. The most likely doves are chief economist Andy Haldane, and former hedge fund economist Gertjan Vlieghe. Good morning. All eyes are on the Bank of England this morning, as the UK central bank holds its latest Super Thursday. The BoE will publish its quarterly Inflation Report \u2013 its assessment of the UK economy \u2013 at noon, and City experts predict it will cut its growth forecasts quite sharply. With British industry falling back into recession yesterday, the Bank will likely conclude that its previous forecasts were too optimistic. Previously, it expected the economy to expand by 2.2% during 2016; that could be lowered to 2%. The big issue looming over the UK economy, of course, is June\u2019s EU referendum. The most recent economic data has shown that the possibility of Brexit has hurt confidence, and made firms put spending decisions on ice. So, the Bank\u2019s economists will have tried to calculate the impact on growth and inflation. Governor Mark Carney faces a grilling from the press from 12.30pm BST. They\u2019ll surely quiz him about the referendum, and what preparations being made in case the UK votes to leave the EU. The Bank\u2019s Monetary Policy Committee will also vote on whether to move interest rates today. And it\u2019s not impossible that some MPC members will push to CUT borrowing costs to fresh record lows. That would be a serious signal that all isn\u2019t well in the UK economy. Most, though, will surely want to leave rates at 0.5%, at least until the EU vote is out of the way. We\u2019ll track all the action at the Bank, and other events through the day....",

The final scores showed:</p> <ul> <li><strong>The FTSE 100 added 12.90 points or 0.21% to 6151.40</strong></li> <li><strong>France\u2019s Cac closed down 0.18% at 4312.28</strong></li> <li><strong>Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB finished up 0.04% at 17,737.02</strong></li> <li><strong>Spain\u2019s Ibex ended 0.45% lower at 8682.1</strong></li> <li><strong>In Greece, the Athens market was down 0.35% at 620.5</strong></li> </ul> <p>On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently 153 points or 0.88% higher.</p> <p><em>On that note it\u2019s time to close for the day.

Athens says that if activated, the contingency measures will not hurt the poor. </p> <p>Passing the reforms before the Eurogroup meeting on May 24, is a demand of international lenders to wrap up the review which will unlock the next tranche of funds that Athens will use to pay IMF loans, state arrears and ECB bonds maturing in July.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5739da8ee4b0ac0aa28f50d6\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-05-16T14:50:13.664Z\">3.50pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Wall Street is moving higher, helped by the Apple news, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average currently 101 points or 0.58% higher.</p> <p>Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>There was one very clear source of growth for the Dow Jones this afternoon, and it wasn\u2019t the latest US economic data. The Empire State manufacturing index, the only notable number on the day\u2019s agenda, vastly underperformed expectations, plunging from a 14 month high of 9.6 to a 3 month nadir of -9.0.</p> <p>Yet news that Warren Buffett\u2019s Berkshire Hathaway took a $1 billion stake in Apple during its (miserable) first quarter helped lift the tech company by over 2.5%. As is the weight of Apple this upwards shift more than compensated for the weak manufacturing figure and, alongside the oil-inspired gains for the likes of ExxonMobil and Chevron, ensured the Dow opened nearly 90 points higher after the bell.</p> <p>The FTSE couldn\u2019t get anywhere near that level of growth as the day went on. Yet with Brent Crude crossing $49 per barrel for the first time since in 6 months, and its miners led on a merry-romp by the jubilant Lonmin, the FTSE finally managed to eke out a 5 point rise as the afternoon wore on.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5739d94ee4b0ac0aa28f50d4\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-05-16T14:29:43.394Z\">3.29pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Over in Greece, reports of new votes in parliament ahead of the next Eurogroup meeting:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/YanniKouts/status/732211600766144512\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Greece?src=hash\">#Greece</a> govt to submit omnibus bill to parliament on Wed, to be voted Sun.<br>Bill to include tax increases, NPL scheme &amp; contingency mechanism</p>&mdash; Yannis Koutsomitis (@YanniKouts) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/YanniKouts/status/732211600766144512\">May 16, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-05-16T14:29:59.212Z\">at 3.29pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5739d350e4b05be498d5f91f\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-05-16T14:07:34.652Z\">3.07pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Warren Buffett is not the only one keen on Apple. A number of fund managers have been making positive noises on the iPhone maker:</p> <p>Thomas Fitzgerald at EdenTree Investment Management said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Apple\u2019s share price has fallen about 28% from 2015\u2019s February peak on uncertainty over the future growth of iPhones, which accounts for 66% of sales. Beyond these near-term concerns, the anticipated launch of iPhone 7 will create fresh opportunity to take further market share. There is also still a large upgrade opportunity within its existing installed base \u2013 with only 40% of iPhone users upgraded to the new generation 6 or 6S models. </p> <p>Continued strong cash generation and its balance sheet fortress will continue to support the Apple\u2019s design and development over the long term. As a result, we believe shares are attractively valued at current levels. The company is also making significant progress towards a higher recurring, subscription-led revenue model through the launch of Internet and entertainment services, such as cloud storage, Apple Music and Apple TV. This could drive greater earnings visibility and potentially stronger profitability in future years.</p> </blockquote> <p>And here\u2019s Geir Lode, Head of Hermes Global Equities and manager of the Hermes Global Equity Fund:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The Apple share price has been undergoing some recent volatility, but we remain supporters of the stock. People tend to get hung up on things like new products and how many it is selling, and when it will disclose numbers, but we think you need to take a broader, longer-term view.</p> <p>There is work to be done in product transitioning in the US and Europe, but if you look at the quality of its product lines versus the competition and the company\u2019s enormous cash pile, we believe Apple remains in a very strong market position.</p> </blockquote> <p>But Josh Spencer, manager of the T. Rowe Price Global Technology Equity Fund, is less convinced about the company\u2019s growth prospects:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We own a very small position in Apple, as like many others, we find the company and its products appealing. However, we are seeing signs the smartphone industry is starting to mature and Apple is trying to reinvent itself and come up with other ideas to generate revenue.</p> <p>Its recent share price fall has certainly made Apple appear more attractive, but also important to keep in mind the size of the company. At a market cap of more than $500bn, it is quite difficult to continue to compound from here. We are currently seeing more compelling opportunities to generate returns in the tech sector in areas such as cloud computing.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5739cfcde4b05be498d5f914\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-05-16T13:49:45.631Z\">2.49pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Apple shares jump after Buffett takes stake</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Apple has now reclaimed the title of \u2018world\u2019s most valuable company\u2019 from Alphabet, Reuters says.</strong></p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5739ce2fe4b0ac0aa28f50ad\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-05-16T13:45:12.897Z\">2.45pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Ding ding....

                "bodyText":"News that Warren Buffett had bought a stake in Apple has helped lift US markets, but Europe has turned in a more mixed performance. The FTSE 100 has edged higher as commodity companies benefited from a bounce in metal prices including copper, which followed some weakness in the dollar. Markets were also supported by a rise in the oil price, after an interruption to supplies from Nigeria and a Goldman Sachs forecast that crude would reach $50 for the rest of the year. But with the German market closed, there was little to enthuse investors elsewhere on the continent. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 added 12.90 points or 0.21% to 6151.40 France\u2019s Cac closed down 0.18% at 4312.28 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB finished up 0.04% at 17,737.02 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended 0.45% lower at 8682.1 In Greece, the Athens market was down 0.35% at 620.5 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently 153 points or 0.88% higher. On that note it\u2019s time to close for the day. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. Brent crude continues to hover close to the $50 a barrel market, currently up 2.55% at $49.05 having earlier climbed as high as $49.47. It is at its highest levels for around six months. More on the Greek vote this weekend, courtesy Reuters: Greece\u2019s parliament will vote on a new package of tax hikes and reforms demanded by its international lenders on Sunday, two days before euro zone finance ministers assess whether Athens qualifies for much-needed bailout loans. The bill would increase value added tax by 1 percentage point to 24 percent, raise tax on fuel, tobacco and alcohol, liberalise the sale of banks\u2019 non-performing loans and detail the set-up a new privatisation fund, government officials said. It will also include details on a contingency mechanism to impose tighter austerity measures, which will be activated only if Greece misses its fiscal targets, the officials said on Monday. The vote is expected to test Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras\u2019 left-led government, which has a thin majority of 153 lawmakers in the 300-seat parliament. Athens says that if activated, the contingency measures will not hurt the poor. Passing the reforms before the Eurogroup meeting on May 24, is a demand of international lenders to wrap up the review which will unlock the next tranche of funds that Athens will use to pay IMF loans, state arrears and ECB bonds maturing in July. Wall Street is moving higher, helped by the Apple news, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average currently 101 points or 0.58% higher. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said: There was one very clear source of growth for the Dow Jones this afternoon, and it wasn\u2019t the latest US economic data. The Empire State manufacturing index, the only notable number on the day\u2019s agenda, vastly underperformed expectations, plunging from a 14 month high of 9.6 to a 3 month nadir of -9.0. Yet news that Warren Buffett\u2019s Berkshire Hathaway took a $1 billion stake in Apple during its (miserable) first quarter helped lift the tech company by over 2.5%. As is the weight of Apple this upwards shift more than compensated for the weak manufacturing figure and, alongside the oil-inspired gains for the likes of ExxonMobil and Chevron, ensured the Dow opened nearly 90 points higher after the bell. The FTSE couldn\u2019t get anywhere near that level of growth as the day went on. Yet with Brent Crude crossing $49 per barrel for the first time since in 6 months, and its miners led on a merry-romp by the jubilant Lonmin, the FTSE finally managed to eke out a 5 point rise as the afternoon wore on. Over in Greece, reports of new votes in parliament ahead of the next Eurogroup meeting: Warren Buffett is not the only one keen on Apple. A number of fund managers have been making positive noises on the iPhone maker: Thomas Fitzgerald at EdenTree Investment Management said: Apple\u2019s share price has fallen about 28% from 2015\u2019s February peak on uncertainty over the future growth of iPhones, which accounts for 66% of sales. Beyond these near-term concerns, the anticipated launch of iPhone 7 will create fresh opportunity to take further market share. There is also still a large upgrade opportunity within its existing installed base \u2013 with only 40% of iPhone users upgraded to the new generation 6 or 6S models. Continued strong cash generation and its balance sheet fortress will continue to support the Apple\u2019s design and development over the long term. As a result, we believe shares are attractively valued at current levels. The company is also making significant progress towards a higher recurring, subscription-led revenue model through the launch of Internet and entertainment services, such as cloud storage, Apple Music and Apple TV. This could drive greater earnings visibility and potentially stronger profitability in future years. And here\u2019s Geir Lode, Head of Hermes Global Equities and manager of the Hermes Global Equity Fund: The Apple share price has been undergoing some recent volatility, but we remain supporters of the stock. People tend to get hung up on things like new products and how many it is selling, and when it will disclose numbers, but we think you need to take a broader, longer-term view. There is work to be done in product transitioning in the US and Europe, but if you look at the quality of its product lines versus the competition and the company\u2019s enormous cash pile, we believe Apple remains in a very strong market position. But Josh Spencer, manager of the T. Rowe Price Global Technology Equity Fund, is less convinced about the company\u2019s growth prospects: We own a very small position in Apple, as like many others, we find the company and its products appealing. However, we are seeing signs the smartphone industry is starting to mature and Apple is trying to reinvent itself and come up with other ideas to generate revenue. Its recent share price fall has certainly made Apple appear more attractive, but also important to keep in mind the size of the company. At a market cap of more than $500bn, it is quite difficult to continue to compound from here. We are currently seeing more compelling opportunities to generate returns in the tech sector in areas such as cloud computing. Apple has now reclaimed the title of \u2018world\u2019s most valuable company\u2019 from Alphabet, Reuters says. Ding ding.... Wall Street is open. Apple has jumped to the top of the Dow Jones risers, following the news that Berkshire Hathaway has taken a $1bn stake. Another day, another warning against Brexit from the Bank of England. Today\u2019s message comes from deputy governor Andrew Bailey, who has told City executives that Britain could lose its status as an international financial sector if the UK leaves the EU. That\u2019s because banks from outside Europe can currently base themselves in the capital, and then offer financial services more easily across the bloc. He was speaking at a Financial Regulation Summit organised by Reuters, so over to them for the details: \u201cWe need a banking system to support the domestic economy but I am afraid we don\u2019t have a God-given right to have anything in terms of international. That decision will be taken by many actors over time,\u201d Bailey said. The EU provides rules for banks, insurers and asset managers that provide a \u201cpassport\u201d for them to operate freely across the bloc\u2019s single market. This includes banks from outside Europe,such as the United States and Asia. \u201cWhat matters to them a lot is having the passport. If you are a non-EU firm operating in London, then having the passport is important,\u201d Bailey said. New economic data out of America has reinforced concerns that economic growth is stumbling. The Empire State manufacturing index, which tracks factory output in the New York region, has lurched to -9.02 this month. Many firms reported a drop in new orders, pulling the index down. Economists expected a reading of +6.5%. Warren Buffett is probably nursing a chunky loss on the Apple shares, given he bought them between 1 January and 31 March. The FT points out: Shares in the technology giant have fallen by more than 19 per cent since mid-April after it disclosed its first quarterly revenue fall in 13 years and its first decline in iPhone sales. Bruce Kasman, chief economist at JPMorgan Chase, predicts that the oil price will be quite subdued over the next year. Up they go.... Billionaire investor Warren Buffett hasn\u2019t lost faith in Apple, despite the recent drop in its share price. Buffett\u2019s Berkshire Hathaway group has just revealed it took a new stake in the tech firm in the first quarter of 2016, worth around $1bn. That\u2019s a welcome boost to Apple CEO Tim Cook, after his company lost its title of the world\u2019s most valuable company to Alphabet (parent company of Google) last week. One for technical chartists in the audience: (basically, the oil price has surged to a point where you\u2019d expect it to fall back. But if it doesn\u2019t, then it might \u2018break out\u2019 and continue to rise #chartism ) Here\u2019s more detail from the Goldman Sach\u2019s oil report that has sent crude prices soaring to a six-month high today. This chart suggests that the oil market has dramatically rebalanced in recent weeks, due to declining production and a surge in demand: Goldman reckons that demand has picked up in Asia: Stronger vehicle sales, activity and a bigger harvest are leading us to raise our Indian and Russia demand forecasts for the year. And while we are reducing our US and EU forecasts on the combination of weaker activity and higher prices than previously assumed, we are raising our China demand forecasts to reflect the expected support from the recent transient stimulus. The headline news is that Goldman now believes the oil market has lurched back into deficit this quarter, earlier than expected. However, the firm also believes we\u2019ll be facing a surplus again in 2017: And that\u2019s because oil nations will probably keep boosting production: Goldman says: Low-cost producers will continue to drive production growth in the New Oil Order \u2013 with growth driven by Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Iran, the UAE and Russia. Second, non-OPEC producers had mostly budgeted such price levels and there remains a pipeline of already sanctioned non-OPEC projects. In fact, we see risks to our production forecasts as skewed to the upside as we remain conservative on Saudi\u2019s ineluctable ramp up and Iran\u2019s recovery. Brexit could also send UK house prices tumbling, Fitch suggests today. Bad news for home owners, but possibly a boost to younger renters \u2013 if they aren\u2019t hit by other side-effects..... Fitch has also pointed out that some British firms might benefit if the UK quits the European Union, weakening the pound. The rating agency says: For the corporate sector, the leave scenarios could have mixed effects, depending on sector. UK exporters would benefit from improved price competitiveness, due to sterling\u2019s depreciation. However... UK companies with significant foreign currency debt would face servicing issues. UK airlines could be significantly affected by sterling depreciation due to their foreign currency cost base. So perhaps it\u2019s no surprise that budget airline Ryanair opposes Brexit. It just wheeled out a Boeing 737 with a Remain campaign slogan painted on the fuselage, for a press conference with chancellor George Osborne today. Rating agency Fitch has just warned that European economies could be disrupted if Britain votes to leave the EU. In a new report, Fitch warns that the populist parties across the region would get a boost if the UK public decide to quit. And that could drive up the borrowing costs of weaker members - possibly sparking a repeat of the 2012 eurozone debt crisis \u2013 if investors begin to fear that countries will quit the euro. They say: Brexit would create a precedent for countries leaving the EU. It could boost anti-EU or other populist political parties, and make EU leaders more reluctant to implement unpopular policies with long-term economic benefits. Negotiating the terms of the UK\u2019s exit could exhaust the EU\u2019s time and energy and open up new fronts of disagreement. Brexit could shift the centre of gravity of the EU, making it more dominated by the eurozone core, poorer, more protectionist and less economically liberal. If the UK were to thrive outside of the EU, it might encourage other countries to follow suit. Fitch points out that the banking sectors of Ireland, Malta, Luxembourg, Spain, France and Germany all have sizeable links to the UK. The EU could also be a poorer place without Britain: Brexit would reduce the UK\u2019s contribution to the EU budget (a net \u20ac7.1bn in 2014 after rebates), potentially to zero. This would imply that other net contributors would have to increase payments, or net recipients accept lower EU expenditure. Fitch: \u2018Brexit\u2019 Would Increase Downside Risks to EU Sovereigns Morgan Stanley agrees with Goldman Sachs: This chart explains very clearly why Goldman has reversed its position on the oil market. It shows the various incidents that have disrupted oil supply recently, and their likely impact on supply during the rest of 2016. Reuters is reporting that the Nigerian authorities have apprehended members of a group behind recent attacks on its oil pipelines: The Nigerian army has arrested several people suspected of having been involved in a recent wave of attacks on pipelines in the restive Delta region, a military source said on Monday. Nigerian newspapers reported that the army had arrested several members of a militant group called Niger Delta Avengers which has claimed a string of attacks in the southern swamps. Those attacks have knocked Nigeria\u2019s oil output down to its lowest level in decades; one reason that the oil market is now in deficit, according to Goldman. More UK business chiefs are cutting back on investment ahead of the EU referendum next month. That\u2019s according to a survey conducted by Credit Suisse that found little enthusiasm for Brexit: Although mining companies are rallying this morning, other sectors are in retreat. Big name companies like BT, Barclays, ITV and Unilever have all lost at least 1.3%. And traders are blaming persistent worries about the UK\u2019s EU referendum next month. Overnight, the CBI has cut its growth forecasts for the UK this year to 2%, down fdrom 2.3%, partly due to Brexit concerns. CBI director-general Carolyn Fairbairn warned that: \u201cA dark cloud of uncertainty is looming over global growth, particularly around weakening emerging markets and the outcome of the EU referendum, which is chilling some firms\u2019 plans to invest.\u201d Those disappointing Chinese retail sales, industrial production and investment figures released on Saturday aren\u2019t helping the mood either. Tony Cross of Trustnet Direct says: Losses are broad based with some mixed economic data out of China over the weekend and ongoing fears over the risk of the UK voting to leave the EU at the end of next month both weighing. Shares in BP and Royal Dutch Shell have risen by around 0.8% this morning, following the jump in the oil price. Goldman is also predicting that the oil market will remain in deficit until the end of the year. However, it would then return to oversupply in 2017: If they\u2019re right, that suggests prices may not rise too dramatically from current levels. Brent crude oil is bobbing around a six-month high, as traders digest Goldman\u2019s claim that the market is now in deficit: The oil price has jumped this morning after Goldman Sachs declared that the long run of oversupply was coming to an end. In a new report, the Wall Street firm argues that the oil market has actually flipped into deficit, due to various supply disruptions. That would end a two-year run of oversupply that pushed crude prices down to 13-year lows at the start of 2016. Goldman writes: \u201cThe oil market has gone from nearing storage saturation to being in deficit much earlier than we expected.... The market likely shifted into deficit in May ... driven by both sustained strong demand as well as sharply declining production.\u201d Goldman has also hikes its US crude price forecast to $50 a barrel for the second half of 2016, from a $45 estimate in March. That has send US crude jumping by 1.5% in early trading, to $46.92 per barrel. Brent crude (sourced from the North Sea) is also up 1.5% to $48.55 per barrel. The wildfires that struck Canada\u2019s Fort McMurray were the most newsworthy reason that production levels have fallen recently. Other factors include disruption in Nigeria, where pipelines have been sabotaged, and the swathe of US shale producers who have halted drilling since prices fell. Ands that means the market will stay in deficit through the second half of this year, according to Goldman anyway. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the financial markets, the global economy, the eurozone and business. There\u2019s a definite Monday morning feeling in the City today. Europe\u2019s main stock markets have opened in the red, following some disappointing Chinese economic data over the weekend. China\u2019s factory output missed forecasts in April, growing by 6% versus expectations of 6.5%. Investment and retail sales also grew more slowly than expected last month, which is giving investors another reason to worry about its economy. Commerzbank economist Zhou Hao summed up the mood: \u201cWe\u2019re seeing that growth engines are losing momentum, and the growth outlook has turned soft as well. It\u2019s clear the government wants to manage down or re-anchor market expectation.\u201d And that\u2019s pushed markets down in early trading: Britain\u2019s FTSE: 6108, down 29 points French CAC: 4289, down 30 points (Germany is closed for Whit Monday or Pentecost Monday). We\u2019ll be tracking all the main events through the day. That will include any developments around Greece \u2013 with just seven days to go until finance ministers to (hopefully) conclude the Greek bailout review.",
