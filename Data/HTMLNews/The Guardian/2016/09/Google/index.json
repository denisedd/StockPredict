Leaning forward, the tough septuagenarian senator from Michigan glared at Cook over the top of his glasses: \u201cIt is not your intent to bring them home unless we reduce our tax rates? Is that correct?\u201d</p> <p>Cook repeated: \u201cI have no current plan to do so at the current tax rates.\u201d</p> <p>It was a charged exchange that laid bare the impasse between corporate America and Washington. At that time, Apple had amassed about $100bn in cash \u2013 income from its foreign operations \u2013 all of which was being carefully held outside America, beyond the reach of the US tax authorities.</p> <p>Since then, every three months, Apple has given Wall Street an update on the size of this cash pile, and each time the figure has grown by several billion. At last count, six weeks ago, the figure stood at $215bn (\u00a3162bn).</p> <p>If Apple were to bring that money back to the US, however, it would be taxed at about 40%, one of the highest tax rates in the world. \u201cApple serves its shareholders by keeping these funds overseas,\u201d the Californian technology firm told the senators.</p> <p>By using a long-standing loophole in the tax code, Apple, in common with many other multinationals, can continually defer US taxes on these offshore earnings for as long as they are kept outside America.</p> <p>This is a quirk of US law that has had a dramatic, and increasingly unsustainable, impact on the corporate world. It has meant that many of the richest firms in the US are amassing huge, untaxed offshore cash piles. In recent, years that trend has been accelerated by America\u2019s booming leading tech firms and their worldwide success.</p> <p>According to ratings agency Moody\u2019s, US companies, excluding banks, had an estimated $1.2 trillion in cash overseas at the end of last year. Just over half of that sum \u2013 $630bn \u2013 is estimated to be held by Apple and other tech companies, among them Silicon Valley firms Microsoft ($96bn), Cisco ($57bn), Google ($43bn) and Oracle ($45bn).</p> <p>Barack Obama promised he would get corporate America to bring profits home, as have both the Republican and Democrat candidates vying to succeed him. Quite how to do so, however, has divided Washington for decades.</p> <p>And if the result has been intransigence, few have complained very loudly.

That deal had resulted in Apple avoiding \u20ac13bn in taxes over 10 years, she said: those back taxes, plus interest, would have to be repaid.</p> <p>Cook was furious. He insisted that the income had already been taxed in Europe. \u201cThe commission is now calling to retroactively change those rules,\u201d he protested last Tuesday.

                "bodyText":"A cross-party group of MPs is claiming a victory for corporate tax transparency after the government accepted a legal amendment that could force multinationals to publicly declare where they do business and the tax they pay. Drawn up by the Labour MP Caroline Flint and supported by more than 60 MPs, the amendment to the finance bill would give the Treasury power to seek more openness on tax from corporations with significant activities in the UK. The amendment says tax information should include a \u201ccountry-by-country report\u201d, showing what revenues are earned in which nation. It comes in the wake of the landmark ruling of the European commission to order Apple to pay back up to \u20ac13bn (\u00a311bn) in taxes to Ireland. The government accepted the amendment on Monday evening, said Flint, a member of the public accounts committee, which has criticised the tax affairs of companies including Google. Flint said she was \u201cdelighted that the government and the Commons has accepted the principle of public country-by-country reporting\u201d. She said: \u201cToday is a victory for fairer taxation. A victory for openness, and a clear message to those global corporations that shift profits to low tax havens, that we expect them to play by the same rules as every other business.\u201d Among the MPs to back the amendment was the shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, the current and former chairs of the public accounts committee, Meg Hillier and Margaret Hodge, and Conservative members of the committee. During her campaign to become leader of the Conservatives, Theresa May had promised to be tough on tax evasion and avoidance. Other MPs supporting the amendment include members of the Scottish National party, the Ulster Unionist party, the Social Democratic and Labour party, Plaid Cymru and the Liberal Democrats. The amendment was first introduced by Flint in March under the Ten Minute Rule, a form of private member\u2019s bill which allows individual MPs to propose their own legislation. This was followed by a formal amendment while the finance bill was at the committee stage in the Commons which proposed that multinationals based in the UK or with a large presence there should make public information about the size of their profits, where they were made and what taxes they paid. They already provide this information to tax authorities, but the idea of the amendment is that making this public could help put pressure on corporations to change their behaviour. Flint said: \u201cThe UK government now has yet another tool to use in the campaign against profit shifting that undermines our country and many others, not least some of the poorest in the world.\u201d",

                "bodyText":"Eight of the world\u2019s top industrialised nations lowered their corporation tax rates last year or announced plans to do so, according to a leading thinktank. In the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development\u2019s annual report on tax changes around the world, published on Thursday, the thinktank said Japan, Spain, Israel, Norway and Estonia had all lowered their tax rates for corporate profits in 2015. Meanwhile, future reductions had been announced by Italy, France and the UK, while Japan planned further cuts. The OECD said the 2015 downward trend was accelerating as governments around the world emerged from the aftermath of the 2008 banking crisis and began using their tax policies more aggressively to chase GDP growth. In particular, countries were vying with one another to offer foreign multinationals the most attractive tax rate in an effort to attract investment. \u201cWith regard to corporate income tax, rate reductions had generally slowed down after the crisis but seem to be picking up again,\u201d the report said. \u201cThe trend seems to be gaining renewed momentum.\u201d The OECD findings may make uncomfortable reading for many politicians who have recently claimed to be leading the battle to make big global corporations pay more tax. A string of revelations about ultra-low tax bills among many of the world\u2019s largest businesses \u2013 including Apple, Vodafone, Starbucks and Google \u2013 has led to widespread public anger. The OECD suggested cuts in corporation tax were being partially offset by rises in other taxes such as VAT, fuel and car tax. Many tax justice and inequality campaigners have pointed out this trend hits poorer individuals hardest. The Tax Justice Network notes that it \u201credistributes wealth upwards\u201d. \u201cGovernments make up shortfalls [from corporation tax cuts] by levying higher taxes on other, less wealthy sections of society, or by cutting back on essential public services, so tax \u2018competition\u2019 boosts inequality and deprivation,\u201d the Tax Justice Network has said.
