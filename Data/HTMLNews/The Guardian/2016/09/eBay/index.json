You bought a Prada dress for $500 from Prada on Fifth Avenue. You walk out the store, it is now worth $250. If the tags are on it, you have never worn it, it\u2019s never been photographed, you\u2019ve never washed it, I am going to keep it at $250. After it sells, you can have a half of that. That\u2019s a 50-50 split. That\u2019s consignment. We are glorified eBay essentially with the different percentage,\u201d she said. \u201cIf it has been washed, loved, abused, you were photographed in it, it has been worn 10 times or it is a mass-produced item, I cut the price in half again so now that $500 dress is at $125. That\u2019s my price point. That\u2019s how I decided prices.\u201d</p> <p>There is a reason why items from Chanel and Herm\u00e8s sell for more: they are unique and the collections are limited.</p> <p>\u201cI tell people the clothes don\u2019t have the best retail value because they are so mass produced. I mean Prada is in 30 states in the United States and 75 countries. This is glorified Zara at that point,\u201d said Murphy. \u201cWhen something becomes mass produced, it loses its value just like any antique or a car. Mass production kills value.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d5d0605277e37621b860c57dba766619ff36717b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d5d0605277e37621b860c57dba766619ff36717b/0_21_1500_900/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u201cA bag will fit everybody.

For one, there was a rise in websites like eBay that enabled people to sell their possessions. Then came the recession. As many Americans found themselves without a raise for years or taking lower-paid jobs to make ends meet, making money off clothes one already owned, as well as buying slightly used clothes at a discount, became more and more appealing.</p> <p>\u201cWe have seen everything. We have seen a young girl who got a handbag for Christmas \u2013 she wore it, loved it, abused it \u2013 and now wants to sell it and make some rent money. We have seen a woman from Connecticut sell us four Birkin bags from the back of her car in a parking lot because she is getting a divorce and has to make money. She is selling them under the fly from her husband,\u201d said Murphy. \u201cNine times out of 10, [consignors are] someone who just needs straight money.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QK8mJJJvaes\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/QK8mJJJvaes?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>Anyone doubting the widespread acceptance and popularity of shopping for used clothes need look no further than Macklemore\u2019s 2013 hit Thrift Shop. The song sat on top of Billboard\u2019s top 100 list for weeks. <a href=\"http://www.hotnewhiphop.com/macklemore-s-thrift-shop-tops-billboard-s-100-hot-rap-songs-of-the-last-25-years-news.9686.html\">It was subsequently deemed</a> \u201cthe most successful track in the 25 years of Billboard\u2019s Hot Rap Songs chart\u201d.</p> <p>The $20 bill burning a hole in Macklemore\u2019s pocket, however, would do him no good at any of the high-end consignment stores in New York, where price tags can range from a few hundred dollars to a couple of thousand.</p> <p>Despite the prices, the market has gotten slightly younger over the years, said Greg Selig, owner of Encounters. Encounters was the first high-end consignment store to open in the US in 1954. Selig\u2019s mother was a salesperson there before she and her husband bought the store in 1981.</p> <p>\u201cI would say it\u2019s a young girl just out of college, she wants her first job, she wants her first fancy handbag. It\u2019s the woman between 22 and 40 \u2013 they want to keep up with the Joneses. They want to look good. They are practical shoppers. It\u2019s people who are trendsetters. It\u2019s people who go: I can\u2019t go to Macy\u2019s. I can\u2019t go to Bloomingdale\u2019s. I can\u2019t wear the same thing my friend does. I have to wear something super unique. I want to stand out,\u201d Murphy agreed.</p> <p>While the buyers might have gotten younger, consignors remain slightly older.</p> <p>\u201cThe younger audience is not going to be spending $1,200 on a [new] bag in terms of an accessible income. The customer base has gotten younger but in terms of the consignment base \u2013 the people selling the goods \u2013 there\u2019s only so young you can get in terms of who has accessible income\u201d to buy the items often seen on the runway, Selig explained.</p> <p>Fluhr-Gates recalled once telling another reporter that the most expensive item sold at Michael\u2019s was an $18,000 handbag. Who would buy that? Someone rich, she said.</p> <p>\u201cPeople who are purchasing from us have the ability to walk down to Herm\u00e8s and buy it from Herm\u00e8s directly, but they understand the value of consignment because they can get it for a few thousand dollars less, which is not chump change,\u201d she said. \u201cAlso, because they recognize that recycling has a benefit and that value can also reside in the thrill of the hunt. There is also a psychological aspect to shopping consignment. And you never know what you are going to find.\u201d</p>",

If the tags are on it, you have never worn it, it\u2019s never been photographed, you\u2019ve never washed it, I am going to keep it at $250. After it sells, you can have a half of that. That\u2019s a 50-50 split. That\u2019s consignment. We are glorified eBay essentially with the different percentage,\u201d she said. \u201cIf it has been washed, loved, abused, you were photographed in it, it has been worn 10 times or it is a mass-produced item, I cut the price in half again so now that $500 dress is at $125. That\u2019s my price point. That\u2019s how I decided prices.\u201d There is a reason why items from Chanel and Herm\u00e8s sell for more: they are unique and the collections are limited. \u201cI tell people the clothes don\u2019t have the best retail value because they are so mass produced. I mean Prada is in 30 states in the United States and 75 countries. This is glorified Zara at that point,\u201d said Murphy. \u201cWhen something becomes mass produced, it loses its value just like any antique or a car. Mass production kills value.\u201d Owners of consignment stores agree that the idea of selling and buying used clothes has become more mainstream over the years. For one, there was a rise in websites like eBay that enabled people to sell their possessions. Then came the recession. As many Americans found themselves without a raise for years or taking lower-paid jobs to make ends meet, making money off clothes one already owned, as well as buying slightly used clothes at a discount, became more and more appealing. \u201cWe have seen everything. We have seen a young girl who got a handbag for Christmas \u2013 she wore it, loved it, abused it \u2013 and now wants to sell it and make some rent money. We have seen a woman from Connecticut sell us four Birkin bags from the back of her car in a parking lot because she is getting a divorce and has to make money. She is selling them under the fly from her husband,\u201d said Murphy. \u201cNine times out of 10, [consignors are] someone who just needs straight money.\u201d Anyone doubting the widespread acceptance and popularity of shopping for used clothes need look no further than Macklemore\u2019s 2013 hit Thrift Shop. The song sat on top of Billboard\u2019s top 100 list for weeks. It was subsequently deemed \u201cthe most successful track in the 25 years of Billboard\u2019s Hot Rap Songs chart\u201d. The $20 bill burning a hole in Macklemore\u2019s pocket, however, would do him no good at any of the high-end consignment stores in New York, where price tags can range from a few hundred dollars to a couple of thousand. Despite the prices, the market has gotten slightly younger over the years, said Greg Selig, owner of Encounters. Encounters was the first high-end consignment store to open in the US in 1954. Selig\u2019s mother was a salesperson there before she and her husband bought the store in 1981. \u201cI would say it\u2019s a young girl just out of college, she wants her first job, she wants her first fancy handbag. It\u2019s the woman between 22 and 40 \u2013 they want to keep up with the Joneses. They want to look good. They are practical shoppers. It\u2019s people who are trendsetters. It\u2019s people who go: I can\u2019t go to Macy\u2019s. I can\u2019t go to Bloomingdale\u2019s. I can\u2019t wear the same thing my friend does. I have to wear something super unique. I want to stand out,\u201d Murphy agreed. While the buyers might have gotten younger, consignors remain slightly older. \u201cThe younger audience is not going to be spending $1,200 on a [new] bag in terms of an accessible income. The customer base has gotten younger but in terms of the consignment base \u2013 the people selling the goods \u2013 there\u2019s only so young you can get in terms of who has accessible income\u201d to buy the items often seen on the runway, Selig explained. Fluhr-Gates recalled once telling another reporter that the most expensive item sold at Michael\u2019s was an $18,000 handbag. Who would buy that? Someone rich, she said. \u201cPeople who are purchasing from us have the ability to walk down to Herm\u00e8s and buy it from Herm\u00e8s directly, but they understand the value of consignment because they can get it for a few thousand dollars less, which is not chump change,\u201d she said. \u201cAlso, because they recognize that recycling has a benefit and that value can also reside in the thrill of the hunt. There is also a psychological aspect to shopping consignment. And you never know what you are going to find.\u201d",

Two tickets for this December\u2019s El Clasico, the grudge football match between Real Madrid and Barcelona, are currently listed for \u00a3196,155.94. If tickets sell at that price then Viagogo\u2019s \u201cbooking fee\u201dwould top \u00a340,000. It would also take a commission from the seller, typically about 15% of the ticket price. The website says this fee is \u201cwhat allows us to provide you with our great service\u201d. Social media sites, however, are littered with angry customers complaining that they had been refused entry or had difficulty getting their money back. Viagogo may advertise tickets with a huge price tag, but it prefers to keep a low profile about its own operations. While the firm is now technically based in Geneva, much of Viagogo\u2019s business is administered from an office in Cannon Street in London, where dozens of staff field calls from customers. When the Guardian visited the office, Viagogo\u2019s name did not appear on the foyer information board listing the building\u2019s tenants. So far, sites such as Viagogo have avoided a legal crackdown, although regulators are understood to be considering a full-blown investigations into secondary ticketing.",
