However, while the sums involved are significant, they will not, in our view, fundamentally change Ireland\u2019s credit metrics. There may also be downside risks should the ruling lead to weaker institutional effectiveness or compromise Ireland\u2019s economic growth outlook.<br></p> <p>Should the windfall be used entirely to reduce Ireland\u2019s general government debt burden, public debt could fall to just over 80% of GDP next year. While not insignificant, it is dwarfed by the close to 40 percentage points of GDP reduction of the debt ratio from the 135% peak in 2012, brought about by Ireland\u2019s robust economic expansion following the crisis and sizable asset sales.</p> <p>Even if the tax funds were eventually received, they may not be fully dedicated to public debt reduction, further reducing the potential positive impact.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>S&amp;P goes on to highlight the potential negatives for Ireland, including divisions within the government over the issue:</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p> The initial reaction has exposed hitherto invisible splits on the issue inside the ruling coalition, which could negatively affect the effectiveness, stability, and predictability of the sovereign\u2019s policymaking and primary institutions, which we currently assess as a credit strength.<br></p> <p>Foregoing such a significant financial windfall by appealing against it, the government\u2019s credibility could suffer in the eyes of the electorate. An appeal could also lead to a more conflicted relationship with some of Ireland\u2019s EU partners, some of which have eyed Ireland\u2019s tax policies with suspicion in the past.</p> <p>Finally, the EU tax ruling could come with economic risks.

                "bodyText":"The day has been dominated by a raft of manufacturing PMI reports for August, providing a snapshot of the global economy. The biggest surprise came from the UK, where an unexpected and sharp rebound in the headline index suggested the shock of the Brexit vote had faded. The eurozone PMI index fell to the lowest level in three months, giving Mario Draghi and his colleagues at the European Central Bank more to think about as they gather for their next policy meeting next week. Manufacturing growth slowed in the the US according to the PMI, but only slightly. Figures out just now however show a sharper drop on the ISM measure of manufacturing - to 49.4 in August from 52.6 in July. Weaker US manufacturing is likely to dampen expectations of a September US rate hike, but more importance will be placed by investors on Friday\u2019s non-farm payrolls. The FTSE is still lagging other European markets, down 0.5% or 34 points. That\u2019s all for today. Thank you for all your comments today, please join us again tomorrow. It\u2019s America\u2019s turn for the manufacturing PMI report... The headline index dropped slightly to 52 in August from 52.9 in July, where anything above 50 signals growth. Chris Williamson, chief economist at PMI provider Markit, says the slightly slower growth is no crisis: Despite the PMI falling in August, the survey suggests the third quarter is shaping up to be the best quarter so far this year for manufacturing, with output growth picking up compared to the first half of the year on the back of improved export sales. The overall rate of expansion remains only modest, however, and the upturn fragile. Weak domestic demand remains a drag on order books. Concerns about the outlook have also resulted in a marked reduction in the rate of job creation. Manufacturing has been one of the weakest parts of the US economy in recent months, and Williamson says the latest PMI is supportive of the view that the Fed should hold rates for now: The overall sluggish pace of expansion signalled by the survey, and the slacking of inflationary pressures, provides support to those arguing that interest rates should remain on hold. US markets are subdued in early trading, opening roughly flat: Dow Jones: -0.05% at 18,393 S&amp;P 500: -0.02% at 2,171 Nasdaq: +0.09% at 5,218 Just as last week investors awaited Janet Yellen\u2019s Jackson Hole Speech, this week they await Friday\u2019s non-farm payrolls for clues over the timing of the next US rate hike. Economists polled by Reuters are expecting a 180,000 rise in August, following a 255,000 rise in July. A number in line with or better than expectations will fuel speculation that the Fed will raise rates at this month\u2019s meeting. A disappointing number will prompt speculation that the Fed will be inclined to wait until December or later. The proportion of children living in workless households dropped in the second quarter of 2016 to 11% - the lowest level on record. There were 1.4 million children living in workless households during the period, while 7 million were in working households and 3.9 million were in mixed households. The report from the Office for National Statistics showed 57.4% of all UK households were working in the second quarter, up from 55.4% a year earlier and 49.3% in Q2 of 1996. The disappearance of BHS from UK high streets continues: Neelie Kroes, the European commissioner for competition between 2004 and 2010, suggests her former colleagues have taken the wrong approach over Apple\u2019s Irish tax affairs. Writing for the Guardian, she says: Rather than pursuing a handful of countries and companies for the past, we should focus on shaping a fair tax system for the future. The controversy about state aid and tax rulings is not about whether companies pay their fair share, but where that share should be paid. That is an important question, but not one for state aid. Read the full piece: Wall Street is expected to open higher: Donald Tusk, president of the European Council, has set the tone for a meeting of EU leaders to discuss what Brexit means for the EU. Theresa May is not invited to the meeting in Bratislava on 16 September, where leaders will be talking about her and not to her. Tusk said on Thursday there would be no informal discussions with the UK over Brexit. In a statement during a visit to Luxembourg, he said: We need to discuss what Brexit means politically for the European Union. We need to talk about ourselves, the European Union, that sooner or later will be left by the UK. It is not our intention to talk about the UK in Bratislava or our negotiation strategy vis-\u00e0-vis the UK. Our position is crystal clear: there will be no negotiations without notification. This principle is enshrined in our treaties. And it is there for a reason: to protect the interests of the members of the Union that want to stay together, not the one which decides to leave. Therefore, we shall not give up on this principle. Over in the US, the number of people filing new claims for jobless benefits rose last week compared with a week earlier. There were 263,000 new claims in the week ending 27 August, 2,000 fewer than economists were expecting, but 2,000 more than the previous week. The four-week rolling average fell to 263,000 claims, from 264,000 according to the US Labor Department. Ratings agency S&amp;P says Ireland\u2019s potential \u20ac13bn windfall from Apple following the EU\u2019s controversial ruling does not alter its A+ stable rating. At first glance, the tax ruling may appear favourable for the sovereign. However, while the sums involved are significant, they will not, in our view, fundamentally change Ireland\u2019s credit metrics. There may also be downside risks should the ruling lead to weaker institutional effectiveness or compromise Ireland\u2019s economic growth outlook. Should the windfall be used entirely to reduce Ireland\u2019s general government debt burden, public debt could fall to just over 80% of GDP next year. While not insignificant, it is dwarfed by the close to 40 percentage points of GDP reduction of the debt ratio from the 135% peak in 2012, brought about by Ireland\u2019s robust economic expansion following the crisis and sizable asset sales. Even if the tax funds were eventually received, they may not be fully dedicated to public debt reduction, further reducing the potential positive impact. S&amp;P goes on to highlight the potential negatives for Ireland, including divisions within the government over the issue: The initial reaction has exposed hitherto invisible splits on the issue inside the ruling coalition, which could negatively affect the effectiveness, stability, and predictability of the sovereign\u2019s policymaking and primary institutions, which we currently assess as a credit strength. Foregoing such a significant financial windfall by appealing against it, the government\u2019s credibility could suffer in the eyes of the electorate. An appeal could also lead to a more conflicted relationship with some of Ireland\u2019s EU partners, some of which have eyed Ireland\u2019s tax policies with suspicion in the past. Finally, the EU tax ruling could come with economic risks. The fear is that the ruling undermines Ireland\u2019s attractiveness as a business location for multinational corporations, hitherto a key factor in Ireland\u2019s economic progress in recent decades. The FTSE is just about holding on to positive territory, up five points or 0.1%. Earlier gains from the miners have faded away, oil prices are dipping. The UK\u2019s leading index is lagging its counterparts in Europe, where investors are shrugging off a weaker eurozone manufacturing PMI. FTSE 100: +0.1% at 6,787 Germany\u2019s DAX: +0.5% at 10,641 France\u2019s CAC: +1% at 4,481 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB: +1.7% at 17,222 Spain\u2019s IBEX: +1.7% at 8,866 Greece\u2019s ATG: +0.4% at 580 Europe\u2019s STOXX 600: +0.8% at 346 Martin Beck, senior economic advisor to the EY Item Club, says the August manufacturing PMI is the latest sign that sentiment quickly recovered after taking a bashing in July in the immediate aftermath of the Brexit vote. The month-on-month change in the PMI was the joint largest in the survey\u2019s history. It follows the pattern seen in a number of other indicators where a decline in sentiment in the immediate aftermath of the vote to leave the EU was followed by a recovery, as the dust settled. But just as we cautioned against getting too carried away with the weak July reading, August\u2019s rebound should not be taken as a sign that everything is fine. Taking the survey evidence in the round, there still remains a good chance that manufacturing output saw a contraction in Q3. Monday\u2019s survey for the much larger services sector will provide a stronger steer. More reaction now to the surge in UK manufacturing in August, following a sharp drop in July in the immediate aftermath of the Brexit vote. The five-point jump in the headline PMI index to 53.3 took City economists and commentators by surprise. Stephen Cooper, head of manufacturing at KPMG UK, says the number was \u201cspectacular\u201d: The August UK PMI results are spectacular for UK manufacturing. Reports of postponed work and delayed projects being restarted, following the EU referendum, are amongst the reasons cited for the better than expected performance. The 10% fall in the value of sterling has had a marked impact on export orders too. One swallow does not a summer make, and as autumn progresses, we will see if this is a blip, or whether it\u2019s the start of a long-term trend. Lee Hopley, chief economist at EEF, the manufacturers trade body, said companies had got their mojo back: Manufacturers, unnerved in July by the referendum outcome, appear to have their mojo back in August. Today\u2019s data provides a lot of relief that manufacturing activity is still on the up. But the heightened volatility in the indicator in the last couple of months still raises questions about whether sentiment has overshot somewhat and, rather than this pace of expansion being sustained, some moderation is likely in the coming months. Philip Hammond, the new(ish) chancellor, says Britain will remain an outward-looking country, attractive to foreign companies: In a statement released to coincide with a visit to Jaguar Land Rover (owned by India\u2019s Tata), he said: As an outward-looking country, we will continue to attract companies to invest and grow in the UK, while supporting British businesses. His boss Theresa May will attend the G20 summit in China later this week, where she is expected to tell world leaders Britain is \u201copen for business\u201d and keen to forge relationships with new markets. Time to buy euros? The pound has risen sharply following the surprisingly strong August manufacturing PMI. It is up 0.9% against the euro and earlier hit a one-month high. The pound is also up 0.7% against the dollar at $1.3236. Neil Wilson, market analyst at ETX Capital: We\u2019re seeing a strong bid for sterling after a stonking manufacturing PMI showed the UK\u2019s factories sparked back into life in August following the July post-Brexit slowdown. The pound is cranking higher on the results, with cable now trading around $1.3250, its best since the Bank of England cut interest rates a month ago. The focus will now be on the key services sector PMI [on Monday]. The omens are good, with consumer spending very robust. However, let\u2019s remember that Brexit negotiations have not even begun yet so there is still plenty of time for things to turn south. The five-point jump in the headline index of the August UK manufacturing PMI was a major rebound for the sector. It was the joint biggest monthly surge in the survey\u2019s near 25-year history, and will add weight to the view that the June Brexit vote has not (yet) plunged the UK economy into crisis. Output, new orders, and employment all jumped in the sector in August. Firms taking part in the survey said stronger demand, new product launches, and customers committing to new and previously postponed contracts all boosted business. Manufacturers said the drop in the pound since the Brexit vote had driven a rise in exports, with swelling sales to overseas markets such as the US, Europe, China, Southeast Asia, the Middle East and Norway. A weak pound makes British goods cheaper abroad, which is a good for exporting businesses. But it also makes imports from other countries more expensive, and evidence of this could be seen in the August PMI. Input prices - those paid by manufacturers for their raw materials - increased at the fastest rate in more than five years in August. About 44% of firms reported a rise in purchasing costs. Factory gate inflation - the price charged by manufacturers as they leave the factory - also rose at the fastest pace for five years. Rob Dobson, senior economist at IHS Markit, says the August report suggests the sector has swerved a (Brexit-induced) downturn: The August PMI data indicate a solid rebound in the performance of the UK manufacturing sector from the steep downturn that followed the EU referendum. Companies reported that work that had been postponed during July had now been restarted, as manufacturers and their clients started to regain a sense of returning to business as usual. Inflation is raising its ugly head, however. Rates of increase in input prices and output charges both hit five-year highs, which manufacturers placed squarely at the door of the cost impact of sterling on import prices. It is too early to say whether the rebounds in growth and inflation will be sustained, but the upturn in August suggests that the weaker exchange rate and recent policy action have helped to avert a downturn. Big upside shock for UK manufacturing PMI in August. The headline index jumped to 53.3 from 48.3 in July. Economists had expected the index to remain in contraction territory (below 50) at 49. More soon. Looking at the detail of the eurozone manufacturing PMI survey, rates of growth slowed for production, new orders, and new export business, which in turn resulted in weaker job creation. Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit, said there were suggestions from the firms surveyed for the PMI that growth could slow further. There is some suggestion of a Brexit impact, and growth may wane further in September after new orders growth slipped to a one-and-a-half year low. Anecdotal evidence suggests that the strengthening of the euro and reduced sales to the UK were partly to blame for the order book slowdown. Employment growth also eased to a five-month low, indicating an increased hesitancy to hire amid the heightened political uncertainty. Once again, it\u2019s also a worryingly mixed picture across the region. Northern countries including Germany, the Netherlands and Austria are providing the main power to the expansion, but elsewhere the picture is looking more subdued. France and Italy are in decline, Greece is stagnating and both Spain and Ireland are enduring their worst growth spells since mid-2013. Here is a country breakdown of the headline numbers for August. Anything above 50 signals growth, anything below 50 signals contraction: Germany: 53.6 Netherlands: 53.5 Austria: 52.1 Ireland: 51.7 Spain: 51 Greece: 50.4 Italy: 49.8 France: 48.3 Activity in the eurozone\u2019s manufacturing sector grew at the slowest rate in three months in August according to the latest survey. The headline index on the Markit PMI edged down to 51.7 in August from 52 in July. Anything above 50 signals expansion. A breakdown of the surveys from the eurozone\u2019s biggest economies showed a mixed picture. In Germany, the sector grew in August at the same pace as July, as expected. It was the same story in Spain. But Italy was a miss, with the manufacturing sector shrinking unexpectedly in August, and in France the sector contracted at a slightly quicker rate than July. The price of a barrel of Brent crude oil is up 0.6% this morning at $47.19. The better-than-expected manufacturing data out of China has also pushed the prices of London zinc, lead and tin to the highest level in more than a year. China is the world\u2019s biggest user of metals. Miners on the FTSE 100 are reaping the rewards this morning: Europe\u2019s major markets are all up this morning, starting September off on a positive note. The FTSE 100 is up 43 points or 0.6%, boosted by mining shares that have been a drag in recent days. The miners are helped today by the better-than-expected Chinese manufacturing data, which is a positive for global demand and is pushing up commodity prices. FTSE 100: +0.6% at 6,823 Germany\u2019s DAX: +0.3% at 10,625 France\u2019s CAC: +0.6% at 4,464 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB: +1% at 17,110 Spain\u2019s IBEX: +0.6% at 8,771 Europe\u2019s STOXX 600: +0.5% at 345 Activity in China\u2019s factories rose unexpectedly in August at the fastest pace in two years as construction boomed in a sign government spending is paying off. The official purchasing managers\u2019 index rose to 50.4 in August from 49.9 in July - crucially taking the index above the 50 mark which signals growth. Economists had expected the headline index to remain unchanged at 49.9. The best manufacturing performance since late 2014 is likely to add to views that China\u2019s central bank will be in no hurry to inject further stimulus into the world\u2019s second largest economy. Julian Evans-Pritchard, China economist at Capital Economics, said the survey would boost confidence: This ought to boost sentiment and suggests that earlier policy easing is still being supportive of economic activity. Today\u2019s PMI readings paint a fairly reassuring picture about the current state of China\u2019s economy and fit with our long-running view that earlier policy stimulus ought to be sufficient to shore up growth until the end of this year. The first of the PMI surveys for August will be published today, starting with manufacturing in the eurozone, UK and US. The PMIs are business surveys rather than official data, but they are closely watched by central bankers, investors and economists, not least because they give the earliest indication of how an economy is performing. There is more of a lag with much of the official data. As we begin a new month, attention is turning to potential action by the world\u2019s central banks as they prepare for their next policy meetings. In the UK and eurozone, the likelihood is for further stimulus, whereas in the US - where economic data and the outlook has been generally more robust - attention is focused on the timing of the next rate hike. The PMI surveys will be scanned for any clues on whether policy action is more or less likely in the world\u2019s major economies. Weekly jobless claims will be published later in the US, ahead of the crucial non-farm payrolls report on Friday which is expected to give the clearest signal as to whether the US Fed will raise rates this month. European markets are expected to open higher after most indices fell on Wednesday: Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Apple boss Tim Cook is still fuming over the EU\u2019s ruling earlier in the week that the US tech giant must pay the Irish government up to \u20ac13bn plus interest in back taxes. In a new interview with the Irish independent he condemns the move as \u201ctotal political crap\u201d, and repeats his vow to fight the EU. Cook suggests Apple has been specifically targeted by commissioners in Europe and that Ireland - which does not want the company to repay the money and has also pledged to appeal the ruling - is being picked on. I think we\u2019ll work very closely together, as we have the same motivation. No one did anything wrong here and we need to stand together. Ireland is being picked on and this is unacceptable. He rejects the claim by European competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager that Apple paid just 0.005pc tax in Ireland in 2014: It\u2019s total political crap. They just picked a number from I don\u2019t know where. In the year that the Commission says we paid that tax figure, we actually paid $400m. We believe that makes us the highest taxpayer in Ireland that year. This conclusion that the Commission has reached has no basis in law or in fact. So I think it clearly suggests that this is politics at play. He continues that while Apple hasn\u2019t always see eye-to-eye with the US government, they are united on this particular issue: This is a huge overreach that represents retrospective activity and is completely unfair,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s wrong. In the last several years, we\u2019ve had political differences of opinion in the US on this. But on this one, literally 100pc of the comments are in agreement. I think that Apple was targeted here,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I think that (anti-US sentiment) is one reason why we could have been targeted. People in leadership positions in several countries tell me that this is the agenda. I don\u2019t know where that comes from. But what I feel strongly about is that this decision was politically based, of that I\u2019m very confident. There is no reason for it in fact or in law. He said Apple remains fully committed to Ireland, and will repay its loyalty. We are going forward, absolutely,\u201d he said. \u201cI want to be really clear that we are very committed on Ireland. We are going to continue with the expansions we talked about. We\u2019ve been spending a lot of money on building out a large location in Cork, We have a 37-year-old marriage with Ireland and it means something to us. It\u2019s a very deep relationship. Every time I go there it brings me such joy. It is an integral part of the company. I feel like Ireland stuck with Apple when it wasn\u2019t easy to stick with Apple and now we\u2019re sticking with Ireland. A reminder of what this is all about:",

When interest is added the final bill could reach \u20ac19bn.</p> <p>\u201cIf the European commission have ruled this profit should be taxable in Ireland, it should be reflected in the GDP numbers,\u201d said Seamus Coffey, lecturer in economics at University College Cork.</p> <p>He believes the revision, which could be required by the European statistics agency Eurostat, could show that the Irish economy was growing between 6% and 8% a year from 2010 onwards. This would represent a dramatic change, at least on paper: Ireland\u2019s GDP shrank in 2012 and growth was recorded at zero in 2011.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Seamus Coffey twitter\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; data-lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;One consequence of &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/AppleTax?src=hash&quot;&gt;#AppleTax&lt;/a&gt; ruling is that the 26% GDP growth rate will be revised away.

The 2015 number won\u2019t change. What will happen is the years before it will rise up.\u201d</p> <p>Following this week\u2019s ruling, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/sep/01/political-crap-tim-cook-apple-tax-ruling\">which Apple has vowed to appeal against</a>, Ireland must now recover unpaid taxes from Apple for the years 2003 to 2014. The cash will not transfer immediately to the Irish revenue. Apple\u2019s chief executive Tim Cook has confirmed that a sum based on the commission\u2019s calculations will be paid into an escrow account pending the end of the appeals process.</p> <p>Apple books the vast majority of its non-US revenues through Ireland, and the amounts passing through the books of its two principal subsidiaries in the Irish Republic have been significant since 2010, when sales of the iPhone and iPad ballooned.</p> <p>Between 2009 and 2014, Apple\u2019s pre-tax earnings from outside the US rose from $6.6bn to $33.6bn. They were $47.6bn (\u00a335.8bn) last year.</p> <p>A statistical change in the rate at which the economy grew could have material consequences. In July, the <a href=\"http://www.irishtimes.com/business/economy/state-faces-280m-rise-in-eu-contribution-due-to-gdp-revision-1.2728535\">finance minister, Michael Noonan</a>, confirmed Ireland would have to contribute an additional \u20ac280m to the European Union budget to reflect a recent revision to its growth.</p> <p>Ireland\u2019s GDP grew by an astonishing 26.3% in 2015, according to revised statistics published by the government in July.

                "bodyText":"Ireland may have to revise its annual GDP figures for the past decade following the European commission\u2019s ruling that the majority of Apple\u2019s overseas profits should have been taxable in the Republic. Europe\u2019s competition watchdog ruled on Tuesday that the company owed the Irish government \u20ac13bn (\u00a310.9bn) in unpaid taxes on profits from international sales routed through subsidiaries in Ireland. When interest is added the final bill could reach \u20ac19bn. \u201cIf the European commission have ruled this profit should be taxable in Ireland, it should be reflected in the GDP numbers,\u201d said Seamus Coffey, lecturer in economics at University College Cork. He believes the revision, which could be required by the European statistics agency Eurostat, could show that the Irish economy was growing between 6% and 8% a year from 2010 onwards. This would represent a dramatic change, at least on paper: Ireland\u2019s GDP shrank in 2012 and growth was recorded at zero in 2011. \u201cThe commission is essentially reallocating the profits from the US to Ireland,\u201d said Coffey. \u201cThey are now saying the output produced in Ireland is billions higher. The 2015 number won\u2019t change. What will happen is the years before it will rise up.\u201d Following this week\u2019s ruling, which Apple has vowed to appeal against, Ireland must now recover unpaid taxes from Apple for the years 2003 to 2014. The cash will not transfer immediately to the Irish revenue. Apple\u2019s chief executive Tim Cook has confirmed that a sum based on the commission\u2019s calculations will be paid into an escrow account pending the end of the appeals process. Apple books the vast majority of its non-US revenues through Ireland, and the amounts passing through the books of its two principal subsidiaries in the Irish Republic have been significant since 2010, when sales of the iPhone and iPad ballooned. Between 2009 and 2014, Apple\u2019s pre-tax earnings from outside the US rose from $6.6bn to $33.6bn. They were $47.6bn (\u00a335.8bn) last year. A statistical change in the rate at which the economy grew could have material consequences. In July, the finance minister, Michael Noonan, confirmed Ireland would have to contribute an additional \u20ac280m to the European Union budget to reflect a recent revision to its growth. Ireland\u2019s GDP grew by an astonishing 26.3% in 2015, according to revised statistics published by the government in July. The rate is nearly three times the highest level recorded during the so-called Celtic Tiger boom years and was far ahead of a previous estimate of 7.8%. Nobel prizewinner Paul Krugman described the figures as \u201cleprechaun economics\u201d, while Sinn F\u00e9in MP Pearse Doherty said that the economy was now \u201cso intertwined in international tax and accounting stunts that they bring with them a serious risk\u201d. The National Treasury Management Agency, which manages Ireland\u2019s debt, said the jump was due to a number of large multinationals moving their tax domicile to Ireland. This led to a \u20ac300bn increase in the country\u2019s capital stock, which records assets such as roads and hospitals but also intangibles such as intellectual property. This pushed the value of assets above \u20ac1tn for the first time. \u201cWhether by re-domiciling or by inverting, the reclassification of several large companies as Irish resident expanded the capital stock in 2015,\u201d the agency said in a presentation in July. Since Tuesday\u2019s ruling, there has been speculation that the GDP leap may be linked to a change in Apple\u2019s offshore strategy. The commission stated that its ruling only applied to the end of 2014 because the company\u2019s two main Irish subsidiaries \u2013 Apple Sales International and Apple Operations Europe \u2013 altered their structures in 2015. If Apple has reallocated more of its intellectual property, such as patents and branding rights to Ireland, the change could explain the \u20ac300bn increase in the value of Irish assets. \u201cWe don\u2019t know that what happened in 2015 was Apple,\u201d said Coffey. \u201cMaybe it\u2019s spread across 40 companies.

                "bodyText":"Oil prices have lost some of their gains after the US added more rigs last week, for the ninth week in ten. According to Baker Hughes, one oil and seven gas rigs were added, taking the total to 497. With worries about oversupply amid weak demand, Brent crude - up 3.2% ahead of the rig cound - is now up 2.7% at $46.68. On that note, it\u2019s time to close the blog for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back next week. Heading into the weekend, investors were in buoyant mood, with the weaker than expected US jobs figures seemingly delaying any interest rate rise from the Federal Reserve until later in the year. A jump in oil prices also helped sentiment. So European markets moved sharply higher, while Wall Street was also in the ascendency. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished up 148.63 points or 2.2% at 6894.60, its biggest one day rise since 30 June and its highest close for two weeks Germany\u2019s Dax jumped 1.42% to 10,683.82 France\u2019s Cac closed 2.31% higher at 4542.17 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB rose 1.54% to 17,183.90 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended up 1.67% at 8908.9 In Greece, the Athens market added 0.56% to 582.13 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 76 points or 0.4%. Markets are finished the week on a strong note following the US jobs data, which seemed to take a September rate rise off the table. In particular, the FTSE 100 has caught fire in late trading, surging more than 2.5%. This would be the biggest daily rise since 29 June. And analysts believe there could be more to come. Joshua Mahony at IG said: As we move out of the summer lull, there is a feeling that today will mark moment where things move into full swing once more. While volatility has been somewhat lacking owing to diminished summer volumes, the introduction of Autumn coupled with today\u2019s breakout in the FTSE 100 could set us up for a resurgent period in UK stocks. In the immediate wake of the weak US jobs data, the dollar stumbled, on the basis that a September rate rise now looked unlikely. But the US currency has bounced back, with a number of analysts still anticipating the Fed will hike borrowing costs in December. Against a basket of currencies, the dollar is now up 0.22% while the euro has slipped 0.3% against the US currency. Back with the earlier UK construction figures: If the US jobs data disappointed, then factory goods orders have shown their biggest increase in nine months. New orders for manufactured goods rose 1.9% in July after falling by 1.8% in the previous months, according to the Commerce Department. This was just shy of expectations of a rise of 2%. The June figure was revised up from an initially reported 1.5%. The chances of a September rate rise by the US Federal Reserve have dropped from 34% to 20% following the weaker than expected jobs data, according to Christopher Vecchio, currency analyst at DailyFX. But a hike in December is not off the table. Vecchio said: While almost every headline jobs growth read has been dubbed \u201cmost important non-farm payrolls\u201d for the last year and a half, this one certainly held importance. This report comes on the heels of Fed Chair Janet Yellen saying that recent economic data have supported the case for a rate hike and Vice Chair Stanley Fischer saying that the Fed cannot afford \u201cone and done.\u201d Immediately following the report, Fed funds futures contracts were implying a 20% chance of a rate hike in September, down from 34% ahead of the jobs data. Let\u2019s not mince words: after forecasting four rates hikes in 2016 at their December 2015 meeting, the Fed needs to hike at least once this year \u2013 December, most likely, when their last SEP of the year comes out \u2013 to save face. Dr. Harm Bandholz, chief US economist at UniCredit Research, is also suggesting a December move: The August employment report showed solid employment gains, a stable unemployment rate, but weaker details, notably a decline in the average workweek and softer average hourly earnings. As the August numbers have tended to come in on the softer side in the past, we think that this mostly reflects seasonal adjustment problems rather than underlying weakness. The report thus leaves the Fed on track for a rate hike in December \u2013 September seems to be off the table now. US investors have also got that Friday feeling, with markets rising in early trading: Dow Jones: + 0.4% at 18,498 S&amp;P 500: +0.4% at 2,180 Nasdaq: +0.4% at 5,250 As in Europe, there is relief on Wall Street that a September rate hike appears to be off the table. European investors are in an upbeat mood as the week draws to a close. Miners are behind much of the rise, as commodity prices rise on a weaker dollar, and sentiment has improved now that a US rate hike in September looks increasingly unlikely. FTSE 100: +1.5% at 6,850 Germany\u2019s DAX: +0.9% at 10,626 France\u2019s CAC: +1.6% at 4,509 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB: +0.6% at 17,030 Spain\u2019s IBEX: +1% at 8,847 Europe\u2019s STOXX 600: +1.2% at 348 The price of a barrel of Brent crude oil is up 1.7% at $46.24 after the weak US jobs report sent the dollar sharply lower. The US West Texas Intermediate futures rose 1.8% to $43.93 a barrel. Despite the rise, Brent crude is still on track for its biggest weekly decline since late July because of concerns about over supply. This is what happened to the euro v dollar immediately after payrolls: The US jobs report also showed the unemployment rate was unchanged at 4.9% in August. It was expected to ease slightly to 4.8%. Earnings growth of 0.1% was also weaker than July, when wages increased by 0.3%. Economists predicted 0.2% growth. James Knightley, a senior economist at ING, says the Fed is likely to wait until 2017 to raise rates (but a December hike is not off the table): The report doesn\u2019t support the case for a September rate hike, probably being more consistent with our current view that the first quarter of 2017 is the more likely point the Fed chooses to raise rates. After all inflation pressures are very benign and the US election has the potential to weigh on sentiment and activity a touch. On the other hand, an increasing number of Fed speakers have suggested that they are comfortable to hike rates despite relatively subdued employment growth meaning a December move should not be ruled out. Here is the full story on the US non-farm payrolls report: The pound hit a one-month high against the dollar after the weak US payrolls report, now up 0.4% at $1.3320. Reaction to those surprisingly weak US non-farm payrolls is coming in: Figures just out show non-farm payrolls were up 151,000 in August, disappointing forecasts of 180,000 and way below July\u2019s upwardly revised 275,000. This will pour cold water on expectations that the Fed will raise rates in September. US markets are expected to open lower: Five minutes until non-farm payrolls... The dollar is treading water ahead of the US employment figures due shortly. Against a basket of currencies it is down just 0.09% at 95.7, after falling 04% on Thursday after weaker than expected manufacturing figures. Meanwhile the pound has edged up 0.02% to $1.3270. The non-farm payrolls will give investors and economists further clues as to whether the US Federal Reserve is likely to increase interest rates at this month\u2019s meeting. Economists polled by Reuters believe the ECB will leave policy unchanged when the governing council meets next week. However, they believe eurozone policymakers will vote for an extension to their asset purchasing programme by the end of 2016. The ECB has been buying mostly government bonds for over a year, and currently at a rate of \u20ac80bn a month. Interest rates are at zero and deposit rates - those paid by banks to hold money at the central bank \u2013 are negative. Despite these measures, inflation is just 0.2%, well below the ECB\u2019s target of close to but just below 2%. Back in Dublin, a protestor from Irish campaign group Uplift is pictured with an open letter to the government, urging it to drop plans to appeal the EU\u2019s Apple tax ruling. The protestor is dressed as Snow White, the fairytale character offered a poisoned apple by the evil queen. Uplift wants the government to take the money - up to \u20ac13bn plus interest \u2013 from US tech giant Apple, and invest it in public services. The European Central Bank is moving into focus as policymakers get ready for business at next week\u2019s meeting. There has been mounting speculation that recently weak eurozone data will prompt ECB president Mario Draghi and his colleagues into action. But Peter Rosenstreich, head of market strategy at Swissquote Bank, says we shouldn\u2019t expect too much: It has been almost three months since the UK Brexit referendum and economic data in the eurozone seems largely unaffected. Given the general assessment that the eurozone has dodged a bullet, we suspect that the ECB will only marginally tweak forecasts and will be less likely to expand its easing programme. We expect that Draghi will opt for a wait-and-see strategy based on the impact of the Fed policy decisions. In the absence of any sudden shifts in Europe\u2019s economic outlook, the ECB will stay on the sidelines with its current policy mix. We anticipate that the ECB will wait for the December meeting before announcing any official extension to quantitative easing and combine it with further adjustments to economic projections. By December\u2019s meeting, the longer term effects of Brexit should begin to become more apparent. Some Twitter reaction now to the news this morning that Southern rail owner Go-Ahead made almost \u00a3100m profit last year despite the travel misery endured by its customers: An old ally of Taoiseach Enda Kenny has piled the pressure on the Irish Premier over the Apple tax debacle. Former Fine Gael minister Phil Hogan has urged the current Irish government to accept Brussels\u2019 ruling that Apple owes the Irish exchequer billions in unpaid tax. The former environment minister is now the EU commissioner for agriculture. Hogan confirmed on Friday that he joined the other 27 commissioners in Brussels in backing the ruling against Apple. He said it was a \u201ccollegiate decision\u201d made by every commissioner including himself. Hogan, who helped introduce the controversial water charges in Ireland as part of the last Fine Gael-Labour government, was Enda Kenny\u2019s nominee for the EU agriculture post. European markets are up as investors await the US payrolls report for August (published at 13.30 UK time). Ana Thaker, market economist at Phillip Capital, says markets are currently pricing in a 34% probability of a September rate hike: US non-farm payrolls promise to be crucial for markets on tenterhooks for data that could spur the Fed into a rate hike. The August payrolls figure could confirm speculation from FOMC members that the labour market is strong enough to withstand a rate hike. However, average hourly wages are set to drop a touch which could be used a reason to defer a rate hike further despite comments from both Yellen and her second in charge, Fischer. Yesterday\u2019s poor ISM PMIs saw the dollar fall rapidly and indicates the fragility of the currency. However, if the labour market proves to be robust, the FOMC may be left with no choice but to tighten despite weakness in other areas. In Ireland, 10,000 people have signed a petition urging the government to accept the EU ruling that Apple must pay up to \u20ac13bn in back taxes, and to drop plans to appeal the decision. The Guardian\u2019s Henry McDonald in Dublin reports that the petition is to be handed over to the Irish Parliament this morning by protestors, including one dressed up as Snow White: A petition containing 10,000 signatures is being handed over to the Irish parliament this morning urging Finance Minister Michael Noonan not to appeal against the EU ruling against Apple. Uplift, the organisers of the petition and protest, said one of their members dressed up as Snow White because she \u201cfamously ended up in a coma after being tricked into eating a poisoned apple.\u201d The \u20ac13 billion the EU believes Apple owes in tax to Ireland has become a politically poisonous issue which has split the Irish Cabinet. Fine Gael and Independent members of the minority coalition government have failed so far to reach an agreement on how to respond to the EU decision. The petition and protest on Friday highlights the political damage the row could inflict on a government that wants to defend Ireland\u2019s reputation as a low-tax bridgehead into the European market for mainly US based hi-tech multi-national corporations. The letter states: Dear Minister Noonan, Everyone has to pay their tax and that includes Apple, one of the world\u2019s most wealthy corporations. When they\u2019re allowed to avoid paying their tax bill, we all suffer. As the Minister for Finance you have a duty to protect and safeguard the interests of every man, woman and child in Ireland. You claim you do not have enough money in the public exchequer to ensure quality healthcare for everyone; to properly resource our schools and universities; to ensure every worker has a living wage, to end homelessness. Apple\u2019s tax bill would go a long way to solving these problems. We, the undersigned, remind you that you have a choice and an opportunity to stand up for the people of Ireland over the interests of Apple. We call on you to not appeal the decision that Apple owes Ireland \u20ac13bn. Don\u2019t stand in the way of Apple paying what they owe. Mike Chappell, construction expert at Lloyds commercial banking said the PMI survey was encouraging for the industry: The past month has seen a number of the bigger players in the sector report robust results with a relatively upbeat outlook, suggesting there may have been less negative impact from the EU referendum result than was originally feared, at least at the top of the market. This data provides further reassurance, although the headline reading still remains below 50, which separates growth from contraction. The order books of larger firms, many of which benefit from diversified revenue streams, appear to be in good shape, while several have either increased or restored their dividends. That said, anecdotal evidence indicates those further down the chain \u2013 such as mid-tier contractors and SMEs \u2013 are less bullish and more likely to adopt a \u2018wait and see\u2019 approach. The breakdown of the construction PMI shows civil engineering was the strongest part of the industry in August, rising to 50 from 47.1 in July. Housebuilding and commercial building such as offices and shops were still shrinking, but at slower rates than in July. Housebuilding rose to 48.2 from 45.6, while commercial rose to 48.2 from 43.9. Firms in the sector took on more workers last month, and were feeling the most confident about the business outlook in three months. At 49.2, the headline index suggests acivity in the construction sector has been shrinking for the past three months. Tim Moore, senior economist at Markit, said construction firms were still concerned about the Brexit vote: The downturn in UK construction activity has eased considerably since July, primarily helped by a much slower decline in commercial building. Construction firms cited a nascent recovery in client confidence since the EU referendum result and a relatively steady flow of invitations to tender in August. However, the latest survey indicates only a partial move towards stabilisation, rather than a return to business as usual across the construction sector. There were still widespread reports that Brexit uncertainty had dampened demand and slowed progress on planned developments, especially in relation to large projects. Despite another month of reduced output, the latest figures can be viewed as welcome news overall after a challenging summer for the construction sector. Britain\u2019s construction sector was in better shape than expected in August according to the Markit/CIPS PMI. The headline index increased to 49.2 from 45.9 in July, beating City forecasts of a smaller rise to 46.1. The sector was still shrinking however, as any number below 50 signals contraction. But the rate of contraction slowed nevertheless. A report published overnight by YouGov and Cebr showed a rebound in UK business confidence in August. It followed a sharp drop in July, the month after the Brexit vote, and is the latest sign that initial panic over the referendum result has subsided. The index rose to 109.7 in August from 105 in July. Confidence was lower than before the EU vote however, with the index at 112.6 in June. Scott Corfe, director at Cebr: The dust is settling on the EU vote and businesses are showing signs of resilience, for now at least. With the post-Brexit panic abating and many indicators signalling a reasonably robust short-term outlook, businesses are suggesting a greater confidence for the coming 12 months when it comes to their own operations. However, one red flag in these figures is the level of pessimism about the UK economy that the Brexit vote has engendered in British businesses. If these concerns materialise into reality, businesses could rapidly rein in their investment and hiring plans.\u201d The rail union RMT has responded with anger to the news that Southern rail owner Go-Ahead made almost \u00a3100m in profit last year while commuters suffered travel misery. General secretary Mick Cash says: While Go-Ahead have been driving Britain\u2019s biggest rail franchise into total meltdown the cash has been sloshing through the boardroom at obscene levels. This is reward for total failure on a scale which is off the map. Just a fraction of these profits would be enough to keep the guards on Southern trains, keep the passengers safe and resolve the industrial dispute between RMT and the company. It is shameful that they have opted to hoard cash instead of protecting the travelling public. It is also deeply cynical that Southern/Go-Ahead have brought forward this mega profit announcement so it doesn\u2019t clash with the strike action by guards next week. They are a money-raking disaster that has turned Britain\u2019s railways into a global laughing stock and they should be slung out and replaced by the public sector option. The pound is roughly flat this morning. It is up 0.02% against the dollar at $1.3270, and up 0.1% against the euro at \u20ac1.1857. Analysts are pondering whether this might be the bottom for the pound for the time being. It has fallen by about 10% since the 23 June Brexit vote, but the latest data suggests the economy performed better than expected in August. The FTSE 100 is up 24 points or 0.4% in early trading, making up some of Thursday\u2019s lost ground. This is how markets across Europe are looking: FTSE 100: +0.4% at 6,770 Germany\u2019s DAX: -0.1% at 10,523 France\u2019s CAC: +0.2% at 4,448 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB: +0.4% at 16,987 Spain\u2019s IBEX: -0.2% at 8,750 Europe\u2019s STOXX: -0.01% at 344 Connor Campbell at Spreadex, says the UK construction PMI at 9.30 could be interesting to markets following the August surge in manufacturing. After taking a hit following the pound\u2019s post-manufacturing PMI surge the FTSE is aiming to regain some of the ground it lost this Friday, jumping just shy of half a percent as the European session got underway. With most of the focus on the US non-farm jobs report this afternoon there isn\u2019t much for investors to deal with this morning. Nevertheless one would imagine that considering that shock boost to manufacturing in August the markets will be interested to see whether or not the UK construction sector has seen a similar recovery. Any positive surprise to the construction PMI will likely benefit the pound more than the FTSE, even if sterling used up quite a lot of its market goodwill yesterday. Frequent travellers on Southern rail services might not be best pleased to hear its parent company Go-Ahead made a \u00a399.8m profit in the last year, up 27%. It follows a summer of commuter misery for passengers faced with delays, cancellations, and suspended routes at the hands of Southern rail. Go-Ahead said its chief executive David Brown would forgo his annual bonus and declined a pay rise. Brown said: Southern services have been disrupted by restricted network capacity, strike action and increased levels of absence. We apologise to the people whose lives have been affected during this time. We continue to work closely with the Department for Transport, Network Rail and other suppliers and partners to operate the best service possible while delivering the long term improvements. Read the full story on the results here. For an alternative perspective, follow the Guardian\u2019s Martin Belam who is live blogging his way around Southern rail services this morning: European markets are expected to open higher today before the US jobs data: The FTSE 100 closed down 0.5% on Thursday, despite a major and unexpected rebound in the UK manufacturing PMI survey for August. Jasper Lawler at CMC Markets explains: There was some divergence between UK stock indices on Thursday with the FTSE 250 ending the day over half a percent higher whilst the FTSE 100 lost 0.5%. The divergence came about as a result of a surprise return to expansion for the UK manufacturing industry in August. Investors pulled funds out of multinationals exposed to a stronger pound and reallocated them into domestically focused firms that benefit from a resilient UK economy. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. It\u2019s non-farm payrolls day. And this one takes on major significance for investors as it the last one before the next policy meeting of the US Federal Reserve on 20-21 September. Janet Yellen, the Fed\u2019s chair, and her colleagues on the FOMC have repeatedly stated they will look to the latest data before making their decision. The payrolls report is the crucial indicator on the state of the US jobs market, and economists are expecting the August report to show an increase of 180,000, following a 255,000 increase in July. Any number in line with or above forecasts will fuel expectations of a rate hike this month. Any number below will have the opposite effect, especially following Thursday\u2019s weak ISM manufacturing report for August.",

Nick Dearden, the charity\u2019s director, said: \u201cThe vast wealth and power of corporations is at the heart of so many of the world\u2019s problems \u2013 like inequality and climate change. \u201cThe drive for short-term profits today seems to trump basic human rights for millions of people on the planet. These figures show the problem is getting worse.\u201d Global Justice Now said it released the figures to increase pressure on the British government ahead of a UN working group, led by Ecuador, that aims to draw up a binding treaty \u201cto ensure transnational corporations abide by the full range of human rights responsibilities\u201d. Campaigners said they are calling for the treaty to be legally enforceable at a national and global level. The charity has criticised Britain for refusing to support the process. Dearden said: \u201cThe UK government has facilitated this rise in corporate power through tax structures, trade deals and even aid programmes that help big business. \u201cTheir wholehearted support for the US-EU trade deal TTIP, is just the latest example of government help to big business. Disgracefully, it also routinely opposes the call of developing countries to hold corporations to account for their human rights impacts at the UN.\u201d",

The letter from Business Roundtable, which was also sent to senior politicians including the German finance minister, Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble, the European Union president, Donald Tusk, and the US secretary of state, John Kerry, echoed the threat. It said the commission\u2019s actions \u201cpromote tax uncertainty \u2013 and unless overturned they will disrupt trade and investment, with the most direct consequences to be borne directly by EU countries and their citizens\u201d. The letter called on member states to \u201cput an end to the use of state aid investigations that will hamper economic growth by undermining cross-border investment\u201d. The group has previously lashed out against what it perceives as Europe\u2019s \u201cnew and dangerous form of protectionism\u201d amid tax investigations into American firms such as Starbucks, McDonald\u2019s and Amazon. The commission\u2019s ruling against Apple was based on its objection to an agreement allowing Apple to pay a maximum tax rate of just 1%. In 2014, the tech firm paid tax at 0.005%. The usual rate of corporation tax in Ireland is 12.5%. The commission said Ireland\u2019s tax arrangements with Apple between 1991 and 2015 had allowed the US company to attribute sales to a \u201chead office\u201d that only existed on paper and could not have generated such profits. The result was that Apple avoided tax on almost all the profit generated from its multibillion-euro sales of iPhones and other products across the EU\u2019s single market. It booked the profits in Ireland rather than the country in which the product was sold.",

                "bodyText":"Amber Rudd\u2019s business career has come under scrutiny following a Guardian investigation that reveals her involvement with two companies in an offshore tax haven, and another where her co-director was jailed for fraud. A fresh leak of tax haven data names the home secretary as having been a director of two companies in the Bahamas \u2013 a fact she did not refer to earlier this year when defending David Cameron over his father\u2019s investment fund in the same country. The Guardian has also discovered new details about her previous career in venture capital during the boom and bust 1990s. One enterprise led her to become a co-director of Monticello, a company that was at the centre of a share ramping investigation. She was also involved in a company prospecting for diamonds in Siberia that was traded on a notoriously unregulated stock exchange. Rudd said that her career in business prior to politics was public knowledge but declined to answer questions, including whether she had invested in the Bahamas companies or whether either company had paid tax in the UK. A rising star of the Conservative party, Rudd has provided scant details about her career before she became an MP in 2010. Though there is no suggestion she was involved in any wrongdoing, the disclosures may cause her some embarrassment, particularly as pressure grows to crack down on tax avoidance and governments demand more transparency from offshore regimes. The home secretary\u2019s name appears in a cache of company data from the Bahamas, a Caribbean tax haven that imposes no income, corporate or wealth taxes on individuals investing in offshore companies. The data, leaked to the German newspaper S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung and shared with the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists, constitutes a list of directors of 175,000 Bahamas registered companies. The files name Rudd as having been a director of two Bahamas companies, Advanced Asset Allocation Fund and Advanced Asset Allocation Management, between 1998 and 2000. Records at Companies House also identify her as a director of Monticello plc, which became the centre of an investigation into share ramping after one of her co-directors, Mark O\u2019Hanlon, gave an interview in January 2000 in which he made false claims about the company\u2019s prospects. Monticello\u2019s share price subsequently skyrocketed and trading on its shares was suspended. Rudd resigned as a board member five months later, two days before she also resigned as director of Advanced Asset Allocation Management. The episode led the Department of Trade and Industry to investigate, and in 2007 O\u2019Hanlon was convicted of making a false statement and sentenced to 18 months\u2019 imprisonment. He was jailed again in June 2013 following an unrelated fraud conviction. Prior to Monticello, Rudd was involved in a number of other ventures. The Guardian can disclose she was: The executive director of Kensington Resources, a company headquartered in Mayfair in London that financed diamond prospecting in Saskatchewan, Canada. Appointed president in 1994 of another mining company, Siberian Pacific Resources Inc. Rudd raised 500,000 Canadian dollars for a joint venture with a group of Russian geologists searching for diamonds in Siberia. A director of The Zinc Corporation plc, a company exploring a new technique for zinc extraction. In 1997 the company hoped to go public on the lightly regulated stock exchange Ofex. However, the plans were dropped after it misplaced a cheque for \u00a312,500, according to an interview in which Rudd was quoted. Shortly after the company was bought by Monticello. Shares in both Kensington and Siberian were traded on the Vancouver Stock Exchange, which prior to its closure in 1999 had a reputation for being poorly regulated. A report commissioned by the finance ministry of British Columbia described a small number of successful enterprises \u201covershadowed by the continuing occurrence of shams, swindles and market manipulations\u201d. Rudd supported Cameron earlier this year after the Panama Papers revealed the inner workings of his father\u2019s Blairmore fund, which was run from the Bahamas and incorporated in Panama. Although legal, the unorthodox structure resulted in the fund paying no tax in Britain for three decades.

                "body":"<p>Apple has been linked with a shock \u00a31.5bn deal to buy McLaren Technology Group, the Formula One team owner and supercar maker.<br></p> <p>A deal between Apple and the British company would dramatically shake up the technology and automotive industries. The California-based company\u2019s interest in McLaren Technology Group highlights its ambition to develop technology that could be used in an electric and driverless car.</p> <p>Apple has approached McLaren about a takeover but could also make a strategic investment in the company, the Financial Times reported.</p> <p>McLaren denied that it was in talks with Apple, but it said: \u201cAs you would expect, the nature of our business means we regularly have confidential conversations with a wide range of parties, and they need to remain so.</p> <p>\u201cWe can confirm that McLaren is not in discussion with Apple in respect of any potential investment.\u201d</p> <p>Apple said it \u201cdoes not comment on rumours or speculation\u201d.</p> <p>McLaren builds supercars such as the P1, which costs \u00a3866,000 and includes ground-breaking technology such as a lightweight electric motor, carbon fibre body panel, and on-board computer systems. The company is also developing a range of technologies for use in healthcare, energy and transport. </p> <p>Ron Dennis, the chair and chief executive, has expanded the company dramatically from its origins in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/mclaren\">Formula One</a>, where it is one of the<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/27/mclaren-triumphs-spa-francorchamps-belgian-grand-prix-f1\"> most successful teams in the history of the sport</a> despite struggling in recent seasons. The company is based in Woking, Surrey, in a futuristic headquarters designed by Norman Foster.</p> <p>Dennis would be in line for a multimillion-pound windfall if a deal with Apple goes through. He owns 25% of McLaren Technology Group while Tag Group, a Luxembourg-based holding company led by Mansour Ojjeh, owns another 25% and Bahrain\u2019s sovereign wealth fund Bahrain Mumtalakat holds the other half of the business.</p> <p>McLaren Technology Group\u2019s last financial results show the company recorded sales of \u00a3266m in 2014 and a pre-tax loss of \u00a323m. It produces roughly 1,500 cars a year but has pledged to spend \u00a31bn on research and development over the next six years.</p> <p>Analysts said a move for McLaren would make sense for Apple. Neil Campling, analyst at Northern Trust Capital Markets, said it would provide Apple with \u201cinstant credibility\u201d in the automotive industry and that the companies had \u201can unusual level of compatibility in design and business outlook\u201d. </p> <p>He added: \u201cThe attractiveness of McLaren \u2013 the designer of very high-end automotive products on and off the race track \u2013 to Apple, with its own reputation for design-centricity and technological expertise, is quite obvious. McLaren\u2019s tagline could almost be Apple\u2019s \u2013 \u2018Designed and Engineered to Win\u2019.</p> <p>\u201cApple has the balance sheet to do it \u2013 they could do the deal for only a fortnight\u2019s free cash flow \u2013 and there are logical commonalities in business model. Perhaps the real jewel in McLaren\u2019s crown from Apple\u2019s perspective is its applied technologies business, the [research and development] lab born from their Formula One expertise.</p> <p>\u201cIf, as has been rumoured for some time, Apple is serious about the autonomous vehicle market, buying McLaren gives them instant credibility in the sector and brings with it an unusual level of compatibility in design and business outlook. It won\u2019t shift the Apple dial much on its own so we read it as a statement of intent regarding autonomous vehicles.\u201d</p> <p>Apple rarely makes acquisitions, and a takeover of McLaren would be its biggest deal since it bought the Beats headphone brand for $3bn (\u00a32.3bn) in 2014.<br></p> <p>The US company is understood to have been developing a driverless car in a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/aug/14/apple-self-driving-car-project-titan-sooner-than-expected\">secretive project codenamed Project Titan.</a> However, a number of workers have left the initiative in recent months, leading to speculation that Apple is struggling with its design or director. </p> <p>Tim Cook, the chief executive of Apple, has never publicly acknowledged the project. </p> <p>Kelley Blue Book, the US automotive research group, said McLaren\u2019s cars were popular in Silicon Valley. Phil Schiller, senior vice president for worldwide marketing at Apple, owns a McLaren.</p> <p>Michael Harley, analyst at Kelley Blue Book, said: \u201cApple\u2019s potential acquisition of McLaren isn\u2019t nearly as far-fetched as its initially sounds. Apple has been rumoured, but never officially confirmed, to be working on an electric car. McLaren is well-known as a manufacturer of high-performance sports and racing cars, but its true expertise is in engineering lightweight materials such as carbon fibre and aluminum, both of which are key building blocks to designing an innovative lightweight vehicle. </p> <p>\u201cCombine McLaren\u2019s many proprietary patents with its proficiency in race technology, hi-tech medical devices, and research, and the two do appear to be a perfect match for each other.\u201d </p>",

The California-based company\u2019s interest in McLaren Technology Group highlights its ambition to develop technology that could be used in an electric and driverless car. Apple has approached McLaren about a takeover but could also make a strategic investment in the company, the Financial Times reported. McLaren denied that it was in talks with Apple, but it said: \u201cAs you would expect, the nature of our business means we regularly have confidential conversations with a wide range of parties, and they need to remain so. \u201cWe can confirm that McLaren is not in discussion with Apple in respect of any potential investment.\u201d Apple said it \u201cdoes not comment on rumours or speculation\u201d. McLaren builds supercars such as the P1, which costs \u00a3866,000 and includes ground-breaking technology such as a lightweight electric motor, carbon fibre body panel, and on-board computer systems. The company is also developing a range of technologies for use in healthcare, energy and transport. Ron Dennis, the chair and chief executive, has expanded the company dramatically from its origins in Formula One, where it is one of the most successful teams in the history of the sport despite struggling in recent seasons. The company is based in Woking, Surrey, in a futuristic headquarters designed by Norman Foster. Dennis would be in line for a multimillion-pound windfall if a deal with Apple goes through. He owns 25% of McLaren Technology Group while Tag Group, a Luxembourg-based holding company led by Mansour Ojjeh, owns another 25% and Bahrain\u2019s sovereign wealth fund Bahrain Mumtalakat holds the other half of the business. McLaren Technology Group\u2019s last financial results show the company recorded sales of \u00a3266m in 2014 and a pre-tax loss of \u00a323m. It produces roughly 1,500 cars a year but has pledged to spend \u00a31bn on research and development over the next six years. Analysts said a move for McLaren would make sense for Apple. Neil Campling, analyst at Northern Trust Capital Markets, said it would provide Apple with \u201cinstant credibility\u201d in the automotive industry and that the companies had \u201can unusual level of compatibility in design and business outlook\u201d. He added: \u201cThe attractiveness of McLaren \u2013 the designer of very high-end automotive products on and off the race track \u2013 to Apple, with its own reputation for design-centricity and technological expertise, is quite obvious. McLaren\u2019s tagline could almost be Apple\u2019s \u2013 \u2018Designed and Engineered to Win\u2019. \u201cApple has the balance sheet to do it \u2013 they could do the deal for only a fortnight\u2019s free cash flow \u2013 and there are logical commonalities in business model. Perhaps the real jewel in McLaren\u2019s crown from Apple\u2019s perspective is its applied technologies business, the [research and development] lab born from their Formula One expertise. \u201cIf, as has been rumoured for some time, Apple is serious about the autonomous vehicle market, buying McLaren gives them instant credibility in the sector and brings with it an unusual level of compatibility in design and business outlook. It won\u2019t shift the Apple dial much on its own so we read it as a statement of intent regarding autonomous vehicles.\u201d Apple rarely makes acquisitions, and a takeover of McLaren would be its biggest deal since it bought the Beats headphone brand for $3bn (\u00a32.3bn) in 2014. The US company is understood to have been developing a driverless car in a secretive project codenamed Project Titan. However, a number of workers have left the initiative in recent months, leading to speculation that Apple is struggling with its design or director. Tim Cook, the chief executive of Apple, has never publicly acknowledged the project. Kelley Blue Book, the US automotive research group, said McLaren\u2019s cars were popular in Silicon Valley. Phil Schiller, senior vice president for worldwide marketing at Apple, owns a McLaren. Michael Harley, analyst at Kelley Blue Book, said: \u201cApple\u2019s potential acquisition of McLaren isn\u2019t nearly as far-fetched as its initially sounds. Apple has been rumoured, but never officially confirmed, to be working on an electric car. McLaren is well-known as a manufacturer of high-performance sports and racing cars, but its true expertise is in engineering lightweight materials such as carbon fibre and aluminum, both of which are key building blocks to designing an innovative lightweight vehicle. \u201cCombine McLaren\u2019s many proprietary patents with its proficiency in race technology, hi-tech medical devices, and research, and the two do appear to be a perfect match for each other.\u201d",

                "bodyText":"Ding ding ding.... the closing bell on the New York stock exchange has been rung. And the US stock market has lost almost 1%, as investors brace for tonight\u2019s clash between the two candidates to become US president. The Dow Jones industrial average lost 166 points, or 0.91%, with almost every component dropping. Banks were the big fallers (who caught a cold from the troubles at Deutsche Bank). The S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq both dropped by 0.8%, following heavier losses in Europe with Britain suffering its worst day since late June. And as we covered earlier, Analysts are predicting further losses if Trump outperforms in the debate the VIX fear index has hit a two week high. Investors are betting against the Mexican Peso - anticipating a Trump victory And US, German and UK government bonds have jumped, as traders scramble for safety tonight. But now, there\u2019s nothing more that investors can do. They must just wait to see how the first presidential debate plays out. And with the polls so close, it could be a real classic.... My colleagues will be live-blogging all the action here: I\u2019ll be back in the morning to see how the markets react. Until then, good nght and thanks for reading and commenting. GW Donald Trump hasn\u2019t released a massive amount of detail about his policy platform if he becomes president. That\u2019s one reason the markets are nervous about the presidential race. But despite that, City firm Columbia Threadneedle have taken a stab at the potential impact of a Trump victory. They reckon infrastructure providers should benefit, if Trump does launch a massive programme of building more roads, bridges, and the like. But that means more borrowing, which could get expensive. Mark Burgess of Columbia explains: Trump has made some disconcerting comments regarding a lack of commitment to debt repayments. If a substantial global event like the financial crisis were to occur again, this may mean domestic debt is paid while foreign debt remains outstanding. Could this deter investors? This would be particularly unfortunate as Treasury issuance is likely to increase significantly in order to fund the various costly proposals as the US racks up larger deficits. Richard Scalone, co-head of foreign exchange at TJM Brokerage in Chicago, says US election uncertainty isn\u2019t helping the dollar. He told Reuters that: \u201cMost market participants are waiting to see what comes out of the debate tonight and will take their cue from there.\u201d US Treasuries (American government debt) have rallied today, on nervousness ahead of tonight\u2019s debate. This has pushed the yield (or interest rates) on 10-year Treasury bonds down to 1.587%, from 1.6% on Friday. It\u2019s another sign that investors are looking for safety tonight. As Kim Rupert, managing director for fixed income at Action Economics in San Francisco, put it: \u201cA lot of the gains in Treasuries are safe-haven trades....Stocks are also looking pretty weak with a lot of concerns about financials with Deutsche Bank.\u201d Hillary Clinton has a five point lead over Donald Trump, according to the latest weekly tracking poll from NBC News. But that follows a Bloomberg poll this morning putting the two candidates level (and Trump ahead, in a four-way fight). And polling expert Nate Silver believes it is too close to call: Stocks are still down on Wall Street, with just under an hour to go until the closing bell. The Dow is currently off 159 points, or 0.8%, at 18101 -- a level it\u2019s been hovering around for most of the day, really. The S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq are showing similar losses. Bank shares continue to get a kicking; Goldman and JP Morgan are both down 2.5% (due to the worries over Deutsche Bank). Walt Disney is now among the fallers too, down 1.7%, following a report it might bid for Twitter. CNN aren\u2019t pulling their punches -- they predict that stock markets will probably tumble on Tuesday if Trump wins tonight\u2019s debate. Here\u2019s a flavour: Wall Street doesn\u2019t want a President Trump (with the exception of a few hedge fund managers and Trump supporters, like Carl Icahn). As the old saying goes, the market loves good news, it can deal with bad news, but it hates uncertainty. And Trump is the motherlode of uncertainty. \u201cThe typical investor just can\u2019t contemplate the possibility of a Trump victory,\u201d says Cary Leahey, chief U.S. economist at Decision Economics.... So the closer the race gets, the more worried investors become.... \u201cIf for some reason Trump puts on a presidential showing...and Clinton stumbles for whatever reason, then the market may take another reassessment,\u201d says Leahey. That\u2019s the polite way of saying, stocks are likely to fall. More here: Donald Trump\u2019s protectionist rhetoric is a particular worry for Wall Street. CNBC\u2019s Elizabeth Gurdus reports that: \u201cI think neither candidate has super market-friendly policies,\u201d Dean Curnutt, CEO of Macro Risk Advisors, said on CNBC. \u201cBoth have been reasonably anti-trade. Clinton was pulled pretty far left by Bernie Sanders. Trump\u2019s policies really resemble very little of what we typically associate with free-market Republicanism.\u201d Trump\u2019s attacks on Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen add another dollop of instability to the pot. If he wins in November, Yellen might not bank on getting a second term. Mexico\u2019s manufacturers might want to raise a glass to Donald Trump; by weakening the peso, he\u2019s made their exports much more competitive: The US dollar is already dropping against the yen, even before the two nominees take to the stage in New York. One dollar now gets you 100.29 yen in the FX market, down 0.7% compared to Friday, when your greenback was worth 101.1 yen. That won\u2019t amuse the Tokyo government much; Japan wants to weaken its currency to push inflation up. The US, Canada, Brazil and Mexico stock markets are all down today, following losses across Europe. It\u2019s more of an adjustment than a rout, though - with Wall Street losing less than 1% so far. Most European market shed less than 2% (they\u2019re all closed now) There could be a surge of money into safe-havens if Donald Trump outperforms expectations on tonight\u2019s debate, City experts say. Chris Beauchamp of IG predicts that the Japanese Yen and US government bonds (Treasuries) could both benefit: Tonight\u2019s US presidential election debate is a major event for financial markets, with risky assets likely to see significant volatility, should Trump manage to further build on the gains he has made over recent weeks. Despite significant movements towards Trump in recent polls, IG clients perceive there still to be a 62% chance of a Clinton win, according to the IG binary market. That being said, Hilary remains a somewhat uninspiring personality and there is a distinct risk that tonight\u2019s debate could see the polls tighten even further, thus driving investors towards havens such as the yen and Treasuries. Some investors are looking at the Presidential Race as a serious chance to make money. The rest are just worried about losing what they\u2019ve already got. But how do you trade, say, a Donald Trump victory? Well, Mexico\u2019s currency has emerged as a surprise proxy for the Upset To End All Upsets. When Trump does well, or Hillary Clinton has a bad day, the Mexicon peso often takes a pasting. This chart shows how the peso has weakened since April, from 17 to the $1 to almost 20/$1 today. And the pressure is getting worse -- bets against the poor old Peso have hit a record high and the cost of insuring against future losses has spiked. Trump\u2019s vow to build a wall on the Mexican border means the country is at \u201cthe sharp end of \u2018Trump risk\u2019\u201d, says Nicholas Spiro a partner at London-based Lauressa Advisory Ltd. More here: Mexican Peso Shorts at Record Ahead of U.S. Election Debate Volatility is also rising on Wall Street today as the race to the White House hots up. The CBOE Market Volatility index, or VIX (commonly known as the \u201cfear gauge\u201d) is up 1.9% today - the biggest rise in a fortnight. Reuters has more details: With just over six weeks until Election Day, some investors see a toss-up contest creating volatility in certain sectors, including health insurers, drugmakers and industrials. \u201cInvestors are acting extremely nervous with regards to the debate ... and it highlights the fact that the markets are not focusing on the health of the economy, interest rates and geopolitical events,\u201d said Robert Pavlik, chief market strategist at Boston Private Wealth. Wall Street banks Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan are the biggest fallers on the Dow Jones industrial average today. They\u2019re both down around 1.8%, as financial stocks suffer from worries over the health of Germany\u2019s Deutsche Bank. Consumer group Procter &amp; Gamble and tech giant Apple are among the few risers, but most stocks have dropped as investors await for tonight\u2019s debate (in just under 8 hours time). Over in Greece the former deputy premier Evangelos Venizelos has warned the country faces political, social and economic disintegration as financial indicators worsen and the government scrambles to push through long overdue reforms. Helena Smith reports from Athens: Venizelos, finance minister at the height of the Greek debt crisis, issued a withering assessment of the government\u2019s performance in office. In a speech to businessmen on the future of Greece at the Thessaloniki chamber of commerce and industry the politician said the country was in danger of \u201cinstitutional, economic and social collapse\u201d because the leftist-led coalition lacked a strategic plan to exit its long-running debt crisis. Instead, he claimed, ministers were working to the slogan \u201cwe are doing well and will do better\u201d and were turning a blind eye to real problems as the nation\u2019s real economy plummeted. \u201cThe government is making out as if it doesn\u2019t understand how critical things are. Its theory \u2018we are doing well and will do better\u2019 is a spring that will pop up.\u201d Venizelos, whose Pasok socialist party was in office with the main opposition conservatives until being ejected by Syriza, the radical left group led by prime minister Alexis Tsipras, spoke as the government prepared to push more creditor-mandated reforms through parliament tomorrow. Some \u20ac2.8bn worth of aid is at stake. After a summer of little progress, the aim is for parliament to legislate on the 15 milestone actions by the time the Euro Working Group meets on Thursday. The reforms, which include appointment of officials to a new privatisation fund\u2019s supervisory board, are expedient if a second bailout review is to begin and debt relief talks officially opened. Earlier on Monday the European Commission Vice-President Valdis Dombrovskis said the thrice-bailed out nation had been forced to endure more punitive austerity than otherwise necessary because of Tsipras\u2019 populist pledge to end the policies when he assumed power in January 2015. \u201cPopulism doesn\u2019t solve problems. Populism creates problems,\u201d he told a conference in Riga. \u201cWe could see that in the \u2026 classical example of Greece. A new government came with a populist stance, that \u2018we don\u2019t need any austerity regimes, we will spend as much as we want\u2019 \u2026 and, in fact, Greece now implements tougher austerity measures than it would have been necessary if [reforms] of the previous government were continued at the time.\u201d Meanwhile: Britain will get no favours in the Brexit discussions, ECB president Mario Draghi hinted in his testimony to the European parliament. In his opening speech Draghi - the latest to suggest Europe will take a tough line in the negotiations - said: Regardless of the type of relationship that emerges between the European Union and the United Kingdom, it is of utmost importance that the integrity of the single market is respected. Any outcome should ensure that all participants are subject to the same rules. He added (as quoted by Bloomberg): It is very hard to imagine that any agreement that will be perceived as discriminatory against some subjects or in favor of other subjects could be a source of stability for the future of our EU. A cocktail of concerns - from the forthcoming US presidential debate to worries about Brexit to uncertainty over the outcome of the current oil producers meeting in Algeria to a new drop in Deutsch Bank shares - combined to send European markets sharply lower at the start of the trading week. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished down 91.39 points or 1.32% - its biggest one day percentage fall since the immediate aftermath of the Brexit vote - at 6818.04 Germany\u2019s Dax dropped 2.19% to 10,393.71 France\u2019s Cac closed 1.8% lower at 4407.85 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB fell 1.58% to 16,192.48 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended down 1.27% at 8711.4 In Greece, the Athens market lost 1.82% to 563.59 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 143 points or 0.78%. Bookmaker Ladbrokes has sent its buzzword bingo odds for the presidential debate, and here they are: 1/10 Make America Great Again 1/5 Commander In Chief 1/2 Lying 1/2 Putin 4/6 Crooked Evens Pneumonia Evens Pennsylvania Evens Terrific 5/4 Mexico\u2019s Gonna Pay For It 6/4 Unbelievable 6/4 Reagan 6/4 Basket Of Deplorables 2/1 Racist 2/1 Founding Fathers 2/1 You\u2019re Fired 3/1 Washington Bubble 4/1 Total Loser 5/1 Brexit 5/1 Give Me A Break 10/1 Monica Lewinsky 20/1 How the Hell Should I Know 20/1 How\u2019s Your Cold 33/1 You\u2019re No Jack Kennedy Some good news for Hillary and the reverse for Trump: Back with the race to become US president, and the market\u2019s reaction ahead of the head-to-head debate, Jasper Lawler, market analyst at CMC Markets, said: Stocks in the US opened lower. A number of forecasters have raised their odds of a Donald Trump presidency ahead of the first of the presidential debates Monday evening. It\u2019s Clinton the Wall Street darling versus Trump the Wall-builder. With shares near highs of the year, it seems fair to say that markets have so far discounted the probability of a Donald Trump victory. Mrs Clinton is seen as a continuation of the status quo, which hasn\u2019t exactly provided stellar growth and economic opportunity for America\u2019s poorest in the last decade. Donald Trump wants to shake up the status quo, from a market\u2019s perspective that necessarily means uncertainty. Meanwhile IG still reckons Hillary Clinton is still more likely to win the election. IG\u2019s market analyst Joshua Mahony said: Tonight\u2019s US presidential election debate is a major event for financial markets, with risky assets likely to see significant volatility, should Trump manage to further build on the gains he has made over recent weeks. Despite significant movements towards Trump in recent polls, IG clients perceive there still to be a 62% chance of a Clinton win, according to the IG binary market. That being said, Hilary remains a somewhat uninspiring personality and there is a distinct risk that tonight\u2019s debate could see the polls tighten even further, thus driving investors towards havens such as the yen and Treasuries. Asked about Deutsche Bank - whose shares have fallen sharply today - Draghi refuses to comment. And on Brexit, he says the ECB does not have an official role in the negotiations but may work in an advisory capacity. In questions Draghi repeats this theme: It is clear other policies should complement monetary policy action to reap all the benefits of the present monetary policy stance. He adds that if other policies are in place, the time for monetary policy stance to be successful would be shorter. And he admits that having low interest rates for longer would have side effects on financial stability. In his conclusion Draghi again suggests the ECB needs others - politicians particularly - to step up and do their bit for the EU: For the euro area to thrive, actions by national governments are needed to unleash growth, reduce unemployment and empower individuals, while offering essential protections for the most vulnerable.... The political commitment underpinning our single currency has been strongly reaffirmed during the crisis. Important efforts have been made. But widespread feelings of insecurity, including economic insecurity, remain a major concern. We cannot simply wait for better times: we need to renew our efforts to ensure that Economic and Monetary Union offers protection and prosperity. The ECB will do its part. On the effect of low (and indeed negative) interest rates, he said: Low rates are a symptom of the underlying economic situation. They reflect weak long-term growth trends and the protracted macroeconomic slump that has resulted from the crisis. The ECB\u2019s monetary policy has provided significant accommodation to limit the negative effects of the global and euro area-specific shocks on the economy, thereby mitigating their disinflationary impact. Nevertheless, monetary policy cannot determine the sustainable level of real interest rates in the long run, as they in turn depend on long-term growth prospects. This means that other policy actors need to do their part, pursuing fiscal and structural policies which will contribute to a self-sustaining recovery and increase the economic growth potential of the euro area, as I discussed with you in June. Mario Draghi\u2019s opening remarks to the European Parliament have been released, and the European Central Bank president said that so far the European economy has stood up to the challenge of Brexit, so far: The recovery in the euro area is expected to continue at a moderate and steady pace, but with slightly less momentum than envisaged in June. On the positive side, incoming information continues to point to the euro area economy being resilient to global and political uncertainty, notably following the UK referendum outcome. The initial impact of the vote has been contained and the strong financial market reactions, such as equity price falls, have largely reversed.... The extent to which the economic outlook will be affected depends on the timing, development and final outcome of the upcoming negotiations. So far, the euro area economy has been resilient, but due to this uncertainty our baseline scenario remains subject to downside risks. Regardless of the type of relationship that emerges between the European Union and the United Kingdom, it is of utmost importance that the integrity of the single market is respected. Any outcome should ensure that all participants are subject to the same rules. The full speech is here. A bit of US economic news, and new home sales fell less than expected in August. The Commerce Department said sales of single family homes fell 7.6% to 609,000 compared to expectations of a decline to 600,000. July\u2019s figure was revised up by 5,000 units to 659,000. Here\u2019s our US live blog of latest developments in the presidential race ahead of the Clinton-Trump debate: Back with the US debate, and Robert Shapiro of advisory firm Sonecon has looked at the economic prospects under the two candidates: Trump says he\u2019ll restore 4% annual growth, or double our current rate. But his plan to achieve it is a deceit that would actually slow growth by deporting part of the labor force and ignoring everyone\u2019s productivity. There\u2019s no silver bullet, but Hillary\u2019s program would help. Her path to citizenship and commitments to pay equity, child care assistance, universal health coverage, and more would expand the labor force. Furthermore, her pledges for tuition-free college, more support for R&amp;D, and more access to loans for young businesses would all help raise productivity. It\u2019s an easy choice. His full post is here. Elsewhere Mario Draghi, the head of the European Central Bank, is due to make his regular appearance before the European Parliament within the next half hour or so. He normally reads out his last governing council statement before being quizzed by MEPs, with Brexit of course high on the agenda. The session should be available here. As expected US markets are falling in early trading, ahead of the presidential debate between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump. Investors are also jittery as oil producers meet in Algeria, with few expecting any positive decisions to curb the slump in the crude price although some are at least hoping for guidance that something may be done at Opec\u2019s November meeting. The uncertainty over Brexit is not helping, nor is concern about Deutsche Bank after its shares fell sharply. So the Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 105 points or 0.5%, while the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq Composite opened down a similar amount. You can get psyched up for tonight\u2019s presidential debate by reading Dan Robert\u2019s list of 10 awkward question for the two candidates. Hillary Clinton should be ready for probing questions on globalisation, her counter-terrorism strategy and secrecy issues, while Donald Trump will need answers on his Middle East strategy, his suitability (or otherwise) for the most powerful job in the world, and whether he regrets anything he\u2019s said during this most remarkable campaign. It\u2019s been a bad morning on Europe\u2019s stock markets, with Deutsche Bank\u2019s problems and the looming presidential debate both hitting investor confidence. The FTSE 100 index of leading shares in London is still down around 1.25%; banks, builders and mining stocks are all leading the selloff. And European markets are deeper in the red: The news that Donald Trump is closing the gap with Hillary Clinton, ahead of today\u2019s sure-to-be bruising debate has worried investors. Trump\u2019s comments about protectionist trade policies aren\u2019t terribly popular in the City, while suggestions that NATO members should pay for the US\u2019s protection have caused angst. And the closer the race looks, the more nervous markets will get. There could still be one big shock lurking in 2016\u2019s locker. Peter Rosenstreich, head of market strategy at Swissquote Bank, says traders are worrying about the impact of a Trump victory. Risk appetite has faded with many analysts pointing to the tightening of the US presidential elections and uncertainty around tonight\u2019s debates as the primary catalysts. Rosenstreich believes a Trump presidency could also help \u2018fringe\u2019 political groups in Europe. Donald Trump\u2019s track record of supporting anti-establishment issues and candidates, such as Brexit and Russian President Putin, will legitimize Eurosceptic groups. With the EU questioning its post-Brexit future and elections in France, Spain and Germany, empowered fringe parties could potentially redefine the geopolitical landscape. Deutsche Bank\u2019s shares are still at their lowest level since the 1980s, down 6%, despite repeatedly pledging that it hasn\u2019t been seeking help from the Berlin government. Chris Beauchamp of IG Index says Deutsche Bank is causing much alarm today. The new week has started with a bang, as the parlous state of Deutsche Bank explodes onto everyone\u2019s radar once again. The bank has been limping along for months now, but reports that Angela Merkel may not step in to rescue the bank have sent the shares tumbling, dragging banks across the UK and Europe lower as a result. The gut feeling of most investors is that Berlin would be forced to act to avoid the loss of a key institution, but gut feelings do not always make the best trades. Wall Street is expected to fall when it opens in around 75 minutes. Here are the pre-open calls (via CMC Markets): S&amp;P 500: 9 points lower at 2,155 Dow Jones: 77 points lower at 18,184 Nasdaq 100: 28 points lower at 4,830 Deutsche Bank\u2019s head of communication, Joerg Eigendorf, has just told CNBC that the bank \u201cstrongly intends\u201d to resolve its problems. Eigendorf denied that CEO John Cryan had appealed, in vain, to Angela Merkel,and reiterated that Deutsche does not need to raise fresh capital (despite the threat of a $14bn fine in the US). Here are the key points: Q: So Mr. Cryan was allegedly in Berlin and has asked for help at the Chancellery. JE: This is just wrong. At no moment of time. No point of time, John Cryan has asked the Chancellor for support in the negotiations with the Department of Justice and he doesn\u2019t intend to do that. He\u2019s very strong in that position. Q: In Berlin, some who have been speculating about the fact that you are too big to fail. There are rumours all across the capital that Deutsche Bank is just too big. So what are you answering? JE: Just look, I mean yes the share price is low. But that is not what is worrying us and that is not what we are really looking. What is really important to us is Our credit story which is very strong. Its fundamentally strong and a lot of those in the market understand if they analyse the basics and the fundamentals that we are quite strong. Look at our credit story, value add risk very low, our credit portfolio very strong, liquidity position very strong, very comfortable and the third quarter is almost over. And I can tell you today is where we are finding very comfortable. Q: Berlin is not willing to bail you guys out. So does that put you in an insecure situation? JE: Again that is pure speculation. And for us it\u2019s just not a question. Deutsche Bank strongly intends to solve its problems or its challenges by itself and we don\u2019t think about anything else. We do our homework here. We are structure of the bank. We try to get the litigation issues out of the way because this is creating this uncertainty. A lot that is out there in the market right now. It\u2019s just pure speculation and uncertainty that was created by this and this is what we try to do. And by doing our homework, we will get this. This uncertainty out of the market again. Q: And looking at the markets though they are betting against you had the share price hit a new record low. How confident are you that you have enough time actually to do your homework? JE: We are very committed and we are doing our job. We are we are out there today and doing our homework. And the speculations, again, this is as if we need something today. We are fulfilling all capital requirements comfortably right now and that is not that is just speculation for the future and we have said time and once we got through the Canadian litigation issue all of the way once we get that restructuring done, the operative strengths of the bank will be seen again and once it is seen people will then these speculations will hopefully end. Q: Just one last question. Would you exclude the capital increase in the short to medium term now? JE: Again this is just not a question for us right now. We fulfil the capital requirements. We have time to fulfil future capital requirements and that\u2019s what we are working on. The pound is on track to hit a five-week low, amid speculation that the UK could be heading for a \u2018hard Brexit\u2019. Sterling has fallen by half a cent to $1.293, which would be the lowest closing level since mid-August. Paresh Davdra, CEO and Co-Founder of RationalFX, blames a lack of communication about the government\u2019s plans for Brexit. \u201cThe recent news reports that a so called \u2018hard Brexit\u2019 seems the more likely strategy for the UK\u2019s EU departure and this has had a dramatic impact on the pound, with sterling falling to a five week low. Despite the lost ground, the pound had regained last week in reaction to unchanged interest rates from the Fed, but has slumped as comments from the Ministers in charge of Brexit suggest that the UK would push to become a part of the World Trade Organisation \u2013the strongest indication yet of divorce proceedings that forgoes prolonged negotiations for single market access with the EU. This echoes the front page of today\u2019s Financial Times, that City figures are increasingly fearful of a Hard Brexit John McFarlane, chairman of Barclays and TheCityUK lobby group summed up the mood to the FT: The danger of hard talk now is that it increases uncertainty, reduces confidence and will result in businesses triggering their exit plans from the UK. And yesterday, several business leaders including Ryanair\u2019s Michael O\u2019Leary criticised the government\u2019s handling of the issue. Trump and Clinton are now neck-and-neck in the race for the presidency, according to a new poll from Bloomberg. The pair are both claiming around 46% of the vote, in this latest Bloomberg Politics national poll which was conducted last week. And if two smaller parties are also included, the Republican nominee has a small leader over his Democrat rival. This suggests Trump has gained ground on Clinton in the last week, making tonight\u2019s debate, at Hofstra University in New York, even more dramatic. Here\u2019s some detail: Among likely voters under 35 years old, Clinton gets 50 percent to Trump\u2019s 40 percent, down from her 29-point margin in August in the two-way race and from her 26-point margin in June in the three-way race. The poll\u2019s margin of error is plus or minus 3.1 points for top-line numbers, with 1,002 likely voters interviewed, and is higher among subgroups. It was taken Wednesday through Saturday, after Clinton took political heat for calling half of Trump\u2019s supporters \u201cdeplorables\u201d and for disclosing she had pneumonia after a video caught her falling ill at a Sept. 11 ceremony. More here: Trump, Clinton Deadlocked in Bloomberg Poll Before Key Debate The FT\u2019s Bryce Elder has explained how Deutsche Bank has been a poor investment for a long time.... (this is from the always excellent daily live chat on Alphaville) Back in the UK...the number of new mortgage approved by lenders has shrunk by 20%. The British Bankers\u2019 Association reports that 36,997 new home loans were approve in August, the lowest level since 2015. Mortgage approvals can be a good leading indicator of the direction of the housing market, so this may show that the Brexit vote has cooled demand. Here\u2019s the full story: The German government is trying to slap down speculation that Deutsche Bank might need state aid (following those reports that Angela Merkel has declined to help). Steffen Seibert, Merkel\u2019s spokesman, insists that there is no reason to speculate about this issue at all. He told reporters that: \u201cThere is no reason for such speculation as presented there and the federal government doesn\u2019t engage in such speculation.\u201d Deutsche Bank has insists that it can tackle its current problems without tapping shareholders for fresh capital, in response to today\u2019s selloff. A spokesman for the bank also denied that CEO John Cryan had asked chancellor Angela Merkel for help, to tackle the threatened $14bn fine from the DoJ. Here\u2019s the quote (via Reuters). John Cryan at no point asked the German Chancellor for the government to intervene in the U.S. Justice Department\u2019s mortgages case. \u201cDeutsche Bank is determined to resolve its challenges on its own.... There is currently no question of a capital increase. We are meeting all regulatory requirements.\u201d This is helping Deutsche Bank\u2019s shares to recover some of their earlier losses -- when they hit a record low (according to my Reuters terminal...although other data show they were lower in the 1980s) Turkey\u2019s stock market is in a spin this morning, after Moody\u2019s downgraded the country to Junk status on Friday night. The BIST 100 index of leading shares has shed 4% this morning, with almost every company losing ground. Banking shares are leading the rout, dropping by around 6%. The Turkish lira has been hit, and government bond prices are also weakening - driving up the yield (or interest rate) on debt issued by Ankara. Mike van Dulken, Head of Research at Accendo Markets, says a \u201cnasty cocktail\u201d of worries and threats are hitting shares this morning. They are: last week\u2019s dovish central bank inspired rally having run its course; jitters about tonight\u2019s Trump v Clinton debate; waning faith in this week\u2019s Algiers Oil meeting yielding anything whatsoever; German Chancellor Merkel saying no backstop for troubled Deutsche Bank (trading all-time lows), increasing sector contagion risk; City fears of a hard Brexit. He adds: Risk assets like Banks, Housebuilders and Miners are bearing the brunt of it this morning. Geopolitics appears to dominate. The financial pages of the UK newspapers are packed with Brexit stories. In the Guardian, AkzoNobel, one of Europe\u2019s biggest industrial companies, is calling for \u201cquick clarity\u201d over the UK\u2019s future relationship with the EU. CEO Ton B\u00fcchner says: \u201cAs a CEO, what you prefer in situations like this is quick clarity, quick stability so everybody knows the rules, everybody can adapt to the situation on the ground. \u201cAs long as the situation on the ground is unclear people don\u2019t know exactly whether big decisions are going to be right or wrong, so you get postponements [of decisions]. So for us that could be with our customers and it could be with our suppliers.\u201d The Financial Times splash on City worries that Britain is heading for a hard Brexit, and losing access to the single market. That could force more businesses to start relocating from London, to other EU cities, to maintain access to the bloc. But the Telegraph is more upbeat, reporting that City economists have upgraded their growth forecasts for this year. They say: Panic has faded rapidly among the dozens of independent economists consulted by the Treasury as strong data in the three months since the vote reassured the analysts that any shock from the vote was far less severe than first feared. Forecasts for 2016\u2019s GDP growth had been chopped to 1.5pc immediately after the 23 June ballot, but economists have reversed those downgrades and now expect growth of 1.8pc - exactly the same as they predicted before the vote. They\u2019ve also raised next year\u2019s forecasts, but still expect a serious slowdown: In July the average prediction was for growth of 0.5pc in 2017, but now it almost doubled to 0.9pc \u2013 though it remains below the 2.1pc average forecast before the vote. An early rally in the oil price has fizzled out. Brent crude had jumped by 1% early doors, having shed over 3% on Friday. But it\u2019s now down slightly at $45.80 per barrel. Investors are (once again) facing the prospect that Opec fails to agree to curb production during their meeting in Algeria. Algerian energy minister Noureddine Bouterfa raised hopes yesterday, declaring that: \u201cWe will not come out of the meeting empty-handed.\u201d Around \u00a322bn has now been wiped off the FTSE 100 this morning, with the blue-chip index currently down 88 points or 1.2%. Bloomberg\u2019s Matthew Campbell is also worried about Deutsche Bank: Shares in Deutsche Bank have now hit their lowest level in over 24 years. This morning\u2019s selloff appears to be triggered by reports that chancellor Angela Merkel won\u2019t provide any state assistance for the troubles lender. Focus Magazine also reported that Merkel has declined to lobby the US Department of Justice over that $14bn fine for misconduct. That may worry investors, as Deutsche only set aside around $6bn. Newsflash from Berlin: German business morale has hit its highest level in over two years. The IFO institute says its business climate index rose to 109.5 this month, much higher than expectations of 106.4. Ifo head Clemens Fuest says. \u201cCompanies are clearly more optimistic about the months ahead. They are also more satisfied with their current business situation. \u201cThe German economy is expecting a golden autumn.\u201d That suggests that Brexit fears have ebbed away; just in time for the US presidency to jump up the agenda... Money is flowing out of shares and into safe-haven assets this morning. This is driving up the value of German, US and UK government bonds, as investors hunker down ahead of the presidential debate. Conner Campbell of SpreadEx explains: Despite months and months of political drama one could make a fairly convincing argument for today being the real Day Zero for the US election. The first televised debate marks the point where Trump vs Clinton will be even more unavoidable than it already is, and therefore has reminded the market that the Brexit, US interest rates and China\u2019s economic slowdown aren\u2019t the only macro-issues out there to worry about. In other words, the markets have been reminded this morning that a Donald Trump presidency is still more than possible, sparking a sharp decline roughly on par with the gradual gains managed last week. The FTSE dropped 80 points to duck under 6850, while the DAX and CAC fell 1.6% and 1.8% respectively. European banking stocks are getting pummelled this morning. Deutsche Bank is worst hit, shedding 6.6% to \u20ac10.65. It is dogged by the threat of a $14bn fine from US authorities for mis-selling mortgage-backed securities before the 2008 crash. Lloyds Banking Group has dropped by 3%, after being downgraded to \u2018sell\u2019 by Goldman Sachs. Wall Street bank Citi has raise the possibility of a Trump victory in November to 40%, up from 35%. With the polls \u201cstarting to tighten\u201d, Citi is predicting much volatility in the foreign currency markets and precious metals prices if the Republican candidate triumphs. Citi also fears that the world economy will be hurt by the presidential race: \u201cCiti\u2019s base case is for a Clinton victory and mostly continuity in policies, which would leave U.S. and global growth expectations relatively unchanged... \u201cBut a Trump victory is a wild card and Citi expects this, among lingering uncertainties from Brexit and elsewhere, may cap the prospects for global growth to pick up in the remainder of the year.\u201d 2016 has been a year of shocks, but could November\u2019s presidential election be the biggest one yet? Mike Bell of JP Morgan reckons Trump is a stronger candidate than many people believe: Kit Juckes of Societe Generale says that the debate also sent shares down in Asia (where the Tokyo market shed 1%) We\u2019re starting the week in a slight risk-off mood, with Asian equities soggy, currency markets quiet, 10-year Treasury yields down a bit at 1.62% (the average of the month so far) and oil slightly higher ahead of the informal oil producers meeting. FXTM chief market strategist Hussein Sayed says investors are wondering how to prepare for the election on November 8th. Monday\u2019s US presidential debate will probably break a new record, not in the S&amp;P 500, but the number of viewers which according to media analyst could reach over 100 million Americans, surpassing Carter-Reagan debate in 1980 which attracted 80.6 million viewers. With Donald Trump closing the gap with Hillary Clinton in latest polls, the debate is becoming more interesting than any other TV show. America\u2019s direction, achieving prosperity and securing America are the three major topics at the first presidential debate. Investors are becoming increasingly concerned on how to tweak their portfolios before November 8. Nasaq\u2019s Biotech index plunged 4.5% in two days (24-25 Aug) in one tweet from Hillary Clinton criticising the recent price hikes on EpiPens, which suggest that investors and portfolio managers are seriously considering having different asset allocation strategies on the outcome of the election. However, I still believe that a Trump win will be perceived as a negative factor to the overall market. European stock markets are falling in early trading, as the City\u2019s attention turns to the looming clash between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump. In London, the FTSE 100 index shed 1% at the open, and is now down 80 points at 6829 (updated). The French and German markets are showing similar losses, amid signs that the presidential debate could be particularly brutal. The presidential election is now the biggest worry in the financial markets, with investors wonder whether 2016 will end with Trump preparing to succeed Barack Obama. The polls still put Clinton ahead, but there\u2019s real uncertainty about the outcome. It became clear last night that both sides are preparing for a dirty fight tonight, when the bell rings at 9pm in New York. The Queensberry Rules don\u2019t carry much weight when the White House is up for grabs, as my colleague David Smith explains: Trump\u2019s campaign manager did not rule out the prospect of the nominee getting personal onstage at Hofstra University in New York by summoning the ghosts of Bill Clinton\u2019s sex life, insisting that the Republican candidate had \u201ca right to defend himself\u201d. The two camps traded threats over who would be in the debate audience. After Clinton\u2019s team confirmed that it had offered a front row seat to billionaire Trump critic Mark Cuban, Trump responded that he might invite Gennifer Flowers, a former model who had an extramarital encounter with Bill Clinton in the 1980s. On Sunday, Clinton campaign chair John Podesta described Trump\u2019s reaction as \u201cto dive in the sewer and go for a swim\u201d, although the Republican candidate\u2019s running mate, Mike Pence, denied that Flowers would be present. Bob Schieffer, a venerable broadcaster who has moderated presidential debates, commented on CBS: \u201cThose kinds of things are beneath the dignity of the office that these two people are running for. I think they both would do well to think about that.\u201d Robin Bew of the Economist Intelligence Unit reckons Trump could do better than expected.... Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. There are three key questions in the City this morning; could oil producers agree an output deal soon? could Donald Trump become US president? What\u2019s happening with Brexit? Over in Algeria, energy ministers are gathering for a two-day meeting of the International Energy Forum. That\u2019s an opportunity for Opec members to have a behind-the-scenes chat about a potential deal to cut, or at least freeze output. Few observers expect a breakthrough this week, but there\u2019s the possibility of building towards an agreement at the next Opec meeting, in November. European investors are also bracing for the first US presidential election debate, which kicks off on Monday night in the US (so 2am Tuesday in the UK). Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump will trade blows before a massive global audience, on issues such as national security, healthcare, immigration...and each other\u2019s ability to carry out the most powerful job in the world. It could be a truly decisive moment in the race to the White House, as Bloomberg explains: The first of three debates promises to be a national sensation, contrasting two vastly different New Yorkers who are recognized around the world. Clinton, known for her extensive experience in government, is more comfortable discussing substantive issues than pitching her candidacy, and Trump excels as a self-promoter and an unsparing critic of his adversaries. Meanwhile back home, Brexit still means Brexit..... which means everyone\u2019s still wondering what\u2019s actually going on. This lack of clarity is now hurting Britain\u2019s financial services industry, as the threat of losing \u2018passporting rights\u2019 to the EU lingers. My colleague Angela Monaghan explains: Optimism dropped for the third consecutive quarter in the three months to September, according to the research jointly produced by the CBI business lobby group and the accountancy firm PwC. It marked the longest run of deteriorating sentiment since the first quarter of 2009, when the global financial system was in the midst of a deep and prolonged crisis. The biggest drop in confidence was among finance houses, building societies and investment managers, and less so among banks. Optimism was broadly stable among life and general insurance providers. Also coming up... Mario Draghi, ECB president, is testifying at the European Parliament this afternoon (at 3pm BST). We\u2019ll be tracking all the main events through the day...",
