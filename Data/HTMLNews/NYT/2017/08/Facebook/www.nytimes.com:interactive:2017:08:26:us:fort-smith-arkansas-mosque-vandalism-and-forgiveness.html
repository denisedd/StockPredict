                    <span class="d-dateline">FORT SMITH, Ark.  — </span>
                     Abraham Davis was sitting on a thin blue pad on the concrete floor of Cell 3 in a jail in western Arkansas when a guard came around with stamped envelopes and writing paper.
                </p>
            
        



        


        

    

        

        


        


        
            
                <p class="paragraph">The first person he wrote to was his mother. Abraham, just shy of 21, had barely spoken to her since his arrest a few days before, and he had a lot to explain.</p>
            
        



        


        

    

        

        


        


        
            
                <p class="paragraph">It all began on a night last October when he borrowed her white minivan and drove to the home of a friend. They&#x2019;d gotten drunk on cheap whiskey. Kentucky Deluxe. Abraham agreed to drive his friend to a mosque in town. His friend drew swastikas and curses on the mosque&#x2019;s windows and doors while Abraham stood watch in the driveway.</p>
            
        



        


        

    

        

        


        


        
            
                <p class="paragraph">The next day, the vandalism was all over the news. Abraham watched the reports over and over on his phone, his stomach curdling with regret.</p>
            
        



        


        

    

        

        


        


        
            
                <p class="paragraph">Even now, as he was facing up to six years in prison for the act, Abraham could not explain why he had done it.</p>
            
        



        


        

    

        

        


        


        
            
                <p class="paragraph">He had grown up in Fort Smith, a city of tall oak trees and brick churches that has the look of a faded Polaroid. His father, charismatic but violent, died when Abraham was 5, leaving him with a feeling of powerlessness so intense that he has been trying to conquer it ever since. &#x201C;Most of my life I&#x2019;ve spent trying to train myself to become something that&#x2019;s too strong to be broken through,&#x201D; he said. Life has teed him up for a fight, and he walks tilted slightly forward, as if someone is pulling him with an invisible wire.</p>
            
        



        


        

    

        

        


        


        
            
                <p class="paragraph">As a poor student in the high school on the wealthier side of town, Abraham often felt like an outsider. He walked, not drove, hung out on playgrounds, not in restaurants. He got into a lot of fights. He did poorly in school, but he doesn&#x2019;t remember his teachers seeming surprised. Expectations were low, and he bent to fit them. He slept a lot in class. At 18, he dropped out.</p>
            
        



        


        

    

        

        


        


        
            
                <p class="paragraph">Fort Smith has two country clubs, several golf courses, a Talbots and a symphony orchestra. But a proliferation of pawnshops and a circuit court crowded with indigent defendants are reminders of the grinding poverty all around, in the rural areas of western Arkansas and eastern Oklahoma.</p>
            
        



        


        

    

        

        


        


        
            
                <p class="paragraph">For years, those divisions had been etched into the city&#x2019;s geography. Poorer families lived on the north side of town and wealthier families on the south. Race followed the same pattern, with the south predominantly white and much of the city&#x2019;s black population in the north.</p>
            
        



        


        

    

        

        


        


        
            
                <p class="paragraph">But time has scrambled those old lines. Latinos came here to work in the poultry industry. Pho shops dot the city&#x2019;s main drag, property of Vietnamese who began arriving as refugees after the fall of Saigon. R &amp; R&#x2019;s Curry Express serves deliciously spicy North Indian food at a Finish Line gas station.</p>

                <p class="paragraph">Muslims from different countries came, too &#x2014; some to study, some to work in the city&#x2019;s growing medical industry. Many had money. Hisham Yasin did not.</p>
            
        



        


        

    

        

        


        


        
            
                <p class="paragraph">A Palestinian who grew up just outside Damascus in Syria, Hisham sold fruits and vegetables in an outdoor market. He came to the United States in 1996, joining his parents and an older brother. Hisham imagined Beverly Hills, but found himself in western Arkansas in a rotting house with rats and cockroaches. He washed dishes at the Golden Corral. His father collected cans. He and a brother, Abdul Rahman, opened a used-car business. They called it A &amp; H Auto Sales.</p>
            
        



        


        

    

        

        


        


        
            
                <p class="paragraph">Today, Hisham lives in a grand house in Fort Smith with sparkling chandeliers on the edge of a thick green forest of oak and pine. He is 49 and has the look of an affable neighborhood baker, with a big belly and a broad smile. He is giving his three children what he calls a &#x201C;five-star life&#x201D; compared with his own, which he says began at &#x201C;below zero.&#x201D; He follows the news about Syria daily. But Arkansas is his home. He considers the day he came to the United States &#x2014; Feb. 11 &#x2014; his birthday.</p>
            
        



        


        

    

        

        


        


        
            
                <p class="paragraph">Hisham was one of the founders of the mosque that Abraham helped vandalize. They called it Al Salam &#x2014; meaning &#x201C;peace&#x201D; in Arabic. Since 2009, it has been in a brick ranch formerly used as a law office. It is on a busy road, South 28th Street, between a library branch and a nursing home. The founders wanted it that way. They thought the Muslims of Fort Smith should be forthright and confident, not hiding somewhere off the beaten path. This, they believed, would gain the community&#x2019;s trust and respect, maybe even help guard against the noxious stream of negative news about Muslims.</p>
            
        



        


        

    

        

        


        


        
            
                <p class="paragraph">The truth was that until the vandalism, few people in Fort Smith knew that Muslims lived in their city.</p>
            
        



        


        

    

        
            <div class="g-ad-wrapper"></div>
        

        


        


        
            
                <p class="paragraph">Abraham did. He had gone to high school with Hisham&#x2019;s older son, Wasim Yasin. They often ate lunch together in the cafeteria. Sometimes it wasn&#x2019;t easy being Muslim in high school, Wasim said. But around Abraham, it was.</p>
            
        



        


        

    

        

        


        


        
            
                <p class="paragraph">&#x201C;Abraham was a good guy, a &#x2018;whatever&#x2019; kind of guy, he never had any problems with that,&#x201D; Wasim said. &#x201C;You know how people can talk about Muslims. He came up to me and he said: &#x2018;I&#x2019;m with you, man. If anybody bothers you, just let me know. I&#x2019;m your friend.&#x2019;&#x201D;</p>
            
        



        


        

    

        

        


        


        
            
                <p class="paragraph">Months passed after the vandalism without contact from the police, and Abraham began to feel relief. He had only helped a friend, he told himself. &#x201C;My mind was trying to let me off the hook,&#x201D; he said.</p>
            
        



        


        

    

        

        


        


        
            
                <p class="paragraph">But his dreams were less forgiving. In one, he was walking through a crowd of parents and their children. The children were looking at some writing and crying. &#x201C;It was like one of those Scrooge stories,&#x201D; he said. He could see the children, but they could not see him. He saw their frightened faces and woke up sweating.</p>
            
        



        


        

    

        

        


        


        
            
                <p class="paragraph">Now, sitting in the Sebastian County jail, Abraham was not entirely surprised he had ended up here. Expectations for him were so low &#x2014; at his church, at school, even in his own mind &#x2014; that he sometimes saw the line of his life pointing toward prison.</p>
            
        



        


        

    

        

        


        


        
            
                <p class="paragraph">But not like this. Not with swastikas. So Abraham decided to use another piece of paper the jail guard had given him to write to the mosque. He wanted to tell the people there how sorry he was for what he&#x2019;d done. What, after all, did he have to lose?</p>
            
        



        


        

    

        

        


        


        
            
                <p class="paragraph">He sat on the floor of the cell, and placed a yellow sheet of paper on one of the metal seats bolted to the wall. He did not know the mosque&#x2019;s name. So he copied it, a letter at a time, from his paperwork.</p>
            
        



        


        

    

        

        


        


        
            
                <p class="paragraph">&#x201C;Dear Masjid Al Salam Mosque,&#x201D; he began.</p>

                <p class="paragraph">The sky was just brightening the morning of Oct. 20 when Hisham pulled into the mosque&#x2019;s driveway. He liked to do his morning prayers there when he could. The quiet of the early hour was soothing, and he&#x2019;d been told that praying at the mosque meant more rewards from God. But he had not come to pray this morning. He had sped there in his white Infiniti, carrying his gun, after receiving a distressed phone call from the imam.</p>
            
        



        


        

    

        

        


        


        
            
                <p class="paragraph">Al Salam&#x2019;s members had already been anxious. For months the year before, a man had sent the mosque disturbing emails. &#x201C;Sharia is a cancer that must be eliminated,&#x201D; the man warned, until someone called the Federal Bureau of Investigation. And the Republican presidential candidate Donald J. Trump was calling for a &#x201C;total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States.&#x201D; Few thought that was possible, but it seemed to loosen some dark impulse in the land.</p>
            
        



        


        

    

        

        


        


        
            
                <p class="paragraph">Rolling up to the mosque, Hisham saw the first swastika from the street, spray-painted in black on the bottom left corner of the small curbside sign. It was off-kilter, like a creeping spider.</p>
            
        



        


        

    

        

        


        


        
            
                <p class="paragraph">There was more on the building: &#x201C;Go Home&#x201D; on the wooden front door, just above a babysitter-wanted sign. On the garage: &#x201C;We Don&#x2019;t Want You Here U.S.A.&#x201D; And on one of the front windows, among profanities about Islam and Allah, a phrase Hisham did not recognize: &#x201C;Deus Vult.&#x201D; It is Latin for &#x201C;It is God&#x2019;s will&#x201D; &#x2014; a medieval rallying cry for the Crusades.</p>

                <p class="paragraph">Hisham&#x2019;s heart hurt. He thought about how little the vandals understood. America was the only true home Hisham had ever known. As a Palestinian in Syria he had been stateless. America gave him a country. America gave him a kidney, through a transplant. It gave him the dignity of being able to travel in the world. He still cries when he explains this.</p>
            
        



        


        

    

        

        


        


        
            
                <p class="paragraph">&#x201C;They never let me go to Dubai,&#x201D; Hisham said, blowing his nose and wiping his eyes. &#x201C;Then I went with my American passport, and they stand up straight &#x2014; they say, &#x2018;You&#x2019;re welcome, Mr. Hisham!&#x2019;&#x201D;</p>
            
        



        


        

    

        

        


        


        
            
                <p class="paragraph">At the mosque that morning, Hisham sprang into action like a rescue worker after an earthquake. He called the police. He called the mosque&#x2019;s board members. He called journalists.</p>

                <p class="paragraph">By early afternoon, the story was breaking.</p>
            
        



        


        

    

        

        


        


        
            
                <p class="paragraph">Then something wonderful happened. The mosque&#x2019;s phone started ringing, and didn&#x2019;t stop. Churches called. A synagogue called. Buddhists called. So did residents who had seen the news or simply driven by. One man called, crying. His daughter had seen the graffiti on her way to work and told him about it. He said the vandals could not have been Christians. No true Christian would have done it.</p>
            
        



        


        

    

        

        


        


        
            
                <p class="paragraph">Anas Bensalah, a mosque member who had taken the day off to help with the cleanup, told the man that he understood completely: That was exactly how he felt every time there was an attack by the Islamic State.</p>
            
        



        


        

    

        

        


        


        
            
                <p class="paragraph">Over the next week, the mosque was snowed under with cards and letters. Some people brought flowers. Most of the letters were from Fort Smith and the surrounding towns, but some were from as far as Reston, Va.</p>
            
        



        


        

    

        

        


        


        
            
                <p class="paragraph">Hisham was overjoyed. He kept them, as if they were jewels, in a drawer in his office.</p>

                <p class="paragraph">The night the mosque was vandalized, Kristin Collins, 45, had been worrying about her white minivan. There was a knocking sound under the hood, and it sometimes lurched unexpectedly. She was afraid the transmission was going, and she could not afford to fix it. Her last job was at a day care center in 2013. She quit after her husband, who had Parkinson&#x2019;s, began having trouble putting diapers on their 1-year-old. The next year, Kristin learned she had leukemia. She and her husband receive disability insurance &#x2014; a total of about $1,700 a month to support them, Kristin&#x2019;s son Abraham and his younger brothers, Noah Davis and Gabriel Collins.</p>
            
        



        


        

    

        

        


        


        
            
                <p class="paragraph">Fixing the van was on a long list of things they couldn&#x2019;t afford: the $25 monster costume that Gabriel, 4, wanted for Halloween; the several thousand dollars in back rent on their small brick ranch house. Kristin sometimes had to go to church food banks at the end of the month. And she had the sinking feeling she would have to rely on charity for a turkey on Thanksgiving, only a month away.</p>
            
        



        


        

    

        

        


        


        
            
                <p class="paragraph">So when Abraham asked to borrow the van, she was reluctant. Kristin loved her son. At 20, he was still more a teenager than a man, with a sparse goatee and &#x2014; at 5 feet 11 inches and 139 pounds &#x2014; a boyish frame. He was outgoing, loved people and liked to show off his break dancing and singing. She remembers his sweet head, hair dyed green, asleep on her hospital couch during her cancer treatment. But he was also directionless and unemployed, and spent too much time drinking and smoking pot with his friends.</p>
            
        



        


        

    

        

        


        


        
            
                <p class="paragraph">Kristin&#x2019;s boys were so different. Her middle son, Noah, was shy and sensitive but also a striver. He rose many days at 6 a.m. to work at a sandwich shop downtown. He had a girlfriend and a car. Where Noah was determined, Abraham just floated through, escaping into comic books and cartoons.</p>

                <p class="paragraph">Yet the brothers, only 15 months apart, were extremely close. As kids they played pirates, drinking sweet tea as whiskey on bunk bed boats. Abraham was protective of Noah, a frequent target for bullies with his surgically repaired cleft palate. Abraham was also quick to fight. At 9, he pummeled a boy who had made fun of Noah.</p>
            
        



        


        

    

        

        


        


        
            
                <p class="paragraph">Something was lodged in Abraham from the beginning, like a shard of glass in his heel. Kristin says it came from his father, Hud Davis, who grew up in a violent home. He had one real leg and cartoon flames painted on his fake one, the result of stepping on a downed power line. To his friends, he was full of life. At home, he was cruel. Kristin remembers him grabbing her by the neck and slamming her into the laundry-room door.</p>
            
        



        


        

    

        

        


        


        
            
                <p class="paragraph">Noah would sit on his toy dump truck and wheel himself backward into the closet to hide during the eruptions. Abraham remembers his father screaming that he would not have had to marry &#x201C;your whore mother&#x201D; if Abraham had not come along.</p>
            
        



        


        

    

        

        


        


        
            
                <p class="paragraph">At 5, Abraham said, he got down on his knees in his bedroom and asked God &#x201C;to take him and save my mom.&#x201D; When his 33-year-old father died a month later, after a seizure, Abraham believed he was responsible.</p>
            
        



        


        

    

        

        


        


        
            
                <p class="paragraph">As he grew older, Abraham had trouble controlling his anger. Hank Needham, the principal of Cavanaugh Elementary in Fort Smith, remembers him as a polite little boy &#x2014; but one with an angry streak. He once threw a fit when the school took away his screwdriver, which had belonged to his father.</p>
            
        



        


        

    

        

        


        


        
            
                <p class="paragraph">&#x201C;He had a big heart and a short fuse, and he&#x2019;d just start cussing,&#x201D; Mr. Needham said. &#x201C;He had an adult mouth in the second grade.&#x201D;</p>

                <p class="paragraph">Mr. Needham gained Abraham&#x2019;s trust, and medication for hyperactivity helped smooth his moods. By the sixth grade, he was an all-star student. His picture still hangs in a hallway promoting good attendance: Abraham, in a yellow sweatshirt, grinning.</p>
            
        



        


        

    

        

        


        


        
            
                <p class="paragraph">It didn&#x2019;t last. By the time he got to Southside High, Abraham had made peace with his place in the social hierarchy. He was, as he put it, &#x201C;one of the outcasts.&#x201D; But he was O.K. with that. He did not crave being in the popular crowd, which would have been impossible anyway.</p>
            
        



        


        

    

        

        


        


        
            
                <p class="paragraph">He didn&#x2019;t have money for meals at the mall or the latest phone. He couldn&#x2019;t afford fashionable sneakers or jeans; Kristin shopped at Goodwill. When Mr. Needham bought sneakers for Abraham one year, he expected the teenager to pick out the most expensive style. He chose a modest pair.</p>
            
        



        


        

    

        

        


        


        
            
                <p class="paragraph">&#x201C;He said, &#x2018;Mr. Needham, that is not me,&#x2019;&#x201D; the principal remembered. &#x201C;&#x2018;That is not who I am.&#x2019;&#x201D;</p>
            
        



        


        

    

        

        


        


        
            
                <p class="paragraph">Abraham was himself with a small, tight group of friends, which included Craig Wigginton, a tall, intense teenager who lived in a small apartment across town. They bonded over their backgrounds. Craig had spent his early childhood on the carnival circuit with his parents, his father, Rick Wigginton, said. His mother eventually left the family. Last year, when his father was sent to prison for a while, Craig was left alone to care for his younger brother. Abraham helped babysit.</p>
            
        



        


        

    

        

        


        


        
            
                <p class="paragraph">Abraham believed Craig was &#x201C;college professor brilliant.&#x201D; He sometimes walked eight miles across town to see him. But Craig made Kristin nervous. She was driving him and Abraham somewhere once and a woman in a hijab drove by. She remembers Craig pointing out the &#x201C;sand monkey in a Cadillac.&#x201D; He seemed jealous.</p>
            
        



        


        

    

        

        


        


        
            
                <p class="paragraph">Mr. Wigginton said his son never used words like that around him. Craig did not respond to requests for comment for this piece.</p>
            
        



        


        

    

        

        


        


        
            
                <p class="paragraph">Craig was the friend Abraham wanted to meet up with the night he asked his mother for the van. Kristin let him take it. It would be four months before she learned what he&#x2019;d done with it.</p>

                <p class="paragraph">Fort Smith was on the edge of the United States when it appeared in 1817 as a military outpost in Indian Territory, along what is now the Oklahoma-Arkansas border. A federal judge, Isaac Parker, made the place famous in the 1870s by presiding over one of the most prolific courts in the country. Known as the &#x201C;Hanging Judge,&#x201D; he sentenced 160 people to death; 79 were executed.</p>
            
        



        


        

    

        

        


        


        
            
                <p class="paragraph">Today, Fort Smith is a mix of the South and the West, a peanut butter cup of libertarian and Southern Baptist sensibilities. The Old South still haunts the place: A monument to the first white child born in Fort Smith, erected in 1936, still stands, barely noticed, in a small park behind a beverage distributorship. Southside High&#x2019;s Dixie fight song was not retired until 2015, and its Johnny Rebel mascot a year later &#x2014; and not without a fight.</p>
            
        



        


        

    

        

        


        


        
            
                <p class="paragraph">But the New South is here, too. Vibrant murals adorn downtown buildings, including a 100-foot-tall painting of an African-American woman and an Apache man on a grain tower. And while the city had a precipitous decline in manufacturing jobs, its economy is now doing other things.</p>
            
        



        


        

    

        

        


        


        
            
                <p class="paragraph">In February, a Milwaukee-based real estate company bought the old Whirlpool building, where thousands of workers made refrigerators. A large &#x201C;Available&#x201D; sign is now stuck to its facade. Health care and transportation companies have been hiring, particularly people with an education. The city&#x2019;s unemployment rate is lower than the national average, and its population &#x2014; 88,000 &#x2014; is up since the last census.</p>

                <p class="paragraph">Tall and confident, with the poise of a ballet dancer, Dr. Al-Shahrouri tells herself that people stare because she is pretty, or because they like the color of her hijab. But she worries that her children, including her 13-year-old daughter, may not be able to summon the same self-confidence. So she wields what weapons she has to protect them: her status as a doctor and her wealth. She drives a Mercedes-Benz sport utility vehicle. She carries an expensive hand bag.</p>

                <p class="paragraph">Mr. Bensalah understands, too. He came to Fort Smith from Morocco in 2000 to attend college. His first job was as a dishwasher. He fell in love with and married a local woman whose family refused to accept him &#x2014; more because of his skin color, he said, though looking back it was also probably his religion.</p>

                <p class="paragraph">On Sept. 25, 2001, his wife was in the hospital for the birth of their first child, and several of her relatives stopped him from entering the building. Standing outside, pleading with them to no avail, was one of the worst experiences of his life, he said. He did not witness the birth of his son. Nor did he tell his mother that he had become a father, fearing she would try to visit.</p>

                <p class="paragraph">Determined, Mr. Bensalah wore down his in-laws with wit and generosity. He started with the smokers, standing around and cracking jokes. He bought beer. He went hunting. One day he came home from his job as an accountant to find his wife&#x2019;s cousin on his couch, and they talked for hours. The man became addicted to drugs, and Mr. Bensalah visited him in the hospital after he overdosed. He brought a Bible. As the man recovered, Mr. Bensalah taught him how to budget. He told him that he was worth something. Now the man lives in Colorado with three kids, a wife, and a good job at a mining company.</p>

                <p class="paragraph">This is what makes Dr. Al-Shahrouri love the United States fiercely: There may be bigotry, but the system is fair, she said. She remembers entering a kidney transplant ward in 2004 with her medical team in San Antonio and being told to leave by the patient&#x2019;s wife, who raved that Dr. Al-Shahrouri would kill her husband &#x201C;like they killed us on 9/11.&#x201D; The doctor in charge warned the woman that if Dr. Al-Shahrouri wasn&#x2019;t allowed to treat her husband, no one would. Then the entire medical team walked out.</p>

                <p class="paragraph">On the night of Feb. 17, nearly four months after the mosque was vandalized, the police came to Abraham&#x2019;s house with a warrant for his arrest. Noah thought it was a case of mistaken identity. His brother had been in trouble twice before &#x2014; once for having pot paraphernalia in his backpack, once for hanging around too late on a playground &#x2014; but nothing that had required a $15,000 bond.</p>

                <p class="paragraph">Abraham understands how the attack on the mosque looks. The swastikas. The reference to the Crusades. Craig&#x2019;s father said he was horrified at his son&#x2019;s use of swastikas. Abraham argued that these were intended not as expressions of racism or white power, but merely as the most offensive images they could conjure &#x2014; a kind of measure of their manly capacity to shock.</p>

                <p class="paragraph">&#x201C;A swastika is a small act of terrorism if you think about it,&#x201D; he said. &#x201C;At that point, yes, it&#x2019;s scary.&#x201D;</p>
            
        



        


        

    

        

        


        


        
            
                <p class="paragraph">For all the regret and penance that the act of vandalism caused Abraham, the decision to commit it took no time at all. The three friends had been drinking and talking about ISIS, he said. Craig was angry about American soldiers being killed, about children dying.</p>

                <p class="paragraph">Abraham burns with regret now. At their ignorance, for lumping all Muslims together. &#x201C;That&#x2019;s like meeting one racist, and you say all white guys are like him,&#x201D; he said.</p>
            
        



        


        

    

        

        


        


        
            
                <p class="paragraph">At his weakness, for not stopping it: &#x201C;I wish I could go back in time and say, &#x2018;Hey, dumbass, I&#x2019;m the future you, and I&#x2019;m telling you, don&#x2019;t do this.&#x2019;&#x201D;</p>
            
        



        


        

    

        

        


        


        
            
                <p class="paragraph">But he&#x2019;d done it. And now he was on his way to jail in the passenger seat of his mom&#x2019;s white van. Noah drove by the house so Abraham could say goodbye. His mother was sobbing in big, deep gulps. He had felt it before, the dead weight of her disappointment. It made him feel disgusting.</p>
            
        



        


        

    

        

        


        


        
            
                <p class="paragraph">&#x201C;She cried like a woman who had just got broken,&#x201D; he said. &#x201C;I think about that a lot. It&#x2019;s stuff like that that hurts you while you are in jail. You replay and replay. It&#x2019;s torture on your mind. Worse than any knife.&#x201D;</p>

So he waited in jail.</p>

                <p class="paragraph">Abraham was given a sheet and a thin blue sleeping pad, with a pillow area sewn into one end where the stuffing had been torn out. His skinny body was on high alert. He felt cold a lot. He barely slept the first week.</p>
            
        



        


        

    

        

        


        


        
            
                <p class="paragraph">Jail reminded him of high school. The prison guards were like the popular kids, lording their power over everybody else. The days were long and boring. People were constantly sizing each other up. New inmates quickly adapted to a rigid social hierarchy.</p>
            
        



        


        

    

        

        


        


        
            
                <p class="paragraph">Pretty much every group was represented. He made friends with a black man who was into Japanese cartoons and a Muslim who showed him the Quran. He had never seen one. The man told Abraham not to bother to look for the part where martyrdom brings 72 virgins. &#x201C;He said it wasn&#x2019;t there and he knew because he had looked for it himself,&#x201D; Abraham said, laughing.</p>

                <p class="paragraph">There were white supremacists of several varieties. One took an interest in Abraham after learning that he had vandalized the mosque, even offered him a tattoo. Abraham told Noah later that he had said no.</p>

When she finally saw his face behind the glass, she started to cry. He did, too. Recounting this scene later, he raised his two hands to his cheeks and said, &#x201C;Two rivers.&#x201D;</p>

Abraham&#x2019;s mouth moved, but the sound came out delayed, or not at all, like an old kung fu movie. Kristin and Noah visited every Saturday after that.</p>

I&#x2019;m so sorry about having a hand in vandalising your mosque. It was wrong and y&#x2019;all did not deserve to have that done to you. I hurt y&#x2019;all and I am haunted by it.

But I just wouldn&#x2019;t want to keep going on without trying to make amends. I wish I could undo the pain I helped to cause. I used to walk by your mosque a lot and ask myself why I would do that.

Anything equal or less than that was a misdemeanor. Dr. Nassri submitted paperwork showing the mosque had spent only $500 on cleanup.
