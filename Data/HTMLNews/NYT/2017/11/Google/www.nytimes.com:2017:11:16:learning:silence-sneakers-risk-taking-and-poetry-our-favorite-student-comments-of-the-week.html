        <p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="77" data-total-count="983" id="story-continues-2"><strong>Allison Zafiri from Massachusetts</strong> said silence begins where distraction ends:</p><blockquote class="story-quote story-content" data-para-count="539" data-total-count="1522"><p>In relation to Mr. Kagge’s point of silence, I interpret silence as a place where you can find mental happiness and peace at any given time in your life after going through through stress, anger, or pressure... Silence is your break from society and moment of debriefing and relaxation. Silence should be able to be found at any place you choose whether that be your bedroom, practice room, or even school. To find silence it doesn’t necessarily have to be quiet per se, it’s simply a place where you can break from your frustration.</p></blockquote><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="103" data-total-count="1625"><strong>Hailey Black from Massachusetts</strong> said, as many did, that music separates the listener from distractions:</p><blockquote class="story-quote story-content" data-para-count="410" data-total-count="2035"><p>As many distractions iPhones can create, using a phone could also be one of these many coping methods that people may use to find peace. I personally find silence through listening to music and as ironic it may sound, music helps me separate myself from the distractions that bother me. Whether these distractions are visual or audible, music allows me to drown everything out until I am able to find serenity.</p></blockquote><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="80" data-total-count="2115"><strong>Cassandra DiNardo from Danvers, Mass.,</strong> remembers absolute silence after a storm:</p><blockquote class="story-quote story-content" data-para-count="534" data-total-count="2649"><p>Life, for humans, is a clamorous exchange of sights, sounds, and the frank inability to respect the very thing that allows for an all-encompassing of existence.</p>
<p>My personal discovery of silence (and the continuation to find similar/better circumstances) happened on the morning after the biggest snowstorm of my childhood; not an animal, person, nor car was in sight. This very method brought me an indescribable peace, the closest thing to visual and verbal silence, granted me the opportunity of appreciation and self-understanding.</p></blockquote><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="124" data-total-count="2773"><strong>Morgan Brodsky from Massachusetts</strong> warns of the dangers of silencing oneself, in this honest exploration of a lesson learned:</p><blockquote class="story-quote story-content" data-para-count="1094" data-total-count="3867"><p>For a quiet person, like myself, I tend to keep many of my thoughts to myself. As I got to high school, I found myself to be almost mute at school, and I was just going through the motions every day. I was afraid of getting my feelings hurt, so I silenced myself. It turns out that this was the worst thing that I could have done. My own thoughts were eating away at me, and it was no escape from the everyday world, it was actually worse.</p>
<p>However once I was able to open up to others, and ultimately be true to myself, the world became a much better place. I have learned that silence is OK in bundles, and an hour or two of silence at a time is very beneficial. As Mr. Kagge says, silence allows more openness to the world and finding love for life. I think that people often appreciate something more once they realize what their life would be like without it. Don’t let silence get the best of you; use it to your advantage, but do not abuse it. We have voices for a reason and we have the right to use them. No one should silence your voice, and more importantly do not silence yourself.</p></blockquote><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="128" data-total-count="3995">We heard from many students who live in New York City, and most of them said they had learned ways to find silence in the noise.</p><div id="story-ad-1" class="story-ad ad ad-placeholder nocontent robots-nocontent ">

<p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="65" data-total-count="4060" id="story-continues-3"><strong>Gaby Cordon from New York</strong><strong>, </strong>for instance, finds serenity this way:</p><blockquote class="story-quote story-content" data-para-count="968" data-total-count="5028"><p>Silence to me is the hum of the subway train that brings me clarity. Silence to me is the solitude I am able to have at church, when the lights are dim and my heart is open. Silence to me is walking along the river’s edge, listening the waves crashing, the winds blowing, and the sky singing. Silence to me is in the darkest of nights, when I can’t sleep and I hear my sister breathing, the neighbors laughing, and my heart pounding.</p>
<p>I believe silence to be all of these things, even though they aren’t places that are silent themselves. But they bring me a sense of clarity, peace, and serenity, which truly is silence to me. To me it’s when you’re able to think deeply and let your mind travel to unknown places waiting to be explored... As an ordinary 14 year old girl, I feel as if, even though I live in a city where people are awake at every hour of every day, I’m still capable of having some clear understanding of my world and the world around me.</p></blockquote><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="64" data-total-count="5092"><strong>Aden from New York, New York </strong>can feel at peace only in the city:</p><blockquote class="story-quote story-content" data-para-count="768" data-total-count="5860"><p>Living in New York City is often seen as a chaotic and unbearably loud place to live, yet somehow it is the only place where I can feel at peace. A few years ago my parents bought a house in upstate New York. We have a nice small house tucked in the very back of a driveway with acres of trees surrounding us. The silence and tranquil feel could be one of the most relaxing aspects of our house, but every time I’m up my anxiety spikes.</p>
<p>... Silence for me, is not the same thing as being at peace. Hearing the loud voices of my angry neighbors or the traffic and cars out my window is what makes me feel at home, not the chirping of crickets or wind blowing. Though I love to spend the weekend upstate in the quiet countryside, I could never stay there for too long.</p></blockquote><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="67" data-total-count="5927"><strong>Christina goes to school in New York City, but lives in New Jersey:</strong></p><blockquote class="story-quote story-content" data-para-count="411" data-total-count="6338"><p>Sometimes my sister complains about the chaos of the city, but I find these noises to be delicacies of an urban environment. Many people may disagree with me and feel they can only work in a quiet space. But to me, it’s the best place to work. Being blunt, I don’t cope with the distractions. I learn to adapt. One cannot get rid of all distractions. They are why I love the city and never want to leave it.</p></blockquote><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="137" data-total-count="6475">Several students were proponents of meditation. <strong>Will from New York, </strong> for instance, uses it to seek escape from visual and auditory noise:</p><blockquote class="story-quote story-content" data-para-count="459" data-total-count="6934"><p>I believe practicing silent meditation can open new doors in one’s life. I think a good way of finding silence can be accessing a point far away from where you usually reside. For example, I go to Maine every summer. Maine can be a busy place in the town where I live, so I like to hike up to a spot where none of my friends know about. There is no visual or audible noise, and I love it. Find a place where you can’t be distracted, and peace will follow.</p></blockquote><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="54" data-total-count="6988"><strong>Ryan Brooks from Danvers, Mass.</strong> practices mindfulness:</p><blockquote class="story-quote story-content" data-para-count="594" data-total-count="7582"><p>I am a firm supporter of practicing mindfulness: the psychological process of bringing one’s attention to experiences occurring in the present moment. For as many moments as possible, take a second and absorb your surroundings. What do you hear? What do you see? What can you feel? Relax yourself. Remove yourself from the chaotic noise of this world. Listen to yourself. How are you feeling? Silence is needed every day to listen to your own body. It is needed to savor the present and enjoy the real world instead of the virtual world most of us are guilty of being constantly plugged into.</p></blockquote><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="72" data-total-count="7654"><strong>Isen Ritchie from New York</strong> has a technique that works almost everywhere:</p><blockquote class="story-quote story-content" data-para-count="834" data-total-count="8488"><p>Often people have a mind that is racing that they cannot turn off, and they have no time to sit down, take a deep breath and take in the surroundings rather than having them rush by. They might find it hard to achieve what I call inner calmness, which is a type of silence that allows you to close the door and take a walk inside of your head. It allows me to take a step inside of my mind, shut down my body, and take a tour around my thoughts and see what I’ve been doing for the past length of time. It is a good time to reflect and organize things, as well as give my body a break, so I can relax inside myself without anything penetrating from the outside. I find this easy to achieve in almost any environment, and all I have to do is simply focus my eyes on a surface near me that has no detail, and then look at my thoughts.</p></blockquote><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="99" data-total-count="8587"><strong>Hailey Pevear of Danvers, Mass.</strong><strong>,</strong> thinks we all need to learn to “establish a personal silence”:</p><blockquote class="story-quote story-content" data-para-count="353" data-total-count="8940"><p>For me, literal silence is far more deafening than the world’s ongoing commotion. Silence is mental, and only truly comes when we quiet our minds. The world stops for no one, and expecting the world to silence its noise is unrealistic and naive. Rather, we need to learn to establish a personal silence: a walk in the city, maybe a pair of headphones.</p></blockquote><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="113" data-total-count="9053"><strong>Gabrielle Schmit from FSI, Asheville, N.C.</strong><strong>,</strong> said the article made her realize the absence of silence in her life:</p><blockquote class="story-quote story-content" data-para-count="720" data-total-count="9773"><p>I can see what Mr. Kagge means be saying that people, especially teenagers who are attached to their phones don’t know what silence is. It’s sad, but my parents would probably say the same about me. For me, most of the time I am doing something, and then when I have free time I am on my phone.</p>
<p>After reading this, I started thinking about times when my phone isn’t with me, and it’s rare. At school, my phone’s in my pocket. At home my phone is in front of my face. Even when I’m sleeping, my phone is on my bed right next to me, waiting to be the first sound I wake up to. Phones provide endless distractions for our minds. I would really like to learn how to just be alone and quiet, without distractions.</p></blockquote><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="126" data-total-count="9899"><strong>Bronwyn Williams </strong><strong> from Wilmington, N.C.</strong><strong>,</strong> has found that being silent has helped her become more aware of the world around her:</p><blockquote class="story-quote story-content" data-para-count="1006" data-total-count="10905"><p>Life’s distractions are only as loud as you make them. It’s like a car accident, you can choose to stop and stare, or you can move on. You can place yourself in a loud environment or you could opt for a calmer, more silent place.</p>
<p>... Closing the door and staying up later than everyone else is usually my remedy to a world too loud. But silence really isn’t all about muting the world. I believe the best silence is when you walk outside, hearing the whisper of nature and nothing else. Once you stop thinking, glancing, talking so much, you start to see what’s really around you. When the evening sunset you’ve passed a thousand times while conversing with others becomes that much more vibrant when you’re all alone. And you take a second, without speaking or moving, and you take it in. Hues of red, orange, and purple become a composition of red-purples, orange bleeding to a vibrant yellow peeking from behind tinted clouds. Yes, silence can open you up to the world, and the world to you.</p></blockquote><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="68" data-total-count="10973"><strong>Noa from New York </strong>defined silence as more than just a lack of noise:</p><blockquote class="story-quote story-content" data-para-count="696" data-total-count="11669"><p>On the taxing journey to “silence,” one must find a place where they feel safe; somewhere where the eternal buzz of the city-life is drowned out by inner-peace. For me, this place is my home. I live on a quiet street in downtown Manhattan, so, for the most part, there is not much noise coming from the stereotypical road-rage of an NYC driver. And, most of all, what makes my home “silent” is the way it makes me feel. I know that when I am home I am safe next to the people I love most in this world: my family. Although “silence,” by dictionary definition, is the absence of noise, to me, it is wherever you feel most at peace, safe, and comfortable with yourself and surroundings.</p></blockquote><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="72" data-total-count="11741"><strong>Connor Golden from Massachusetts</strong> also defined “silence” differently:</p><blockquote class="story-quote story-content" data-para-count="580" data-total-count="12321"><p>I think silence can be found anywhere, as long as someone is willing to let everything else go. Some examples of this is when someone is truly engulfed in a book, or at a really great movie in the theater, or just zoned out in class. All these actions can create a sense of peace in a person, and finding a sense of peace is why I think many people seek out silence. People will often say they need “peace and quiet” when they feel overwhelmed. I don’t think that literal peace and quiet is always what they seek, but rather just a moment to be able to forget about reality.</p></blockquote><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="78" data-total-count="12399"><strong>Katie Cool from Wilmington, N.C.</strong><strong>,</strong> remembered finding silence in an art museum:</p><blockquote class="story-quote story-content" data-para-count="671" data-total-count="13070"><p>I was reminded of my first visit to what would soon become my escape from life, a small local art museum a few miles from my house. I recall standing in utter amazement, eager to see all this place had to offer, before walking into a room towards the end of what was to be seen. The exhibit had all white walls and wooden floors with dozens of faces, made of clay, hung about the room in no particular way (or maybe, the most particular way). I stood for hours in that room carefully examining every wrinkle and eyebrow hair of each clay face, and to this day I am perplexed by my affliction to these easily-shattered people, but their image is forever burned in my mind.</p></blockquote><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="97" data-total-count="13167"><strong>Patrick from New York</strong> was poetic in describing how impossible he finds it to ignore distractions:</p><blockquote class="story-quote story-content" data-para-count="732" data-total-count="13899"><p>To me, a distraction merely means something that catches my attention, departing from something else or not. Almost everyone and everything seizes my attention. When I turn my head, I might see a vast grin on my friend’s face twenty feet away, the rise of an eyebrow during a speech, or the shapes and forms a mouth makes when someone is talking directly to me. Nevertheless, my attention to specific, irrelevant things creates a distraction. So inevitably I must learn to cope with these distractions, and over the years I’ve learned it is practically impossible. Try if you wish, but attempting to ignore the red scar across that guy’s face is a deed almost no one can do. Although, there must be some way to stop it, right?</p></blockquote><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="75" data-total-count="13974"><strong>Dylan from New York</strong> might have an answer for Patrick’s question, however:</p><blockquote class="story-quote story-content" data-para-count="419" data-total-count="14393"><p>To cope with those distractions it is necessary to embrace those distractions. If you keep trying to be pushing, pushing, pushing distractions away from you they will consume you. However if you embrace them, take them into consideration and are aware of them you will be able to dismiss them and turn them into white noise. Distractions are something you cannot terminate but they are something that you can cope with.</p></blockquote><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="129" data-total-count="14522">We’ll end with <strong>Meghan Miraglia from Massachusetts, </strong>who says her generation will never have the silence earlier generations had:</p><blockquote class="story-quote story-content" data-para-count="852" data-total-count="15374"><p>The definition of silence to the “Gen Z” teenager is found in snatches. It is a few minutes where we are not bombarded by bluelight and ads, a few moments not spent looking at other people’s lives on a screen. We do not have the silence that other generations were given.</p>
<p>I promise myself five undivided minutes per day. Five minutes where my brain is not scattered in a billion places. Five minutes where I am not forced to budget my time between tasks. Silence, to me, can look different depending on the day. Silence is me, walking through the barn on a Thursday, smelling dust and hay and leather and metal. Silence is me, sitting on my bed drinking coffee, my phone tucked somewhere else, muted. So, do not tell me that I don’t know what silence looks like. I know what silence is. I have to fight for it sometimes - but I know what it is.</p></blockquote><figure id="media-100000005534182" class="media photo embedded layout-large-horizontal media-100000005534182 ratio-tall" data-media-action="modal" itemprop="associatedMedia" itemscope itemid="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/11/03/sports/marathonhistory1/marathonhistory1-master675.jpg" itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject" aria-label="media" role="group">

<p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="271" data-total-count="15645">Our most popular writing prompt this past week was “<strong><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/07/learning/coed-sports.html">Coed Sports</a>.</strong>” Commenters covered all aspects of the answers, considering difficulty, safety, comfort, social constraints and more. We heard from many in <strong>Woodside, Calif.</strong>, and loved what they added to the discussion.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="42" data-total-count="15687"><strong>BlackHammer02 from Woodside, Calif., </strong>said:</p><blockquote class="story-quote story-content" data-para-count="319" data-total-count="16006"><p>Girls should have the right to play whatever sport they want just like guys should. I don’t want to see girls get hurt in football or in hockey but I do believe they should have a chance to do whatever sport they want. I think it would be interesting to see girls play against guys in sports like football and hockey.</p></blockquote><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="91" data-total-count="16097"><strong>Grace Leete from Massachusetts </strong>made an argument — and then took on the opposing argument:</p><blockquote class="story-quote story-content" data-para-count="981" data-total-count="17078"><p>All sports should be equal. There is no exception to equality. It is not as if the women are being forced to play sports with men, this is something they are signing up for. There is no reason why they would be in more harm than if it was just one gender. If there is a constant push for equality then both sides need to learn to take it. I think that the New York City Marathon is a great example of how things should be done. There is a push on more equality that is crucial to the equality for all. It is an example of change for the better, they recognized something wrong and made it something good.</p>
<p>The opposing argument that women are not the same as men, they have different strengths and weaknesses. But as an athlete isn’t that what you want? A good competitor? If a man or a women is complaining about having to compete against someone of another gender, then they should take a moment and look in the mirror and see if they are really the athlete they think they are.</p></blockquote><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="112" data-total-count="17190"><strong>Maggie Yang from King of Prussia, Pa.,</strong> started a conversation with students in California and got three replies:</p><blockquote class="story-quote story-content" data-para-count="348" data-total-count="17538"><p>I think that women and men should be given the chance or opportunity to compete against the opposite sex. People shouldn’t have to stay confined to their own gender’s sports. I think that all sports should be coed, for females have the same athletic capabilities as males. Our genders don’t define how well or how capable we are at something.</p></blockquote><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="45" data-total-count="17583"><strong>Debrah Debbie from Woodside, Calif., </strong>replied:</p><blockquote class="story-quote story-content" data-para-count="146" data-total-count="17729"><p>Yes! Just because you are a female or male it doesn’t define how aggressive or strong you are. So yes coed sports should be a thing from now on.</p></blockquote><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="68" data-total-count="17797"><strong>Some from Woodside, Calif.,</strong> qualified their support for coed sports.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="54" data-total-count="17851"><strong>notorious smalls </strong>listed sports that might be too much:</p><blockquote class="story-quote story-content" data-para-count="289" data-total-count="18140"><p>There are some sports that probably should not be coed. I say this because some sports may be a little too much for females. But if a female wants to play the sport, I think she should be able to play it. The sports that may be too much for females are football, basketball, and wrestling.</p></blockquote><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="45" data-total-count="18185"><strong>LV03 </strong> felt physical touch was a deal breaker:</p><blockquote class="story-quote story-content" data-para-count="512" data-total-count="18697"><p>I believe that some sports should be and shouldn’t be coed. Some sports that shouldn’t be coed is football because most of the guys always work out and gain weight. Another sport that shouldn’t be coed is swimming because some men might act inappropriate. For example, women might feel uncomfortable around men. Some sports that should be coed is soccer, volleyball and track because there isn’t like any real physical touching involved and you just pass the ball and you aren’t allowed to grab people.</p></blockquote><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="9" data-total-count="18706"><strong><em>_________</em></strong></p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="245" data-total-count="18951">Readers from around the world weighed in with their interpretations of our Picture Prompt “<strong><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/10/learning/birds-and-cages.html">Birds and Cages</a></strong>.” While everyone saw it as a comparison of childhood and adulthood, they offered very different explanations for what that might mean.</p><figure id="media-100000005375868" class="media photo embedded layout-large-horizontal media-100000005375868" data-media-action="modal" itemprop="associatedMedia" itemscope itemid="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/08/20/opinion/sunday/20gray/20gray-master675.jpg" itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject" aria-label="media" role="group">

<p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="103" data-total-count="19054"><strong>Emma Weber from London</strong> closely analyzed the details in the picture to come up with this interpretation:</p><blockquote class="story-quote story-content" data-para-count="1395" data-total-count="20449"><p>Both the child and the adult are caged, yet the doors to the child’s cage are open, and birds fly in and out freely. New birds displace the old ones, as there is only so much space in this cage. In the adult’s cage, the same two birds are trapped and unmoving. The birds to me represent beliefs and judgments. Children and adults are both exposed to ideas, but children are more open-minded. They allow thoughts to flow rather than shutting them off by closing the cage doors of their mind and trapping certain opinions and judgments. Children are exposed to a greater range of stimuli, as they are not in a specialised profession as many adults are, so have a greater breadth in their thoughts.</p>
<p>Adults may feel as though they have established their view on the world, so shut themselves off from thoughts outside their cage, referring instead to the same beliefs perched on their head. Adults are therefore more likely to harbour stereotypes, and to dislike change. I also found it interesting that the child is looking up at the adult. As children, we aspire to be like adults, to be mature. Yet to us, looking at the picture from the outside, the child looks so much happier, freer than the caged adult, so it seems like the child is almost shocked at how different their future looks. The adult, meanwhile, stares blankly ahead, reflecting in his expression the monotony of his thoughts.</p></blockquote><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="116" data-total-count="20565"><strong>Brooke Myers from King of Prussia </strong>thought it was a representation for the responsibilities that come with adulthood:</p><blockquote class="story-quote story-content" data-para-count="508" data-total-count="21073"><p>I believe this illustration was about how a child’s mind is free and simple because they do not have much worry. This compared to the adult’s mind which is complex and caged because they have worry and responsibility to think about and cannot just do whatever they wish to do. I feel like when I was younger, I wondered about everything and my mind was free as compared to now where I overthink everything and worry about everything. I believe the article compared a child’s mind vs. an adult’s mind.</p></blockquote><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="56" data-total-count="21129"><strong>Tejal from KOP</strong> viewed it more as a maturing of the mind:</p><blockquote class="story-quote story-content" data-para-count="859" data-total-count="21988"><p>I think that this image represents how an adult’s mind is stabilized compared to a child’s mind that has different thoughts rushing through. It’s easy for an adult to make a decision because they have a stabilized mindset. They can think faster. They can think what is good for them. Adults are also matured, which makes them limited to the choices they can make. On other hand a child has a mindset that is unmatured and is not stabilized. They have a thousand thoughts rushing through their minds. They have no limits. They can behave however they want too.</p>
<p>When I was a small kid, all of my mistakes were excused. Now I am a teenager, I do one mistake on my assignment, my grades drop, my parents get angry at me because they have high expectation. This is the difference between childhood and a young adult. As I grow up my decisions affect my life.</p></blockquote><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="64" data-total-count="22052"><strong>Kali Sheppard from Massachusetts</strong> saw a life lesson in the image:</p><blockquote class="story-quote story-content" data-para-count="1432" data-total-count="23484"><p>Thinking outside the box, I believe almost that the cages outwardly express the mind, whether it be the mind of an adult, or the mind of a child. I finally came to this conclusion after I realized that the child’s doors are open, and the adult’s are closed.</p>
<p>This led me to ask myself, “What do children have that are open that adults also possess but in a closed manner?”</p>
<p>As we all grow up in this society filled with new news, new norms, new expectations, it is easy to see the majority of the younger youth is more easily swayed than the older, more experienced adults. In today’s society, this is exceptionally clear, through LGBTQ rights, BLM, and especially the presidency.</p>
<p>The younger youth is more prone to have an open mind, more prone to foster the capability of change. In the adult’s cage, it is clear to see the old birds sitting in the cage, not changing, just like the adult’s views. The child, however, has open doors, with birds flying in and flying out, symbolizing the importance of keeping an open mind, and not letting one view sway you into a life of closed doors.</p>
<p>Leave your doors open. Let yourself wander into the beauty of the differences in our society. After all, you don’t want two old rotting birds when you could have hundreds - or even thousands - of new birds, influencing your thoughts in a way that will leave you thinking, “Why did I ever leave my cage closed in the first place?”</p></blockquote><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="9" data-total-count="23493"><strong><em>_________</em></strong></p><figure id="media-100000005415405" class="media photo embedded layout-large-vertical media-100000005415405" data-media-action="modal" itemprop="associatedMedia" itemscope itemid="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/10/31/well/family/well-fear-bed/well-fear-bed-blog427.jpg" itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject" aria-label="media" role="group">

<p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="137" data-total-count="23630">Students shared their deepest fears and how they cope with them in response to our Student Opinion question “<strong><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/09/learning/how-do-you-handle-fear.html">How Do You Handle Fear?</a></strong>”</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="365" data-total-count="23995">Many wrote about their everyday anxieties, like forgetting to do their homework, disappointing their parents and fitting in at school. They also wrote about bigger fears, like terrorism and mass shootings, that now seem to consume the news. All came to the conclusion that, no matter the fear, dealing with it is the key. Readers had this advice for easing worries:</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="68" data-total-count="24063"><strong>Maya Sabbaghian from California </strong>suggested facing your fears head-on:</p><blockquote class="story-quote story-content" data-para-count="523" data-total-count="24586"><p>Fear is a part of life. It can help keep us safe and reminds us that we are human and have our own limitations. It only becomes destructive if we give it too much power and let it consume our energy. If we try to forcefully subdue fear, it only feeds on the attention. However, if we accept fear as a part of life, are mindful of its presence, and gently shift our attention to more productive items, then not only do we overcome this inhibiting fear and move on with our lives, we become mentally and emotionally stronger.</p></blockquote><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="81" data-total-count="24667"><strong>Kaya Lemire from FSI</strong> agreed, adding that admitting you are afraid shows strength:</p><blockquote class="story-quote story-content" data-para-count="586" data-total-count="25253"><p>If you show fear, it is portrayed as weak. However everyone has fear; no matter who you are, there is always something that can make you afraid. For some that could be fear of the future, for others it could be fear of spiders. Fear is such a wide range word that could mean different things to different people. I understand why someone who is strong and powerful would deny this statement, for so long the world has portrayed fear as something that only cowards have. But the truth is, fear is a part of life and it reminds us that we are human and we have limitations to our actions.</p></blockquote><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="102" data-total-count="25355"><strong>Aubrey Cook from </strong><strong>t</strong><strong>he Franklin School Of Innovation </strong>recommended taking things one small step at a time:</p><blockquote class="story-quote story-content" data-para-count="865" data-total-count="26220"><p>I think that people should push themselves to get over fears and phobias because every fear you have or phobia holds you back from doing something in life. For example if you are scared of heights and never go to the top of a building in the city you will never get to see all the city lights. If you are scared of water you may never go snorkeling. Which could both be great experiences in life but fears can hold you back. So I think people should work to overcome them — if you are scared of water you don’t have to jump into the ocean, if you are scared of public speaking you don’t have to talk to a million people at first. No one knows you better than you. Only you knows what pace you should go at if you are scared of water; don’t jump in the ocean to get over your fear go to a local pool and only go 3 feet until you are ready to go to the ocean.</p></blockquote><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="99" data-total-count="26319"><strong>Chris Miller 2775 tec from Fa</strong><strong>irfie</strong><strong>ld</strong> advised finding a friend to help you overcome your challenges:</p><blockquote class="story-quote story-content" data-para-count="602" data-total-count="26921"><p>The way I handle fear is usually getting somebody to keep me company so I know I’m not alone and so I can feel more safe. I get so stressed when I have too many things to do and I know I can’t do them all. This sometimes gets in the way of my goals because I stress too much to the point where I just don’t do what I need to do. After reading this article I can learn to just calm down when I’m stressing too much because now I know it’s just my brain stressing me out. I think improving my phobias will improve my life because it will be less stressful and I will have more peace in my life.</p></blockquote><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="9" data-total-count="26930"><strong><em>_________</em></strong></p><figure class="promo media video embedded layout-large-horizontal "

My friend yelled what I’m sure were words at me from the base of the tower. But all of life outside where I was standing was a blur and to be dealt with at a later date, because right then, I was awake, and there’s no way I would take that for granted.</p></blockquote><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="112" data-total-count="27666"><strong>Nick Trinity from Sarasota, Fla.</strong>, an adrenaline fiend, told this story about one of his greatest physical feats:</p><blockquote class="story-quote story-content" data-para-count="1496" data-total-count="29162"><p>YEAH!!!... when it comes to risk taking ... I have a lot of stories... I am 15 and accidentally saw this post, so I decided to write on it :)..</p>
<p>Most of the risks I do is parkour. I live in a vast Sarasota community with big buildings, and lots of downtown areas where I go with friends. Last Christmas, we decided to put on a show. We knew that there would be LOTS of people out in the streets shopping, and using Google Maps, we carefully planned out all the paths we would take that would make people down below see us, and hold their breath during the tricks. There were 7 of us. Me, 5 boys and a girl, who is a pro at this exotic sport :)).</p>
<p>The day of the performance had come, and a couple times at night we went there and repeated the route to get used to it and perform well for the public. To stay anonymous, we put on masks, hoodies, and black ninja like outfits. Starting off on the roof of a supermarket, we all stood on the edge looking down at the crowd below us, trembling with fear. This was the first trick: we held hands, and back flipped, all together... (we practiced this like a HUNDRED times if not more). I heard a shout during the backwards air roll and a scream of excitement from the crowd... We then started running, the crowd followed us. Jumped to the first building, flipped, then the next one, then we split up and came back together at the last building, performing another group flip. I was exhausted, only to hear police sirens in the distance... time to run......</p></blockquote><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="123" data-total-count="29285">And<strong> Maggie Yang from King of Prussia</strong><strong>,</strong> who thinks that friends can help push you to do things you wouldn’t do on your own:</p><blockquote class="story-quote story-content" data-para-count="597" data-total-count="29882"><p>Personally, I absolutely love the feeling of risk-taking. Being adventurous makes me feel an adrenaline rush and I get a sense of euphoria from it. I think that people generally are more willing to do something out of their comfort zone with their friends opposed to without. In many cases, peer pressure makes people feel like they have to do things for their friends or else they become a “let-down.” But I believe that not all peer pressure is bad. If they are really your friends, they will motivate you towards improving yourself and push you to get to where you’ve always wanted to be.</p></blockquote><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="59" data-total-count="29941"><strong>Erica Blanch from Danvers, Mass.</strong>, though, remains cautious:</p><blockquote class="story-quote story-content" data-para-count="935" data-total-count="30876"><p>Some people enjoy jumping over pools of sharks with a bike while others take risks by cheating on a test. Both make your heart rate increase but in very different ways. I enjoy being adventurous and stepping out of my comfort zone but I tend to not go too far. I am very afraid of free falling and heights when I have to land in something within a high distance. I can do heights on ski lifts and overlooking a city, but I don’t like jumping off cliffs into water or riding a bike over a jump. If my friends were to do something physically I would see how they turned out and then decide.</p>
<p>... My brother will jump off cliffs, bridges, anything. He is not bothered by anything while I’m the opposite. I will give it a try if, and will probably love it but getting myself to do it is the problem. On another hand, people can’t take risks socially, but I can. I will go up to anyone on the phone, in the mall or even on the streets.</p></blockquote><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="111" data-total-count="30987"><strong>Brooke Myers from King of Prussia </strong>is also more careful, but finds joy in bonding with others over being afraid:</p><blockquote class="story-quote story-content" data-para-count="469" data-total-count="31456"><p>I am a risk-taker with certain things but I am not a physical risk-taker. The biggest risk I have ever taken was rock climbing and it was okay but I wouldn’t do anything more dangerous. I can bond with being scared with others and have actually made a few friends because of our bonding of being afraid. Although I have made friends from it, I wouldn’t just do something because my friends do it.

We were told to write a poem about Asheville, which is where I live, and later perform it for the class. The poem did not have any expectations, just that it would connect to Asheville, and it was well written and insightful. I personally was very excited to write a poem as an assignment. I had written poetry before and I really enjoy reading and writing it. Our teacher told us that we would perform these poetries for the class, and then a few of the students from each class would be voted to perform them at a event for school. I was asked to perform for the school event, and I accepted. I was very nervous, but at the same time, very excited to be voted for my poem. Each student would go up on the stage and perform. I was amazed at all the different poems, each unique and really well written; connecting the poems to Asheville in different ways. I really like how poetry is a creative way of expressing thoughts and ideas, there are no expectations or limits to what you write.

I enjoy reading it at times, but most importantly, I love writing my own poetry. My favorite type of poetry is the limerick. They’re easy to come up with, and they’re almost like short, little snippets of a poem. Because they’re so easy to write, you can write many at a time, within a few minutes. Limericks follow an A-A-B-B-A pattern, where the first two lines rhyme, the next two lines rhyme with each other, and the last line rhymes with the first two.

I used to not like poetry as much because it was difficult to understand; however, now I can pick apart and analyze parts of the poem far better than when I was younger. Now, I love poetry for the meanings behind the words and the overall message of the poem I’m reading. My poems have so far varied on subjects and messages.

She has a poetical way of telling her stories. My favorite poet is much easier to choose than my favorite poems, that probably being William Shakespeare or Gwendolyn Brooks. I don’t generally write poetry, but I have written it before for a school assignment.</p>
<p>The school assignment was way back into my elementary days, and we were to make a poetry portfolio. We made different types of poems. I remember one poem in particular. It was shaped into a heart, but I can’t remember the exact words. I remember the meaning behind it, it was about my family and how I never want them to fall apart. At the time, my parents were arguing a lot and on many occasions, I heard the threats of divorce thrown between the two. They thought that I wouldn’t listen, they thought I was fast asleep.

One word in poetry can have so many different meanings. That is what I love about poetry, the many different interpretations behind a single word or phrase.

I believe my sense of smell is best at night due to me being able to sit on my porch and smell the flowers. My sense of smell helps me identify and describe things.

Every so often, we would get rewarded with bubble tea drinks after a long day’s worth of work and effort.</p>
<p>Now, whenever I get a hint of the same smell, I remember the beautiful faces of the children of Taiwan who’ve helped shape who I am today.</p></blockquote><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="54" data-total-count="41753"><strong>Tejal from KOP </strong>needs a good sense of smell for health:</p><blockquote class="story-quote story-content" data-para-count="528" data-total-count="42281"><p>I am really surprised when I heard that nose is sensitive in different times.

I particularly think that when I have my favorite foods near me it may be the strongest. My sense of smell really helps me in my daily schedule.

<p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="143" data-total-count="42433">And finally, the student comments for <strong>“<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/08/learning/should-national-monuments-be-protected-by-the-government.html">Should National Monuments Be Protected by the Government?</a>”</strong> were resoundingly in favor of protection.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="84" data-total-count="42517"><strong>Levi Campbell from Clarksville, Ohio, </strong>was disgusted with the idea of shrinking them:</p><blockquote class="story-quote story-content" data-para-count="913" data-total-count="43430"><p>National parks are made to preserve land and prevent *exactly* this, from commercial interests taking them over and tearing them down for profit. I can’t even believe this is happening, what has this world come to when we must destroy what others have put up for our own personal gain? That sounds like some dystopian “lord of the flies” situation, destroying and stealing for personal benefit. The growing interest of commercial entities on natural and preserved land has done nothing but grow exponentially, and why wouldn’t they? Nature reserves are like a huge, juicy grape on a vine that has nearly been plucked clean, and the company would rather have them than keep eating the dried up grapes along the rest of the vine; they just have to convince the vineyard to give the grapes to them to consume rather than saving them for the fine wine that is the experience of nature for those down the line.</p></blockquote><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="93" data-total-count="43523"><strong>Aubrey Cook from </strong><strong>t</strong><strong>he Franklin School Of Innovation </strong>said shrinking them would be exploitation:</p><blockquote class="story-quote story-content" data-para-count="880" data-total-count="44403"><p>I think that yes the government should protect national monuments and I don’t think that someone would remove a national monument or make it smaller. I think with doing this the land that had been protected for whatever reason like it being a burial ground for native americans or endangered species have inhabited it would be put at high risk. People will exploit the land in some way whether that is building something commercial on the land to further profit or just becoming reckless with what is still protected by the government. I think that if Trump was to make national monuments smaller that people would take that as they are not important and do not serve a purpose when in fact they do and harm or disrespect could be done to the land or monument so I do not think that the places that are protected by the government because they are a monument should be affected.</p></blockquote><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="59" data-total-count="44462"><strong>Hee Yun Chung from California</strong> said we should preserve them:</p><blockquote class="story-quote story-content" data-para-count="1045" data-total-count="45507"><p>National monuments are places or things within our nation that we all cherish and admire. They are the natural or manmade beauties that the Earth has given to our nation and we should do everything to preserve the national monuments. The posterity of the nation deserves to see the monuments just like those who came before them. By allowing the protection of monuments to go away only degrades America’s past achievements by figures like Teddy Roosevelt but also the cultural history of the United States.</p>
<p>... Even shrinking the area of a national monument like the Bears Ears monument in Utah can have adverse effects. If the surrounding area is not protected, the ecosystem and environment may collapse which defiles the beauty of the location. Though it may seem appealing to remove federal protections of monuments, I believe that preserving the beauty of America is more valuable than budget cuts in the name of politics. At the minimum, the government should not change the current policy of monuments and refrain from devastating cuts.</p></blockquote><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="24" data-total-count="45531"><strong>Francesca FSI NC</strong> agreed:</p><blockquote class="story-quote story-content" data-para-count="587" data-total-count="46118"><p>I strongly believe Trump should not be allowed to shrink or demolish national monuments. The national monuments have significant meaning to individual people, cultures as well as having historic importance. To shrink or take away a national monument and convert them into commercial use is absurd. People have already taken over so much of this earth and having places such as Bears Ears to enjoy the beauty of nature is wonderful. There is no need to put there, for example, a mall. I believe he can choose not to add any more in his time, but he should not take the existing ones away.</p></blockquote>        <a class="visually-hidden skip-to-text-link" href="#whats-next">Continue reading the main story</a>
