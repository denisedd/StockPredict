This wonderful show of about 100 works from the permanent collection samples all the varieties of artistic expression under the museum’s purview, from portraits and quilts by anonymous craftspeople to otherworldly fantasies envisioned by so-called Outsiders like Henry Darger and Martin Ramírez.

It also includes some of her rarely exhibited drawings and encourages you to see her three-dimensional artworks as drawings in space. Implicitly, it de-emphasizes the prosaic nature of her art materials: the cotton swabs, toothpicks, bottle caps and other throwaway objects that she fashions, with gee-whiz structural ingenuity, into rambling landscapes and galactic spirals. 725 Park Avenue, at 70th Street, (212) 517-2742, <a target="_" href="http://asiasociety.org">asiasociety.org</a>.

Today, thanks to “Harry Potter and the Sorcerer’s Stone,” in which Harry and Ron play with magically animated replicas of them, the Lewis Chessmen are world famous. On tour from the British Museum, these adorable, bug-eyed little kings, queens, bishops, knights and warders, each beautifully carved from walrus ivory, are wonderful to examine up close.

The cabinet at the Frick doesn’t hold the same range of marvels, but the current show of 10 drawings donated by Charles Ryskamp, a former Frick director, functions almost like a wunderkammer. There is a botanical watercolor by Pierre-Joseph Redouté, who worked for Marie Antoinette before the French Revolution and Empress Josephine afterward; a watercolor by Eugène Delacroix from his first journey to North Africa; a William Blake drawing created during a séance; and George Stubbs’s portrait of Warren Hastings, first governor-general of India under British colonial rule, as Hastings was being prosecuted for corruption. 1 East 70th Street, (212) 288-0700, <a target="_" href="http://frick.org">frick.org</a>.

Yet the works in this exhibition, which transforms the Frick’s mohair-upholstered East Gallery into a runway for Renoir’s soigné Parisians, don’t at first register as Impressionist. With their traditional portrait format and imposing scale, they seem at odds with the modest plein-air paintings that define the movement. Central among them is the Frick’s own Renoir, “La Promenade” (1875-6), in which a stylish young woman guides two equally well-dressed little girls along a public garden path. 1 East 70th Street, (212) 288-0700, <a target="_" href="http://frick.org">frick.org</a>.

The Frick has transformed an outdoor colonnade into an indoor exhibition space. Floor-to-ceiling windows enclose a long, narrow space that feels bigger and airier than its actual 850 square feet.

As installed on the Guggenheim Museum’s curved ramps for this full-dress retrospective, they look, inevitably, like mangled wrecks on a speedway. Yet the show goes to great lengths to extricate Mr. Chamberlain from what he called “the car-crash syndrome.” It includes work made from foam, aluminum foil, paper and plexiglass, and it emphasizes the collage process behind the metal sculptures rather than the material that went into them. 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 423-3500, <a target="_" href="http://guggenheim.org">guggenheim.org</a>.

The story began on July 11, 1958, when a Virginia county sheriff and two deputies entered the Lovings’ bedroom at 2 a.m. and arrested them, saying they had violated the Racial Integrity Act. Mr. Villet’s images represent the heyday of social documentary, but also the midcentury photo-essay format. Ms. Loving later became a conscious activist when, on the 40th anniversary of the Supreme Court ruling, she made a statement supporting the right to marry, whether “black or white, young or old, gay or straight.” 1133 Avenue of the Americas, at 43rd Street, (212) 857-0000, <a target="_" href="http://icp.org">icp.org</a>.

His penchant for self-promotion; the work of his competitors and peers; the evolution of tabloid journalism; and the great city that was both his subject and his audience are emphasized, with fresh curatorial precision and deftly used touch screens. 1133 Avenue of the Americas, at 43rd Street, (212) 857-0000, <a target="_" href="http://icp.org">icp.org</a>.

It focuses on an artist, teacher and art historian who helped preserve the ancient tradition of ink painting and then struggled to make it relevant under the Communists, bending it toward propaganda, introducing a new degree of realism and making frequent use of the color red.

Degas as a young man studied Rembrandt prints, copied at least one and made others imitating Rembrandt-type effects.

It was a time when ancient Greek and Roman precedents inspired artists to create extraordinarily lively images of people in two and three dimensions. The dialogue between painting and sculpture is especially intriguing. Desiderio da Settignano’s marble bust of a lovely young woman with a strikingly expressive, coquettish expression creates an illusion of fleeting real life that painters could only envy.

What the show lacks in star power, though, it makes up for with a keen, all-encompassing look at life in the Dutch Republic during its Golden Age (which corresponds, roughly, to the 17th century).

Some of these paintings seem ripped from current headlines. In “The Uprising,” protesting laborers are brutally suppressed by uniformed soldiers; the stratified New York cityscape of “Frozen Assets” tops a bank vault with a crowded homeless shelter.

In the dark-wood-paneled gallery on the second floor, for instance, six paintings by Cézanne preside over an imposing installation of arms and armor and 15th- and 16th-century German and Netherlandish portraiture.

Keeping this exercise from becoming pedantic, Ms. Reicheck finds elements of the myth where we least expect them: in comic books and the film “The Shining,” for instance.

As if to defend against anti-hedonist judgment, Mr. Winters also offers a series of notebook collages combining scientific and quasi-scientific imagery in Matthew Marks’s small exhibition space at 502 West 22nd Street. They are interesting, but the paintings of flickering, warping, spiraling and tunneling diamond patterns in hot and cool colors are the real trip.

Its boxy white cabin seems precariously balanced on a single concrete pillar. The light tower tops out at 90 feet above sea level. This is the subject of “Lighthouse,” a spectacular, 12-minute movie by Ms. Yass, a British specialist in the sublime. We explore the edifice as if through a disembodied eye from near and far and above and below. It is a kinetically and poetically thrilling ride.

The political climate of that period informs the show, as well as downtown Manhattan’s landscape of graffiti, posters and stickers. “Kissing Doesn’t Kill” (1990), a series of posters displayed on buses, defied contemporary claims that AIDS could be spread by kissing, while “Read My Lips” turned George H. W. Bush’s famous campaign line into a homoerotic provocation. The haircuts and clothes in the works are dated, but the sentiments overlap powerfully with current activism and the Occupy movement. 80WSE, New York University, 80 Washington Square East, Greenwich Village, (212) 998-5747, <a target="_" href="http://steinhardt.nyu.edu/80wse">steinhardt.nyu.edu/80wse</a>.

This show will not precipitate a run to revive his reputation, but it does open an intriguing window on the mid-20th-century philosophical landscape of Modern art. Still perceptually arresting are constructions from the ’50s, in which you view abstract compositions through similarly painted plexiglass panels.

Eminently promising, they nonetheless look excessively refined and skillful, and more mannered than they should be.

After permanently expatriating to France in 1891, he found success as a painter of luminous pictures of biblical subjects. In this informative survey of his career, one piece stands out: an Annunciation in which the angel Gabriel appears to Mary as a burst of yellow light. It is a painting of amazing grace. 118 North Broad Street, Philadelphia, (215) 972-7600, <a target="_" href="http://pafa.org">pafa.org</a>.

For a time — the 1930s, give or take a few years — these artists linked arms to defend modern American art against the dreariness and insularity of the Depression. One might see this show as an expansion of the first few galleries of the Museum of Modern Art’s recent de Kooning retrospective, with their eerie still lifes and fidgety figure paintings that seemed to collapse abstraction and representation.

The selection cuts a narrow, well-organized path through his art, examining the terrains he painted, the often close-up viewpoints he used and the shifting topographies of his paint textures, leading us to the fullness of his achievement along a fresh and eye-opening route.

It would take place under an elevated section of Interstate 95, in her home city, Philadelphia, and would consist of photographs mounted on the columns that supported the highway. It would be a recurring event, appearing yearly over a decade, and would be free and accessible to the public. That series, “I-95,” is at the core of “Zoe Strauss: Ten Years,” an engaging, parameter-expanding exhibition at the Philadelphia Museum of Art and on billboards around the city. In it, the highway links sweeping literary ambition and local interest, lyrical and documentary photography, portraiture and the urban landscape.

It also literalizes the innovations of Jasper Johns’s early work and points them toward proto-Minimalism, especially the early works of Donald Judd, and expands the understanding of a crucial turning point in the history of postwar American art.

This fascinating and often amusing show presents about 160 drawings and prints from six centuries in which men and women appear ugly, weird, venal and foolish. The show shies away from troublemaking work by contemporary artists, but examples of exceptional draftsmanship and satiric imagination from the past abound. Watercolors by the great British cartoonists James Gillray and Thomas Rowlandson alone make a visit rewarding. (212) 535-7710, <a target="_" href="http://metmuseum.org">metmuseum.org</a>.
