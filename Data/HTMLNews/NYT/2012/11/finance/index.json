Perry Mandell Cohen died peacefully October 29, 2012 at age 74, in NYC. Survived by wife Margo; sons Michael, Daniel and Jonathan; grandchildren Ilana, Jessica, Nathaniel and Zachary; and sister Diane Grainer. After receiving a BA in Economics and MBA in Finance from the Univ. of Michigan and obtaining his CPA, Perry worked at Touche Ross and then at Chrysler Corp. in Detroit and in Buenos Aires, serving as Director of Finance at Chrysler Argentina, and later Corporate Credit Director of Chrysler. Perry moved to New York in 1982, holding analytical and executive positions in several investment firms, lecturing on investment strategy and establishing a thriving trading group. Perry and Margo co-founded a biomedical company focused on complications of diabetes. Perry was a visionary founder and leader of the Beyond Shelter Coalition of West Side Synagogues for Permanent Housing for the Homeless and the East Side Congregations for Housing Justice, an active member of Park Avenue Synagogue and AIPAC, and an avid tennis player. Perry will be remembered and cherished for his sincere and gentle demeanor; his wisdom, patience and thoughtfulness; tireless devotion to and enormous pride in his family; and lifelong interest in public policy, current events and foreign affairs, where his knowledge and perspicacity were unmatched. Funeral service at 10:30am on November 1 at Plaza Chapel, 630 Amsterdam Ave., NYC, followed by burial at Prospect Hill/JCC Cemetery, 69 Capner Street, Flemington, NJ. The family will receive visitors at 115 CPW 4H, NYC on November 3,4 and 5 from 6-9pm.
