The Budget Rental Center that occupied the east corner is now an Enterprise Rent-A-Car, and there's a new BP service station across the street from it, in what used to be a vacant lot. You can no longer park on the east side of McGuinness, because the gas station's driveway flows out into the street there. Seven years ago, before the gas station, a row of parked trucks lined the curb, and it is for that reason that the driver of the Budget rental van, turning left onto Kent, was unable to see Liz as she rode her bike from the sidewalk to the street. A few months later, a group of activists chained a white-painted bicycle to a signpost across the street from the site of the accident. Above it, a plaque states her name and the day she died, and how: ''killed by truck.'' You can see these ''ghost bikes'' all around the city, wherever cyclists lost their lives.",
