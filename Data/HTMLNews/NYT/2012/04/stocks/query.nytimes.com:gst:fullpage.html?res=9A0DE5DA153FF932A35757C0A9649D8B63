The Budget Rental Center that occupied the east corner is now an Enterprise Rent-A-Car, and there&apos;s a new BP service station across the street from it, in what used to be a vacant lot. You can no longer park on the east side of McGuinness, because the gas station&apos;s driveway flows out into the street there. Seven years ago, before the gas station, a row of parked trucks lined the curb, and it is for that reason that the driver of the Budget rental van, turning left onto Kent, was unable to see Liz as she rode her bike from the sidewalk to the street.

                                        I first saw the memorial in person, along with my aunts and an uncle, in January 2008. It was my first trip to New York. We huddled around the bike, which was draped in flowers, dozens of them, some bright, some wilted, some still in bouquets, wondering
                                        who was responsible for the upkeep. No one cried. It was cold and sad and we didn&apos;t stay long. </p>
                                    <p itemprop="articleBody">
                                        I visited the bike a second time in July of that year. I had just graduated from college and I was in New York for job interviews and to look at an apartment to rent in Williamsburg, the neighborhood next to Greenpoint. After deciding to sign the lease,
                                        I walked north. From two blocks away I could see it; with even more flowers than before, it was a great thing, a mass of colors painted on the ghost of a 10-speed bike. </p>
                                    <p itemprop="articleBody">
                                        I remember thinking that it would have made Liz proud. She had studied at Cooper Union and then worked as a graphic designer. We all knew she painted in her spare time, but no one knew how much. After she died, we inherited hundreds of her paintings,
                                        everything from huge geometric designs to small oil portraits. Now they fill every room in my grandparents&apos; house. The overflow is stacked in the attic. </p>
                                    <p itemprop="articleBody">
                                        I saw the bike for a third time a week later. I had left the city for three days and returned with my father and a car full of boxes. We drove 15 hours from St. Louis, then spent the night with my cousin in New Jersey. That morning, I mentioned in passing
                                        to my dad that his sister&apos;s memorial was near my new place. He had seen photographs, but had yet to see it in person, and I didn&apos;t want to be there when he did. </p>

                                        But the GPS took us right there. I realized what was going on as we turned onto McGuinness Boulevard. If I had known the city better, I might have suggested a different route. Instead, the automated voice navigated us to the site of the accident, one
                                        turn at a time. The light turned red as we pulled up to the intersection. We both stared at the bike. </p>

                                        &apos;&apos;It&apos;s covered in flowers,&apos;&apos; he said. Behind his sunglasses, my father began to cry. He didn&apos;t linger when the light changed. </p>

                                        TWO years later, in 2010, my father visited the city for a second time. I was 24; I had acquired jobs; went to grad school. I was excited to show him that I&apos;d made it, that I was at least in the process of making it. </p>
                                    <p itemprop="articleBody">
                                        My father, in those two years, had been through a lot, too. For one thing, my mother had left him and initiated a divorce. He left his job as a management consultant to deal with the proceedings. It was the summer of 2008 -- he was convinced that he&apos;d
                                        easily find work again. Then the market tanked. No one was hiring. He burned through his savings, sold all of his stocks. My father learned how to let me go, and I learned how to be self-sufficient. </p>
                                    <p itemprop="articleBody">
                                        Finally, in the spring of 2010, he landed a job at IBM. His work was in Hartford, but he was living in his parents&apos; house in St. Louis. He flew out every Monday and flew back on Friday, but decided to spend one weekend on the East Coast with me.
                                        It was a triumphant visit for both of us, that first real taste of mutual financial security. We ate steak both nights. </p>

                                        On Saturday, we walked up to that corner in Greenpoint, cold and barren but for the ghost bike&apos;s flowers. Neither of us cried this time -- we had had plenty of blocks to steel ourselves for the sight of it -- but we did stand there in silence for
                                        longer than men are usually silent with each other. &apos;&apos;What a waste,&apos;&apos; he said. I wasn&apos;t totally sure what he meant, but I agreed. The next day he took the train back to Hartford. That was
                                        the last time I saw him. </p>
                                    <p itemprop="articleBody">
                                        He died a few weeks later, sitting in his recliner in my grandparents&apos; house. He had some sort of coronary event, something mostly random, a fluke of the heart. It happened almost instantly: he lost consciousness and then died. His mother, who went
                                        upstairs to get him for lunch, thought that he was napping. </p>
                                    <p itemprop="articleBody">
                                        His ashes are in the solarium in my grandparents&apos; house, next to Liz&apos;s, under one of her paintings, surrounded by photos of the two of them. It is hard to stand in that room. </p>

                                        But then again, it is hard to walk through New York City. Each place we went together is imbued with the now poignant fact that it was the stage for one of the last times I saw him, random street corners given significance by virtue of association. Here
                                        is where we had breakfast. Here is where we shook hands before he left for the train. Here is the block where I called him and got his voice mail the day before he died. </p>
                                    <p itemprop="articleBody">
                                        Here is where he stood with his hands in his pockets and said, &apos;&apos;What a waste.&apos;&apos; That corner in Greenpoint, once a tombstone for Liz, is now a monument to both of them. </p>
                                    <p itemprop="articleBody">
                                        The last time I visited the bike, it had been nearly a year since my dad died, and I was walking with friends toward a party at a bar. The white paint glowed in the light of the gas station across the street, and new flowers were woven through the spokes.
                                        I thought about the different incarnations of my grief over the years: At first, New York was a place I&apos;d never visited, Liz&apos;s home and the city where we lost her. After I moved here, that sadness contracted
                                        and became focused on this single corner, the corner of McGuinness and Kent. I barely acknowledged that Kent crossed other streets, that McGuinness crossed a river and curved north into Queens. My sadness found
                                        new triggers: Budget rental vans; the bicycle safety campaigns of the city&apos;s traffic commissioner. </p>
                                    <p itemprop="articleBody">
                                        I stood on the corner that night and took it in: the bike, the street, the neighborhood and everything that surrounded it. The city where my aunt had died and the city where I last saw my father alive, the place where those memories now live. This is
                                        how I knew I would never move away. </p>

                                    data-description="The corner of McGuinness and Kent, in Greenpoint, Brooklyn, has undergone a minor face-lift in the seven years since my aunt Liz was struck and killed there. The Budget Rental Center that occupied the east corner is now an Enterprise Rent-A-Car, and there&apos;s a new BP service station across the street from it, in what used to be a vacant lot. You can no longer park on the east side of McGuinness, because the gas station&apos;s driveway flows out into the street there. Seven years ago, before the gas station, a row of parked trucks lined the curb, and it is for that reason that the driver of the Budget rental van, turning left onto Kent, was unable to see Liz as she rode her bike from the sidewalk to the street.
&lt;p&gt;
  A few months later, a group of activists chained a white-painted bicycle to a signpost across the street from the site of the accident. Above it, a plaque states her name and the day she died, and how: &apos;&apos;killed by truck.&apos;&apos; You can see these &apos;&apos;ghost bikes&apos;&apos; all around the city, wherever cyclists lost their lives.
