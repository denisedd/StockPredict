The debt ratios would not change appreciably because the fresh revenue to be gained from the higher tax rate on wealthy households would be eclipsed by the revenue forgone by keeping the current tax rates in place for everyone else, Moody\u2019s said in a brief report.</p>\n<p>Moody\u2019s and Standard &amp; Poor\u2019s both said on Wednesday that the new fiscal package had bought Congress about two months\u2019 time before it would have to enact big cuts in federal spending \u2014 as much as $1.2 trillion worth over 10 years. The two-month delay means the next round of high-pressure Congressional negotiations is likely to coincide with the next deadline to raise the federal debt ceiling, which will come in late February or early March.</p>\n<p><!--more--> </p>\n<p>\u201cAlthough Moody\u2019s believes that the debt limit will eventually be raised, and that the risk of default on Treasury bonds is extremely low, this confluence of events adds uncertainty to the outcome,\u201d Steven A. Hess, a member of Moody\u2019s sovereign risk group, wrote in the report. \u201cThe debt trajectory resulting from this process is likely to determine whether the AAA rating is returned to a stable outlook or downgraded.\u201d  </p>\n<p>Standard &amp; Poor\u2019s said the agreement might bolster \u201cthe still-fragile U.S. economic rebound,\u201d but \u201cdoes little to place the U.S.\u2019s medium-term public finances on a more sustainable footing.\u201d It also said the continuing uncertainty put the creditworthiness of America\u2019s states and cities under \u201ca fiscal cloud,\u201d because many states rely on capital gains taxes, and the fighting in Washington could roil the stock market. Moody\u2019s said that the deal helped America dodge a recession for the time being, but that the increase in the Social Security payroll tax, along with additional spending cuts expected in the coming months, were likely to dampen economic growth.</p>\n<p>The third major ratings agency, Fitch, did not issue a statement in response to the fiscal agreement, but a spokesman said the observations Fitch had made in December still applied. Fitch said in a report on Dec. 19 that it expected Congress to find a way to pull back from the \u201cfiscal cliff,\u201d but that it would not be \u201ca credible plan to reduce the federal budget deficit and stabilize government debt over the medium term.\u201d </p>\n<p>The three agencies already have a negative outlook on the United States\u2019 sovereign debt, suggesting that a downgrade is possible at some point. Standard &amp; Poor\u2019s is the only agency ever to downgrade the United States Treasury\u2019s credit, which it did in August 2011 by one notch to AA-plus, when Congress nearly failed to increase the government\u2019s borrowing authority in time to avert a cash crunch. Moody\u2019s and Fitch kept their ratings at the highest possible, Triple-A. </p>\n<p>The three agencies said that while they were looking at quantitative ratios, like the relationship between the federal debt and gross domestic product, they were also considering federal policy makers\u2019 ability to negotiate productively despite their fundamental differences. </p>\n<p>Fitch said it was watching for a credible deficit reduction plan, with \u201cspecific measures and targets\u201d and \u201ca significant down payment in 2013.\u201d</p>\n<p>Standard &amp; Poor\u2019s noted that Republicans in Congress \u201chave indicated they will demand more spending cuts, while the White House has hinted at a harder line than it took in 2011, when political brinkmanship nudged the country toward default on its debt.\u201d Brinkmanship and the brush with default were what prompted the agency\u2019s unprecedented downgrade in 2011.</p>\n<p>A credit downgrade normally makes it more expensive for an institution to borrow, but that did not happen after Standard &amp; Poor\u2019s action. Global investors have kept on flocking to Treasuries, and the federal government\u2019s borrowing rate is now around 1.8 percent, compared with a rate above 2.5 percent around the time of the downgrade.</p>\n<p class=\"live-byline\">\u2014 <em>Mary Williams Walsh</em></p>",

Boehner.</span>\n</div>\n<p>Even as President Obama prepares to sign the hard-won tax deal that Congress passed Tuesday, another manufactured deadline with a colorful name is threatening to hamstring the government and undermine the economy.</p>\n<p>Goodbye, fiscal cliff. Hello, debt ceiling.</p>\n<p>The federal government has exhausted its legal authority to borrow money, and in about two months it will no longer have enough cash to meet all of its obligations, the Treasury Department said Monday.</p>\n<p>Congress could vote to let the government borrow more, as it has done 11 times since 2001, most recently in August 2011. But some Congressional Republicans say they are willing to do so only as part of an agreement to reduce federal spending, while Mr. Obama said Tuesday that he would not accept any conditions, even as he warned of disastrous consequences.<span class=\"read-more-link\">Read&nbsp;More&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><div class=\"show-more\">\n<p>\u201cWe can\u2019t not pay bills that we\u2019ve already incurred,\u201d Mr. Obama said. \u201cIf Congress refuses to give the United States government the ability to pay these bills on time, the consequences for the entire global economy would be catastrophic \u2014 far worse than the impact of a fiscal cliff.\u201d</p>\n<p>While it remains difficult to imagine that the federal government would default on its obligations, doubts may grow as the deadline approaches, and the cost of that uncertainty could be significant. The belief that lending money to the United States government is virtually risk-free is a basic tenet of the global financial system. The risks of other investments are measured by comparison, and priced accordingly.</p>\n<p>Doubts also could cost the government directly. The scale of federal borrowing means that even small increases in the interest rates that the government pays to investors add billions to the federal debt. The slightly higher rates on debt issued during the last debt ceiling standoff, in 2011, will cost taxpayers about $18.9 billion in additional interest payments, according to the Bipartisan Policy Center.</p>\n<p>\u201cLast-minute agreements to raise the debt ceiling undermine confidence in the sovereign\u2019s willingness to pay,\u201d Fitch Ratings, which evaluates risks for bond investors, said in a report last month. It added that it still saw little chance of defaulting, describing the very idea as \u201cincredible.\u201d</p>\n<p>The debt ceiling was created, ironically enough, to make it easier for the government to borrow. The Treasury once required Congressional approval each time it issued debt. The ceiling, which evolved from an initial version created in 1917 to facilitate the government\u2019s wartime borrowing binge, replaced those individual authorizations with an upper limit, like the limit on a credit card.</p>\n<p>There is an important difference, however: This credit card can be used only for spending that Congress has separately authorized.</p>\n<p>That might seem to obviate the need for a limit, or at least create a ready justification for the necessary increases. Instead, over the last century, Congress has repeatedly authorized more spending than borrowing, creating a long-running series of crises that have grown more frequent in recent years.</p>\n<p>The ceiling is now set at roughly $16.4 trillion and, as of Monday, that is the amount of the federal debt, too. The government has enough money to pay its debts until \u201cmid-February or early March,\u201d the Congressional Budget Office estimated in November. The government needs to borrow about $100 billion a month, and the Treasury estimated last week that it could use bookkeeping tricks to borrow about $200 billion more without increasing the total amount of its debts.</p>\n<p>These \u201cextraordinary measures\u201d mostly involve government pension funds that invest their holdings in special federal debt to earn interest. The money that the Treasury borrows from the funds, however, cannot be used to pay other bills. So over the next two months, as about $175 billion in debt held by those funds comes due, the Treasury will repay the money it borrowed and then borrow the same amounts from external investors to pay its bills. Once the debt ceiling is raised, the Treasury will then compensate the pension funds for the lost interest.</p>\n<p>The tax deal that passed Congress on Tuesday also cuts into the time remaining to deal with the debt ceiling because it reduces revenues while postponing spending cuts.</p>\n<p>Falling off the cliff, for all of its downsides, could have delayed hitting the ceiling.</p>\n<p class=\"live-byline\">\u2014 <em>Binyamin Appelbaum</em></p>\n</div>",

                                            "content": "<p>I've been on vacation for the past week and have been following the fiscal negotiations with less attention than I normally would. But perhaps that distance gives me a different perspective on <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/02/us/politics/house-takes-on-fiscal-cliff.html\">the deal</a>.</p><p>Most of the observations that I was reading about the deal were highly concerned with tactical considerations: Who had moved most from their previous offers? What precedents were being established for future negotiations?</p><p>As news about the negotiations evolved on a daily (or hourly) basis, the attitude of liberals and conservatives in my Twitter feed seemed to change along with it. Liberals seemed considerably happier about the deal on Tuesday night, for example - after the House of Representatives nearly scuttled the deal and then passed it with mostly Democratic votes - than they were early Tuesday morning, after the deal had passed through the Senate with an overwhelming bipartisan majority. But there had been no change to <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2013/01/01/us/the-mcconnell-biden-plan.html?ref=politics\">the policy terms of the deal</a>.<br /></p><p>I do not mean to suggest that these tactical considerations are of no importance. It could matter that the House of Representatives violated the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Majority_of_the_majority\">Hastert rule</a> -- the idea that that a bill should receive a majority of votes from members of the majority party in the House - in passing the bill. It could matter that President Obama, at an earlier point in the negotiation, capitulated on his demand that the federal debt ceiling be raised as part of a deal, setting up another confrontation in a few months.</p><p>But I would argue that the attention paid to these tactical considerations is a bit disproportionate. They seem to make it easy to declare \"winners\" and \"losers\" at every turn in the negotiations - whereas evaluating the deal in terms of the actual policy impact is much trickier.</p><p> Why is this so? Because each side has a variety of plausible <em>strategic</em> imperatives when it comes to fiscal policy - and they don't necessarily yield the same policy preferences.</p><p>Take the deal from the Democratic or liberal perspective, for example.  What were Democrats' major strategic goals? For some liberals, the goal might be <strong>redistribution</strong>: to adopt a series of policies that result in a net transfer of wealth from high-income earners to middle- or low-income earners.</p><p>Other Democrats (and Republicans) might view the deal from the standpoint of <strong>taxes vs. spending</strong>: what is the ratio of tax increases to spending cuts?</p><p>Finally, there is the paradigm of <strong>expansionary or  contractionary fiscal policy</strong>. Since the economic recovery is still tepid, many liberals would prefer that the government continue to stimulate the economy in the near-term at the expense of increasing the debt in the long term. (This consideration may have a political component as well, since a better economy will tend to improve President Obama's popularity and perhaps increase his ability to achieve future fiscal and nonfiscal policy goals in the months and years ahead.)</p><p>Take one component of the deal: that the <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2012/12/31/obamas-wrong-this-cliff-deal-still-raises-taxes-on-the-middle-class/\">cuts to the payroll tax</a>, which had been in place for the past several years were not extended and will now expire. If increasing tax revenues is the major Democratic goal, the expiration of the payroll tax cut helped to achieve that. But it also represented contractionary fiscal policy. And the impact will mostly be <a href=\"http://www.cbpp.org/cms/index.cfm?fa=view&amp;id=3505\">realized upon the middle class and the working poor</a>, which pay a higher percentage of their income in payroll taxes.</p><p>Most Democrats, I assume, would have preferred that the payroll tax cut had been extended: doing so would have achieved two Democratic goals (expansionary policy and redistribution), outweighing the one that it contradicted (increasing tax revenues).</p><p>But when the overall deal is considered - not just the payroll  tax, but all the other components, like the extension of unemployment benefits, or the increase in income and capital gains taxes for high-income earners - it becomes much trickier to evaluate because of the different criteria that might be reasonably be applied to evaluate success or failure.</p><p>My objective here is not to advocate for any one set of metrics, or to  \"score\" the deal that was struck on Tuesday - so much as to suggest that liberals and conservatives might do well to spend more time  considering what their strategic objectives really are. Just as is the case during election campaign, an obsessive focus on the latest developments in the news cycle can cause one to lose sight of the bigger picture.</p>",

Only about 0.7 percent of households would be subject to an income tax increase this year, according to the Tax Policy Center, a nonpartisan research group in Washington. The increases would apply almost exclusively to households making at least half a million dollars, the center estimated in an analysis published Tuesday.</p>\n<p>But the Senate\u2019s decision not to reverse a scheduled increase in the payroll tax that finances Social Security, while widely expected, still means that about 77 percent of households would pay a larger share of income to the federal government this year, according to the center\u2019s analysis.</p>\n<p>The tax this year would increase by two percentage points, to 6.2 percent from 4.2 percent, on all earned income up to $113,700. <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/02/business/economy/a-bigger-tax-bite-for-most-households-under-senate-plan.html\">Read more</a></p>\n<p class=\"live-byline\">\u2014 <em>Binyamin Appelbaum and Catherine Rampell</em></p>",

Other provisions would help companies that produce biofuels with algae; cut Medicare payments to hospitals and radiologists; protect tax breaks for motor sports complexes and certain film and television productions; and cancel a scheduled pay raise for members of Congress.</p>\n<p>The bill, the American Taxpayer Relief Act, also freezes Medicare payments to doctors, which otherwise would have been cut by at least 26.5 percent in 2013.</p>\n<p>The Congressional Budget Office said the freeze would cost $25 billion over 10 years, with most of that coming in 2013-14.<span class=\"read-more-link\">Read&nbsp;More&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><div class=\"show-more\">\n<p>Congress offset the cost with changes in Medicare and other federal health programs. For example, it reduced Medicare payments to hospitals by $10.5 billion over 10 years after finding that many hospitals had increased their Medicare revenue by describing the severity of patients\u2019 illnesses in more detail.</p>\n<p>Charles N. Kahn III, president of the Federation of American Hospitals, which represents investor-owned companies, objected to the cut.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe understand the necessity for Congressional action to avoid a dive off the fiscal cliff,\u201d Mr. Kahn said. \u201cBut we are disappointed that scarce hospital finances would be used to offset the Medicare physician payment fix.\u201d</p>\n<p>The tax and spending legislation steers clear of the most contentious proposals for Medicare savings, which would, for example, have increased the age of eligibility for the program. The bill does squeeze savings from health care providers. It cuts Medicare payments for nonemergency ambulance transportation of kidney dialysis patients, gives the government more time to recover overpayments and trims payments to health maintenance organizations serving Medicare beneficiaries.</p>\n<p>Under the long-term care insurance program, cherished by some Democrats, workers would have paid monthly premiums during their careers and could have received cash benefits if they became disabled later in life. The program was part of President Obama\u2019s health care law.</p>\n<p>Obama administration officials suspended the program in October 2011, saying they could not find a way to make it financially sustainable. Many Democrats wanted to keep it on the books, in the hope that it could be revived someday. But Republicans wanted to repeal it, and they got their way.</p>\n<p>The Senate Republican leader, Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, who was an architect of this week\u2019s budget deal, had criticized the long-term care program, known as Community Living Assistance Services and Supports, or Class, saying it was \u201cdestined to fail in the real world.\u201d</p>\n<p>Senator John Thune of South Dakota, chairman of the Senate Republican Conference, who led opposition to the long-term care insurance program, welcomed the prospect of its repeal. He said the administration had \u201cignored repeated warnings about the financial solvency of this massive new entitlement.\u201d</p>\n<p>However, a separate section of the fiscal legislation establishes a commission to study the need for long-term care and recommend legislation in about six months.</p>\n<p>The 15-member panel is supposed to examine demographic trends, as well as the potential for new technologies to improve \u201clong-term services and supports.\u201d</p>\n<p>The legislation also reduces Medicare payments for physical therapy and other therapy services when they are provided more than once on the same day to the same patient.</p>\n<p>In addition, the bill would reduce Medicare payments for one particular radiology service when performed in hospital outpatient departments. Lawmakers specified the service in detail: \u201cstereotactic radiosurgery, complete course of treatment of cranial lesion(s) consisting of one session that is multi-source Cobalt 60 based.\u201d The cutback is expected to save $400 million over 10 years.</p>\n<p>In the future, lawmakers said, they may also cut payments to hospital clinics for services that can be done at lower cost in doctors\u2019 offices.</p>\n<p>The bill would save $4 billion in 2022 by extending cuts in Medicaid payments to states for hospitals that serve large numbers of low-income people. Republicans had sought bigger savings in Medicare and Medicaid and said they would continue their efforts to rein in the growth of the health care programs, which together account for nearly one-fourth of federal spending.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat I\u2019ve seen does not include significant spending cuts,\u201d said Representative Phil Gingrey, Republican of Georgia.</p>\n<p>Democrats said they would resist any changes that reduced benefits or access to care for Medicare or Medicaid beneficiaries.</p>\n<p class=\"live-byline\">\u2014 <em>Robert Pear</em></p>\n</div>",

If a new bill is not passed or the current one extended, farm programs would lose billions of dollars in financing and would revert to a 1949 agriculture law. The old law would reintroduce higher government price supports for milk, corn, rice, wheat and other crops and could lead to higher consumer prices and federal spending. Milk prices could jump to as much as $6 to $8 a gallon if farm programs are allowed to expire. Milk now costs an average of $3.65 a gallon.</p>\n<p>The Senate passed a farm bill over the summer, but the House failed to bring up its version for a vote after Republicans split over the size of the cuts to nutrition programs. The bills would have cut between $24 and $35 billion from agriculture programs.<span class=\"read-more-link\">Read&nbsp;More&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><div class=\"show-more\">\n<p>Members of the House and Senate agriculture committees had worked on getting the White House and Congressional leaders to include the bills in deficit talks, touting the savings as a way to get a new five-year farm bill passed. But the Senate instead chose to include a proposal by Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky and the minority leader.</p>\n<p>The proposal by Mr. McConnell would extend only portions of the current farm bill. The extension would have no disaster assistance, something farmers had sought after suffering through the worst drought in 50 years in 2012. The proposal would also eliminate conservation programs and financing for fruit vegetable growers and organic farmers. The proposal does contain provisions to prevent milk prices from increasing. But it would not include a program that pays milk producers when feed prices increase. </p>\n<p>Mr. McConnell\u2019s proposal would leave in place direct payments to farmers, which total about $5 billion a year. The payments go to farmers or farmland owners whether or not they grow crops and have long been a target of liberals and conservatives as an example of wasteful government spending.</p>\n<p>Senator Debbie Stabenow, Democrat of Michigan and chairwoman of the Senate Agriculture Committee, called the extension incomplete and criticized it for continuing the direct payments that were eliminated in the Senate farm bill.</p>\n<p>\u201cRather than embrace the Senate\u2019s bipartisan farm bill, which cuts $24 billion in spending and creates certainty for our agriculture economy, Senator McConnell insisted on a partial extension that reforms nothing, provides no deficit reductions, and hurts many areas of our agriculture economy,\u201d said Ms. Stabenow.</p>\n<p>Dairy producers also expressed their disappointment in the extension.</p>\n<p>\u201cThese stopgap measures don\u2019t even qualify as kicking the can down the road,\u201d said Jerry Kozak, president of National Milk Producers Federation. \u201cIt\u2019s little more than a New Year\u2019s Day, hair-of-the-dog stab at temporarily putting of decision that should haven been made in 2012 about how to move farm policy forward, not offer more of the same.\u201d</p>\n<p>The House is expect to pass a similar farm bill extension Tuesday afternoon when it votes on legislation to stave off billions in tax increases and cuts in government spending.</p>\n<p class=\"live-byline\">\u2014 <em>Ron Nixon</em></p>\n</div>",

Biden Jr.</p>\n<p>   The late entry of Mr. Biden to the tax-and-spending talks that have consumed the capital over the last two months recalls his role in the debt crisis of 2011 and once again seems to have been critical toward cutting through the deadlock.</p>\n<p>   Mr. Biden was handed the ball not by President Obama but by Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican minority leader, who called the vice president after growing frustrated by negotiations with the Democratic majority leader, Senator Harry Reid of Nevada. Mr. McConnell and Mr. Biden have had good relations going back to their years together in the Senate.<span class=\"read-more-link\">Read&nbsp;More&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><div class=\"show-more\">\n<p>   As soon as the talks boiled down to Mr. Biden and Mr. McConnell, it became a relatively short path to a tentative agreement on taxes. The two talked late into the night on Sunday, with their last call coming around 12:45 a.m. Mr. Biden remained at the White House along with Mr. Obama until 2 a.m. before returning to the vice presidential residence for a little sleep.</p>\n<p>   Mr. Biden and Mr. McConnell were back on the phone at 6:30 a.m. on Monday, and by the afternoon Mr. Obama and Mr. McConnell were both reporting a near-deal. The vice president and the senator agreed on a compromise raising tax rates on income over $400,000 for individuals and $450,000 for households as well as renewing a variety of tax credits, increasing the estate tax on the wealthy and extending unemployment insurance. But the two still remain in talks about how long to postpone automatic spending cuts due to take effect this week.</p>\n<p>   It\u2019s not as if Mr. Biden had not been part of the jockeying over the two months before the call from Mr. McConnell. He has sat in on the meetings and advised the president on what to do. But he was largely a secondary figure as long as the action was centered on the House with Speaker John A. Boehner as the main Republican negotiator. Once Mr. Boehner gave up and handed off the issue to Mr. McConnell in the Senate, the vice president\u2019s long history in the upper chamber put him back on the field.</p>\n<p>   Last year, Mr. Obama gave Mr. Biden the task of negotiating with Representative Eric Cantor of Virginia, the House majority leader, for a way out of a confrontation over the nation\u2019s debt ceiling, but they failed to come up with a resolution and Mr. Obama and Mr. Boehner stepped in. After the two of them failed to reach a grand bargain, Mr. Biden and Mr. McConnell came up with an agreement that resolved the issue for the moment but set up the automatic spending cuts that take effect later this week unless the two sides come up with an agreement to stop them.</p>\n<p>   The tandem between Mr. Biden and Mr. McConnell comes not from any ideological affinity; the vice president is a liberal Democrat and the senator is a conservative Republican. But Mr. McConnell has a strained relationship at best with the other two main Democratic players, Mr. Obama and Mr. Reid, leaving the vice president as his best \u201cdancing partner.\u201d</p>\n<p>   \u201cThey have a good relationship,\u201d said a senior White House official who asked not to be named discussing continuing talks. \u201cIt\u2019s borne fruit before.\u201d</p>\n<p>   Both sides are hoping it does again.</p>\n<p class=\"live-byline\">\u2014 <em>Peter Baker</em></p>\n</div>",

The president wants this, members of Congress want to protect taxpayers, and we can get it done now.\u201d </p>\n<p>\tMr. McConnell was instrumental in all but securing a deal that would head off most of the fiscal punch if Congress could get it passed. When Senate Democrats all but walked away from negotiations, he reached for the phone and called Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. to find a new Democratic negotiating partner.<span class=\"read-more-link\">Read&nbsp;More&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><div class=\"show-more\">\n<p>\t\u201cI\u2019m happy to report that the effort has been a successful one and as the president just said, we are very close to an agreement,\u201d Mr. McConnell said.</p>\n<p>\tBut a final deal is being held up by one last question: What to do about $110 billion in automatic spending cuts set to begin Jan. 2. Republicans want them to go into force unless they are replaced by spending cuts elsewhere. Senate Democrats want to put them on \u201cpause\u201d for at least a year. President Obama said he would suspend the cuts with a mix of tax increases and spending cuts elsewhere. And all sides are angry over the impasse.</p>\n<p>\tMr. McConnell\u2019s solution will most likely be resisted by Democrats, who will see it as a clear Republican victory with the spending cuts remaining in place, at least temporarily. But many Republicans are just as opposed to those cuts as Democrats because they hit defense programs especially hard. Pressure would continue to mitigate or reverse the damage.</p>\n<p>\t\u201cLet me be clear,\u201d Mr. McConnell said, \u201cwe will continue to work on finding smarter ways to cut spending, but let\u2019s not let that hold up protecting Americans from the tax hike that will take place in about 10 hours. We can do this. We must do this.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"live-byline\">\u2014 <em>Jonathan Weisman</em></p>\n</div>",

Biden Jr. and Senator Mitch McConnell are closing in on, objecting vociferously to any compromise that suspends automatic across-the-board spending cuts for any time frame short of a year.</p>\n<p>\tA senior Senate Democratic aide said a one-year \u201cpause\u201d in those cuts \u2014 known as sequestration \u2014 is nonnegotiable. Mr. McConnell of Kentucky, the Senate Republican leader, has suggested a three-month suspension, according to officials knowledgeable about the negotiations.</p>\n<p>\tSenator Tom Harkin of Iowa, one of the Democratic Party\u2019s most senior liberals, took to the Senate floor to suggest that he will oppose the deal that is coming together.<span class=\"read-more-link\">Read&nbsp;More&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><div class=\"show-more\">\n<p>\t\u201cAs I see this thing developing, as I have said, no deal is better than a bad deal,\u201d Mr. Harkin said, \u201cand this is a very bad deal, the way things are shaping up.\u201d</p>\n<p>\tDemocratic officials stressed that no deal yet exists, but phone calls between Mr. Biden and Mr. McConnell have moved negotiations forward. Talks center on allowing tax rates to rise to 39.6 percent from 35 percent on incomes over $450,000 for married couples, an extension of unemployment insurance and a provision to prevent the alternative minimum tax from expanding into the middle class starting on Tuesday. Negotiators are still apart on a tax regimen for inherited estates, but according to a Democratic aide, Mr. Biden has suggested a 40 percent tax rate on the value of estates over $4 million. That would split the difference between the Democratic demand for a 45 percent rate on estates over $3.5 million and the Republican position of a 35 percent rate on inheritances over $5 million. Mr. Biden has also suggested allowing tax rates to rise on singles earning more than $400,000 a year. On Sunday, Democrats had wanted that threshold set at $360,000.</p>\n<p>\tDemocrats are leery that the vice president will give away too much, when they believe that they hold the upper hand politically. Mr. Biden and the Republican leader spoke past midnight last night and again at 6:30 this morning after a series of conversations that began shortly after noon Sunday, when Mr. McConnell reached out to the vice president to break a stalemate.</p>\n<p>\tSkeptical Democratic aides said they still feared that the deal would blow up over the issue of sequestration. Republicans on Sunday said any \u201cpause\u201d in the $110 billion in cuts for 2013 should be offset by spending cuts elsewhere. Democrats balked, and continue to balk, even after Mr. McConnell suggested that Republicans could accept a three-month hiatus. </p>\n<p class=\"live-byline\">\u2014 <em>Jonathan Weisman</em></p>\n</div>",

Right now, of course, it is doing just that: The country is running deficits of about $1 trillion a year.</p>\n<p>Of late, Republicans have refused to raise the ceiling unless Democrats agree to commensurate spending cuts. In 2011, that led to the <a href=\"www.nytimes.com/2012/04/01/magazine/obama-vs-boehner-who-killed-the-debt-deal.html\">heated and ultimately fruitless debt negotiations</a> between the White House and the House speaker, John A. Boehner, as well as the passage of the spending cuts in the \u201cfiscal cliff\u201d that Congress is now peering over. </p>\n<p>This time around, Republicans want to extract cuts, likely from entitlement programs like Social Security, in exchange for their help in lifting the ceiling. But Democrats have said that Congress should go back to raising the debt limit as a matter of course, as generally happened up until last year.<span class=\"read-more-link\">Read&nbsp;More&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><div class=\"show-more\">\n<p>Specifically, the White House has said that it will not negotiate with Congressional Republicans over the debt ceiling. \u201cWe are not going to play that game,\u201d President Obama said at a meeting with the Business Roundtable this month. \u201cIf Congress in any way suggests that they\u2019re going to tie negotiations to debt ceiling votes and take us to the brink of default once again as part of a budget negotiation \u2013 which, by the way, we had never done in our history until we did it last year \u2013 I will not play that game, because we\u2019ve got to break that habit before it starts.\u201d</p>\n<p>Democratic aides have described a strategy that is more literal than one might think: to simply refuse to discuss the ceiling as any kind of bargaining chip. But Republicans continue to see the debt limit as a potent piece of leverage over the White House. That has set up another major debt confrontation for early in 2013. </p>\n<p>Right now, the Treasury is undertaking \u201cextraordinary measures\u201d to give the government enough breathing room to pay all of its bills. But such measures buy Washington only so much time.

No one answers the phone at his office and an e-mail to his spokesman was not immediately returned. </p>\n<p>While several senators returned at their own pace last week, when the Senate reconvened with a hope that a deal to avert the so-called fiscal cliff would be in the offing, most have made it back. Senator Mark Kirk of Illinois is set to return to the Senate on Thursday; Mr. Kirk has been away for a year after having a stroke. Senator Frank R. Lautenberg, Democrat of New Jersey, has also been missing this week as he is recovering from flu, though his office said the senator would return to vote should a deal come to the floor.</p>\n<p>While some of his colleagues may mourn his absence, Democrats no doubt will welcome it as Mr. DeMint is one of a handful of senators who might object to a unanimous consent agreement that must be obtained to get a deal before the 112th Congress\u2019s business is finished. </p>\n<p class=\"live-byline\">\u2014 <em>Jennifer Steinhauer</em></p>",

Mr. Obama has called for rates to go up on income above $250,000 (he later increased his offer to $400,000), Congressional Democrats have said they would agree to $500,000, and Mr. Boehner has called for a $1 million threshold.

And in the Senate\u2019s current state of dysfunction, he could be right.</p>\n<p>The Senate, by tradition, has operated on negotiated agreements and unanimous consent to move legislation from one parliamentary stage to another. If just one senator does not sign on to such agreements, work can continue but only at a crawl. Here\u2019s the math.</p>\n<p>Mr. Reid could motion Thursday afternoon to bring up <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/22/us/politics/next-move-is-obamas-after-boehners-tax-plan-fails.html?hpw\">legislation</a> that would extend expiring Bush-era tax cuts on incomes under $250,000, set dividends and capital gains tax rates at 20 percent, ensure the alternative minimum tax does not expand dramatically to hit more of the middle class, extend expiring unemployment insurance and temporarily stop across-the-board cuts to military and domestic programs. Assuming one senator objects to a request to move straight to the bill by unanimous consent, the Senate would then vote at 9 a.m. to cut off debate on that motion to proceed to the bill.</p>\n<p>If that motion got 60 votes Saturday morning, there would then have to be 30 hours of \u201cpost-cloture ripening\u201d before the Senate actually votes on the motion to proceed to the bill. That would take the Senate to 1 p.m. Sunday. If again that procedural motion received 60 votes, the Senate would be on the \u201cfiscal cliff\u201d bill itself. Mr. Reid would then immediately file to cut off debate on the bill itself. </p>\n<p>At that point, under Senate rules, the earliest possible vote on final passage would be Tuesday, Jan. 1. By then, the 112th Congress would have disbanded and efforts to pass the bill would have to start all over again \u2014 this time on the other side of the \u201cfiscal cliff.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"live-byline\">\u2014 <em>Jonathan Weisman</em></p>",

Geithner wrote a letter to Congress informing it that the United States would hit its $16.4 trillion borrowing limit on Dec. 31. The Treasury will \u201cshortly\u201d begin undertaking \u201cextraordinary measures\u201d to avoid the limit \u2014 essentially moving money from pocket to pocket to give the government enough breathing room to pay all of its bills, from soldiers\u2019 salaries to Social Security payments, after that date. But within weeks \u2014 sometime in February or March, analysts estimate \u2014 its required payments would overwhelm its receipts, leaving an unprecedented cash shortfall. That would most likely send financial markets into a tailspin and lead to another downgrade of the country\u2019s debt rating. </p>\n<p>This year, the debt ceiling has become a potent political football, complicating negotiations over the scheduled year-end tax increases and spending cuts, the so-called fiscal cliff. The White House wants the debt ceiling to be taken off the table in the negotiations and for Congress to raise it as a matter of course. (Congress controls the country\u2019s level of debt, by virtue of its controlling the government\u2019s power to tax and spend. The debt limit is a secondary check on the total amount of outstanding debt that Congress periodically needs to raise.) But Republicans have threatened not to raise the ceiling if President Obama vetoes a bill extending the Bush-era tax cuts for household income above $250,000 a year, and more generally have indicated that they intend to use it as a bargaining chip. </p>\n<p><!--more--> </p>\n<p>The full text of Mr. Geithner\u2019s letter is below: </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>December 26, 2012</p>\n<p>The Honorable Harry Reid<br />\nMajority Leader<br />\nUnited States Senate<br />\nWashington, DC  20510</p>\n<p>Dear Mr. Leader:</p>\n<p>I am writing to inform you that the statutory debt limit will be reached on December 31, 2012, and to notify you that the Treasury Department will shortly begin taking certain extraordinary measures authorized by law to temporarily postpone the date that the United States would otherwise default on its legal obligations. </p>\n<p>These extraordinary measures, which are explained in detail in an appendix to this letter, can create approximately $200 billion in headroom under the debt limit.  Under normal circumstances, that amount of headroom would last approximately two months. However, given the significant uncertainty that now exists with regard to unresolved tax and spending policies for 2013, it is not possible to predict the effective duration of these measures. At this time, the extent to which the upcoming tax filing season will be delayed as a result of these unresolved policy questions is also uncertain. If left unresolved, the expiring tax provisions and automatic spending cuts, as well as the attendant delays in filing of tax returns, would have the effect of adding some additional time to the duration of the extraordinary measures. Treasury will provide more guidance regarding the expected duration of these measures when the policy outlook becomes clearer.</p>\n<p>Sincerely,</p>\n<p>Timothy F.

But military analysts say they could be phased in more gradually than originally thought, eliminating the need for furloughs or layoffs on Jan. 2.</p>\n<p>As a result, White House officials and House Republicans believe that they can limit the fallout at the Pentagon if they miss that deadline and reach a larger budget deal sometime next year.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s not like a government shutdown, where things close and the lights go out,\u201d said <a href=\"http://www.csbaonline.org/about/people/tharrison/\">Todd Harrison</a>, an analyst at the Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments, a research group in Washington. \u201cIt looks more like a glide slope than going down a cliff.\u201d<span class=\"read-more-link\">Read&nbsp;More&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><div class=\"show-more\">\n<p>The defense secretary, Leon E. Panetta, who has said that the automatic cuts would be catastrophic, also toned down his remarks in a memorandum to Pentagon employees on Thursday.</p>\n<p>\u201cThese cuts, while significant and harmful to our collective mission as an agency, would not necessarily require immediate reductions in spending,\u201d he wrote. But, he added: \u201cShould we have to operate under reduced funding levels for an extended period of time, we may have to consider furloughs or other actions in the future.\u201d</p>\n<p>Under the law that created the process, known as sequestration, uniformed members of the military would be exempt from furloughs or pay reductions, and war spending would be protected.</p>\n<p>But a significant number of the Pentagon\u2019s civilian employees could be furloughed or laid off, as could some of the contractors who build weapons systems and provide services to the military.</p>\n<p>The plan was created to cut spending automatically if the White House and Congress could not agree on how to meet caps on discretionary spending. Mr. Panetta has said sequestration would act like a meat ax, chopping about 10 percent off most Pentagon programs next year. If the plan is not altered, the cuts would add up to $500 billion over 10 years.</p>\n<p>Democrats initially hoped that the threat of the automatic cuts would help prompt more hawkish Republicans to make a deal on deficit reduction. But the level of military spending never became a major topic in the presidential election, and it has been pushed to the side in the latest negotiations.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/21/us/politics/house-moves-toward-vote-on-boehners-backup-plan.html\">House voted</a> 215 to 209 on Thursday night to cancel the military cuts. The narrow margin in the House, which has 241 Republicans, suggested that \u201cthe floor is getting soft under defense spending\u201d in general, said Gordon Adams, who helped oversee military budgets in the Clinton White House.</p>\n<p>Mr. Harrison, the budget center analyst, said that if the automatic cuts were to start on Jan. 2, they would unfold in several stages. The fiscal year started on Oct. 1, so the Pentagon would have three quarters in which to shave about $50 billion from its base budget of more than $525 billion.</p>\n<p>\u201cThere would be no immediate layoffs,\u201d he said. And weapons programs that had already been financed would keep going.</p>\n<p>By next spring, the Pentagon would probably have to furlough or lay off civilian employees, and \u201cthings could get messy,\u201d he said. It would also have to slow awards of new contracts, and it would have fewer employees to oversee contractors, causing more delays.</p>\n<p>Mr. Harrison said that unless the department could shift money from other uses, it would eventually have to reduce its civilian payroll by nearly 14 percent. Though the Pentagon has said it would try to avoid layoffs, Mr. Harrison said it could only achieve that level of savings through furloughs if nearly every one of its 791,000 civilian employees took a month off without pay.</p>\n<p>Because most weapons programs are financed in advance of the work, he said, the purchases from contractors might decline by only 3.5 percent next year.</p>\n<p>Military analysts said that if a broader deficit-reduction deal is reached, the Pentagon might have to accept from $150 billion to $300 billion in cuts over 10 years instead of the $500 billion under the sequestration law. It also would have more flexibility in apportioning the cuts.</p>\n<p class=\"live-byline\">\u2014 <em>Christopher Drew</em></p>\n</div>",

                                            "content": "<p>Markets were down sharply on Friday after Speaker John A. Boehner's tax plan failed to reach a vote in the House on Thursday evening. No Democrats were prepared to support the bill, and Mr. Boehner told reporters that his plan also lacked sufficient votes among Republicans.</p><p>A <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-12-21/a-fiscal-cliff-deal-just-got-more-likely.html\">variety of smart political observers</a> have suggested that the markets are misreading the situation. Instead, they say, the failure of Mr. Boehner's bill makes a deal to avert the so-called fiscal cliff more likely because it has now become clear that any deal will need to rely upon the support of at least some Democrats, which could ease passage through the Democratic-controlled Senate.</p><p>Perhaps this is correct. Mr. Boehner has said that the White House and Senator Harry Reid, the majority leader, will now have to take the lead in negotiations. The chance that a fiscal deal will be secured on terms that Democrats find favorable may have increased.</p><p>But the chance that there will not be a deal at all may also have increased, or at least not one before protracted negotiations that could harm the economy. The difficulty is in finding any winning coalition of votes in the House of Representatives.</p><p>In the diagram below, I've charted the major coalitions in the incoming 113th Congress, which will convene on Jan. 3. The new House of Representatives will have 233 Republicans and 200 Democrats. Two seats remain vacant, which means that 217 of 433 votes will be required to pass a bill.</p><p>Of the 233 Republicans, 51 will be <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-11-08/tea-party-freshmen-to-become-sophomores-by-keeping-house-seats.html\">members of the Tea Party  Caucus</a>, give or take a few depending on which first-term members of Congress join the coalition. The other 182 are what I will call Establishment Republicans.</p><p>As Keith T. Poole of the <a href=\"http://voteview.com/blog/?p=702\">Voteview blog</a> points out, the Tea Party Caucus wasn't solely responsible for Mr. Boehner's failure to pass his bill. A significant number of Tea Party Caucus members were thought to support his plan, while some of the opposition came  from representatives who do not formally associate themselves with the Tea Party. </p><p>Nonetheless, it seems clear that Mr. Boehner lacks the confidence of roughly three dozen Republican members of the House, and possibly more. Erick Erickson, of the blog RedState, <a href=\"http://www.redstate.com/2012/12/20/urgent-last-few-hours-to-stop-the-boehner-tax-hike/\">identified 34 Republicans whom he said opposed Mr. Boehner's bill</a> and another 12 whom he identified as being on the fence.</p><p>Say that Mr. Boehner cannot count on the support of 34 of his Republicans when it comes to passing major fiscal policy legislation. That means he would need to identify 18 Democrats who would vote along with the Republicans who remained with him.</p><p>Here's the problem: it might be hard to round up those 18 Democrats. </p><p>The reason is that most of the Democrats who remain in the House are quite liberal.</p><p>In fact, the once-powerful Blue Dog Caucus, a coalition of moderate Democrats, <a href=\"http://thehill.com/homenews/house/268567-new-dems-hope-to-be-a-force-in-113th-congress\">will have only 14 members in the new Congress</a>. The centrist Democrats who once filled its ranks fared very poorly in the 2010 midterm elections, while others retired or were harmed by redistricting or by primary battles. Although Republicans have moved more to the right than Democrats have moved to the left in recent years, according to measures like those developed by Mr. Poole, the attrition in the Democratic Party has nevertheless contributed to moving the two parties even further apart.</p><p>What that means is that if Mr. Boehner has a significant number of Republican defections, as he did on Thursday night, he will need to win the support of at least some <em>liberal</em> Democrats. And a bill that wins the support of some liberal Democrats will be an even harder sell to Mr. Boehner's Republicans. For each vote that he picks up from the left, he could risk losing another from his right flank.</p><p>Perhaps cooler heads will prevail in these negotiations. But a majority of the incoming House - 237 of 433 members - will be either Tea Party Republicans or liberal Democrats, leaving only 196 members who are either Establishment Republicans or Blue Dog Democrats and who might form a functional center-right coalition.</p><p>Moreover, the House is likely to engage in repeated battles over fiscal policy during the next two years: not just the over the fiscal cliff, but also over the debt ceiling, annual budgeting plans and whatever stabilization measures might be proposed in the event of another economic downturn.</p><p>If Mr. Boehner is having as much trouble whipping votes as he did on Thursday night, reducing the pool from which he might be able to draw together a compromise, this arithmetic problem could turn out to be intractable at some point.</p>",

A Senate Democratic leadership aide said Mr. Reid would move forward with the stripped-down bill to avoid the so-called fiscal cliff only if Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican leader, agreed not to filibuster it.</p>\n<p>Asked whether he would do that, Mr. McConnell stepped onto an elevator and said, \u201cMerry Christmas.\u201d</p>\n<p>With just days to go before the automatic tax increases and spending cuts go into effect, Democrats are increasingly giving up hope on a major deficit reduction deal. They hope a fallback plan would win so much support in the Senate that Mr. Boehner would feel no choice but to bring it to the House floor, where a combination of Democrats and Republicans would push it to passage.</p>\n<p>Senator Max Baucus of Montana, the Senate Finance Committee chairman, said he was not briefed on the plan but would be willing to move forward on anything at this point.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhatever has enough votes in the House and the Senate \u2014 the bigger the better \u2014 but just get the votes,\u201d he said. </p>\n<p>The plan would do nothing to cut spending or put into motion changes to entitlement programs like Medicare, nor would it head off showdowns early next year on raising the nation\u2019s statutory borrowing limit or keeping the government running when a stopgap spending law runs out in March. But it would prevent a fiscal jolt in less than two weeks.</p>\n<p class=\"live-byline\">\u2014 <em>John H. Cushman Jr. and Jonathan Weisman</em></p>\n</div>",

That could give the president carte blanche to stand his ground behind his last offer, which would allow taxes to rise on incomes over $400,000, raise $1.2 trillion in revenues over 10 years, cut $930 billion in spending over a decade and save $290 billion in interest payments on a lower national debt. By the White House\u2019s count, that would be balanced, $1.2 trillion in taxes, $1.2 trillion in savings, on top of $1 trillion in spending cuts agreed to last year.</p>\n<p>But at a Democratic leadership meeting after the Thursday vote was called off, Democrats discussed further concessions.

But those programs pose far and away the biggest challenge to the long-term fiscal health of the country, as Ben S. Bernanke, chairman of the Federal Reserve, and a number of other economic experts have long warned. Rising health care spending is often singled out as the one most pressing factor.</p>\n<p>Moreover, Congress has already wrung billions in savings from discretionary spending programs. According to an analysis by the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a liberal-leaning research and advocacy group, the Budget Control Act passed last year contained about $1.5 trillion in spending cuts over 10 years, about two-fifths from defense and three-fifths from other discretionary spending. That will shrink nondefense discretionary spending \u2014 meaning public education, agriculture, infrastructure, aid to the poor and numerous other programs \u2014 as a share of economic output to its lowest level since 1962 at least.</p>\n<p class=\"live-byline\">\u2014 <em>Annie Lowrey</em></p>\n</div>",

Given that tax increases \u2014 the most discussed point of the negotiations \u2014 would by themselves <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/09/us/politics/tax-arithmetic-shows-top-rate-is-just-a-starter-in-talks.html?ref=jackiecalmes&amp;_r=0\">only bring in a fraction</a> of the $1.2 trillion in new revenue the president has called for, the omissions are all the more glaring.</p>\n<p>At times, the comments can seem like funhouse mirror images.<span class=\"read-more-link\">Read&nbsp;More&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><div class=\"show-more\">\n<p>\u201cMr. President, let\u2019s talk about a balanced plan, but where are your specifics on the spending cut?\u201d Representative Eric Cantor, the Republican majority leader, said recently.</p>\n<p>The following day, Representative Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic leader, chided her Republican colleagues for <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/04/us/politics/boehner-counters-obamas-proposal-on-deficit-cuts.html\">writing to the president</a> to propose steep spending cuts and $800 billion in new revenue. \u201cThe Republicans sent a letter \u2014 perhaps you saw it? It had a number in it. It had no specifics,\u201d she said.</p>\n<p> <!--more--> </p>\n<p>The lack of specificity is especially striking from Republicans, because they favor a deficit package composed largely of spending cuts.</p>\n<p>There are several reasons that neither side is saying much publicly about the numbers.</p>\n<p>First, both sides generally prefer taking a \u201cyou-first\u201d posture in budget negotiations. Although polls show that a majority of Americans favor generic spending cuts, the largest federal programs \u2014 Medicare, Social Security, Medicaid and the military, among others \u2014 are all popular. That gives politicians reason to stand back while the other side details proposed cuts, and then to criticize those plans.</p>\n<p>Second, this phase of budget talks revolves mostly around overall savings. The specifics are likely to be hashed out early next year, creating further reason for the parties to keep their views to themselves for now.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe notion that we\u2019d put out a document that anyone could use to pick apart and bash us with, that just doesn\u2019t really gain us anything in the negotiations,\u201d said Representative James Lankford of Oklahoma, who sits on the Budget Committee and is a member of the House Republican leadership.</p>\n<p>With a tinge of irritation in his voice, he added: \u201cI do find it rather interesting the short-term memory that many people have, saying we haven\u2019t received a list of specifics from the House. We\u2019ve actually sent two.\u201d</p>\n<p>Mr. Lankford was referring to two bills passed this year by the Republican-led House that contain what Republicans say are the meat of their spending cuts. The principal bill \u2014 the \u201c<a href=\"http://thecaucus.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/03/29/house-passes-republican-budget-plan/\">Ryan budget</a>,\u201d named after its main architect, Representative Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin, the committee\u2019s chairman \u2014 would overhaul programs like Medicare and reduce spending by trillions of dollars in proposed cuts over the next decade.</p>\n<p>The second bill included similar reductions as a way of avoiding automatic cuts that are scheduled to take effect on Jan. 1 if a deal is not reached, including paring services like food stamps, children\u2019s health insurance and Medicaid.</p>\n<p>Democrats tried to turn the 2012 campaign into a referendum on many of those proposed cuts, making Republicans think that it would be unwise to relight those battles. Since the election, members of the Republican conference, usually a restless bunch, have been reticent to talk more about spending.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt really has surprised me a bit,\u201d said Representative Scott Rigell, Republican of Virginia, who has broken ranks with some in his party and disavowed a no-tax-increase pledge signed by almost every House Republican. \u201cI somewhat expected when the speaker initially indicated that revenue was on the table, a bolder voice of those saying absolutely not.\u201d</p>\n<p>For its part, the White House has proposed $800 billion in cuts. The president has said that half would come from federal health care programs; $200 billion from other so-called mandatory programs, like farm price supports that are not subject to annual Congressional spending bills; $100 billion from military spending; and $100 billion from domestic programs under Congress\u2019s annual discretion.</p>\n<p>For members of Congress not in the top ranks of leadership, there is one more reason not to talk in detail about cuts: Many of them do not know what exactly is happening in the negotiations.</p>\n<p>\u201cFor us, we remain united behind the president,\u201d said Representative John B. Larson, Democrat of Connecticut, a member of the House\u2019s tax-writing Ways and Means Committee and one of the party\u2019s Congressional leaders. \u201cEverybody is always concerned about the details of any proposal. But to be brutally honest, we don\u2019t have a whole lot of details to look at.\u201d</p>\n<p>Anyone looking for more specifics is likely to be disappointed.</p>\n<p>\u201cAt the end of the day the deal is going to be cut by the two principal negotiators,\u201d said Representative Tom Cole, Republican of Oklahoma. \u201cIn these types of situations you either trust your negotiator or you don\u2019t.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"live-byline\">\u2014 <em>Jeremy W.

The Congressional Republican \u2018Plan B\u2019 legislation continues large tax cuts for the very wealthiest individuals \u2014 on average, millionaires would see a tax break of $50,000 \u2014 while eliminating tax cuts that 25 million students and families struggling to make ends meet depend on and ending critical incentives for our nation\u2019s businesses. It would also cut off a vital lifeline of unemployment assistance to two million Americans fighting to find a job just a few days after Christmas.\u201d </p>\n<p>The threat is more about getting deficit-reduction talks going again than stopping House legislation that would allow tax rates to rise on incomes over $1 million but do little else to get control of the deficit. House Republican leaders are trying to round up the votes to push the bill to passage in the House on Thursday, against concern among ardent conservatives over the tax increases it would allow and among military hawks over the across-the-board defense cuts scheduled for January that it does nothing to stop. Regardless, it has little chance to get a hearing in the Senate.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe president believes this moment presents both sides an opportunity to reach a significant, balanced deal that is good for American families, the economy and for our nation\u2019s future,\u201d Mr. Pfeiffer said.</p>\n<p>Brendan Buck, a spokesman for Mr. Boehner, Republican of Ohio, called the veto threat \u201cbizarre and irrational.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cRepublicans have always said a broader, \u2018balanced\u2019 plan is the ideal solution, and we have put one forward,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cIn the absence of a \u2018balanced\u2019 solution from the president, however, we must act to stop taxes from rising across the board in 12 days.\u201d</p>\n<p>Mr. Boehner says he too wants to resume negotiations over a broader deal that prevents most tax increases next year but also locks in spending cuts and changes to entitlement programs like Medicare. But he says the president\u2019s offer \u2014 now in its third iteration \u2014 is still too heavy on tax increases and too light on spending cuts and entitlement reforms.</p>\n<p class=\"live-byline\">\u2014 <em>Jonathan Weisman</em></p>",

At that point, retail milk prices could soar because a complex federal milk pricing program would revert to a 1949 formula that would push up prices. Hundreds of dairy farmers also face foreclosure as a drought and high feed prices have pushed up operating costs.</p>\n<p>\u201cWith each passing day, the difficulty of enacting a farm bill before the end of this Congress grows,\u201d a bipartisan group of 33 senators said in a letter last week to Senate Harry Reid of Nevada, the majority leader, and Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the minority leader. \u201cCongress must do the responsible thing and pass a full, five-year reform farm bill,\u201d the letter said. \u201cAccordingly, we urge you to consider folding in the Senate\u2019s strong bipartisan bill in any end-of-year package.\u201d</p>\n<p>The senators said the proposed farm bill cuts, ranging from $23 billion in the Senate version to $35 billion in the House bill, should be part of any plans to cut spending. It is unclear what version of the farm bill, if any, the White House and Republican leaders would fold into a deficit reduction package. Senators are calling for their version to be included in the deficit talks because the bill has already passed the Senate. The House bill cleared the Agriculture Committee but has not been voted on by the full House. House members have rejected the Senate bill.</p>\n<p>Senate and House Agriculture Committee leaders have been meeting for weeks to try and reach a compromise on the different proposals. But the two sides are deadlocked on the size of potential cuts in food stamps, which makes up nearly 80 percent of the farm bill spending. The Senate bill would cut the program by $4.5 billion over 10 years, while the House version would cut $16.5 billion over the same period. Senators have offered to make deeper cuts, they but are unwilling to go as far as the House.</p>\n<p>House Agriculture Committee leaders have so far rejected the Senate offer as inadequate. The House leaders said they were waiting for a \u201cbalanced offer\u201d from the Senate.</p>\n<p>House lawmakers aren\u2019t the only ones who would be opposed to the Senate bill being included in a deficit reduction deal.</p>\n<p>Southern farmers have also voice their objections, saying the bill favors Northern farmers. Many Southern farmers, especially rice and peanut growers, say the Senate bill would provide an inadequate safety net because it would eliminate direct payments. Direct payments cost about $5 billion a year and are given to farmers and farmland owners, whether or not they grew crops.</p>\n<p>Both versions of the farm bill would eliminate the payments, but the Senate bill would replace them with crop insurance, which rice and peanut farmers say is inadequate in dealing with their losses. The House bill would include a price loss program, mainly for rice and peanut crops, to subsidize farmers\u2019 income if prices fall below target prices set by the government.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt is no secret that many Southern producers believe that the Senate bill is tilted toward \u2018Northern interests\u2019 at the expense of rice, peanut, and other farmers in the South,\u201d rice producers wrote in a letter to the group of 33 senators.</p>\n<p>The Senate has offered to provide some additional support for rice and peanut farmers, but the proposal falls short of what House leaders and Southern farmers are demanding.</p>\n<p class=\"live-byline\">\u2014 <em>Ron Nixon</em></p>\n</div>",

Grijalva of Arizona said in a statement. \u201cIt\u2019s paid for through a dedicated payroll tax separate from general budgeting.\u201d</p>\n<p>\n</p><div class=\"w190 right\">\n<img src=\"https://static01.nyt.com/images/2012/12/19/us/RECKON-3/RECKON-1-articleInline.jpg\" id=\"100000001964632\" width=\"190\" height=\"245\" alt=\"\" /><span class=\"credit\">Manuel Balce Ceneta/Associated Press</span> <span class=\"caption\"></span>\n</div>\n\n<p>Representative Charles B. Rangel of New York was among many on the left who echoed that sentiment. \u201cEveryone has a grandparent, a friend or a neighbor who relies on the Social Security benefits they earned to pay for medical care, food and housing,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cA move towards chained Consumer Price Index would be a long-term benefit cut for every single person who receives a Social Security check.\u201d</p>\n<p>Democrats and Republicans are considering switching Social Security payment adjustments to a \u201cchained\u201d Consumer Price Index. The Consumer Price Index tracks the price of a basket of commonly purchased household goods. A chained index accounts for consumers\u2019 tendency to substitute similar items for one another as prices fluctuate. A consumer might buy more apples when the price of oranges increases, for instance.</p>\n<p>Though it sounds like nothing more than a technical fix, adopting a chained index would squeeze benefits over time. The chained index ends up, in a given year, about 0.3 percentage points lower than the unchained index. That difference accumulates, so after five years, it might be 1.5 percentage points lower. Using a chained index would cut Social Security spending by about $112 billion over a decade, according to an estimate by the Congressional Budget Office.</p>\n<p>AARP, the lobbying and research group for older Americans, immediately criticized the proposal. \u201cWe would rather see a broader discussion addressing retirement security,\u201d said Debra Whitman, an executive vice president at AARP. \u201cWe object to the context in which it\u2019s being discussed, which is a few weeks before Christmas, without people understanding what the change really means.\u201d</p>\n<p>Because the payment reductions would accumulate over time, AARP and other groups argue that they would hit the oldest Americans disproportionately hard. They might also unduly burden women, who tend to live longer than men, and the lowest-income older people, who are most dependent on Social Security checks, the groups warned.</p>\n<p>Some economists and policy experts have also argued that both the current and the chained indexes underestimate the inflation that older Americans experience. The government produces an experimental \u201celderly index,\u201d for instance, that tries to capture the consumption habits of people over 62 more accurately than other measures. For instance, older people buy more health care and less education than the average family, so the elderly index puts more weight on the former and less on the latter.</p>\n<p>In no small part because of spiraling health care costs, inflation as measured by the elderly index has grown faster than inflation as calculated by the standard index that Social Security uses. That implies that the purchasing power of Social Security payments linked to a chained index would erode more over time, given what older Americans buy.</p>\n<p>\n</p><div class=\"w190 right\">\n<img src=\"https://static01.nyt.com/images/2012/12/19/us/RECKON-2/RECKON-2-articleInline.jpg\" id=\"100000001964266\" width=\"190\" height=\"244\" alt=\"Andrew G.

Biggs of the American Enterprise Institute.</span>\n</div>\n\n<p>Still, other economists and policy experts from across the political spectrum have argued that a chained index is a more accurate measure of the inflation that households actually experience, and therefore is a better policy tool. They note that the elderly index is still experimental, and that not just older people receive or spend Social Security payments.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe know that the current measure of inflation is not adequately measuring experienced inflation, and we should hence go with the better measure,\u201d said Christian E. Weller, a senior fellow at the Center for American Progress, a liberal research group based in Washington, and the author of a plan to modernize Social Security.</p>\n<p>Both liberals and conservatives have at times argued against making changes to Social Security outside the context of a broader overhaul. Many analysts \u2014 particularly Democrats \u2014 argue that Social Security does not contribute to long-term deficits because it has its own financing stream in payroll taxes. But it does have a long-term fiscal challenge, as payouts would eventually overwhelm its trust fund and revenues.</p>\n<p>\u201cBack when the system started, the demographics were really favorable,\u201d said Andrew G. Biggs of the American Enterprise Institute, a right-leaning research group in Washington. \u201cYou could provide decent benefits for the rich and poor alike at low cost. You can\u2019t do that anymore, mathematically. We could provide decent benefits for the rich and the poor by raising taxes a lot, but we need to raise taxes for other things.\u201d </p>\n<p>Mr. Biggs said Social Security changes that provided more ample benefits to vulnerable low-income older people and less to the well-off might prove to be a better path forward.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe oppose chained C.P.I.,\u201d Representative Peter Welch, Democrat of Vermont, said in an interview. \u201cBut I think all of us are waiting to see the details in the final package, and we\u2019ll make our determination then.\u201d</p>\n<p><strong><em>Correction: December 19, 2012</em></strong><br />\nAn earlier version of a caption in this post misstated Representative Ra\u00fal M.

Revenue has exceeded spending in just five of the last 50 years \u2014 in 1969 and from 1998 to 2001. The rest of the time, the government has borrowed some of the money that it needs.

It allows the government to provide Americans with a higher quality of life: more infrastructure, more services, more investment in the future. And as long as the economy continues to grow, the loans actually become easier to repay with time because doing so requires a smaller share of current revenue.<span class=\"read-more-link\">Read&nbsp;More&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><div class=\"show-more\">\n<p>Inflation helps in the same way: more dollars to repay the same amount of debt.</p>\n<p>Consider what happened after World War II. In 1946, the federal debt equaled 122 percent of the nation\u2019s annual economic output, the highest level on record. And over the next three decades, the amount the government owed almost exactly doubled.</p>\n<p>As the accompanying chart shows, the government ran annual deficits in most of those years. But economic output, and inflation, rose even faster. By 1975, the federal debt was twice as large, but it equaled just 35 percent of the nation\u2019s gross domestic product.</p>\n<p>Or consider a person who makes $10,000 and buys a home with a mortgage that requires annual payments of $2,000. Over the following decade, the person gets a few raises and a new job. Add in some inflation, and the worker is now making $20,000. The mortgage debt, however, does not increase. The person still owes just $2,000 a year.</p>\n<p>That\u2019s the sunny side, but deficits can cause problems too. Greater debt requires larger interest payments. Government borrowing can soak up money that might otherwise be available to businesses and consumers. The European debt crisis is a reminder that countries sometimes cannot borrow as much as they need.</p>\n<p>And the federal government\u2019s needs are getting larger. The chart shows clearly that the gap between spending and revenue has yawned wider since the mid-1970s, save for that anomalous interlude in the late years of the Clinton administration.</p>\n<p>In recent years, of course, the gap has grown even wider. The recession eroded revenues, and the government, seeking to stimulate the economy, increased spending.</p>\n<p>Over the last five years, spending averaged 22.8 percent of the nation\u2019s annual economic output, revenues 16.3 percent.</p>\n<p>What happens next? That is where the two charts diverge.</p>\n<p>In the first situation, the government jumps from the so-called fiscal cliff. That has a certain appeal. As the chart shows, revenues would increase, spending would plunge, and the annual deficits would shrink. Economists, however, predict that the nation also would plunge back into recession. \u201cThe economy will, I think, go off a cliff,\u201d the Federal Reserve chairman, <a href=\"http://www.marketplace.org/topics/economy/bernanke-says-fiscal-cliff-good-name-scary-thing\">Ben S. Bernanke, said at a news conference</a> last week.</p>\n<p>In the second situation, the government makes almost no changes to current policy and annual deficits shrink slightly before expanding again. That, too, has an obvious benefit: it avoids an immediate dose of economic pain. But it leaves the larger issue unresolved. Annual deficits, and the debt, would continue to grow.</p>\n<p>Both the Obama administration and Congressional Republicans would like to land somewhere in between: more revenues, yes, and less spending too, but not enough of either to eliminate deficits or undermine the economic recovery.</p>\n<p>So far, they have not been able to agree where those lines should be.</p>\n<p class=\"live-byline\">\u2014 <em>Binyamin Appelbaum</em></p>\n</div>",

                                                                things Moody&#x2019;s analysts need to see for their outlook on the United States&#x2019; debt to improve. The debt ratios would not change appreciably because the fresh revenue to be gained

                                                            <p>Moody&#x2019;s and Standard &amp; Poor&#x2019;s both said on Wednesday that the new fiscal package had bought Congress about two months&#x2019; time before it would have to enact big cuts in
                                                                federal spending &#x2014; as much as $1.2 trillion worth over 10 years. The two-month delay means the next round of high-pressure Congressional negotiations is likely to coincide with the

                                                                whether the AAA rating is returned to a stable outlook or downgraded.&#x201D; </p>

                                                                on a more sustainable footing.&#x201D; It also said the continuing uncertainty put the creditworthiness of America&#x2019;s states and cities under &#x201C;a fiscal cloud,&#x201D; because
                                                                many states rely on capital gains taxes, and the fighting in Washington could roil the stock market. Moody&#x2019;s said that the deal helped America dodge a recession for the time being,

                                                            <p>The third major ratings agency, Fitch, did not issue a statement in response to the fiscal agreement, but a spokesman said the observations Fitch had made in December still applied. Fitch said
                                                                in a report on Dec. 19 that it expected Congress to find a way to pull back from the &#x201C;fiscal cliff,&#x201D; but that it would not be &#x201C;a credible plan to reduce the federal budget

                                                    <p>Most of the observations that I was reading about the deal were highly concerned with tactical considerations: Who had moved most from their previous offers? What precedents were being established for
                                                        future negotiations?</p>
                                                    <p>As news about the negotiations evolved on a daily (or hourly) basis, the attitude of liberals and conservatives in my Twitter feed seemed to change along with it. Liberals seemed considerably happier
                                                        about the deal on Tuesday night, for example - after the House of Representatives nearly scuttled the deal and then passed it with mostly Democratic votes - than they were early Tuesday morning,
                                                        after the deal had passed through the Senate with an overwhelming bipartisan majority. But there had been no change to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2013/01/01/us/the-mcconnell-biden-plan.html?ref=politics">the policy terms of the deal</a>.<br></p>
                                                    <p>I do not mean to suggest that these tactical considerations are of no importance. It could matter that the House of Representatives violated the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Majority_of_the_majority">Hastert rule</a>                                                        -- the idea that that a bill should receive a majority of votes from members of the majority party in the House - in passing the bill. It could matter that President Obama, at an earlier point in
                                                        the negotiation, capitulated on his demand that the federal debt ceiling be raised as part of a deal, setting up another confrontation in a few months.</p>
                                                    <p>But I would argue that the attention paid to these tactical considerations is a bit disproportionate. They seem to make it easy to declare &quot;winners&quot; and &quot;losers&quot; at every turn in
                                                        the negotiations - whereas evaluating the deal in terms of the actual policy impact is much trickier.</p>
                                                    <p> Why is this so? Because each side has a variety of plausible <em>strategic</em> imperatives when it comes to fiscal policy - and they don&apos;t necessarily yield the same policy preferences.</p>
                                                    <p>Take the deal from the Democratic or liberal perspective, for example. What were Democrats&apos; major strategic goals? For some liberals, the goal might be <strong>redistribution</strong>: to adopt
                                                        a series of policies that result in a net transfer of wealth from high-income earners to middle- or low-income earners.</p>
                                                    <p>Other Democrats (and Republicans) might view the deal from the standpoint of <strong>taxes vs. spending</strong>: what is the ratio of tax increases to spending cuts?</p>
                                                    <p>Finally, there is the paradigm of <strong>expansionary or  contractionary fiscal policy</strong>. Since the economic recovery is still tepid, many liberals would prefer that the government continue to
                                                        stimulate the economy in the near-term at the expense of increasing the debt in the long term. (This consideration may have a political component as well, since a better economy will tend to improve
                                                        President Obama&apos;s popularity and perhaps increase his ability to achieve future fiscal and nonfiscal policy goals in the months and years ahead.)</p>
                                                    <p>Take one component of the deal: that the <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2012/12/31/obamas-wrong-this-cliff-deal-still-raises-taxes-on-the-middle-class/">cuts to the payroll tax</a>,
                                                        which had been in place for the past several years were not extended and will now expire. If increasing tax revenues is the major Democratic goal, the expiration of the payroll tax cut helped to
                                                        achieve that. But it also represented contractionary fiscal policy. And the impact will mostly be <a href="http://www.cbpp.org/cms/index.cfm?fa=view&amp;id=3505">realized upon the middle class and the working poor</a>,
                                                        which pay a higher percentage of their income in payroll taxes.</p>
                                                    <p>Most Democrats, I assume, would have preferred that the payroll tax cut had been extended: doing so would have achieved two Democratic goals (expansionary policy and redistribution), outweighing the
                                                        one that it contradicted (increasing tax revenues).</p>
                                                    <p>But when the overall deal is considered - not just the payroll tax, but all the other components, like the extension of unemployment benefits, or the increase in income and capital gains taxes for high-income
                                                        earners - it becomes much trickier to evaluate because of the different criteria that might be reasonably be applied to evaluate success or failure.</p>
                                                    <p>My objective here is not to advocate for any one set of metrics, or to &quot;score&quot; the deal that was struck on Tuesday - so much as to suggest that liberals and conservatives might do well to spend
                                                        more time considering what their strategic objectives really are. Just as is the case during election campaign, an obsessive focus on the latest developments in the news cycle can cause one to lose
                                                        sight of the bigger picture.</p>

                                                    <p> Mr. Obama strode into the White House briefing room shortly after the vote and lamented that the deal did not address the broader issues involving spending and debt but said &#x201C;we are continuing
                                                        to chip away this problem step by step&#x201D; and called on Republicans to agree on a balanced mix of further tax revenues and spending cuts.&#x201D;</p>

                                                        brought to the House floor less than 24 hours after its passage in the Senate, passed 257 to 167, with 85 Republicans joining 172 Democrats in voting to allow incomes taxes to rise for the first
                                                        time in two decades. The bill is expected to be signed quickly by Mr. Obama. </p>

                                                    <p>Only the most affluent American households would pay higher income taxes this year under the terms of a deal that passed the Senate early Tuesday morning, but most households would face higher payroll
                                                        taxes because the deal does not extend a two-year-old tax break.</p>
                                                    <p>The legislation, which still must overcome resistance exhibited on Tuesday by House Republicans, would grant most Americans an instant reversal of the income tax increases that took effect with the arrival
                                                        of the new year. Only about 0.7 percent of households would be subject to an income tax increase this year, according to the Tax Policy Center, a nonpartisan research group in Washington. The increases
                                                        would apply almost exclusively to households making at least half a million dollars, the center estimated in an analysis published Tuesday.</p>
                                                    <p>But the Senate&#x2019;s decision not to reverse a scheduled increase in the payroll tax that finances Social Security, while widely expected, still means that about 77 percent of households would pay
                                                        a larger share of income to the federal government this year, according to the center&#x2019;s analysis.</p>
                                                    <p>The tax this year would increase by two percentage points, to 6.2 percent from 4.2 percent, on all earned income up to $113,700. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/02/business/economy/a-bigger-tax-bite-for-most-households-under-senate-plan.html">Read more</a></p>

                                                    <p>The Congressional Budget Office said the freeze would cost $25 billion over 10 years, with most of that coming in 2013-14.<span class="read-more-link">Read&#xA0;More&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;</span></p>

                                                        <p>Congress offset the cost with changes in Medicare and other federal health programs. For example, it reduced Medicare payments to hospitals by $10.5 billion over 10 years after finding that many
                                                            hospitals had increased their Medicare revenue by describing the severity of patients&#x2019; illnesses in more detail.</p>
                                                        <p>Charles N. Kahn III, president of the Federation of American Hospitals, which represents investor-owned companies, objected to the cut.</p>
                                                        <p>&#x201C;We understand the necessity for Congressional action to avoid a dive off the fiscal cliff,&#x201D; Mr. Kahn said. &#x201C;But we are disappointed that scarce hospital finances would be used
                                                            to offset the Medicare physician payment fix.&#x201D;</p>
                                                        <p>The tax and spending legislation steers clear of the most contentious proposals for Medicare savings, which would, for example, have increased the age of eligibility for the program. The bill does
                                                            squeeze savings from health care providers. It cuts Medicare payments for nonemergency ambulance transportation of kidney dialysis patients, gives the government more time to recover overpayments
                                                            and trims payments to health maintenance organizations serving Medicare beneficiaries.</p>
                                                        <p>Under the long-term care insurance program, cherished by some Democrats, workers would have paid monthly premiums during their careers and could have received cash benefits if they became disabled
                                                            later in life. The program was part of President Obama&#x2019;s health care law.</p>
                                                        <p>Obama administration officials suspended the program in October 2011, saying they could not find a way to make it financially sustainable. Many Democrats wanted to keep it on the books, in the hope
                                                            that it could be revived someday. But Republicans wanted to repeal it, and they got their way.</p>
                                                        <p>The Senate Republican leader, Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, who was an architect of this week&#x2019;s budget deal, had criticized the long-term care program, known as Community Living Assistance
                                                            Services and Supports, or Class, saying it was &#x201C;destined to fail in the real world.&#x201D;</p>
                                                        <p>Senator John Thune of South Dakota, chairman of the Senate Republican Conference, who led opposition to the long-term care insurance program, welcomed the prospect of its repeal. He said the administration
                                                            had &#x201C;ignored repeated warnings about the financial solvency of this massive new entitlement.&#x201D;</p>
                                                        <p>However, a separate section of the fiscal legislation establishes a commission to study the need for long-term care and recommend legislation in about six months.</p>
                                                        <p>The 15-member panel is supposed to examine demographic trends, as well as the potential for new technologies to improve &#x201C;long-term services and supports.&#x201D;</p>
                                                        <p>The legislation also reduces Medicare payments for physical therapy and other therapy services when they are provided more than once on the same day to the same patient.</p>
                                                        <p>In addition, the bill would reduce Medicare payments for one particular radiology service when performed in hospital outpatient departments. Lawmakers specified the service in detail: &#x201C;stereotactic
                                                            radiosurgery, complete course of treatment of cranial lesion(s) consisting of one session that is multi-source Cobalt 60 based.&#x201D; The cutback is expected to save $400 million over 10 years.</p>
                                                        <p>In the future, lawmakers said, they may also cut payments to hospital clinics for services that can be done at lower cost in doctors&#x2019; offices.</p>
                                                        <p>The bill would save $4 billion in 2022 by extending cuts in Medicaid payments to states for hospitals that serve large numbers of low-income people. Republicans had sought bigger savings in Medicare
                                                            and Medicaid and said they would continue their efforts to rein in the growth of the health care programs, which together account for nearly one-fourth of federal spending.</p>
                                                        <p>&#x201C;What I&#x2019;ve seen does not include significant spending cuts,&#x201D; said Representative Phil Gingrey, Republican of Georgia.</p>
                                                        <p>Democrats said they would resist any changes that reduced benefits or access to care for Medicare or Medicaid beneficiaries.</p>

                                                <p>The <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/us/politics/www.nytimes.com/interactive/2013/01/01/us/the-mcconnell-biden-plan.html">last-minute tax package</a> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/02/us/politics/senate-tax-deal-fiscal-cliff.html">passed by Senate early Tuesday morning</a>                                                    included a nine-month farm bill extension that will prevent an increase in milk prices that was due to hit at the beginning of the year, but the proposal fell short of changes sought by dairy farmers
                                                    and lawmakers on the agriculture committees who were hoping for a new five-year bill to be included in the legislation.</p>
                                                <p>The most recent farm bill, passed in 2008, expired on Sept. 30. If a new bill is not passed or the current one extended, farm programs would lose billions of dollars in financing and would revert to a 1949
                                                    agriculture law. The old law would reintroduce higher government price supports for milk, corn, rice, wheat and other crops and could lead to higher consumer prices and federal spending. Milk prices
                                                    could jump to as much as $6 to $8 a gallon if farm programs are allowed to expire. Milk now costs an average of $3.65 a gallon.</p>
                                                <p>The Senate passed a farm bill over the summer, but the House failed to bring up its version for a vote after Republicans split over the size of the cuts to nutrition programs. The bills would have cut between
                                                    $24 and $35 billion from agriculture programs.<span class="read-more-link">Read&#xA0;More&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;</span></p>

                                                    <p>Members of the House and Senate agriculture committees had worked on getting the White House and Congressional leaders to include the bills in deficit talks, touting the savings as a way to get a new
                                                        five-year farm bill passed. But the Senate instead chose to include a proposal by Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky and the minority leader.</p>
                                                    <p>The proposal by Mr. McConnell would extend only portions of the current farm bill. The extension would have no disaster assistance, something farmers had sought after suffering through the worst drought
                                                        in 50 years in 2012. The proposal would also eliminate conservation programs and financing for fruit vegetable growers and organic farmers. The proposal does contain provisions to prevent milk prices
                                                        from increasing. But it would not include a program that pays milk producers when feed prices increase. </p>
                                                    <p>Mr. McConnell&#x2019;s proposal would leave in place direct payments to farmers, which total about $5 billion a year. The payments go to farmers or farmland owners whether or not they grow crops and
                                                        have long been a target of liberals and conservatives as an example of wasteful government spending.</p>
                                                    <p>Senator Debbie Stabenow, Democrat of Michigan and chairwoman of the Senate Agriculture Committee, called the extension incomplete and criticized it for continuing the direct payments that were eliminated
                                                        in the Senate farm bill.</p>
                                                    <p>&#x201C;Rather than embrace the Senate&#x2019;s bipartisan farm bill, which cuts $24 billion in spending and creates certainty for our agriculture economy, Senator McConnell insisted on a partial extension
                                                        that reforms nothing, provides no deficit reductions, and hurts many areas of our agriculture economy,&#x201D; said Ms. Stabenow.</p>
                                                    <p>Dairy producers also expressed their disappointment in the extension.</p>
                                                    <p>&#x201C;These stopgap measures don&#x2019;t even qualify as kicking the can down the road,&#x201D; said Jerry Kozak, president of National Milk Producers Federation. &#x201C;It&#x2019;s little more than
                                                        a New Year&#x2019;s Day, hair-of-the-dog stab at temporarily putting of decision that should haven been made in 2012 about how to move farm policy forward, not offer more of the same.&#x201D;</p>
                                                    <p>The House is expect to pass a similar farm bill extension Tuesday afternoon when it votes on legislation to stave off billions in tax increases and cuts in government spending.</p>

                                                <p>House members of both parties expressed little enthusiasm for a tentative deal to stave off large tax increases as they learned elements of the agreement taking shape on Tuesday.</p>
                                                <p>&#x201C;What I&#x2019;ve seen does not include significant spending cuts,&#x201D; said Representative Phil Gingrey, Republican of Georgia.</p>
                                                <p> Representative Michael C. Burgess, Republican of Texas, expressed dismay at the likely delay in automatic spending cuts, with no assurance of other savings to offset the cost. &#x201C;It&#x2019;s preposterous
                                                    to delay the sequester,&#x201D; Mr. Burgess said, referring to the cuts. </p>
                                                <p> Mr. Burgess said the leadership of the House Republican caucus had told members to &#x201C;stay close and stay sober&#x201D; on New Year&#x2019;s Eve, in case they needed to return to the Capitol on short
                                                    notice.</p>
                                                <p> Representative Earl Blumenauer, Democrat of Oregon, said the emerging agreement was vexing because it put off major decisions until a time when Democrats might have less leverage.</p>
                                                <p>&#x201C;We&#xB9;ll be in a squirrel cage,&#x201D; confronting similar issues in a few months, Mr. Blumenauer predicted. &#x201C;Democrats have all the leverage now&#x201D; and will probably have less in
                                                    a few months, when Congress debates an increase in the federal debt limit, he said. &#x201C;This reinforces all the worst political behavior around here.&#x201D;</p>

                                                <p>Another year, another fourth-quarter summons from the fiscal bench for Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr.</p>
                                                <p> The late entry of Mr. Biden to the tax-and-spending talks that have consumed the capital over the last two months recalls his role in the debt crisis of 2011 and once again seems to have been critical toward
                                                    cutting through the deadlock.</p>
                                                <p> Mr. Biden was handed the ball not by President Obama but by Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican minority leader, who called the vice president after growing frustrated by negotiations with
                                                    the Democratic majority leader, Senator Harry Reid of Nevada. Mr. McConnell and Mr. Biden have had good relations going back to their years together in the Senate.<span class="read-more-link">Read&#xA0;More&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;</span></p>

                                                    <p> As soon as the talks boiled down to Mr. Biden and Mr. McConnell, it became a relatively short path to a tentative agreement on taxes. The two talked late into the night on Sunday, with their last call
                                                        coming around 12:45 a.m. Mr. Biden remained at the White House along with Mr. Obama until 2 a.m. before returning to the vice presidential residence for a little sleep.</p>
                                                    <p> Mr. Biden and Mr. McConnell were back on the phone at 6:30 a.m. on Monday, and by the afternoon Mr. Obama and Mr. McConnell were both reporting a near-deal. The vice president and the senator agreed
                                                        on a compromise raising tax rates on income over $400,000 for individuals and $450,000 for households as well as renewing a variety of tax credits, increasing the estate tax on the wealthy and extending
                                                        unemployment insurance. But the two still remain in talks about how long to postpone automatic spending cuts due to take effect this week.</p>
                                                    <p> It&#x2019;s not as if Mr. Biden had not been part of the jockeying over the two months before the call from Mr. McConnell. He has sat in on the meetings and advised the president on what to do. But he
                                                        was largely a secondary figure as long as the action was centered on the House with Speaker John A. Boehner as the main Republican negotiator. Once Mr. Boehner gave up and handed off the issue to
                                                        Mr. McConnell in the Senate, the vice president&#x2019;s long history in the upper chamber put him back on the field.</p>
                                                    <p> Last year, Mr. Obama gave Mr. Biden the task of negotiating with Representative Eric Cantor of Virginia, the House majority leader, for a way out of a confrontation over the nation&#x2019;s debt ceiling,
                                                        but they failed to come up with a resolution and Mr. Obama and Mr. Boehner stepped in. After the two of them failed to reach a grand bargain, Mr. Biden and Mr. McConnell came up with an agreement
                                                        that resolved the issue for the moment but set up the automatic spending cuts that take effect later this week unless the two sides come up with an agreement to stop them.</p>
                                                    <p> The tandem between Mr. Biden and Mr. McConnell comes not from any ideological affinity; the vice president is a liberal Democrat and the senator is a conservative Republican. But Mr. McConnell has a
                                                        strained relationship at best with the other two main Democratic players, Mr. Obama and Mr. Reid, leaving the vice president as his best &#x201C;dancing partner.&#x201D;</p>
                                                    <p> &#x201C;They have a good relationship,&#x201D; said a senior White House official who asked not to be named discussing continuing talks. &#x201C;It&#x2019;s borne fruit before.&#x201D;</p>
                                                    <p> Both sides are hoping it does again.</p>

                                        <div class="content">
                                            <p>With a deal within reach to stop hundreds of billions of dollars in tax increases from kicking in Tuesday, Senator Mitch McConnell went to the Senate floor Monday to call on Congress to act now on the tax agreement
                                                and leave a deal on automatic spending cuts for the coming days.</p>
                                            <p> &#x201C;Let&#x2019;s pass the tax relief portion now,&#x201D; said Mr. McConnell, the Senate Republican leader. &#x201C;Let&#x2019;s take what&#x2019;s been agreed to and get moving. The president wants this,
                                                members of Congress want to protect taxpayers, and we can get it done now.&#x201D; </p>
                                            <p> Mr. McConnell was instrumental in all but securing a deal that would head off most of the fiscal punch if Congress could get it passed. When Senate Democrats all but walked away from negotiations, he reached
                                                for the phone and called Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. to find a new Democratic negotiating partner.<span class="read-more-link">Read&#xA0;More&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;</span></p>
                                            <div class="show-more">
                                                <p> &#x201C;I&#x2019;m happy to report that the effort has been a successful one and as the president just said, we are very close to an agreement,&#x201D; Mr. McConnell said.</p>
                                                <p> But a final deal is being held up by one last question: What to do about $110 billion in automatic spending cuts set to begin Jan. 2. Republicans want them to go into force unless they are replaced by spending
                                                    cuts elsewhere. Senate Democrats want to put them on &#x201C;pause&#x201D; for at least a year. President Obama said he would suspend the cuts with a mix of tax increases and spending cuts elsewhere.
                                                    And all sides are angry over the impasse.</p>
                                                <p> Mr. McConnell&#x2019;s solution will most likely be resisted by Democrats, who will see it as a clear Republican victory with the spending cuts remaining in place, at least temporarily. But many Republicans
                                                    are just as opposed to those cuts as Democrats because they hit defense programs especially hard. Pressure would continue to mitigate or reverse the damage.</p>
                                                <p> &#x201C;Let me be clear,&#x201D; Mr. McConnell said, &#x201C;we will continue to work on finding smarter ways to cut spending, but let&#x2019;s not let that hold up protecting Americans from the tax hike
                                                    that will take place in about 10 hours. We can do this. We must do this.&#x201D;</p>

                                            <p>Republicans responded to the president&#x2019;s statement angrily, accusing him of &#x201C;moving the goal posts&#x201D; just when a deal was in reach. They said they knew that the two sides still had to agree
                                                on how to suspend automatic, across-the-board spending cuts, but that they generally agreed such a suspension would be offset, at least partially, by spending cuts elsewhere. Instead, the president said
                                                any deal to turn off the so-called &#x201C;sequester&#x201D; had to be financed by tax increases and spending cuts in concert.</p>
                                            <p>&#x201C;He can&#x2019;t hold the middle class hostage when an agreement is ready simply because he wants to get the sequester done now,&#x201D; said a senior Republican leadership aide after the speech. &#x201C;That
                                                can be handled over the next month or so.&#x201D;</p>

                                            <p> President Obama said on Monday that a deal on taxes is &#x201C;within sight,&#x201D; though still incomplete, as negotiators scramble to meet a midnight deadline.</p>
                                            <p> &#x201C;Today it appears that an agreement to prevent his New Year&#x2019;s tax hike is within sight,&#x201D; he said in an appearance with supporters at the White House. &#x201C;But it&#x2019;s not done. There
                                                are still issues left to resolve, but we&#x2019;re hopeful that Congress can get it done.&#x201D;</p>
                                            <p> Mr. Obama used the occasion to warn Republicans that he will continue to press for more tax increases even beyond whatever may be included in a deal today. &#x201C;If Republicans think I will finish the job
                                                of deficit reduction through spending cuts alone,&#x201D; he said, then &#x201C;they&#x2019;ve got another thing coming. That&#x2019;s not how it&#x2019;s going to work.&#x201D;</p>
                                            <p>Mr. Obama also said that though he would have preferred a &#x201C;grand bargain&#x201D; that provided a comprehensive solution to deficit reduction, but that &#x201C;with this Congress that was a little too
                                                much to hope for at this time.&#x201D;</p>

                                                on whether and how to stop $110 billion in across-the-board spending cuts in 2013, an official familiar with the negotiations said.</p>
                                            <p>Under the emerging deal, income taxes would rise to 39.6 percent from 35 percent on income over $400,000 for single people and $450,000 for couples. Above those income levels, dividends and capital gains tax
                                                rates would also rise, to 20 percent from 15 percent.</p>

                                            <p>Talks between Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky are dipping deep into the weeds, a sign of how far negotiations have come toward a deal.</p>

                                            <p>Under the blueprint, income taxes would rise on incomes over $400,000 for singles and $450,000 for couples, but the affluent would take another hit. Two provisions phasing out the personal exemption and other
                                                tax deductions would be reinstated after being eliminated by the Bush tax cuts of 2001. The so-called PEPS and Pease provisions would begin kicking in on incomes over $200,000 for singles and $250,000 for
                                                couples.</p>
                                            <p>The tax rate on capital gains and dividends would also rise, to 20 percent from 15 percent, but that would kick in with the higher income tax rates, at incomes of $400,000 for singles and $450,000 for couples.</p>

                                            <p>Senate Democrats are pushing back hard on a deal that Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and Senator Mitch McConnell are closing in on, objecting vociferously to any compromise that suspends automatic across-the-board
                                                spending cuts for any time frame short of a year.</p>
                                            <p> A senior Senate Democratic aide said a one-year &#x201C;pause&#x201D; in those cuts &#x2014; known as sequestration &#x2014; is nonnegotiable. Mr. McConnell of Kentucky, the Senate Republican leader, has suggested
                                                a three-month suspension, according to officials knowledgeable about the negotiations.</p>
                                            <p> Senator Tom Harkin of Iowa, one of the Democratic Party&#x2019;s most senior liberals, took to the Senate floor to suggest that he will oppose the deal that is coming together.<span class="read-more-link">Read&#xA0;More&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;</span></p>
                                            <div
                                                class="show-more">
                                                <p> &#x201C;As I see this thing developing, as I have said, no deal is better than a bad deal,&#x201D; Mr. Harkin said, &#x201C;and this is a very bad deal, the way things are shaping up.&#x201D;</p>
                                                <p> Democratic officials stressed that no deal yet exists, but phone calls between Mr. Biden and Mr. McConnell have moved negotiations forward. Talks center on allowing tax rates to rise to 39.6 percent from
                                                    35 percent on incomes over $450,000 for married couples, an extension of unemployment insurance and a provision to prevent the alternative minimum tax from expanding into the middle class starting on
                                                    Tuesday. Negotiators are still apart on a tax regimen for inherited estates, but according to a Democratic aide, Mr. Biden has suggested a 40 percent tax rate on the value of estates over $4 million.
                                                    That would split the difference between the Democratic demand for a 45 percent rate on estates over $3.5 million and the Republican position of a 35 percent rate on inheritances over $5 million. Mr.
                                                    Biden has also suggested allowing tax rates to rise on singles earning more than $400,000 a year. On Sunday, Democrats had wanted that threshold set at $360,000.</p>
                                                <p> Democrats are leery that the vice president will give away too much, when they believe that they hold the upper hand politically. Mr. Biden and the Republican leader spoke past midnight last night and again
                                                    at 6:30 this morning after a series of conversations that began shortly after noon Sunday, when Mr. McConnell reached out to the vice president to break a stalemate.</p>
                                                <p> Skeptical Democratic aides said they still feared that the deal would blow up over the issue of sequestration. Republicans on Sunday said any &#x201C;pause&#x201D; in the $110 billion in cuts for 2013 should
                                                    be offset by spending cuts elsewhere. Democrats balked, and continue to balk, even after Mr. McConnell suggested that Republicans could accept a three-month hiatus. </p>

                                    <div class="content">
                                        <p>On top of everything else, the United States officially hits its debt ceiling today, starting a countdown clock that ends in a cash management crisis in a matter of weeks.</p>
                                        <p>The debt ceiling is a statutory limit on the amount the country can borrow &#x2013; currently, it sits at about $16.4 trillion &#x2013; which Congress periodically needs to raise if the country is spending more
                                            than it is taking in in revenue. Right now, of course, it is doing just that: The country is running deficits of about $1 trillion a year.</p>
                                        <p>Of late, Republicans have refused to raise the ceiling unless Democrats agree to commensurate spending cuts. In 2011, that led to the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/us/politics/www.nytimes.com/2012/04/01/magazine/obama-vs-boehner-who-killed-the-debt-deal.html">heated and ultimately fruitless debt negotiations</a>                                            between the White House and the House speaker, John A. Boehner, as well as the passage of the spending cuts in the &#x201C;fiscal cliff&#x201D; that Congress is now peering over. </p>
                                        <p>This time around, Republicans want to extract cuts, likely from entitlement programs like Social Security, in exchange for their help in lifting the ceiling. But Democrats have said that Congress should go back
                                            to raising the debt limit as a matter of course, as generally happened up until last year.<span class="read-more-link">Read&#xA0;More&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;</span></p>
                                        <div class="show-more">
                                            <p>Specifically, the White House has said that it will not negotiate with Congressional Republicans over the debt ceiling. &#x201C;We are not going to play that game,&#x201D; President Obama said at a meeting with
                                                the Business Roundtable this month. &#x201C;If Congress in any way suggests that they&#x2019;re going to tie negotiations to debt ceiling votes and take us to the brink of default once again as part of a
                                                budget negotiation &#x2013; which, by the way, we had never done in our history until we did it last year &#x2013; I will not play that game, because we&#x2019;ve got to break that habit before it starts.&#x201D;</p>
                                            <p>Democratic aides have described a strategy that is more literal than one might think: to simply refuse to discuss the ceiling as any kind of bargaining chip. But Republicans continue to see the debt limit as
                                                a potent piece of leverage over the White House. That has set up another major debt confrontation for early in 2013. </p>
                                            <p>Right now, the Treasury is undertaking &#x201C;extraordinary measures&#x201D; to give the government enough breathing room to pay all of its bills. But such measures buy Washington only so much time. In February
                                                or March, the Treasury secretary would need to decide which payments to delay or default on. </p>

                                    <div class="content">
                                        <p>If the Senate votes on any legislation to avert a fiscal crisis on Monday, they may have to do it without Senator Jim DeMint of South Carolina. </p>
                                        <p>The Republican senator, who <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/07/us/politics/jim-demint-to-leave-senate-to-run-heritage-foundation.html?_r=0">announced this month</a> that he would retire just two years into
                                            his second term to head the Heritage Foundation, has not returned to the Capitol for votes in weeks, and there were no signs that he would be beating a hasty return. No one answers the phone at his office and
                                            an e-mail to his spokesman was not immediately returned. </p>
                                        <p>While several senators returned at their own pace last week, when the Senate reconvened with a hope that a deal to avert the so-called fiscal cliff would be in the offing, most have made it back. Senator Mark Kirk
                                            of Illinois is set to return to the Senate on Thursday; Mr. Kirk has been away for a year after having a stroke. Senator Frank R. Lautenberg, Democrat of New Jersey, has also been missing this week as he is
                                            recovering from flu, though his office said the senator would return to vote should a deal come to the floor.</p>
                                        <p>While some of his colleagues may mourn his absence, Democrats no doubt will welcome it as Mr. DeMint is one of a handful of senators who might object to a unanimous consent agreement that must be obtained to get
                                            a deal before the 112th Congress&#x2019;s business is finished. </p>

                                            President Obama and Speaker John A. Boehner have sought to keep tax rates at their current level for some taxpayers while letting them rise for high earners, but they have not agreed on where to set the income
                                            threshold. Mr. Obama has called for rates to go up on income above $250,000 (he later increased his offer to $400,000), Congressional Democrats have said they would agree to $500,000, and Mr. Boehner has called

                                    <div class="content">
                                        <p>The Senate majority leader, Harry Reid, of Nevada, took to the Senate floor on Thursday to say absent an unexpected breakthrough, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/28/us/politics/senate-leader-fears-not-enough-time-for-fiscal-deal.html">time has run out on a deal</a>                                            to avert large-scale tax increases and budget cuts in the first days of next year. And in the Senate&#x2019;s current state of dysfunction, he could be right.</p>
                                        <p>The Senate, by tradition, has operated on negotiated agreements and unanimous consent to move legislation from one parliamentary stage to another. If just one senator does not sign on to such agreements, work can
                                            continue but only at a crawl. Here&#x2019;s the math.</p>
                                        <p>Mr. Reid could motion Thursday afternoon to bring up <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/22/us/politics/next-move-is-obamas-after-boehners-tax-plan-fails.html?hpw">legislation</a> that would extend expiring
                                            Bush-era tax cuts on incomes under $250,000, set dividends and capital gains tax rates at 20 percent, ensure the alternative minimum tax does not expand dramatically to hit more of the middle class, extend expiring
                                            unemployment insurance and temporarily stop across-the-board cuts to military and domestic programs. Assuming one senator objects to a request to move straight to the bill by unanimous consent, the Senate would
                                            then vote at 9 a.m. to cut off debate on that motion to proceed to the bill.</p>
                                        <p>If that motion got 60 votes Saturday morning, there would then have to be 30 hours of &#x201C;post-cloture ripening&#x201D; before the Senate actually votes on the motion to proceed to the bill. That would take
                                            the Senate to 1 p.m. Sunday. If again that procedural motion received 60 votes, the Senate would be on the &#x201C;fiscal cliff&#x201D; bill itself. Mr. Reid would then immediately file to cut off debate on
                                            the bill itself. </p>
                                        <p>At that point, under Senate rules, the earliest possible vote on final passage would be Tuesday, Jan. 1. By then, the 112th Congress would have disbanded and efforts to pass the bill would have to start all over
                                            again &#x2014; this time on the other side of the &#x201C;fiscal cliff.&#x201D;</p>

                                    <div class="content">
                                        <p>At the end of the year, the United States will hit its statutory borrowing limit, starting a countdown clock that would within a matter of weeks lead to it failing to pay all of its obligations, according to a statement
                                            from the Treasury Department. </p>
                                        <p>On Wednesday, Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner wrote a letter to Congress informing it that the United States would hit its $16.4 trillion borrowing limit on Dec. 31. The Treasury will &#x201C;shortly&#x201D;
                                            begin undertaking &#x201C;extraordinary measures&#x201D; to avoid the limit &#x2014; essentially moving money from pocket to pocket to give the government enough breathing room to pay all of its bills, from
                                            soldiers&#x2019; salaries to Social Security payments, after that date. But within weeks &#x2014; sometime in February or March, analysts estimate &#x2014; its required payments would overwhelm its receipts,
                                            leaving an unprecedented cash shortfall. That would most likely send financial markets into a tailspin and lead to another downgrade of the country&#x2019;s debt rating. </p>
                                        <p>This year, the debt ceiling has become a potent political football, complicating negotiations over the scheduled year-end tax increases and spending cuts, the so-called fiscal cliff. The White House wants the debt
                                            ceiling to be taken off the table in the negotiations and for Congress to raise it as a matter of course. (Congress controls the country&#x2019;s level of debt, by virtue of its controlling the government&#x2019;s
                                            power to tax and spend. The debt limit is a secondary check on the total amount of outstanding debt that Congress periodically needs to raise.) But Republicans have threatened not to raise the ceiling if President
                                            Obama vetoes a bill extending the Bush-era tax cuts for household income above $250,000 a year, and more generally have indicated that they intend to use it as a bargaining chip. </p>
                                        <p> </p>
                                        <p>The full text of Mr. Geithner&#x2019;s letter is below: </p>
                                        <blockquote>
                                            <p>December 26, 2012</p>
                                            <p>The Honorable Harry Reid<br> Majority Leader<br> United States Senate<br> Washington, DC 20510</p>
                                            <p>Dear Mr. Leader:</p>
                                            <p>I am writing to inform you that the statutory debt limit will be reached on December 31, 2012, and to notify you that the Treasury Department will shortly begin taking certain extraordinary measures authorized
                                                by law to temporarily postpone the date that the United States would otherwise default on its legal obligations. </p>
                                            <p>These extraordinary measures, which are explained in detail in an appendix to this letter, can create approximately $200 billion in headroom under the debt limit. Under normal circumstances, that amount of headroom
                                                would last approximately two months. However, given the significant uncertainty that now exists with regard to unresolved tax and spending policies for 2013, it is not possible to predict the effective duration
                                                of these measures. At this time, the extent to which the upcoming tax filing season will be delayed as a result of these unresolved policy questions is also uncertain. If left unresolved, the expiring tax
                                                provisions and automatic spending cuts, as well as the attendant delays in filing of tax returns, would have the effect of adding some additional time to the duration of the extraordinary measures. Treasury
                                                will provide more guidance regarding the expected duration of these measures when the policy outlook becomes clearer.</p>
                                            <p>Sincerely,</p>
                                            <p>Timothy F. Geithner</p>

                                    <div class="content">
                                        <p>In last year&#x2019;s budget talks, Congress set up the prospect of $500 billion in automatic cuts in military spending to help pressure political leaders to reach a broader deficit-reduction deal.</p>
                                        <p>The cuts, which would start with $50 billion next year, would be disruptive. But military analysts say they could be phased in more gradually than originally thought, eliminating the need for furloughs or layoffs
                                            on Jan. 2.</p>
                                        <p>As a result, White House officials and House Republicans believe that they can limit the fallout at the Pentagon if they miss that deadline and reach a larger budget deal sometime next year.</p>
                                        <p>&#x201C;It&#x2019;s not like a government shutdown, where things close and the lights go out,&#x201D; said <a href="http://www.csbaonline.org/about/people/tharrison/">Todd Harrison</a>, an analyst at the Center
                                            for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments, a research group in Washington. &#x201C;It looks more like a glide slope than going down a cliff.&#x201D;<span class="read-more-link">Read&#xA0;More&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;</span></p>
                                        <div
                                            class="show-more">
                                            <p>The defense secretary, Leon E. Panetta, who has said that the automatic cuts would be catastrophic, also toned down his remarks in a memorandum to Pentagon employees on Thursday.</p>
                                            <p>&#x201C;These cuts, while significant and harmful to our collective mission as an agency, would not necessarily require immediate reductions in spending,&#x201D; he wrote. But, he added: &#x201C;Should we have
                                                to operate under reduced funding levels for an extended period of time, we may have to consider furloughs or other actions in the future.&#x201D;</p>
                                            <p>Under the law that created the process, known as sequestration, uniformed members of the military would be exempt from furloughs or pay reductions, and war spending would be protected.</p>
                                            <p>But a significant number of the Pentagon&#x2019;s civilian employees could be furloughed or laid off, as could some of the contractors who build weapons systems and provide services to the military.</p>
                                            <p>The plan was created to cut spending automatically if the White House and Congress could not agree on how to meet caps on discretionary spending. Mr. Panetta has said sequestration would act like a meat ax,
                                                chopping about 10 percent off most Pentagon programs next year. If the plan is not altered, the cuts would add up to $500 billion over 10 years.</p>
                                            <p>Democrats initially hoped that the threat of the automatic cuts would help prompt more hawkish Republicans to make a deal on deficit reduction. But the level of military spending never became a major topic in
                                                the presidential election, and it has been pushed to the side in the latest negotiations.</p>
                                            <p>The <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/21/us/politics/house-moves-toward-vote-on-boehners-backup-plan.html">House voted</a> 215 to 209 on Thursday night to cancel the military cuts. The narrow margin in
                                                the House, which has 241 Republicans, suggested that &#x201C;the floor is getting soft under defense spending&#x201D; in general, said Gordon Adams, who helped oversee military budgets in the Clinton White
                                                House.</p>
                                            <p>Mr. Harrison, the budget center analyst, said that if the automatic cuts were to start on Jan. 2, they would unfold in several stages. The fiscal year started on Oct. 1, so the Pentagon would have three quarters
                                                in which to shave about $50 billion from its base budget of more than $525 billion.</p>
                                            <p>&#x201C;There would be no immediate layoffs,&#x201D; he said. And weapons programs that had already been financed would keep going.</p>
                                            <p>By next spring, the Pentagon would probably have to furlough or lay off civilian employees, and &#x201C;things could get messy,&#x201D; he said. It would also have to slow awards of new contracts, and it would
                                                have fewer employees to oversee contractors, causing more delays.</p>
                                            <p>Mr. Harrison said that unless the department could shift money from other uses, it would eventually have to reduce its civilian payroll by nearly 14 percent. Though the Pentagon has said it would try to avoid
                                                layoffs, Mr. Harrison said it could only achieve that level of savings through furloughs if nearly every one of its 791,000 civilian employees took a month off without pay.</p>
                                            <p>Because most weapons programs are financed in advance of the work, he said, the purchases from contractors might decline by only 3.5 percent next year.</p>
                                            <p>Military analysts said that if a broader deficit-reduction deal is reached, the Pentagon might have to accept from $150 billion to $300 billion in cuts over 10 years instead of the $500 billion under the sequestration
                                                law. It also would have more flexibility in apportioning the cuts.</p>

                                <div class="content">
                                    <p>Markets were down sharply on Friday after Speaker John A. Boehner&apos;s tax plan failed to reach a vote in the House on Thursday evening. No Democrats were prepared to support the bill, and Mr. Boehner told reporters
                                        that his plan also lacked sufficient votes among Republicans.</p>
                                    <p>A <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-12-21/a-fiscal-cliff-deal-just-got-more-likely.html">variety of smart political observers</a> have suggested that the markets are misreading the situation. Instead, they
                                        say, the failure of Mr. Boehner&apos;s bill makes a deal to avert the so-called fiscal cliff more likely because it has now become clear that any deal will need to rely upon the support of at least some Democrats,
                                        which could ease passage through the Democratic-controlled Senate.</p>
                                    <p>Perhaps this is correct. Mr. Boehner has said that the White House and Senator Harry Reid, the majority leader, will now have to take the lead in negotiations. The chance that a fiscal deal will be secured on terms
                                        that Democrats find favorable may have increased.</p>
                                    <p>But the chance that there will not be a deal at all may also have increased, or at least not one before protracted negotiations that could harm the economy. The difficulty is in finding any winning coalition of votes
                                        in the House of Representatives.</p>
                                    <p>In the diagram below, I&apos;ve charted the major coalitions in the incoming 113th Congress, which will convene on Jan. 3. The new House of Representatives will have 233 Republicans and 200 Democrats. Two seats remain
                                        vacant, which means that 217 of 433 votes will be required to pass a bill.</p>
                                    <p>Of the 233 Republicans, 51 will be <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-11-08/tea-party-freshmen-to-become-sophomores-by-keeping-house-seats.html">members of the Tea Party  Caucus</a>, give or take a few depending
                                        on which first-term members of Congress join the coalition. The other 182 are what I will call Establishment Republicans.</p>
                                    <p>As Keith T. Poole of the <a href="http://voteview.com/blog/?p=702">Voteview blog</a> points out, the Tea Party Caucus wasn&apos;t solely responsible for Mr. Boehner&apos;s failure to pass his bill. A significant number
                                        of Tea Party Caucus members were thought to support his plan, while some of the opposition came from representatives who do not formally associate themselves with the Tea Party. </p>
                                    <p>Nonetheless, it seems clear that Mr. Boehner lacks the confidence of roughly three dozen Republican members of the House, and possibly more. Erick Erickson, of the blog RedState, <a href="http://www.redstate.com/2012/12/20/urgent-last-few-hours-to-stop-the-boehner-tax-hike/">identified 34 Republicans whom he said opposed Mr. Boehner&apos;s bill</a>                                        and another 12 whom he identified as being on the fence.</p>
                                    <p>Say that Mr. Boehner cannot count on the support of 34 of his Republicans when it comes to passing major fiscal policy legislation. That means he would need to identify 18 Democrats who would vote along with the Republicans
                                        who remained with him.</p>
                                    <p>Here&apos;s the problem: it might be hard to round up those 18 Democrats. </p>
                                    <p>The reason is that most of the Democrats who remain in the House are quite liberal.</p>
                                    <p>In fact, the once-powerful Blue Dog Caucus, a coalition of moderate Democrats, <a href="http://thehill.com/homenews/house/268567-new-dems-hope-to-be-a-force-in-113th-congress">will have only 14 members in the new Congress</a>.
                                        The centrist Democrats who once filled its ranks fared very poorly in the 2010 midterm elections, while others retired or were harmed by redistricting or by primary battles. Although Republicans have moved more
                                        to the right than Democrats have moved to the left in recent years, according to measures like those developed by Mr. Poole, the attrition in the Democratic Party has nevertheless contributed to moving the two parties
                                        even further apart.</p>
                                    <p>What that means is that if Mr. Boehner has a significant number of Republican defections, as he did on Thursday night, he will need to win the support of at least some <em>liberal</em> Democrats. And a bill that wins
                                        the support of some liberal Democrats will be an even harder sell to Mr. Boehner&apos;s Republicans. For each vote that he picks up from the left, he could risk losing another from his right flank.</p>
                                    <p>Perhaps cooler heads will prevail in these negotiations. But a majority of the incoming House - 237 of 433 members - will be either Tea Party Republicans or liberal Democrats, leaving only 196 members who are either
                                        Establishment Republicans or Blue Dog Democrats and who might form a functional center-right coalition.</p>
                                    <p>Moreover, the House is likely to engage in repeated battles over fiscal policy during the next two years: not just the over the fiscal cliff, but also over the debt ceiling, annual budgeting plans and whatever stabilization
                                        measures might be proposed in the event of another economic downturn.</p>
                                    <p>If Mr. Boehner is having as much trouble whipping votes as he did on Thursday night, reducing the pool from which he might be able to draw together a compromise, this arithmetic problem could turn out to be intractable
                                        at some point.</p>

                                    <p> <iframe frameborder="0" height="270" src="https://static01.nyt.com/packages/html/elections/2012/debates/dashboard-video-embed.html?videoId=100000001970526" width="480"></iframe></p>
                                    <p>President Obama urged Congress on Friday to make another attempt after Christmas to pass a scaled-back plan before the end of the year to head off broad tax increases and spending cuts that would otherwise occur.</p>
                                    <p>After meeting with Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the majority leader, and talking on the phone to House Speaker John A. Boehner, the president said he was hoping for a formula that would gain enough support from both
                                        Democrats and Republicans to allow passage by bipartisan majorities in both the House and the Senate.</p>
                                    <p>&#x201C;We move forward together, or we don&#x2019;t move forward at all,&#x201D; he said. </p>
                                    <p>He said such a plan, among other things, would avoid raising taxes on the middle class and extend unemployment insurance payments.<span class="read-more-link">Read&#xA0;More&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;</span></p>
                                    <div
                                        class="show-more">
                                        <p>Mr. Obama stressed that he remained &#x201C;ready and willing to get a comprehensive package done,&#x201D; whether in a grand compromise or a series of steps.</p>
                                        <p>But the limited, stopgap approach, he said, is &#x201C;an achievable goal that can get done in 10 days.&#x201D;</p>
                                        <p>The House and the Senate are not expected to resume business until after Christmas.</p>
                                        <p>In the meantime, Mr. Obama said, &#x201C;Everybody can cool off, everybody can drink some eggnog, have some Christmas cookies, sing some Christmas carols and enjoy the company of loved ones.&#x201D; </p>
                                        <p>He acknowledged that there would have to be compromises in order to draw enough support from both parties.</p>
                                        <p>&#x201C;Nobody can get 100 percent of what they want,&#x201D; Mr. Obama said. &#x201C;And this is not simply a contest between parties in terms of who looks good and who doesn&#x2019;t. There are real-world consequences
                                            to what we do here.&#x201D;</p>
                                        <p>Describing the halting progress of the past few weeks, Mr. Obama said that &#x201C;I met them halfway on taxes and I met them more than halfway on spending.&#x201D;</p>
                                        <p>As he has done all along, he said that his primary aim was to avoid tax increases on lower and middle tax brackets &#x2014; but that the wealthy would be asked to pay more.</p>
                                        <p>The scaled-back plan the president is proposing would extend expiring Bush-era tax rates on incomes below $250,000, with a measure to temporarily suspend automatic, across-the-board spending cuts and an extension
                                            of unemployment insurance benefits, Democratic officials said Friday.</p>
                                        <p>The bill would be similar to legislation already passed by the Senate, but the added measures delaying so-called &#x201C;sequestration&#x201D; and helping the unemployed would make it that much more difficult for
                                            Republicans to oppose, Democrats said. </p>
                                        <p>Senator Reid was meeting with the president Friday afternoon to consult on ways forward. A Senate Democratic leadership aide said Mr. Reid would move forward with the stripped-down bill to avoid the so-called fiscal
                                            cliff only if Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican leader, agreed not to filibuster it.</p>
                                        <p>Asked whether he would do that, Mr. McConnell stepped onto an elevator and said, &#x201C;Merry Christmas.&#x201D;</p>
                                        <p>With just days to go before the automatic tax increases and spending cuts go into effect, Democrats are increasingly giving up hope on a major deficit reduction deal. They hope a fallback plan would win so much
                                            support in the Senate that Mr. Boehner would feel no choice but to bring it to the House floor, where a combination of Democrats and Republicans would push it to passage.</p>
                                        <p>Senator Max Baucus of Montana, the Senate Finance Committee chairman, said he was not briefed on the plan but would be willing to move forward on anything at this point.</p>
                                        <p>&#x201C;Whatever has enough votes in the House and the Senate &#x2014; the bigger the better &#x2014; but just get the votes,&#x201D; he said. </p>
                                        <p>The plan would do nothing to cut spending or put into motion changes to entitlement programs like Medicare, nor would it head off showdowns early next year on raising the nation&#x2019;s statutory borrowing limit
                                            or keeping the government running when a stopgap spending law runs out in March. But it would prevent a fiscal jolt in less than two weeks.</p>

                            <div class="content">
                                <p>Congressional Democrats on Friday prepared to offer their support to President Obama and the speaker of the House to strike a deal, even if it means the president&#x2019;s taking another step toward Republicans.</p>
                                <p>&#x201C;We saw the failure of &#x2018;Plan B.&#x2019; It&#x2019;s time to get &#x2018;Plan C,&#x2019; which is &#x2018;compromise,&#x2019; and use the president&#x2019;s current proposal as the basis,&#x201D; said Representative
                                    Steve Israel of New York, the chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. &#x201C;We&#x2019;re prepared to step up and get him the 218 votes, as long as it&#x2019;s fair and balanced, which the president&#x2019;s
                                    currently is.&#x201D;</p>
                                <p>Even before Thursday night&#x2019;s Republican rebellion, polls showed that Americans strongly support Mr. Obama&#x2019;s position on taxes, and more broadly that they are inclined to blame Republicans for the failure to
                                    get a deal. That could give the president carte blanche to stand his ground behind his last offer, which would allow taxes to rise on incomes over $400,000, raise $1.2 trillion in revenues over 10 years, cut $930 billion
                                    in spending over a decade and save $290 billion in interest payments on a lower national debt. By the White House&#x2019;s count, that would be balanced, $1.2 trillion in taxes, $1.2 trillion in savings, on top of $1
                                    trillion in spending cuts agreed to last year.</p>
                                <p>But at a Democratic leadership meeting after the Thursday vote was called off, Democrats discussed further concessions. Those could include raising the income threshold for tax increases to $500,000 and possibly inching
                                    higher on the $400 billion in federal health care savings Mr. Obama has offered.</p>

                            <div class="content">
                                <p>Representative Tim Huelskamp, a conservative Republican from Kansas who led the House Republicans&#x2019; resistance to House Speaker John A. Boehner&#x2019;s fiscal plan, said on Friday morning that he would not vote for
                                    any approach that raised taxes on anyone, no matter how wealthy.</p>
                                <p>Mr. Huelskamp said he blamed the failure Thursday night of Mr. Boehner&#x2019;s effort to pass the &#x201C;Plan B&#x201D; legislation on the House Republican leaders, as well as on Senate Democratic leaders and President
                                    Obama. He also criticized Mr. Boehner and the Senator majority leader, Harry Reid, for leaving town until after Christmas.</p>
                                <p>&#x201C;Let&#x2019;s do Plan W &#x2014; go to work,&#x201D; Mr. Huelskamp said. &#x201C;We can still get this done.&#x201D;</p>
                                <p>Mr. Huelskamp took this strikingly uncompromising stance in an appearance on <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/3080460/ns/msnbc-morning_joe/#.UNRktLbzd9U">MSNBC&#x2019;s &#x201C;Morning Joe&#x201D; show</a>. He described
                                    the Boehner approach to negotiations with the White House as a &#x201C;dive left.&#x201D;</p>
                                <p>&#x201C;We don&#x2019;t have to raise taxes on anyone,&#x201D; he said.<span class="read-more-link">Read&#xA0;More&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;</span></p>
                                <div class="show-more">
                                    <p>Without Congressional action on some kind of compromise, taxes will be raised automatically next year in all tax brackets. </p>
                                    <p>Mr. Boehner&#x2019;s office said the speaker would talk to the press at 10 a.m. Friday morning.</p>
                                    <p>Mr. Huelskamp, a frequent critic from the right of his own party&#x2019;s leaders, was one of three conservative Republicans ousted from committee assignments after the November elections by Mr. Boehner, apparently
                                        because they did not toe the party line.</p>
                                    <p><a href="http://huelskamp.house.gov/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=4259:a-victory-for-republican-principles&amp;catid=48:press-releases">In a statement on his Web page</a> explaining his opposition
                                        to the Boehner plan, he called it &#x201C;a &#x2018;show&#x2019; bill that asks us to compromise on our principles.&#x201D;</p>
                                    <p>&#x201C;Republican leadership thought they could silence conservatives when they kicked us off our committees,&#x201D; he said. &#x201C;I&#x2019;m glad that enough of my colleagues refused to back down after the threats
                                        and intimidation.&#x201D;</p>
                                    <p>Also on Friday, Representative Steny H. Hoyer of Maryland, the second ranking Democrat in the House, said on MSNBC that he hoped the collapse of the Boehner plan would open a path to compromise. </p>
                                    <p>He said that would mean shaping a &#x201C;balanced, fiscally effective&#x201D; formula, presumably including higher taxes on wealthier people &#x2014; but he would not be pinned down on a specific income level. </p>
                                    <p>&#x201C;Democracy is compromise, &#x201D; he said. But on the subject of tax increases, he said, &#x201C;zero is the answer to a large number of Republicans.&#x201D;</p>

                            <div class="content">
                                <p>In their efforts to resolve the pending fiscal crisis, Republican and Democratic negotiators are struggling to thread a very fine needle: finding budget cuts big enough to help stabilize the country&#x2019;s long-term debt
                                    but palatable enough to sell to both sides and the public at large.</p>
                                <p>Part of the challenge is that the biggest, fastest-growing expenses tend to be the ones Americans object most to cutting. Last year, a Kaiser Family Foundation and Harvard School of Public Health poll asked respondents
                                    whether they would support major, minor or no reductions to a number of programs.</p>
                                <p>Over all, Americans were most willing to cut foreign aid, spending for the war in Afghanistan and salaries and benefits for federal workers. But Congress could eliminate spending on foreign aid and Afghanistan entirely
                                    and still be left with large deficits.<span class="read-more-link">Read&#xA0;More&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;</span></p>

                                    <p>As of the 2011 fiscal year, the government was spending about $22 billion a year on foreign aid and $120 billion on the conflict in Afghanistan. But for the past four years, it has run deficits of more than $1 trillion
                                        a year. As for federal salaries, they have been frozen for the past two years. And if all federal civilian workers took a 10 percent pay cut, that would amount to roughly $19 billion a year in savings.</p>
                                    <p>Americans were far less willing to cut Medicaid, Social Security and Medicare. But those programs pose far and away the biggest challenge to the long-term fiscal health of the country, as Ben S. Bernanke, chairman of
                                        the Federal Reserve, and a number of other economic experts have long warned. Rising health care spending is often singled out as the one most pressing factor.</p>
                                    <p>Moreover, Congress has already wrung billions in savings from discretionary spending programs. According to an analysis by the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a liberal-leaning research and advocacy group, the
                                        Budget Control Act passed last year contained about $1.5 trillion in spending cuts over 10 years, about two-fifths from defense and three-fifths from other discretionary spending. That will shrink nondefense discretionary
                                        spending &#x2014; meaning public education, agriculture, infrastructure, aid to the poor and numerous other programs &#x2014; as a share of economic output to its lowest level since 1962 at least.</p>

                                    spending cuts.</p>
                                <p>Beyond numbers so large they are virtually meaningless to most Americans and a few specific proposals, like an adjustment to the Social Security formula, neither side has said much about how it wants to cut federal spending.
                                    Given that tax increases &#x2014; the most discussed point of the negotiations &#x2014; would by themselves <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/09/us/politics/tax-arithmetic-shows-top-rate-is-just-a-starter-in-talks.html?ref=jackiecalmes&amp;_r=0">only bring in a fraction</a>                                    of the $1.2 trillion in new revenue the president has called for, the omissions are all the more glaring.</p>
                                <p>At times, the comments can seem like funhouse mirror images.<span class="read-more-link">Read&#xA0;More&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;</span></p>
                                <div class="show-more">
                                    <p>&#x201C;Mr. President, let&#x2019;s talk about a balanced plan, but where are your specifics on the spending cut?&#x201D; Representative Eric Cantor, the Republican majority leader, said recently.</p>
                                    <p>The following day, Representative Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic leader, chided her Republican colleagues for <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/04/us/politics/boehner-counters-obamas-proposal-on-deficit-cuts.html">writing to the president</a>                                        to propose steep spending cuts and $800 billion in new revenue. &#x201C;The Republicans sent a letter &#x2014; perhaps you saw it? It had a number in it. It had no specifics,&#x201D; she said.</p>
                                    <p> </p>
                                    <p>The lack of specificity is especially striking from Republicans, because they favor a deficit package composed largely of spending cuts.</p>
                                    <p>There are several reasons that neither side is saying much publicly about the numbers.</p>
                                    <p>First, both sides generally prefer taking a &#x201C;you-first&#x201D; posture in budget negotiations. Although polls show that a majority of Americans favor generic spending cuts, the largest federal programs &#x2014;
                                        Medicare, Social Security, Medicaid and the military, among others &#x2014; are all popular. That gives politicians reason to stand back while the other side details proposed cuts, and then to criticize those plans.</p>
                                    <p>Second, this phase of budget talks revolves mostly around overall savings. The specifics are likely to be hashed out early next year, creating further reason for the parties to keep their views to themselves for now.</p>
                                    <p>&#x201C;The notion that we&#x2019;d put out a document that anyone could use to pick apart and bash us with, that just doesn&#x2019;t really gain us anything in the negotiations,&#x201D; said Representative James Lankford
                                        of Oklahoma, who sits on the Budget Committee and is a member of the House Republican leadership.</p>
                                    <p>With a tinge of irritation in his voice, he added: &#x201C;I do find it rather interesting the short-term memory that many people have, saying we haven&#x2019;t received a list of specifics from the House. We&#x2019;ve
                                        actually sent two.&#x201D;</p>
                                    <p>Mr. Lankford was referring to two bills passed this year by the Republican-led House that contain what Republicans say are the meat of their spending cuts. The principal bill &#x2014; the &#x201C;<a href="http://thecaucus.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/03/29/house-passes-republican-budget-plan/">Ryan budget</a>,&#x201D;
                                        named after its main architect, Representative Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin, the committee&#x2019;s chairman &#x2014; would overhaul programs like Medicare and reduce spending by trillions of dollars in proposed cuts
                                        over the next decade.</p>
                                    <p>The second bill included similar reductions as a way of avoiding automatic cuts that are scheduled to take effect on Jan. 1 if a deal is not reached, including paring services like food stamps, children&#x2019;s health
                                        insurance and Medicaid.</p>
                                    <p>Democrats tried to turn the 2012 campaign into a referendum on many of those proposed cuts, making Republicans think that it would be unwise to relight those battles. Since the election, members of the Republican conference,
                                        usually a restless bunch, have been reticent to talk more about spending.</p>
                                    <p>&#x201C;It really has surprised me a bit,&#x201D; said Representative Scott Rigell, Republican of Virginia, who has broken ranks with some in his party and disavowed a no-tax-increase pledge signed by almost every House
                                        Republican. &#x201C;I somewhat expected when the speaker initially indicated that revenue was on the table, a bolder voice of those saying absolutely not.&#x201D;</p>
                                    <p>For its part, the White House has proposed $800 billion in cuts. The president has said that half would come from federal health care programs; $200 billion from other so-called mandatory programs, like farm price supports
                                        that are not subject to annual Congressional spending bills; $100 billion from military spending; and $100 billion from domestic programs under Congress&#x2019;s annual discretion.</p>
                                    <p>For members of Congress not in the top ranks of leadership, there is one more reason not to talk in detail about cuts: Many of them do not know what exactly is happening in the negotiations.</p>
                                    <p>&#x201C;For us, we remain united behind the president,&#x201D; said Representative John B. Larson, Democrat of Connecticut, a member of the House&#x2019;s tax-writing Ways and Means Committee and one of the party&#x2019;s
                                        Congressional leaders. &#x201C;Everybody is always concerned about the details of any proposal. But to be brutally honest, we don&#x2019;t have a whole lot of details to look at.&#x201D;</p>
                                    <p>Anyone looking for more specifics is likely to be disappointed.</p>
                                    <p>&#x201C;At the end of the day the deal is going to be cut by the two principal negotiators,&#x201D; said Representative Tom Cole, Republican of Oklahoma. &#x201C;In these types of situations you either trust your negotiator
                                        or you don&#x2019;t.&#x201D;</p>

                                <p>The White House&#x2019;s effort to win support in the business community for a deal to end the fiscal impasse in Washington is set to continue on Wednesday afternoon, as top administration officials meet with the heads

                        <div class="content">
                            <p>President Obama said on Wednesday that he would veto Speaker John A. Boehner&#x2019;s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/19/us/politics/backing-off-deal-boehner-invokes-plan-b-on-taxes.html">stripped-down &#x201C;Plan B&#x201D; approach</a>                                to averting a fiscal crisis less than two weeks away, demanding that any package include an extension of expiring unemployment benefits and a variety of tax breaks for the working poor that are set to expire.</p>
                            <p>&#x201C;The American people have been clear that they will not accept an economic approach that places too big of a burden on the middle class, seniors, students and the most vulnerable Americans while asking too little of
                                the wealthiest Americans,&#x201D; said the White House communications director, Dan Pfeiffer. The Congressional Republican &#x2018;Plan B&#x2019; legislation continues large tax cuts for the very wealthiest individuals
                                &#x2014; on average, millionaires would see a tax break of $50,000 &#x2014; while eliminating tax cuts that 25 million students and families struggling to make ends meet depend on and ending critical incentives for our
                                nation&#x2019;s businesses. It would also cut off a vital lifeline of unemployment assistance to two million Americans fighting to find a job just a few days after Christmas.&#x201D; </p>
                            <p>The threat is more about getting deficit-reduction talks going again than stopping House legislation that would allow tax rates to rise on incomes over $1 million but do little else to get control of the deficit. House Republican
                                leaders are trying to round up the votes to push the bill to passage in the House on Thursday, against concern among ardent conservatives over the tax increases it would allow and among military hawks over the across-the-board
                                defense cuts scheduled for January that it does nothing to stop. Regardless, it has little chance to get a hearing in the Senate.</p>
                            <p>&#x201C;The president believes this moment presents both sides an opportunity to reach a significant, balanced deal that is good for American families, the economy and for our nation&#x2019;s future,&#x201D; Mr. Pfeiffer said.</p>
                            <p>Brendan Buck, a spokesman for Mr. Boehner, Republican of Ohio, called the veto threat &#x201C;bizarre and irrational.&#x201D;</p>
                            <p>&#x201C;Republicans have always said a broader, &#x2018;balanced&#x2019; plan is the ideal solution, and we have put one forward,&#x201D; he said in a statement. &#x201C;In the absence of a &#x2018;balanced&#x2019; solution
                                from the president, however, we must act to stop taxes from rising across the board in 12 days.&#x201D;</p>
                            <p>Mr. Boehner says he too wants to resume negotiations over a broader deal that prevents most tax increases next year but also locks in spending cuts and changes to entitlement programs like Medicare. But he says the president&#x2019;s
                                offer &#x2014; now in its third iteration &#x2014; is still too heavy on tax increases and too light on spending cuts and entitlement reforms.</p>

                        <div class="content">
                            <p>In the new year, the dairy industry could be facing a fiscal crisis of its own.</p>
                            <p>Unless Congress passes a farm bill or votes to extend the current law, which expired last September, milk drinkers could see prices surge to more than $6 a gallon early in the new year, government and industry experts say.</p>
                            <p>With a possible &#x201C;dairy cliff&#x201D; nearing, several lawmakers are scrambling to get a stalled farm bill included in the tax and spending deal between President Obama and House Speaker John A. Boehner.<span class="read-more-link">Read&#xA0;More&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;</span></p>
                            <div
                                class="show-more">
                                <p>Without action by Congress, several programs, including price supports for milk producers, expire at the end of the year. At that point, retail milk prices could soar because a complex federal milk pricing program would
                                    revert to a 1949 formula that would push up prices. Hundreds of dairy farmers also face foreclosure as a drought and high feed prices have pushed up operating costs.</p>
                                <p>&#x201C;With each passing day, the difficulty of enacting a farm bill before the end of this Congress grows,&#x201D; a bipartisan group of 33 senators said in a letter last week to Senate Harry Reid of Nevada, the majority
                                    leader, and Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the minority leader. &#x201C;Congress must do the responsible thing and pass a full, five-year reform farm bill,&#x201D; the letter said. &#x201C;Accordingly, we urge
                                    you to consider folding in the Senate&#x2019;s strong bipartisan bill in any end-of-year package.&#x201D;</p>
                                <p>The senators said the proposed farm bill cuts, ranging from $23 billion in the Senate version to $35 billion in the House bill, should be part of any plans to cut spending. It is unclear what version of the farm bill, if
                                    any, the White House and Republican leaders would fold into a deficit reduction package. Senators are calling for their version to be included in the deficit talks because the bill has already passed the Senate. The
                                    House bill cleared the Agriculture Committee but has not been voted on by the full House. House members have rejected the Senate bill.</p>
                                <p>Senate and House Agriculture Committee leaders have been meeting for weeks to try and reach a compromise on the different proposals. But the two sides are deadlocked on the size of potential cuts in food stamps, which makes
                                    up nearly 80 percent of the farm bill spending. The Senate bill would cut the program by $4.5 billion over 10 years, while the House version would cut $16.5 billion over the same period. Senators have offered to make
                                    deeper cuts, they but are unwilling to go as far as the House.</p>
                                <p>House Agriculture Committee leaders have so far rejected the Senate offer as inadequate. The House leaders said they were waiting for a &#x201C;balanced offer&#x201D; from the Senate.</p>
                                <p>House lawmakers aren&#x2019;t the only ones who would be opposed to the Senate bill being included in a deficit reduction deal.</p>
                                <p>Southern farmers have also voice their objections, saying the bill favors Northern farmers. Many Southern farmers, especially rice and peanut growers, say the Senate bill would provide an inadequate safety net because it
                                    would eliminate direct payments. Direct payments cost about $5 billion a year and are given to farmers and farmland owners, whether or not they grew crops.</p>
                                <p>Both versions of the farm bill would eliminate the payments, but the Senate bill would replace them with crop insurance, which rice and peanut farmers say is inadequate in dealing with their losses. The House bill would
                                    include a price loss program, mainly for rice and peanut crops, to subsidize farmers&#x2019; income if prices fall below target prices set by the government.</p>
                                <p>&#x201C;It is no secret that many Southern producers believe that the Senate bill is tilted toward &#x2018;Northern interests&#x2019; at the expense of rice, peanut, and other farmers in the South,&#x201D; rice producers
                                    wrote in a letter to the group of 33 senators.</p>
                                <p>The Senate has offered to provide some additional support for rice and peanut farmers, but the proposal falls short of what House leaders and Southern farmers are demanding.</p>

                    <div class="content">
                        <p>WASHINGTON &#x2014; As part of a deal being negotiated by President Obama and Speaker John A. Boehner to avert the worst of the year-end tax increases and spending cuts, Social Security payments might be lower in the future for
                            millions of Americans.</p>
                        <p>On Tuesday, Democrats and Republicans were examining a multitrillion-dollar deficit reduction package put forward by the president, though the two sides were trading barbed remarks and aides were emphasizing that nothing was final
                            until the whole deal was done.</p>
                        <p>But the White House seemed willing to make a concession to Republicans with a switch in the formula that ensures that Social Security payments keep up with the pace of inflation &#x2014; an idea that immediately proved unpopular
                            with its liberal base.</p>
                        <p> </p>
                        <p>&#x201C;Any talk of shrinking the program to save money is flawed from the start because Social Security is not part of the national budget in the same way as military spending,&#x201D; Representative Ra&#xFA;l M. Grijalva of Arizona
                            said in a statement. &#x201C;It&#x2019;s paid for through a dedicated payroll tax separate from general budgeting.&#x201D;</p>
                        <p>

                        <p>Representative Charles B. Rangel of New York was among many on the left who echoed that sentiment. &#x201C;Everyone has a grandparent, a friend or a neighbor who relies on the Social Security benefits they earned to pay for medical
                            care, food and housing,&#x201D; he said in a statement. &#x201C;A move towards chained Consumer Price Index would be a long-term benefit cut for every single person who receives a Social Security check.&#x201D;</p>
                        <p>Democrats and Republicans are considering switching Social Security payment adjustments to a &#x201C;chained&#x201D; Consumer Price Index. The Consumer Price Index tracks the price of a basket of commonly purchased household goods.
                            A chained index accounts for consumers&#x2019; tendency to substitute similar items for one another as prices fluctuate. A consumer might buy more apples when the price of oranges increases, for instance.</p>
                        <p>Though it sounds like nothing more than a technical fix, adopting a chained index would squeeze benefits over time. The chained index ends up, in a given year, about 0.3 percentage points lower than the unchained index. That difference
                            accumulates, so after five years, it might be 1.5 percentage points lower. Using a chained index would cut Social Security spending by about $112 billion over a decade, according to an estimate by the Congressional Budget Office.</p>
                        <p>AARP, the lobbying and research group for older Americans, immediately criticized the proposal. &#x201C;We would rather see a broader discussion addressing retirement security,&#x201D; said Debra Whitman, an executive vice president
                            at AARP. &#x201C;We object to the context in which it&#x2019;s being discussed, which is a few weeks before Christmas, without people understanding what the change really means.&#x201D;</p>
                        <p>Because the payment reductions would accumulate over time, AARP and other groups argue that they would hit the oldest Americans disproportionately hard. They might also unduly burden women, who tend to live longer than men, and
                            the lowest-income older people, who are most dependent on Social Security checks, the groups warned.</p>
                        <p>Some economists and policy experts have also argued that both the current and the chained indexes underestimate the inflation that older Americans experience. The government produces an experimental &#x201C;elderly index,&#x201D;
                            for instance, that tries to capture the consumption habits of people over 62 more accurately than other measures. For instance, older people buy more health care and less education than the average family, so the elderly index
                            puts more weight on the former and less on the latter.</p>
                        <p>In no small part because of spiraling health care costs, inflation as measured by the elderly index has grown faster than inflation as calculated by the standard index that Social Security uses. That implies that the purchasing
                            power of Social Security payments linked to a chained index would erode more over time, given what older Americans buy.</p>

                        <p>Still, other economists and policy experts from across the political spectrum have argued that a chained index is a more accurate measure of the inflation that households actually experience, and therefore is a better policy tool.
                            They note that the elderly index is still experimental, and that not just older people receive or spend Social Security payments.</p>
                        <p>&#x201C;We know that the current measure of inflation is not adequately measuring experienced inflation, and we should hence go with the better measure,&#x201D; said Christian E. Weller, a senior fellow at the Center for American
                            Progress, a liberal research group based in Washington, and the author of a plan to modernize Social Security.</p>
                        <p>Both liberals and conservatives have at times argued against making changes to Social Security outside the context of a broader overhaul. Many analysts &#x2014; particularly Democrats &#x2014; argue that Social Security does not
                            contribute to long-term deficits because it has its own financing stream in payroll taxes. But it does have a long-term fiscal challenge, as payouts would eventually overwhelm its trust fund and revenues.</p>
                        <p>&#x201C;Back when the system started, the demographics were really favorable,&#x201D; said Andrew G. Biggs of the American Enterprise Institute, a right-leaning research group in Washington. &#x201C;You could provide decent benefits
                            for the rich and poor alike at low cost. You can&#x2019;t do that anymore, mathematically. We could provide decent benefits for the rich and the poor by raising taxes a lot, but we need to raise taxes for other things.&#x201D;
                            </p>
                        <p>Mr. Biggs said Social Security changes that provided more ample benefits to vulnerable low-income older people and less to the well-off might prove to be a better path forward.</p>
                        <p>&#x201C;We oppose chained C.P.I.,&#x201D; Representative Peter Welch, Democrat of Vermont, said in an interview. &#x201C;But I think all of us are waiting to see the details in the final package, and we&#x2019;ll make our determination
                            then.&#x201D;</p>

                    <div class="content">
                        <p>It takes only two lines to explain the federal government&#x2019;s financial situation. The first shows federal spending, measured as a share of the nation&#x2019;s economic output. The second shows federal revenues. And the space
                            in between &#x2014; that&#x2019;s the deficit.</p>
                        <p>To be more precise, over the last half-century, federal spending on average equaled 20.6 percent of the gross domestic product, while revenues averaged 17.9 percent.</p>
                        <p>As those figures suggest, the government almost always runs an annual deficit. Revenue has exceeded spending in just five of the last 50 years &#x2014; in 1969 and from 1998 to 2001. The rest of the time, the government has borrowed
                            some of the money that it needs. And the next year it borrowed even more, to cover the old debts and the new deficit. Every year the government runs a deficit increases the total amount of the federal debt.</p>
                        <p>
                        </p>

                        <p>Borrowing can be very good policy. It allows the government to provide Americans with a higher quality of life: more infrastructure, more services, more investment in the future. And as long as the economy continues to grow, the
                            loans actually become easier to repay with time because doing so requires a smaller share of current revenue.<span class="read-more-link">Read&#xA0;More&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;</span></p>
                        <div class="show-more">
                            <p>Inflation helps in the same way: more dollars to repay the same amount of debt.</p>
                            <p>Consider what happened after World War II. In 1946, the federal debt equaled 122 percent of the nation&#x2019;s annual economic output, the highest level on record. And over the next three decades, the amount the government
                                owed almost exactly doubled.</p>
                            <p>As the accompanying chart shows, the government ran annual deficits in most of those years. But economic output, and inflation, rose even faster. By 1975, the federal debt was twice as large, but it equaled just 35 percent
                                of the nation&#x2019;s gross domestic product.</p>
                            <p>Or consider a person who makes $10,000 and buys a home with a mortgage that requires annual payments of $2,000. Over the following decade, the person gets a few raises and a new job. Add in some inflation, and the worker is
                                now making $20,000. The mortgage debt, however, does not increase. The person still owes just $2,000 a year.</p>
                            <p>That&#x2019;s the sunny side, but deficits can cause problems too. Greater debt requires larger interest payments. Government borrowing can soak up money that might otherwise be available to businesses and consumers. The European
                                debt crisis is a reminder that countries sometimes cannot borrow as much as they need.</p>
                            <p>And the federal government&#x2019;s needs are getting larger. The chart shows clearly that the gap between spending and revenue has yawned wider since the mid-1970s, save for that anomalous interlude in the late years of the
                                Clinton administration.</p>
                            <p>In recent years, of course, the gap has grown even wider. The recession eroded revenues, and the government, seeking to stimulate the economy, increased spending.</p>
                            <p>Over the last five years, spending averaged 22.8 percent of the nation&#x2019;s annual economic output, revenues 16.3 percent.</p>
                            <p>What happens next? That is where the two charts diverge.</p>
                            <p>In the first situation, the government jumps from the so-called fiscal cliff. That has a certain appeal. As the chart shows, revenues would increase, spending would plunge, and the annual deficits would shrink. Economists,
                                however, predict that the nation also would plunge back into recession. &#x201C;The economy will, I think, go off a cliff,&#x201D; the Federal Reserve chairman, <a href="http://www.marketplace.org/topics/economy/bernanke-says-fiscal-cliff-good-name-scary-thing">Ben S. Bernanke, said at a news conference</a>                                last week.</p>
                            <p>In the second situation, the government makes almost no changes to current policy and annual deficits shrink slightly before expanding again. That, too, has an obvious benefit: it avoids an immediate dose of economic pain.
                                But it leaves the larger issue unresolved. Annual deficits, and the debt, would continue to grow.</p>
                            <p>Both the Obama administration and Congressional Republicans would like to land somewhere in between: more revenues, yes, and less spending too, but not enough of either to eliminate deficits or undermine the economic recovery.</p>
                            <p>So far, they have not been able to agree where those lines should be.</p>
