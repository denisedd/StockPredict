Miss O'Connor was born in New York City February 6, 1925, the youngest daughter of Francis Barnard and Gabriella Gilpin O'Connor. She attended and graduated from the Chapin School in New York City and then from Barnard College, which was named for Frederick Barnard, her paternal great grand uncle, who was born and is buried in Sheffield. During a long working career that lasted until 2006, Miss O'Connor was employed mostly in the fields of public relations, fund raising and planned giving. In the 1950s, she worked as an editorial assistant, in succession, at Town and Country Magazine in New York, Realities Magazine in Paris, France, and Gourmet Magazine in New York. During her time in France, she also worked as an editorial assistant to the late Ludwig Bemelmans, remembered primarily as the author and illustrator of the \"Madeline\" series of children's stories. In the 1960s, she was employed in public-relations work and then, in 1970, became director of development for Girls Clubs of America and subsequently the Freedom from Hunger Foundation. From 1987 until 2006, she served as planned-giving officer for the national board of the YWCA and as director of trusts and estates for the Planned Parenthood Federation of America. She also held, in succession, all executive offices of the Planned Giving Group of New York and was a founding member of the Women in Financial Development organization. In Sheffield, she was a longtime and active member of the board of the Sheffield Land Trust and the finance committee, a member of the Sheffield Historical Society and of Christ Church, Episcopal. She was a passionate golf and tennis player until last month and an enthusiastic traveler. Her parents and three older sisters, Anne Fulton, Emily Fowler, and Frances Havemeyer predeceased her. A memorial service will be held Monday at 12 noon at Christ Episcopal and Trinity Lutheran Church, 180 Main Street in Sheffield, MA. In lieu of flowers the family suggests memorial donations may be made to The Sheffield Land Trust, 404 Legyt Rd., Sheffield, 01257, www.sheffieldland.org or Planned Parenthood, 434 West 33rd St., NY, NY 1001, www.plannedparenthood.org.",
