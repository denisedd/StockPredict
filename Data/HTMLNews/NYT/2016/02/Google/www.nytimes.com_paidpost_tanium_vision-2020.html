As the frequency of cyberattacks continues to increase worldwide, many companies still manage and protect critical systems with a patchwork of outdated tools, some dating back to the 1990s. Worse, as distributed workforces and connected devices tear down the boundaries around networks, the majority of enterprises cannot tell you how many devices they have on their network, much less what is happening on them, at any given time. IT leaders are forced to make decisions blindly, without timely data about the state of their defenses and the attackers. The threat and complexity will only grow as billions of new laptops, mobile devices and sensors plug into corporate networks worldwide. According to the research firm Gartner, the number of connected devices is expected to increase from 4.9 billion in 2015 to 25 billion in 2020. Each connected device opens a potential door to intruders. IDC predicts that by 2020, if current trends continue, one of every four people on Earth will be affected by a data breach. “The growth and complexity is already causing systems to break, and it’s only going to accelerate,” says Tanium Chief Executive Officer Orion Hindawi.</p> <p>Traditionally, companies have left these issues to IT to deal with. But these risks are now strategic to the business and the responsibility of the entire leadership team and the board. A single breach might not only expose the personal information of customers, leading to financial penalties, lawsuits and lost customer trust, but also reveal intellectual property and set a company’s progress back by years.</p> <p>But even in today’s threat landscape, there is reason to be optimistic. It’s an opportunity for a long overdue transformation to how organizations manage and protect our public and private data — as well as the critical systems that manage, store and transmit this data. Threats cannot be contained merely by adding more outdated weapons to battle the enemy. After all, the frequency and severity of data breaches is outpacing the growth in security budgets — companies are paying more and receiving less. Like any strategic challenge, modern cybersecurity requires a new approach.</p> <p>The risk of cyberthreats is as dangerous as an unexpected shift in customer behavior, an economic crisis or a new competitor entering the market — threats that executives and board members are held accountable for.

Today’s intruder is far more likely to be a 16-year-old using Google. And while organizations are building their arsenal of defenses, the intruders are slipping through the digital doors and windows left open by the organization. According to the 2015 Verizon Data Breach Investigations Report, 99.9 percent of attacks exploited vulnerabilities that had been identified for more than a year, some of them as far back as 1999. So the vital work for most organizations is not bolstering the defenses in place. Instead it’s a challenge of basic hygiene, from ensuring systems are up to date with the latest patches and software to understanding something as basic as how many computers are on the network. If you can’t keep track of the devices on your network, there is no way you can effectively manage and secure them.</p> <p>Organizations need to go back to basics and make good security hygiene practices a critical priority. In the wake of the U.S. Office of Personnel Management 2015 data breach, which impacted millions of government employees and contractors, U.S. CIO Tony Scott issued a 30-day cybersecurity sprint to agencies to shore up their systems, including a mandate to patch all known vulnerabilities. The challenge in achieving this lies in the technology used to manage, secure and control the billions of devices on corporate and government networks worldwide. Organizations need technology that was built for this new age of computing — not decades-old tools — to spot and respond to attacks as they occur, and ultimately prevent them from occurring in the first place. Scott described the outdated tools problem best: “It’s kind of like trying to put airbags on a ’65 Mustang — it just wasn’t designed for security, wasn’t designed for safety.”</p> </div> <div class="column two red tools desktop"> <div class="pullquote-container first"> <pullquote> <p>&ldquo;Networks have gotten bigger.

Investigations Report</p> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div class="column one tools"> <h2 class="sec-title">Do You Have the Right Tools?</h2> <div class="line-container"> <hr class="blue"> </div> <p>IT organizations have been adding security defenses as long as they have been using computers. Unfortunately, the tools used haven’t kept pace with the computing shifts of the past two decades, from virtualization to cloud computing. Most organizations still use antivirus software as a defense, a technology that has been around since the 1990s. And while there is a common understanding that antivirus is fool’s gold, many organizations still spend thousands to millions of dollars on this technology, creating a false sense of security while &ldquo;checking the box” for compliance. In more recent years, as new threats have emerged, hundreds of security vendors have responded with offerings to address them. The result is that many organizations are left to manage an outdated, dense stack of security tools, which are either ineffective of keeping attackers out or don’t provide data fast enough for an organization to actually stop an attack. According to the 2015 Verizon report, in 60 percent of security incidents, attackers broke into a system and compromised an organization within minutes, yet the majority of breaches took weeks to detect. IT and security teams desperately need a clear and timely view of the threats they face — in the moment they are happening — but they all too often must stitch together reports containing days or weeks-old data. What’s worse, while they might have been defending a few thousand computers 10 years ago, they likely have 10 times as many systems now.</p> <p>In 2013, IDT Corporation of Newark, N.J., was grappling with a typical and unwieldy complex of legacy systems, some dating back to the 1990s. In all, the telecommunications company was running 96 different security products, many of them overlapping or not providing the coverage required. Antivirus software was detecting only 20 percent of the threats.</p> <p>The biggest problem was time. Like other companies, IDT was facing constant streams of attack bots probing its defenses. Yet, all too often the response to these threats involved a system administrator spotting a red light on a dashboard, and then picking up the phone or even hurrying down hallways. Golan Ben-Oni, IDT’s chief information officer, estimates that it took his team four to five hours to investigate an attack. IDT found itself overmatched, says Ben-Oni. “We were bringing knives to a gunfight.”</p> <div class="swiper-outer one desktop dark-blue"> <div class="swiper-container"> <div class="swiper-title"> </div> <div class="swiper-wrapper"> <div class="swiper-slide one"> <h2>99.9<span>%</span></h2> <h3>of attacks exploited vulnerabilities known for more than a year (some dating back to 1999)</h3> <div class="background"> <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?> <!-- Generator: Adobe Illustrator 19.0.0, SVG Export Plug-In .

them visibility and speed. This meant cleaning out the clutter of legacy programs, and counting on fewer programs that could handle the speed required with automatic functions. Only machines could respond quickly to machine-generated threats. This shift also led to a strategic advantage. It reduced the need to recruit in the over-tapped market for security professionals, where there are now over a million unfilled positions.</p> <p>In the following three years, IDT reduced its security tool arsenal from 96 to 15 systems, including Tanium. Technology platforms capable of meeting the speed and scale requirements that IDT required replaced old standalone programs. The result? Investigations that used to take four hours can now race through the system in seconds. And the company is spending less on security than it did three years ago.</p> </div> </div> </section> <section class="content wide"> <div class="infographic one"> <h2 class="desktop">A New Approach Is Needed</h2> <div class="flex-container"> <div class="info-icon large" id="first"><img src="https://paidpost-assets.nyt.com/paidpost/tanium/vision-2020/images/magnifyingGlass.svg"></div> <div class="info-icon" id="second"><img src="https://paidpost-assets.nyt.com/paidpost/tanium/vision-2020/images/3_basic_hygeine.svg"></div> <div class="info-icon" id="third"><img src="https://paidpost-assets.nyt.com/paidpost/tanium/vision-2020/images/5_less_is_more.svg"></div> <!-- <div class="info-icon" id="fourth"><img src="https://paidpost-assets.nyt.com/paidpost/tanium/vision-2020/images/4_cluttered_toolshed.svg"></div> --> <!-- <div class="info-icon" id="fifth"><img src="https://paidpost-assets.nyt.com/paidpost/tanium/vision-2020/images/5_less_is_more.svg"></div> --> </div> <div class="text-container"> <div class="box first visible"> <h3>Continuous Visibility</h3> <p>Companies need to see what is happening on their networks and be able to respond to cyberthreats in seconds, not days or weeks.

It is vital not only to educate the board, but also to ensure that executives and the board take accountability over this strategic risk.</p> <p>Tanium and Nasdaq jointly commissioned a study of over 1,500 C-suite officers and non-executive company directors at Global 2000 organizations across five regions to gauge the state of cybersecurity awareness and readiness. At far too many companies, directors and C-level executives are disengaged from crucial security issues. At the most vulnerable companies surveyed, one in three have never received security training and 91 percent of those directors say they struggle to make sense of a cybersecurity report. This makes it nearly impossible for them to ask tough questions about these crucial issues, much less guide smart investment strategies for security.</p> <p>Even those who understand the risks often lack crucial information. According to the survey, 28 percent of all respondents report concerns that their anti-malware, antivirus software and patches may not be up to date. Among the companies at greatest risk, this number skyrockets to 87 percent. Those firms combine the worst of dangers. They’re vulnerable, but they often don’t know where or how.</p> <p>Most interestingly, the study found that a widespread lack of accountability at all levels of an organization is another critical culprit. 40 percent of respondents admitted that they didn’t feel responsible for cyberattacks, even though the report revealed that 90 percent of all respondents are at medium to high vulnerability to a cyberthreat.</p> </div> <div class="column two red language"> <div class="pie-background first"> <h2>90<span>%</span></h2> </div> <h3>of companies are at medium to high vulnerability for a cyberattack.</h3> <hr class="black"> <div class="pie-background second"> <h2>40<span>%</span></h2> </div> <h3>of C-level executives and board members admitted they didn’t consider themselves responsible for cyberattacks.</h3> <p>Source: Tanium/Nasdaq Report</p> </div> </div> </section> <section class="content wide"> <div class="infographic two"> <h2 class="desktop">The Accountability Gap</h2> <h3 class="desktop">Hover over the cards to learn more</h3> <h3 class="mobile">Tap the cards to learn more</h3> <div class="flex-container"> <div class="card first"> <div class="initial-text"> <div class="pie-container one"> <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" standalone="no"?> <svg width="162px" height="162px" viewBox="0 0 162 162" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:sketch="http://www.bohemiancoding.com/sketch/ns"> <!-- Generator: Sketch 3.5.2 (25235) -

Either succumb to the chaotic growth of information technology, placing the company at an existential risk, or assert control over the process.</p> <p>To face the growing risks, executives and board directors must identify the right battles to fight, put the right technology in place to fight them, and create accountability and awareness in the executive suite and the board.</p> <p>The key to success is confidence in the data used to assess risk and manage critical IT systems. Without accurate and up-to-date information, it’s impossible to understand where the risk is and how to mitigate it. 20/20 clear vision across all devices on the network, and the status of each device now requires data and action in seconds, not days, weeks or months. The technologists at Tanium have invented a software platform to provide this level of visibility and control with the speed required to secure and manage every device on the network, whether it’s thousands or millions of them. Now IT and security teams can detect and respond to attacks in seconds, while also helping ensure the basics of security hygiene are continuously followed.</p> <div class="pullquote-container second"> <pullquote> <p>“There are a lot of people who now consider security the biggest problem in enterprise IT, and it&rsquo;s not just CIOs and CISOs, it&rsquo;s CEOs and the board who are talking about it. That&rsquo;s heartening to see. This is a huge problem and unless it gets the attention it deserves, it&rsquo;s not going to get solved.”</p> </pullquote> <p>–Orion Hindawi, Tanium Co-Founder and Chief Executive Officer</p> </div> <p>It’s time for a new level of accountability for cybersecurity at every level in the organization, including the entire executive suite and the board of directors. Building the awareness to address these threats and make the right decisions for the organization will require cybersecurity training so there is a baseline of cyber literacy for technologists and non-technologists alike. At the same time, executives should evaluate whether they need to recruit technology and cybersecurity savvy directors to their boards, similar to the role the audit chair plays on the board to assess and control financial risk.</p> <p>Facing this growing threat, after all, requires the mobilization of the entire organization and new approaches to the technology used to fight the battle. It’s not an insurmountable task, but to survive in 2020, companies must get it right today.</p> </div> </div> </section> <div class="branded-banner"> <a href="http://tanium.com" target="_blank"> <div class="text-logo"> <h1>There is a better way to protect your business.</h1> <img src="https://paidpost-assets.nyt.com/paidpost/tanium/vision-2020/images/tanium_logo_reverse.png"> </div> </a> </div> </main> <div class="border-bar paid-bottom-border"> <p class="paid-disclaimer">The news and editorial staffs of The New York Times had no role in this post's preparation.</p> </div> <script src="//paidpost-assets.nyt.com/paidpost/common/js/paidpost-v1.0.4.js"></script> <script type="text/javascript"> require(['paidpost/toolkit'],function() { require(['paidpost/modules/slideshow']); require(['paidpost/modules/videoplayer']); }); </script> <script src="https://paidpost-assets.nyt.com/paidpost/tanium/vision-2020/js/app-build-v1.00.min.js"></script>
