    <meta itemprop="description" name="description" content="AUSTIN--Charles Lee, Jr.,much loved teacher at St. Bernard&apos;s School, New York City, died on February 15, 2016 of Alzheimer&apos;s Disease. He was 84 years old. Born in Pittsburgh, PA, son of Charles L. Austin, former president and vice chairman of Jones &amp; Laughlin Steel Corporation, and Louise Bradbury Austin. Lee went to St. Mark&apos;s School and thence to Harvard. He gave finance a good try for a decade, in Boston, London and New York, but happily for hundreds of boys, landed for good on East 98th Street. For 40 years he taught Latin, English and history to Sixth and Seventh Graders while serving for a time as Head of the Middle School. Stuart Johnson III, Headmaster of St. Bernard&apos;s recognized in Lee Austin a teacher who went beyond bare academics to affect the entire life of a boy, in an unpredictable way and with a light touch. He was a wizard in the classroom, able to unlock in his twelve and thirteen year old boys things that they did not know they had in themselves. He is survived by Dee Austin, the caterer, his wife of 40 years; a brother, three children: William Robert &quot;Trip&quot; McGleughlin III, Peter McGleughlin, and Julie &quot;Jade&quot; McGleughlin, and five grandchildren. A memorial service will be held at the Brick Church (91st St. and Park Ave) on Saturday, the 12th of March at 11:30am. Donations in his memory may be made to St. Bernard&apos;s School, 4 East 98th Street, NYC 10128. 1/3">
