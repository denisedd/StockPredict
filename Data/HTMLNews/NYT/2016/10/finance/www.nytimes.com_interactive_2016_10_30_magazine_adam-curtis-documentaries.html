  <p><span class="dropcap">I</span>f the first paragraph of this article were the start of an Adam Curtis film, it would begin with a flat, declarative statement. Something like: “This is a film about a curious afternoon in the summer of 2016, when an American novelist pretending to be a journalist went to meet a British journalist who wanted nothing to do with being called an artist.”</p><!--NYTDROP {"id":1, "pNum":1} --><p>The British journalist’s name is Adam Curtis. Now 61, Curtis has written or directed more than a dozen hypnotically watchable, hilarious and ominous films, all of which explore nothing less than the cultural and political subconscious of the last half of the 20th-century and the first decades of the 21st. I’d been obsessed with Curtis’s work for years; to meet him felt like a privilege. I was in a mighty fine mood too, having finished both a novel and a semester of teaching just days before. I was informed, by the friends who offered me a room in their Camden Town flat, that the London weather was good. Not good, <em>great</em>. Never mind that the world was in tatters and Donald Trump was smirking unstoppably toward Republican coronation. When Curtis suggested I meet him in the famous lobby of the BBC, I borrowed my host’s London map and tackled the crazy-quilt streets. My two-mile walk was exultant. A person who for years had been only an odd, welcome intruder in my brain was about to take me to lunch.</p><!--NYTDROP {"id":2, "pNum":2} --><p>Outwardly, Curtis’s films are journalistic exposés in a documentary mode. They often extend to three or four or even five one-hour episodes; more recently they’ve consisted of single continuous presentations lasting more than two hours. Curtis is not an underground presence, not in England. He is a longtime employee of the BBC, a.k.a. (sentimentally) “the Beeb,” a pillar of 20th- and 21st-century British self-understanding. The films take familiar subjects — the Cold War, the growth of public relations or financial or military-industrial bureaucracies, the premises of the ecology or anti-psychiatry movements, the enmeshment of Western democracies in quasi-colonial military adventures in the Middle East — and render them strange. Stories that might seem like “social studies” fodder become, in Curtis’s hands, compulsive, like a giddy horror film you can’t quit watching.</p><!--NYTDROP {"id":3, "pNum":3} --><p>His method is one of serenely bizarre juxtaposition. He pursues the art of the wild leap, at the level of both “form” (the editing in his films, which consists of abrupt jumps between disparate sequences and images) and “content” (his factual assertions, the lines he traces among seemingly unrelated events and historical actors; the music, which veers between trance-inducing techno-beats or ambient indie pop of the Brian Eno persuasion and satirically iconic standards or show tunes; and his own narration, which drones on authoritatively except when suddenly giving way to aphoristic headlines that flash on-screen in the manner of a <a href="https://www.artsy.net/artist/barbara-kruger">Barbara Kruger</a>-style gallery installation, or vanishes in favor of undigested imagery and song). It is as if your history teacher had decided to show you the brainwashing films that Malcolm McDowell was forced to watch in “A Clockwork Orange.” Like McDowell’s character, you at once resist and are seduced, and by the end your brain is both exhausted and enlarged, full of new things that don’t all seem to fit together. Unlike McDowell’s character, if you are me, you want more, and are willing to prop your own eyelids open to get it. Long before preparing to meet him, I’d been prone to spending too-long nights on Curtis binges on my laptop, resulting in Curtis hangovers the following day.</p><!--NYTDROP {"id":4, "pNum":4} --><p>Now, I won’t offer too much more of this rote, no-longer-very-New Journalism stuff — I swear never to mention anything either Curtis or I ate or drank — but it’s crucial that I offer a behind-the-curtain glimpse here, because it exemplifies a difficulty native to Curtis’s films. This difficulty could be called: Where Is This Voice Coming From? One of Curtis’s central subjects, running through all his work, is the possibility that we’re listening to the wrong voices in public life, and in our own heads; that the ideas we find authoritative and persuasive about our politics and culture are in fact a tenuous construction, one at the mercy of bias, invisible ideological sway and unprocessed, untethered emotions (principally, fear).</p><figure id="graphic-100000004731100" class="graphic">

<p>What this brings up, reasonably enough, is the problem of Adam Curtis’s authority: Who is <em>he</em> to be telling me this? Probably this was already in the back of my head during my happy walk through Regent’s Park. Had Curtis asked to meet in the lobby, rather than some modest cafe nearby, in order to underscore his platform at the BBC? Or to play against it? Or was there perhaps no modest cafe nearby?</p><!--NYTDROP {"id":6, "pNum":6} --><p>And, despite the humble cards I’ve played (weather, map, hangovers), let’s not ignore my present platform. “This is a film about a curious afternoon in the summer of 2016, when The New York Times came to make a polite visit to the BBC, in order to enclose one of England’s most unusual journalists within its own sphere of influence.” For some readers, these major-brand affiliations may be ennobling, and inspire confidence. For those more suspicious, the names of the mighty news organizations will be proof that deeper truth has, like Elvis, left the building.</p><!--NYTDROP {"id":7, "pNum":7} --><p>Curtis prefers you to be suspicious, alert to bullying ideologies that whisper in the guise of neutral authority (like “The Paper of Record”). And yet he wants you to believe <em>him</em>. Why shouldn’t he? And so a Curtis account of our meeting would reveal, through his dry, airy, insinuating narration, what you’re really seeing: not simply a jaunty middle-aged American stepping into a famous lobby to greet a boyish, alert, middle-aged Brit, but two media conglomerates in communion as well. The voice is essential. For, as Curtis would be the first to tell you, systems of power, influence and control are extremely difficult to depict on camera.</p><!--NYTDROP {"id":8, "pNum":8} --><p>I arrived, in fact, as Curtis was laboring at edits on his new film, “HyperNormalisation,” a nearly three-hour epic pegged to several present crises: Brexit, European immigration, suicide bombing, the war in Syria. The sequence under Curtis’s editorial hand today involved the financial firm BlackRock, which operates a powerful computerized risk-management network called Aladdin on the outskirts of an innocuous town in Washington State. Curtis’s belief is that Aladdin, in guiding the investment of now more than $14 trillion of assets around the world, has become an enormous unacknowledged force for stasis in an innately dynamic world.</p><!--NYTDROP {"id":9, "pNum":9} --><p>But how to show it? All he had to work with were a few archival talking-head clips, an Aladdin advertising reel, some footage he shot of the sheds housing Aladdin’s server farms and his own narration. Curtis was frustrated. “How do you illustrate something invisible?” he asked, as if he’d never solved this problem before, or at least not to his satisfaction. “It’s not even people doing keystrokes on computers. It’s just things roaring away. I’ll show you this 37-second shot, my driving past those sheds.”</p><!--NYTDROP {"id":10, "pNum":10} --><p>As we watched, Curtis told me about his admiration for the recent movie “The Big Short,” which tried to portray, for a popular audience, another facet of those invisible forces at work. “This is the whole thing about ‘good and evil’ — it’s a naïve view of the world. The problem is bigger, it’s a system.” Curtis and I briefly discussed a word coined by the critic Timothy Morton to describe a problem so vast in space and time that you are unable to apprehend it: a “hyperobject.” Global warming is a classic example of a hyperobject: it’s everywhere and nowhere, too encompassing to think about. Global markets, too. But naming a hyperobject alone is of limited use; human cognition knows all too well how to file such imminent imponderables away, on a “to-do” list that’s never consulted again.</p><!--NYTDROP {"id":11, "pNum":11} --><p>“I thought it was a brave stab at it,” Curtis said, continuing his analysis of “The Big Short.” “But my argument would be that even the financial system they’re pointing to is only a component of something even bigger, that we haven’t really put together. That bigger thing: It’s <em>my</em> hyperobject.”</p><!--NYTDROP {"id":12, "pNum":12} --><p><strong>“I want to</strong> be Adam Curtis when I grow up.” These words were tweeted last year by the gadfly American documentarian Errol Morris, director of “The Thin Blue Line” and “The Fog of War.” Morris’s tweet greeted the release of Curtis’s film “Bitter Lake,” a two-and-a-quarter-hour historical fugue on the American, Russian and British interventions in Afghanistan. “I’m embarrassed, because the amount of stuff I’ve learned from Adam Curtis is almost unending,” Morris told me. “There’s really no one like him here. I think of Seymour Hersh, who’s a different kind of animal altogether. There’s this raw intelligence — let’s call Curtis sui generis. Had I ever heard of Qutb before I watched ‘The Power of Nightmares’? Maybe you had — I hadn’t.”</p><!--NYTDROP {"id":13, "pNum":13} --><p>Morris was talking about <a href="http://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/a-lesson-in-hate-109822568/?no-ist">Sayyid Qutb</a>, the Egyptian author, Muslim theologian and anti-Western propagandist, who is one of the twin poles — the other being the Chicago-based conservative academic Leo Strauss — around which Curtis wove his three-part 2004 series, “The Power of Nightmares.” Qutb, who was partly educated in the United States, became a leader of Egypt’s Muslim Brotherhood and was executed in 1966 for plotting to overthrow the government of President Gamal Abdel Nasser. His intellectual lineage runs directly through Ayman al-Zawahri to Osama bin Laden. And no, I hadn’t heard of him before Curtis’s film either.</p><!--NYTDROP {"id":14, "pNum":14} --><p>“The Power of Nightmares,” a study of the parallel growths of radical Islamist violence and the neoconservative movement that defined the U.S. response to 9/11, was the first Curtis film that Morris, or I, had seen. The film’s thesis: that the present disaster was in some sense called forth by two oddly compatible apocalyptic responses to the anxieties raised by the fulfillments and disappointments of Western-style liberalism. Uncomfortable in 2004, the film’s assertions still attract dispute even as the central thesis has trickled into the popular imagination such that many who have never seen Curtis’s film now accept it as a given.</p><!--NYTDROP {"id":15, "pNum":15} --><p>If Americans like Morris and myself have tended to learn of Curtis’s work beginning with “The Power of Nightmares,” his British viewers usually started earlier, with his landmark treatises on the biases of technological utopian social thinking (“Pandora’s Box,” 1992); on propaganda, historical amnesia, brainwashing and nostalgia (“The Living Dead,” 1995); on the growth of popular psychiatry and public relations, and the merging of the cult of personal fulfillment with consumerist imperatives (“The Century of the Self,” 2002). “The Century of the Self,” in particular, is seen by many in Britain as Curtis’s signature accomplishment. These early works construct a kind of “bible” of Curtis’s thinking, upon which his later arguments build.</p><!--NYTDROP {"id":16, "pNum":16} --><p>The British director Stephen Frears began with “The Mayfair Set” (1999), which depicts a group of entrepreneurs who, starting in the ’60s, dismantled the power of the British state and helped usher the free market back into politics, with disastrous results. “It’s absolutely brilliant,” Frears says. “I was just watching television, and I couldn’t believe what I was seeing. It was such a dazzling analysis. He’s a cult figure in England, but he has access. The BBC is the greatest broadcasting organization in the world. In ‘Bitter Lake,’ he had all the material. He’s standing in the right place, inside that archive.” Even among those skeptical of Curtis’s narratives, his masterly use of the BBC archive — his uncanny capacity to excavate sequences from the dark side of journalism’s moon and the expressive power he finds in their juxtaposition — produces awe. Curtis possesses a “dazzlingly acute eye,” wrote Andrew Anthony in The Observer, even as he accused him of “superimposing his own creative theory as journalistic fact.”</p><!--NYTDROP {"id":17, "pNum":17} --><p>Curtis is justly proud of his adeptness in the archives: “It’s all stored in a giant warehouse on the outskirts of West London, deliberately kept anonymous. It’s the biggest film archive in the world. The cataloging is good, although it’s been done at different stages. But, because the BBC is an organization that has a vast global news output, I discovered that, throughout the 1980s, there were these giant two-inch videotapes, called COMP tapes, onto which satellites would just dump stuff overnight. And they’re not well cataloged. You can go to a news item and see; if there was a COMP tape for that day, you can order it up. Those two-inch tapes start to degrade, but they’ve been transferred, and they’re amazing.”</p><!--NYTDROP {"id":18, "pNum":18} --><p>Pause.</p><p>“Or no. Sometimes they’re very boring. Sometimes they’re like an hour of a chair waiting for someone to come to it. I don’t do that Andy Warhol stuff of a chair for an hour. But then, someone will come to the chair and prepare, and you’ve got that moment. When one of those COMP tapes turns up for me because of something I’ve ordered, I just press fast forward and go through it all. Until something catches my eye, and then I will then digitize it. And I’ve got a very good memory. I have a pattern memory, an associative way of thinking.”</p><!--NYTDROP {"id":19, "pNum":20} --><p>Pause.</p><p>“If you really want to know, it’s like a computer game, the archive. There are different levels. Most people can only get to Level 1. I can get to Level 6.”</p><!--NYTDROP {"id":20, "pNum":22} --><p>Readers may recall a sequence from Michael Moore’s “Fahrenheit 9/11,” in which Deputy Secretary of Defense Paul Wolfowitz was inadvertently caught <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bnpTK5mgZQ">licking his comb</a> as he readied to go on camera. The moment was imperishable, and cruel. As it happens, Curtis has made it a recurring emblem of his work to show familiar figures of power — Tony Blair, Ronald Reagan, Thatcher, Putin, many others — in interstitial moments of a similar kind, often precisely when they have taken a chair in preparation for the red light to go on, and are either unaware they are already being recorded or too bored to care.</p><!--NYTDROP {"id":21, "pNum":23} --><p>Curtis’s brief against world leaders — or at least the policies they’re chosen to embody, at the cost of great misery — is pretty savage. Neoliberals fare as poorly as neocons. He’s got no love for tyrants either. But he doesn’t opt, as Moore did with Wolfowitz, to expose his politicians as pathetic. The tiny portraits he carves from the archives are, instead, strangely tender. The human souls in question often appear introspective, as if measuring their self-possession, or discreetly consulting some inner oracle. Bill Clinton coughs. Hillary Clinton nods to herself, hesitates, smiles. Putin shrugs. Hafez al-Assad merely waits, thinking.</p><!--NYTDROP {"id":22, "pNum":24} --><p>Curtis’s films often have surprise bonus protagonists — guest stars, in television terms. In “HyperNormalisation,” it is Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi who steals the show, thanks to a stream of uncanny archival appearances of this kind, including one in which he pours himself a healthy glass of milk from a pitcher. Curtis, by testimony of his narration, regards the sinister, flamboyant Qaddafi as the West’s polymorphous dupe, less a monster than a man monstrously acted upon — a fictional character in a story the West told itself to skirt harder truths. “Violence born out of political struggles for power,” Curtis said, “became replaced by a much simpler image, of the head of a rogue state, who became more like an archcriminal who wanted to terrorize the world.”</p><!--NYTDROP {"id":23, "pNum":25} --><p>With each new bit of footage, a glance, a shy smile, Qaddafi’s human presence seeps unexpectedly into the viewer’s sympathies. Reagan’s does as well. Curtis’s politicians, ultimately, contend with their own bafflement in the face of the unseen forces shaping their world. They’re traveling with us, stuck inside the hyperobject.</p><!--NYTDROP {"id":24, "pNum":26} --><p><strong>Curtis grew up</strong> in Platt, North Kent, just outside Greater London. His father was a cinematographer who worked with the British documentarian Humphrey Jennings, with the “Death Wish” director Michael Winner and on “The Buccaneers,” a pirate-themed television program starring Robert Shaw. Curtis’s family was left-wing. “According to family talk,” he said, his great-uncle was a committed Trotskyite. His socialist grandfather, meanwhile, “would stand as a member of Parliament for seats he would never, ever win — and he did it every election.”</p><!--NYTDROP {"id":25, "pNum":27} --><p>Curtis earned a degree in the human sciences at Oxford, then briefly taught there. Unsatisfied with academia, he took a job at the BBC, eventually going to work in the early ’80s as a segment producer on “That’s Life!” a kind of cross between “60 Minutes” and “Candid Camera.” There, Curtis learned his craft. “One week I was sent up to Edinburgh to film a singing dog,” he said. “His owner said that when he played the bagpipes, the dog would sing Scottish songs. We set the camera up. The owner dressed up in a kilt and started to play the bagpipes. The dog refused to sing. It just sat there looking at me just saying nothing. It just sat there, with a really smug look on its face. This went on for about two hours.” Curtis phoned his producer. “She said: ‘Darling, that is wonderful. Don’t you see that the dog refusing to sing for a man dressed up in a kilt is actually very funny? Go back and keep filming. Film the dog doing nothing. But film the man as well.’ ”</p><!--NYTDROP {"id":26, "pNum":28} --><p>“So I did. We ran a long close-up shot of the dog’s face with the sound of out-of-tune bagpipes. It was quite avant-garde, but the audience loved it, especially when you cut it against the face of the man puffing at the bagpipes who genuinely believed that the dog was about to sing.</p><!--NYTDROP {"id":27, "pNum":29} --><p>“That time with a dog taught me the fundamental basics of journalism. That what really happens is the key thing; you mustn’t try and force the reality in front of you into a predictable story. What you should do is notice what is happening in front of your eyes, and what instinctively your reaction is. And my reaction was that I hated the dog as it looked at me silently. So I made a short film about that.”</p><!--NYTDROP {"id":28, "pNum":30} --><p>Despite his Oxford education, a hint of a provincial resentment defines Curtis’s attitudes toward London’s cultural intelligentsia. Americans might model this as the “John Lennon syndrome” (as opposed to the sense of ease and entitlement exhibited by, say, Mick Jagger). “The snooty people disagree with me,” he said. “The posh literary lot. They don’t like me because they think I’m not elegant and literary and I don’t make enough references. And what I do is I play fast and loose — not with the facts, they’re not interested in that — but with my aesthetic responses. I put pop music, David Bowie, in the middle of an Afghan film. It’s all a bit vulgar.”</p>

<p>Curtis foregrounds such tonal collisions, and he still delights in the comedy of dogs refusing to sing on cue, especially when the dogs in question are influential scientists, famous politicians or pontificating news presenters. He underlines the pratfalls and discontinuities of our neoliberal consensus not only with pop songs but also with an occasional <em>boing</em>! sound straight out of a cartoon soundtrack. Curtis isn’t frightened, and he doesn’t want to frighten you either. “I try to do the very opposite,” he said. He prefers using “all sorts of devices and jokes and parodies of fear to undercut the fear, to try and pull the poison. Because people are overwhelmed.”</p><!--NYTDROP {"id":30, "pNum":32} --><p>“Movies are an authoritarian medium,” wrote David Foster Wallace in 1996. “They vulnerabilize you and then dominate you.” Wallace’s cautionary tone typifies humanistic reservations about the power of the moving image, in the hands of a spellbinder like Curtis (or, in Wallace’s essay, David Lynch). “Film’s overwhelming power isn’t news,” Wallace continued. “But different kinds of movies use this power in different ways. Art film is essentially teleological: it tries in various ways to ‘wake the audience up’ or render us more ‘conscious.’ ”</p><!--NYTDROP {"id":31, "pNum":33} --><p>Curtis alludes to such aims only in the plainest terms. “I use music and all the cultural references that I would talk to my friends about, so it feels like a program made by someone you know,” he said. “Also, what I do deliberately, is I show the joins. There’s no reason you can’t join any two pieces of film up. So I will often in the editing deliberately make a discordant edit. It just makes you aware of what it is you are watching.”</p><!--NYTDROP {"id":32, "pNum":34} --><p><strong>Curtis has as</strong> at least as much in common with installation artists like Kruger or Christian Marclay as he does with shoe-leather reporters like Hersh — indeed, his most anomalous project, “Everything Is Going According to Plan” (2013), consisted of a site-specific film-concert hybrid at the Park Avenue Armory in Manhattan, in collaboration with the band Massive Attack. But Curtis defiantly resists being called an “artist.” “If you’re an artist, you tend to have that rather smug sense of, I’m doing this great work,” he said. “I don’t have that at all. I go out and I find stories, and I find ways of doing them in an imaginative way. I’m a journalist, and I’m responding to my time. That’s it.” Forget Curtis’s collaborations with rock musicians; never mind the cover “it’s art” might offer him from critics complaining that he lacks footnotes and dabbles too much in allusion and mood; and never mind how every plumber is supposed to want to be a poet. Curtis wants no part of it.</p><!--NYTDROP {"id":33, "pNum":35} --><p>His grudge against contemporary art can seem either a provocation or an eccentricity, until he places it in relation to a few of his key terms, like “consumer capitalism” and “the self.” “The problem is that the central ideology of our age is the idea of self-expression,” he said. “That the self, being expressive, is the good thing. It’s what I trace in ‘The Century of the Self.’ Expressing yourself through consumerism is central. So, the dilemma for artists is that however radical in content their paintings, their performance art, their video works, the mode in which they’re doing it — self-expression — feeds the strength of the very thing they’re trying to overthrow, which is modern consumer capitalism.”</p><!--NYTDROP {"id":34, "pNum":36} --><p>Curtis prefers Balzac, the novelist of intricate social tapestries, to the modernist tradition of interiority defined by Woolf and Proust. But the novelist he claims as inspiration is Dos Passos, whose “U.S.A.” trilogy he read when he was a boy, and whose centrifugal blend of pastiche and documentation may be the key to Curtis’s style. At the other end, Curtis’s artistic nemesis is Andy Warhol. “I’ve got this idea. I call it the I.A.R., the Inappropriate Aesthetic Response. I date it back to Warhol. It’s this idea you can take horrific images like the electric chair and aestheticize them. The beheading videos, the orange jumpsuits against the desert background; ISIS uses that knowingly. I have a ruthless theory, that the radical-art movement, which grew out of the failure of revolutionary politics, becomes the outriders for the property developers. You need the aesthetic of decline in order to make those buildings desirable.”</p><!--NYTDROP {"id":35, "pNum":37} --><p>“HyperNormalisation” is a summation of one of Curtis’s major themes: that liberalism — since the collapse of certainty about how its values would transform politics, finance and journalism — has in fact become genuinely conservative. In a world of unpredictability, it has retreated from genuine frontiers, instead opting for holding actions that can make it feel stable and safe.</p><!--NYTDROP {"id":36, "pNum":38} --><p>So we live, thanks to our advanced systems of monitoring, compensation and control, in a bubble of our own devising. And in Curtis’s critique, contemporary artists and hipsters do as much to create this bubble as the internet itself. “On a social-media network, it’s very much like being in a heroin bubble. As a radical artist in the 1970s, you used to go and take heroin and wander through the chaos and the collapsing Lower East Side, and you felt safe. That’s very like now. You know you aren’t safe, but you feel safe because everyone is like you. But you don’t have to take heroin, so it’s brilliant. You don’t get addicted, or maybe you do. Mostly you do.”</p><!--NYTDROP {"id":37, "pNum":39} --><p>Under Curtis’s riffing spell, gripes so familiar as to be almost embarrassing — artists paving the way to gentrification, <em>sure</em>; the internet seals us up in self-flattering silos, <em>right</em> — appear as thunderbolts lighting up a shadowy landscape. For an instant, Patti Smith and Richard Hell are as culpable in the Catastrophe of the Now as Alan Greenspan and Wernher von Braun. Jane Fonda, too. “Fonda is fascinating because she’s ‘radical,’ and then she does the next shift, which is to say, ‘If you can’t change the world, you change yourself, your body.’ And she kick-starts the VHS revolution with her exercise tapes. Then marries Ted Turner, who doesn’t want to analyze the news; he just wants to watch the news.”</p><!--NYTDROP {"id":38, "pNum":40} --><p>Curtis paused for breath. “<em>That’s </em>the foundation for this modern conservatism: ‘Oh, my God. It’s so terrifying. Whatever we do leads to disaster. So what we have to do is shift around and plan for danger, in order to keep stable’ — you <em>have</em> to have the right body mass index — and instead of analyzing the world in order to change it, you just monitor it for risk.”</p><!--NYTDROP {"id":39, "pNum":41} --><p><strong>Curtis’s critiques of </strong>the internet sometimes echo those of skeptics like Jaron Lanier, who sees it as a dead end for art, and Evgeny Morozov, who questions its ability to effect social change. “The internet was invented by engineers,” Curtis tells me. “When engineers build a bridge, they don’t want it to develop, they want it to stay stable. And the same is true of the fundamental engineering system of the internet. It’s based on feedback. And feedback is about stability. So, what happened with Occupy, and with Tahrir Square, is that it was a great system to get everyone together into a group, but then it had absolutely no content. It’s a really terrible mistake they made — they mistook an engineering system for a revolutionary set of ideas.”</p><!--NYTDROP {"id":40, "pNum":42} --><p>Elsewhere, Curtis sounds like a science-fiction writer — one from the 1950s, when S.F. writers began accurately satirizing the world we find ourselves in today. “The utopia they hold out is a world where machines make everything for you and you have endless leisure time, you become creative and everyone’s happy. And the only thing is, actually, everyone’s incredibly unhappy because they haven’t got anything to do. What we call our jobs today are actually fake jobs. We sit in our offices in front of our screens in order to get the money to go out and buy stuff. Our job is really to go shopping. And the rest of the time, we sit in our offices doing complicated managerial things, and when we’re not, we’re actually watching the internet. The internet is there to keep you happy during your fake job.” Curtis’s antic side, however, can’t turn away from the bloody wreckage. “I see people in shops now, going through Instagram, and then looking at things like ‘Is this right?’ It’s almost like they’re reading the Bible. It’s absolutely fascinating. Instagram is the aestheticization of <em>everything</em>. What began with Modernism, which is to actually worry about how things are done rather than about what they’re saying, has now ended with Instagram. I love it.</p><!--NYTDROP {"id":41, "pNum":43} --><p>“What will happen to the internet in the future?” He’s riffing again. “Will it become a bit like a John Carpenter movie? You go there, amidst the ruins, and it’s weird, and you can be nasty — just have fun and be bad, like a child. From about ’96 to about 2005 people built these lovely websites, they put up masses and masses of fantastic information. They’ve left them sitting there, but it’s like a city that everyone’s gone from. And what’s come in instead is a weird world where you don’t know what’s real — just people shouting at each other. It’s good fun, but it’s not real.”</p><!--NYTDROP {"id":42, "pNum":44} --><p>Though Curtis regards the internet with ambivalence — and who among us doesn’t? — his current method of disseminating his films, and his ideas, wouldn’t be possible without it, particularly in America. This contradiction he embraces. Speaking of “The Power of Nightmares,” he told me, “A lot of people said, ‘Oh, the television networks in America would never show it.’ What I’d noticed is that the moment I put it out, it went up on the internet. I understood at that point that it would have more political power and be seen by many more people if I let it be a thing that people want to find illegally.” (Virtually all of Curtis’s films are available to the intrepid Googler for free viewing, but if I told you where to find them, they might vanish.)</p><!--NYTDROP {"id":43, "pNum":45} --><p>Curtis seems to cherish his place in America as a voice seeping from under the floorboards. In a way, the ruined apocalyptic John Carpenter city appears to be where he wants to live. Even in Britain, Curtis made “Bitter Lake” not for television broadcast but as an experiment in releasing his work to the BBC iPlayer website instead. “HyperNormalisation” had an exclusive iPlayer release as well, on Oct. 16. It has freed him, in “Bitter Lake,” to play with moody, wordless sequences sustained longer than anything in his earlier pieces, and to include violence too disturbing for television broadcast. “It’s a good place to experiment. The woman who runs iPlayer — I was the first person to do an original thing for her — is giving me a great deal of freedom. It won’t last. They will bring the palace guards into the internet quite soon, and we’ll have to follow more rules, but for the moment it’s a very good place to be.”</p><!--NYTDROP {"id":44, "pNum":46} --><p><strong>Because Adam Curtis</strong> is a journalist, and because Donald Trump is the black hole toward which all journalistic light presently bends, a portion of Curtis’s new film concerns the Republican nominee. “HyperNormalisation” will be essential viewing for American audiences if for nothing more than a sublime six-minute film-within-a-film that depicts Trump in his role as a casino proprietor. Curtis tells the story of Trump’s entanglement with a probabilities analyst named Jess Marcum and a Japanese gambler named Akio Kashiwagi, who some believe may have been murdered by the Yakuza.</p><!--NYTDROP {"id":45, "pNum":47} --><p>Was it Kashiwagi’s mysterious death, which voided a several-millions debt to Trump, that spurred Trump out of the risk-laden world of actual construction, investment and management and into the realm of speculative virtuality — the practice, that is, of selling his name for others to slap onto buildings, even as he became a television and tabloid personality to make that name more valuable? In Curtis’s portrait, anyway, Trump is an avant-garde figure. From the film’s narration: “Trump had realized that the version of reality that politics presented was no longer believable. … And in the face of that, you could play with reality.”</p><!--NYTDROP {"id":46, "pNum":48} --><p>In the wake of Brexit, though, what did Curtis think of the rise of Trump? “For a lot of the people who support Trump — and the new right in Europe — it’s not really nationalism,” he suggested. “It’s a class thing.” He thought again for a moment; that wasn’t quite it. “You know when you’re told to adopt the brace position in an aircraft because you’ve got some turbulence? It’s as if everyone’s in the brace position at the moment, and they don’t dare look out of the window and see the world for what it is. All the people terrified of Trump are in the brace position — you know, as you gulp another whiskey, ‘Oh, my God — are we going to drop down 20,000 feet?’ If you’re in that position and someone starts walking around the aisle, you want them to stop. You’re in the brace position. They’re teasing you. They <em>know</em> you’re frightened. They decided to get up and walk around the plane, and <em>you don’t like it</em>.”</p><!--NYTDROP {"id":47, "pNum":49} --><p>But Trump’s supporters are, of course, also deeply enbubbled. Trump, according to Curtis, may himself be only another form of feedback system, similar to a chat-bot who replies to you by restating your questions in a flattering style. “He’s a hate-bot. You go, ‘I’m angry,’ and he goes, ‘I’m angry, too!’ And nothing changes. But the system likes it: Angry people click more.”</p><!--NYTDROP {"id":48, "pNum":50} --><p>I asked whether the prospect of Trump’s actually winning concerned him. At the time of my visit with Curtis, many national polls showed the candidates tied. “I’m trying to abstract myself from the frightened-bunny view of Donald Trump,” he told me. “It’s the end of something — that’s what I would think — and if it’s the end of something, then it’s about time we started inventing something new.”</p><!--NYTDROP {"id":49, "pNum":51} --><p>In his pauses I felt Curtis’s thinking as a tangible presence in the room. He wasn’t so much measuring his willingness to provoke or offend as negotiating with his own frightened-bunny view of the question. “I mean, I think he’s dangerous,” he concluded, “but I think there are lots of other dangerous things around in the world.”</p><!--NYTDROP {"id":50, "pNum":52} --><p><strong>If the end </strong>of this article were the end of an Adam Curtis film, it wouldn’t find its way to any very definite conclusion. Instead, the pileup of astounding facts and images and insinuations would leave you wanting both less and more, but with a very certain sense of having been taken out of yourself for a while — of having tested the edge of the bubble, if not actually escaped it. This is what I like best about his films and what I liked best about picking Curtis’s brain up close for three days: Further thinking will always be required.</p><!--NYTDROP {"id":51, "pNum":53} --><p>He seems to feel the same way. “Maybe I’m part of the conservatism that I’m being incredibly rude about,” he said. Uncovering this reservation seemed almost to delight him. “I should have the humility to recognize that the sort of films I make are locked in the past. If I was going to really attack myself — a lot of people also did in the 1990s what I did in film. Which they called sampling. Basically just going and replaying stuff and remaking it into new things, which is really good fun. But fundamentally, it’s doing what I’m accusing BlackRock’s computer of doing: constantly monitoring the past, reworking it into other patterns, as a hedge against the future. Am I giving you any vision of the future?” The question felt earnest, but if I’d said yes he’d have laughed at me.</p><!--NYTDROP {"id":52, "pNum":54} --><p>“In fact, actually the great thing about human beings is that they’re protean,” Curtis told me, near the end, before I let him get back to his editing. “They can be anything you want them to be. They’re amazing. But we’re stuck with the idea that there is a fixed self. We’re stuck with the idea that there is a body mass index that you must have. We’re stuck that this is the food you must have. We’re stuck with the system of finance. It’s just stuck. And maybe, I’m part of the stuckness.” Several times, Curtis and I circled back to the notion of the “hyperobject” — that which is too big in time and space to comprehend. Perhaps this is merely shorthand for the sensation of apprehending that we are creatures born into a world that seems to demand our understanding, but will never grant it. “You have to recognize that you’re part of the thing,” he said. “But the point about journalism is to try to portray the thing you are part of. I think that’s the best you can do.”</p><!--NYTDROP {"id":53, "pNum":55} --><p><em>Jonathan Lethem is the author of 10 novels, including “A Gambler’s Anatomy.” He lives in Los Angeles and Maine.</em></p>

Something like: “This is a film about a curious afternoon in the summer of 2016, when an American novelist pretending to be a journalist went to meet a British journalist who wanted nothing to do with being called an artist.”</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":1, \"pNum\":1} --><p>The British journalist’s name is Adam Curtis. Now 61, Curtis has written or directed more than a dozen hypnotically watchable, hilarious and ominous films, all of which explore nothing less than the cultural and political subconscious of the last half of the 20th-century and the first decades of the 21st. I’d been obsessed with Curtis’s work for years; to meet him felt like a privilege. I was in a mighty fine mood too, having finished both a novel and a semester of teaching just days before. I was informed, by the friends who offered me a room in their Camden Town flat, that the London weather was good. Not good, <em>great</em>. Never mind that the world was in tatters and Donald Trump was smirking unstoppably toward Republican coronation. When Curtis suggested I meet him in the famous lobby of the BBC, I borrowed my host’s London map and tackled the crazy-quilt streets. My two-mile walk was exultant. A person who for years had been only an odd, welcome intruder in my brain was about to take me to lunch.</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":2, \"pNum\":2} --><p>Outwardly, Curtis’s films are journalistic exposés in a documentary mode. They often extend to three or four or even five one-hour episodes; more recently they’ve consisted of single continuous presentations lasting more than two hours. Curtis is not an underground presence, not in England. He is a longtime employee of the BBC, a.k.a. (sentimentally) “the Beeb,” a pillar of 20th- and 21st-century British self-understanding. The films take familiar subjects — the Cold War, the growth of public relations or financial or military-industrial bureaucracies, the premises of the ecology or anti-psychiatry movements, the enmeshment of Western democracies in quasi-colonial military adventures in the Middle East — and render them strange. Stories that might seem like “social studies” fodder become, in Curtis’s hands, compulsive, like a giddy horror film you can’t quit watching.</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":3, \"pNum\":3} --><p>His method is one of serenely bizarre juxtaposition. He pursues the art of the wild leap, at the level of both “form” (the editing in his films, which consists of abrupt jumps between disparate sequences and images) and “content” (his factual assertions, the lines he traces among seemingly unrelated events and historical actors; the music, which veers between trance-inducing techno-beats or ambient indie pop of the Brian Eno persuasion and satirically iconic standards or show tunes; and his own narration, which drones on authoritatively except when suddenly giving way to aphoristic headlines that flash on-screen in the manner of a <a href=\"https://www.artsy.net/artist/barbara-kruger\">Barbara Kruger</a>-style gallery installation, or vanishes in favor of undigested imagery and song). It is as if your history teacher had decided to show you the brainwashing films that Malcolm McDowell was forced to watch in “A Clockwork Orange.” Like McDowell’s character, you at once resist and are seduced, and by the end your brain is both exhausted and enlarged, full of new things that don’t all seem to fit together. Unlike McDowell’s character, if you are me, you want more, and are willing to prop your own eyelids open to get it. Long before preparing to meet him, I’d been prone to spending too-long nights on Curtis binges on my laptop, resulting in Curtis hangovers the following day.</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":4, \"pNum\":4} --><p>Now, I won’t offer too much more of this rote, no-longer-very-New Journalism stuff — I swear never to mention anything either Curtis or I ate or drank — but it’s crucial that I offer a behind-the-curtain glimpse here, because it exemplifies a difficulty native to Curtis’s films. This difficulty could be called: Where Is This Voice Coming From? One of Curtis’s central subjects, running through all his work, is the possibility that we’re listening to the wrong voices in public life, and in our own heads; that the ideas we find authoritative and persuasive about our politics and culture are in fact a tenuous construction, one at the mercy of bias, invisible ideological sway and unprocessed, untethered emotions (principally, fear).</p><!--NYTREF {[\"region\":\"Embedded\", \"id\":\"100000004731100\", \"dropzone\":5, \"pNum\":5]} --><p>What this brings up, reasonably enough, is the problem of Adam Curtis’s authority: Who is <em>he</em> to be telling me this? Probably this was already in the back of my head during my happy walk through Regent’s Park. Had Curtis asked to meet in the lobby, rather than some modest cafe nearby, in order to underscore his platform at the BBC? Or to play against it? Or was there perhaps no modest cafe nearby?</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":6, \"pNum\":6} --><p>And, despite the humble cards I’ve played (weather, map, hangovers), let’s not ignore my present platform. “This is a film about a curious afternoon in the summer of 2016, when The New York Times came to make a polite visit to the BBC, in order to enclose one of England’s most unusual journalists within its own sphere of influence.” For some readers, these major-brand affiliations may be ennobling, and inspire confidence. For those more suspicious, the names of the mighty news organizations will be proof that deeper truth has, like Elvis, left the building.</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":7, \"pNum\":7} --><p>Curtis prefers you to be suspicious, alert to bullying ideologies that whisper in the guise of neutral authority (like “The Paper of Record”). And yet he wants you to believe <em>him</em>. Why shouldn’t he? And so a Curtis account of our meeting would reveal, through his dry, airy, insinuating narration, what you’re really seeing: not simply a jaunty middle-aged American stepping into a famous lobby to greet a boyish, alert, middle-aged Brit, but two media conglomerates in communion as well. The voice is essential. For, as Curtis would be the first to tell you, systems of power, influence and control are extremely difficult to depict on camera.</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":8, \"pNum\":8} --><p>I arrived, in fact, as Curtis was laboring at edits on his new film, “HyperNormalisation,” a nearly three-hour epic pegged to several present crises: Brexit, European immigration, suicide bombing, the war in Syria. The sequence under Curtis’s editorial hand today involved the financial firm BlackRock, which operates a powerful computerized risk-management network called Aladdin on the outskirts of an innocuous town in Washington State. Curtis’s belief is that Aladdin, in guiding the investment of now more than $14 trillion of assets around the world, has become an enormous unacknowledged force for stasis in an innately dynamic world.</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":9, \"pNum\":9} --><p>But how to show it? All he had to work with were a few archival talking-head clips, an Aladdin advertising reel, some footage he shot of the sheds housing Aladdin’s server farms and his own narration. Curtis was frustrated. “How do you illustrate something invisible?” he asked, as if he’d never solved this problem before, or at least not to his satisfaction. “It’s not even people doing keystrokes on computers. It’s just things roaring away. I’ll show you this 37-second shot, my driving past those sheds.”</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":10, \"pNum\":10} --><p>As we watched, Curtis told me about his admiration for the recent movie “The Big Short,” which tried to portray, for a popular audience, another facet of those invisible forces at work. “This is the whole thing about ‘good and evil’ — it’s a naïve view of the world. The problem is bigger, it’s a system.” Curtis and I briefly discussed a word coined by the critic Timothy Morton to describe a problem so vast in space and time that you are unable to apprehend it: a “hyperobject.” Global warming is a classic example of a hyperobject: it’s everywhere and nowhere, too encompassing to think about. Global markets, too. But naming a hyperobject alone is of limited use; human cognition knows all too well how to file such imminent imponderables away, on a “to-do” list that’s never consulted again.</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":11, \"pNum\":11} --><p>“I thought it was a brave stab at it,” Curtis said, continuing his analysis of “The Big Short.” “But my argument would be that even the financial system they’re pointing to is only a component of something even bigger, that we haven’t really put together. That bigger thing: It’s <em>my</em> hyperobject.”</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":12, \"pNum\":12} --><p><strong>“I want to</strong> be Adam Curtis when I grow up.” These words were tweeted last year by the gadfly American documentarian Errol Morris, director of “The Thin Blue Line” and “The Fog of War.” Morris’s tweet greeted the release of Curtis’s film “Bitter Lake,” a two-and-a-quarter-hour historical fugue on the American, Russian and British interventions in Afghanistan. “I’m embarrassed, because the amount of stuff I’ve learned from Adam Curtis is almost unending,” Morris told me. “There’s really no one like him here. I think of Seymour Hersh, who’s a different kind of animal altogether. There’s this raw intelligence — let’s call Curtis sui generis. Had I ever heard of Qutb before I watched ‘The Power of Nightmares’? Maybe you had — I hadn’t.”</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":13, \"pNum\":13} --><p>Morris was talking about <a href=\"http://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/a-lesson-in-hate-109822568/?no-ist\">Sayyid Qutb</a>, the Egyptian author, Muslim theologian and anti-Western propagandist, who is one of the twin poles — the other being the Chicago-based conservative academic Leo Strauss — around which Curtis wove his three-part 2004 series, “The Power of Nightmares.” Qutb, who was partly educated in the United States, became a leader of Egypt’s Muslim Brotherhood and was executed in 1966 for plotting to overthrow the government of President Gamal Abdel Nasser. His intellectual lineage runs directly through Ayman al-Zawahri to Osama bin Laden. And no, I hadn’t heard of him before Curtis’s film either.</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":14, \"pNum\":14} --><p>“The Power of Nightmares,” a study of the parallel growths of radical Islamist violence and the neoconservative movement that defined the U.S. response to 9/11, was the first Curtis film that Morris, or I, had seen. The film’s thesis: that the present disaster was in some sense called forth by two oddly compatible apocalyptic responses to the anxieties raised by the fulfillments and disappointments of Western-style liberalism. Uncomfortable in 2004, the film’s assertions still attract dispute even as the central thesis has trickled into the popular imagination such that many who have never seen Curtis’s film now accept it as a given.</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":15, \"pNum\":15} --><p>If Americans like Morris and myself have tended to learn of Curtis’s work beginning with “The Power of Nightmares,” his British viewers usually started earlier, with his landmark treatises on the biases of technological utopian social thinking (“Pandora’s Box,” 1992); on propaganda, historical amnesia, brainwashing and nostalgia (“The Living Dead,” 1995); on the growth of popular psychiatry and public relations, and the merging of the cult of personal fulfillment with consumerist imperatives (“The Century of the Self,” 2002). “The Century of the Self,” in particular, is seen by many in Britain as Curtis’s signature accomplishment. These early works construct a kind of “bible” of Curtis’s thinking, upon which his later arguments build.</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":16, \"pNum\":16} --><p>The British director Stephen Frears began with “The Mayfair Set” (1999), which depicts a group of entrepreneurs who, starting in the ’60s, dismantled the power of the British state and helped usher the free market back into politics, with disastrous results. “It’s absolutely brilliant,” Frears says. “I was just watching television, and I couldn’t believe what I was seeing. It was such a dazzling analysis. He’s a cult figure in England, but he has access. The BBC is the greatest broadcasting organization in the world. In ‘Bitter Lake,’ he had all the material. He’s standing in the right place, inside that archive.” Even among those skeptical of Curtis’s narratives, his masterly use of the BBC archive — his uncanny capacity to excavate sequences from the dark side of journalism’s moon and the expressive power he finds in their juxtaposition — produces awe. Curtis possesses a “dazzlingly acute eye,” wrote Andrew Anthony in The Observer, even as he accused him of “superimposing his own creative theory as journalistic fact.”</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":17, \"pNum\":17} --><p>Curtis is justly proud of his adeptness in the archives: “It’s all stored in a giant warehouse on the outskirts of West London, deliberately kept anonymous. It’s the biggest film archive in the world. The cataloging is good, although it’s been done at different stages. But, because the BBC is an organization that has a vast global news output, I discovered that, throughout the 1980s, there were these giant two-inch videotapes, called COMP tapes, onto which satellites would just dump stuff overnight. And they’re not well cataloged. You can go to a news item and see; if there was a COMP tape for that day, you can order it up. Those two-inch tapes start to degrade, but they’ve been transferred, and they’re amazing.”</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":18, \"pNum\":18} --><p>Pause.</p><p>“Or no. Sometimes they’re very boring. Sometimes they’re like an hour of a chair waiting for someone to come to it. I don’t do that Andy Warhol stuff of a chair for an hour. But then, someone will come to the chair and prepare, and you’ve got that moment. When one of those COMP tapes turns up for me because of something I’ve ordered, I just press fast forward and go through it all. Until something catches my eye, and then I will then digitize it. And I’ve got a very good memory. I have a pattern memory, an associative way of thinking.”</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":19, \"pNum\":20} --><p>Pause.</p><p>“If you really want to know, it’s like a computer game, the archive. There are different levels. Most people can only get to Level 1. I can get to Level 6.”</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":20, \"pNum\":22} --><p>Readers may recall a sequence from Michael Moore’s “Fahrenheit 9/11,” in which Deputy Secretary of Defense Paul Wolfowitz was inadvertently caught <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bnpTK5mgZQ\">licking his comb</a> as he readied to go on camera. The moment was imperishable, and cruel. As it happens, Curtis has made it a recurring emblem of his work to show familiar figures of power — Tony Blair, Ronald Reagan, Thatcher, Putin, many others — in interstitial moments of a similar kind, often precisely when they have taken a chair in preparation for the red light to go on, and are either unaware they are already being recorded or too bored to care.</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":21, \"pNum\":23} --><p>Curtis’s brief against world leaders — or at least the policies they’re chosen to embody, at the cost of great misery — is pretty savage. Neoliberals fare as poorly as neocons. He’s got no love for tyrants either. But he doesn’t opt, as Moore did with Wolfowitz, to expose his politicians as pathetic. The tiny portraits he carves from the archives are, instead, strangely tender. The human souls in question often appear introspective, as if measuring their self-possession, or discreetly consulting some inner oracle. Bill Clinton coughs. Hillary Clinton nods to herself, hesitates, smiles. Putin shrugs. Hafez al-Assad merely waits, thinking.</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":22, \"pNum\":24} --><p>Curtis’s films often have surprise bonus protagonists — guest stars, in television terms. In “HyperNormalisation,” it is Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi who steals the show, thanks to a stream of uncanny archival appearances of this kind, including one in which he pours himself a healthy glass of milk from a pitcher. Curtis, by testimony of his narration, regards the sinister, flamboyant Qaddafi as the West’s polymorphous dupe, less a monster than a man monstrously acted upon — a fictional character in a story the West told itself to skirt harder truths. “Violence born out of political struggles for power,” Curtis said, “became replaced by a much simpler image, of the head of a rogue state, who became more like an archcriminal who wanted to terrorize the world.”</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":23, \"pNum\":25} --><p>With each new bit of footage, a glance, a shy smile, Qaddafi’s human presence seeps unexpectedly into the viewer’s sympathies. Reagan’s does as well. Curtis’s politicians, ultimately, contend with their own bafflement in the face of the unseen forces shaping their world. They’re traveling with us, stuck inside the hyperobject.</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":24, \"pNum\":26} --><p><strong>Curtis grew up</strong> in Platt, North Kent, just outside Greater London. His father was a cinematographer who worked with the British documentarian Humphrey Jennings, with the “Death Wish” director Michael Winner and on “The Buccaneers,” a pirate-themed television program starring Robert Shaw. Curtis’s family was left-wing. “According to family talk,” he said, his great-uncle was a committed Trotskyite. His socialist grandfather, meanwhile, “would stand as a member of Parliament for seats he would never, ever win — and he did it every election.”</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":25, \"pNum\":27} --><p>Curtis earned a degree in the human sciences at Oxford, then briefly taught there. Unsatisfied with academia, he took a job at the BBC, eventually going to work in the early ’80s as a segment producer on “That’s Life!” a kind of cross between “60 Minutes” and “Candid Camera.” There, Curtis learned his craft. “One week I was sent up to Edinburgh to film a singing dog,” he said. “His owner said that when he played the bagpipes, the dog would sing Scottish songs. We set the camera up. The owner dressed up in a kilt and started to play the bagpipes. The dog refused to sing. It just sat there looking at me just saying nothing. It just sat there, with a really smug look on its face. This went on for about two hours.” Curtis phoned his producer. “She said: ‘Darling, that is wonderful. Don’t you see that the dog refusing to sing for a man dressed up in a kilt is actually very funny? Go back and keep filming. Film the dog doing nothing. But film the man as well.’ ”</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":26, \"pNum\":28} --><p>“So I did. We ran a long close-up shot of the dog’s face with the sound of out-of-tune bagpipes. It was quite avant-garde, but the audience loved it, especially when you cut it against the face of the man puffing at the bagpipes who genuinely believed that the dog was about to sing.</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":27, \"pNum\":29} --><p>“That time with a dog taught me the fundamental basics of journalism. That what really happens is the key thing; you mustn’t try and force the reality in front of you into a predictable story. What you should do is notice what is happening in front of your eyes, and what instinctively your reaction is. And my reaction was that I hated the dog as it looked at me silently. So I made a short film about that.”</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":28, \"pNum\":30} --><p>Despite his Oxford education, a hint of a provincial resentment defines Curtis’s attitudes toward London’s cultural intelligentsia. Americans might model this as the “John Lennon syndrome” (as opposed to the sense of ease and entitlement exhibited by, say, Mick Jagger). “The snooty people disagree with me,” he said. “The posh literary lot. They don’t like me because they think I’m not elegant and literary and I don’t make enough references. And what I do is I play fast and loose — not with the facts, they’re not interested in that — but with my aesthetic responses. I put pop music, David Bowie, in the middle of an Afghan film. It’s all a bit vulgar.”</p><!--NYTREF {[\"region\":\"Embedded\", \"id\":\"100000004723604\", \"dropzone\":29, \"pNum\":31]} --><p>Curtis foregrounds such tonal collisions, and he still delights in the comedy of dogs refusing to sing on cue, especially when the dogs in question are influential scientists, famous politicians or pontificating news presenters. He underlines the pratfalls and discontinuities of our neoliberal consensus not only with pop songs but also with an occasional <em>boing</em>! sound straight out of a cartoon soundtrack. Curtis isn’t frightened, and he doesn’t want to frighten you either. “I try to do the very opposite,” he said. He prefers using “all sorts of devices and jokes and parodies of fear to undercut the fear, to try and pull the poison. Because people are overwhelmed.”</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":30, \"pNum\":32} --><p>“Movies are an authoritarian medium,” wrote David Foster Wallace in 1996. “They vulnerabilize you and then dominate you.” Wallace’s cautionary tone typifies humanistic reservations about the power of the moving image, in the hands of a spellbinder like Curtis (or, in Wallace’s essay, David Lynch). “Film’s overwhelming power isn’t news,” Wallace continued. “But different kinds of movies use this power in different ways. Art film is essentially teleological: it tries in various ways to ‘wake the audience up’ or render us more ‘conscious.’ ”</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":31, \"pNum\":33} --><p>Curtis alludes to such aims only in the plainest terms. “I use music and all the cultural references that I would talk to my friends about, so it feels like a program made by someone you know,” he said. “Also, what I do deliberately, is I show the joins. There’s no reason you can’t join any two pieces of film up. So I will often in the editing deliberately make a discordant edit. It just makes you aware of what it is you are watching.”</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":32, \"pNum\":34} --><p><strong>Curtis has as</strong> at least as much in common with installation artists like Kruger or Christian Marclay as he does with shoe-leather reporters like Hersh — indeed, his most anomalous project, “Everything Is Going According to Plan” (2013), consisted of a site-specific film-concert hybrid at the Park Avenue Armory in Manhattan, in collaboration with the band Massive Attack. But Curtis defiantly resists being called an “artist.” “If you’re an artist, you tend to have that rather smug sense of, I’m doing this great work,” he said. “I don’t have that at all. I go out and I find stories, and I find ways of doing them in an imaginative way. I’m a journalist, and I’m responding to my time. That’s it.” Forget Curtis’s collaborations with rock musicians; never mind the cover “it’s art” might offer him from critics complaining that he lacks footnotes and dabbles too much in allusion and mood; and never mind how every plumber is supposed to want to be a poet. Curtis wants no part of it.</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":33, \"pNum\":35} --><p>His grudge against contemporary art can seem either a provocation or an eccentricity, until he places it in relation to a few of his key terms, like “consumer capitalism” and “the self.” “The problem is that the central ideology of our age is the idea of self-expression,” he said. “That the self, being expressive, is the good thing. It’s what I trace in ‘The Century of the Self.’ Expressing yourself through consumerism is central. So, the dilemma for artists is that however radical in content their paintings, their performance art, their video works, the mode in which they’re doing it — self-expression — feeds the strength of the very thing they’re trying to overthrow, which is modern consumer capitalism.”</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":34, \"pNum\":36} --><p>Curtis prefers Balzac, the novelist of intricate social tapestries, to the modernist tradition of interiority defined by Woolf and Proust. But the novelist he claims as inspiration is Dos Passos, whose “U.S.A.” trilogy he read when he was a boy, and whose centrifugal blend of pastiche and documentation may be the key to Curtis’s style. At the other end, Curtis’s artistic nemesis is Andy Warhol. “I’ve got this idea. I call it the I.A.R., the Inappropriate Aesthetic Response. I date it back to Warhol. It’s this idea you can take horrific images like the electric chair and aestheticize them. The beheading videos, the orange jumpsuits against the desert background; ISIS uses that knowingly. I have a ruthless theory, that the radical-art movement, which grew out of the failure of revolutionary politics, becomes the outriders for the property developers. You need the aesthetic of decline in order to make those buildings desirable.”</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":35, \"pNum\":37} --><p>“HyperNormalisation” is a summation of one of Curtis’s major themes: that liberalism — since the collapse of certainty about how its values would transform politics, finance and journalism — has in fact become genuinely conservative. In a world of unpredictability, it has retreated from genuine frontiers, instead opting for holding actions that can make it feel stable and safe.</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":36, \"pNum\":38} --><p>So we live, thanks to our advanced systems of monitoring, compensation and control, in a bubble of our own devising. And in Curtis’s critique, contemporary artists and hipsters do as much to create this bubble as the internet itself. “On a social-media network, it’s very much like being in a heroin bubble. As a radical artist in the 1970s, you used to go and take heroin and wander through the chaos and the collapsing Lower East Side, and you felt safe. That’s very like now. You know you aren’t safe, but you feel safe because everyone is like you. But you don’t have to take heroin, so it’s brilliant. You don’t get addicted, or maybe you do. Mostly you do.”</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":37, \"pNum\":39} --><p>Under Curtis’s riffing spell, gripes so familiar as to be almost embarrassing — artists paving the way to gentrification, <em>sure</em>; the internet seals us up in self-flattering silos, <em>right</em> — appear as thunderbolts lighting up a shadowy landscape. For an instant, Patti Smith and Richard Hell are as culpable in the Catastrophe of the Now as Alan Greenspan and Wernher von Braun. Jane Fonda, too. “Fonda is fascinating because she’s ‘radical,’ and then she does the next shift, which is to say, ‘If you can’t change the world, you change yourself, your body.’ And she kick-starts the VHS revolution with her exercise tapes. Then marries Ted Turner, who doesn’t want to analyze the news; he just wants to watch the news.”</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":38, \"pNum\":40} --><p>Curtis paused for breath. “<em>That’s </em>the foundation for this modern conservatism: ‘Oh, my God. It’s so terrifying. Whatever we do leads to disaster. So what we have to do is shift around and plan for danger, in order to keep stable’ — you <em>have</em> to have the right body mass index — and instead of analyzing the world in order to change it, you just monitor it for risk.”</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":39, \"pNum\":41} --><p><strong>Curtis’s critiques of </strong>the internet sometimes echo those of skeptics like Jaron Lanier, who sees it as a dead end for art, and Evgeny Morozov, who questions its ability to effect social change. “The internet was invented by engineers,” Curtis tells me. “When engineers build a bridge, they don’t want it to develop, they want it to stay stable. And the same is true of the fundamental engineering system of the internet. It’s based on feedback. And feedback is about stability. So, what happened with Occupy, and with Tahrir Square, is that it was a great system to get everyone together into a group, but then it had absolutely no content. It’s a really terrible mistake they made — they mistook an engineering system for a revolutionary set of ideas.”</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":40, \"pNum\":42} --><p>Elsewhere, Curtis sounds like a science-fiction writer — one from the 1950s, when S.F. writers began accurately satirizing the world we find ourselves in today. “The utopia they hold out is a world where machines make everything for you and you have endless leisure time, you become creative and everyone’s happy. And the only thing is, actually, everyone’s incredibly unhappy because they haven’t got anything to do. What we call our jobs today are actually fake jobs. We sit in our offices in front of our screens in order to get the money to go out and buy stuff. Our job is really to go shopping. And the rest of the time, we sit in our offices doing complicated managerial things, and when we’re not, we’re actually watching the internet. The internet is there to keep you happy during your fake job.” Curtis’s antic side, however, can’t turn away from the bloody wreckage. “I see people in shops now, going through Instagram, and then looking at things like ‘Is this right?’ It’s almost like they’re reading the Bible. It’s absolutely fascinating. Instagram is the aestheticization of <em>everything</em>. What began with Modernism, which is to actually worry about how things are done rather than about what they’re saying, has now ended with Instagram. I love it.</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":41, \"pNum\":43} --><p>“What will happen to the internet in the future?” He’s riffing again. “Will it become a bit like a John Carpenter movie? You go there, amidst the ruins, and it’s weird, and you can be nasty — just have fun and be bad, like a child. From about ’96 to about 2005 people built these lovely websites, they put up masses and masses of fantastic information. They’ve left them sitting there, but it’s like a city that everyone’s gone from. And what’s come in instead is a weird world where you don’t know what’s real — just people shouting at each other. It’s good fun, but it’s not real.”</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":42, \"pNum\":44} --><p>Though Curtis regards the internet with ambivalence — and who among us doesn’t? — his current method of disseminating his films, and his ideas, wouldn’t be possible without it, particularly in America. This contradiction he embraces. Speaking of “The Power of Nightmares,” he told me, “A lot of people said, ‘Oh, the television networks in America would never show it.’ What I’d noticed is that the moment I put it out, it went up on the internet. I understood at that point that it would have more political power and be seen by many more people if I let it be a thing that people want to find illegally.” (Virtually all of Curtis’s films are available to the intrepid Googler for free viewing, but if I told you where to find them, they might vanish.)</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":43, \"pNum\":45} --><p>Curtis seems to cherish his place in America as a voice seeping from under the floorboards. In a way, the ruined apocalyptic John Carpenter city appears to be where he wants to live. Even in Britain, Curtis made “Bitter Lake” not for television broadcast but as an experiment in releasing his work to the BBC iPlayer website instead. “HyperNormalisation” had an exclusive iPlayer release as well, on Oct. 16. It has freed him, in “Bitter Lake,” to play with moody, wordless sequences sustained longer than anything in his earlier pieces, and to include violence too disturbing for television broadcast. “It’s a good place to experiment. The woman who runs iPlayer — I was the first person to do an original thing for her — is giving me a great deal of freedom. It won’t last. They will bring the palace guards into the internet quite soon, and we’ll have to follow more rules, but for the moment it’s a very good place to be.”</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":44, \"pNum\":46} --><p><strong>Because Adam Curtis</strong> is a journalist, and because Donald Trump is the black hole toward which all journalistic light presently bends, a portion of Curtis’s new film concerns the Republican nominee. “HyperNormalisation” will be essential viewing for American audiences if for nothing more than a sublime six-minute film-within-a-film that depicts Trump in his role as a casino proprietor. Curtis tells the story of Trump’s entanglement with a probabilities analyst named Jess Marcum and a Japanese gambler named Akio Kashiwagi, who some believe may have been murdered by the Yakuza.</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":45, \"pNum\":47} --><p>Was it Kashiwagi’s mysterious death, which voided a several-millions debt to Trump, that spurred Trump out of the risk-laden world of actual construction, investment and management and into the realm of speculative virtuality — the practice, that is, of selling his name for others to slap onto buildings, even as he became a television and tabloid personality to make that name more valuable? In Curtis’s portrait, anyway, Trump is an avant-garde figure. From the film’s narration: “Trump had realized that the version of reality that politics presented was no longer believable. … And in the face of that, you could play with reality.”</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":46, \"pNum\":48} --><p>In the wake of Brexit, though, what did Curtis think of the rise of Trump? “For a lot of the people who support Trump — and the new right in Europe — it’s not really nationalism,” he suggested. “It’s a class thing.” He thought again for a moment; that wasn’t quite it. “You know when you’re told to adopt the brace position in an aircraft because you’ve got some turbulence? It’s as if everyone’s in the brace position at the moment, and they don’t dare look out of the window and see the world for what it is. All the people terrified of Trump are in the brace position — you know, as you gulp another whiskey, ‘Oh, my God — are we going to drop down 20,000 feet?’ If you’re in that position and someone starts walking around the aisle, you want them to stop. You’re in the brace position. They’re teasing you. They <em>know</em> you’re frightened. They decided to get up and walk around the plane, and <em>you don’t like it</em>.”</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":47, \"pNum\":49} --><p>But Trump’s supporters are, of course, also deeply enbubbled. Trump, according to Curtis, may himself be only another form of feedback system, similar to a chat-bot who replies to you by restating your questions in a flattering style. “He’s a hate-bot. You go, ‘I’m angry,’ and he goes, ‘I’m angry, too!’ And nothing changes. But the system likes it: Angry people click more.”</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":48, \"pNum\":50} --><p>I asked whether the prospect of Trump’s actually winning concerned him. At the time of my visit with Curtis, many national polls showed the candidates tied. “I’m trying to abstract myself from the frightened-bunny view of Donald Trump,” he told me. “It’s the end of something — that’s what I would think — and if it’s the end of something, then it’s about time we started inventing something new.”</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":49, \"pNum\":51} --><p>In his pauses I felt Curtis’s thinking as a tangible presence in the room. He wasn’t so much measuring his willingness to provoke or offend as negotiating with his own frightened-bunny view of the question. “I mean, I think he’s dangerous,” he concluded, “but I think there are lots of other dangerous things around in the world.”</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":50, \"pNum\":52} --><p><strong>If the end </strong>of this article were the end of an Adam Curtis film, it wouldn’t find its way to any very definite conclusion. Instead, the pileup of astounding facts and images and insinuations would leave you wanting both less and more, but with a very certain sense of having been taken out of yourself for a while — of having tested the edge of the bubble, if not actually escaped it. This is what I like best about his films and what I liked best about picking Curtis’s brain up close for three days: Further thinking will always be required.</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":51, \"pNum\":53} --><p>He seems to feel the same way. “Maybe I’m part of the conservatism that I’m being incredibly rude about,” he said. Uncovering this reservation seemed almost to delight him. “I should have the humility to recognize that the sort of films I make are locked in the past. If I was going to really attack myself — a lot of people also did in the 1990s what I did in film. Which they called sampling. Basically just going and replaying stuff and remaking it into new things, which is really good fun. But fundamentally, it’s doing what I’m accusing BlackRock’s computer of doing: constantly monitoring the past, reworking it into other patterns, as a hedge against the future. Am I giving you any vision of the future?” The question felt earnest, but if I’d said yes he’d have laughed at me.</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":52, \"pNum\":54} --><p>“In fact, actually the great thing about human beings is that they’re protean,” Curtis told me, near the end, before I let him get back to his editing. “They can be anything you want them to be. They’re amazing. But we’re stuck with the idea that there is a fixed self. We’re stuck with the idea that there is a body mass index that you must have. We’re stuck that this is the food you must have. We’re stuck with the system of finance. It’s just stuck. And maybe, I’m part of the stuckness.” Several times, Curtis and I circled back to the notion of the “hyperobject” — that which is too big in time and space to comprehend. Perhaps this is merely shorthand for the sensation of apprehending that we are creatures born into a world that seems to demand our understanding, but will never grant it. “You have to recognize that you’re part of the thing,” he said. “But the point about journalism is to try to portray the thing you are part of. I think that’s the best you can do.”</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":53, \"pNum\":55} --><p><em>Jonathan Lethem is the author of 10 novels, including “A Gambler’s Anatomy.” He lives in Los Angeles and Maine.</em></p>","scoop_slug":"adam-curtis-documentaries","promotional_media":100000004723605,"module_top":100000004723605,"modules_body":{"100000004731100":"LARGE","100000004723604":"JUMBO"},"ad_frequency":"","ad_sizes":"","ad_adjacencies":"","ad_positions":""},"100000004723618":{"data_id":100000004723618,"print_headline":"Lost and Found","headline":"A Pilgrimage to the Desert Shrine of Noah Purifoy","summary":"Two contemporary artists pay homage to a visionary predecessor at Joshua Tree.","byline":"As told to JAIME LOWE","byline_prefix":"As told to","authors":["Jaime Lowe"],"kicker":"The Culture Issue","body":"<p><span class=\"dropcap\">A</span> few years ago, I saw something by the assemblage artist Noah Purifoy that startled me. One of the “Watts Uprising” pieces at P.S. 1 in Queens, made of debris found after the Watts riots, was so similar to the way my friend, the installation artist Abigail DeVille, works. She and Purifoy both collect discarded materials. In Abigail’s case, it’s to show how people are positioned in society; for Purifoy it was social commentary. They both have this sense of responsibility and duty embedded in their work. Objects that had no meaning, this junk, all of a sudden said something about the American experience. Abigail’s installation “Dark Day,” at the New Museum, was made out of furniture collected from Dumpsters outside her grandmother’s projects in the Bronx: The furniture was suspended upside down from the ceiling. When I saw Purifoy, I immediately saw Abigail.</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":1, \"pNum\":1} --><p>Purifoy was born in 1917 in Alabama. He fought in World War II, came back and soon fled to Los Angeles. It struck me deeply, his sense of displacement. After the Watts riots of the mid-1960s, he collected burned materials that ended up in his art. Purifoy had a creative solution to dealing with injustice. Instead of evaporating or being silent, he took these things — pieces of wreckage — and turned them into works of art, a meditation on one’s life, one’s work, one’s history. This is the most powerful act.</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":2, \"pNum\":2} --><p>Abigail and I wanted to make a pilgrimage and pay homage to someone who is clearly an ancestor and a predecessor for each of us. We wanted to witness our history in Purifoy’s work in the Joshua Tree Outdoor Museum. I couldn’t believe how incredibly hot it was in the Mojave — I was hoping I wouldn’t faint. It felt as if I were going through this spiritual cleansing and detox. This has been a rough few years in thinking about racial equality.</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":3, \"pNum\":3} --><p>Even though he died in 2004, Purifoy is still teaching us in these 10 acres of a hundred or so sculptures in Joshua Tree. He moved there when he was priced out of Los Angeles, in a way that is so similar to gentrification today. The art world didn’t really allow him to exist, though he was offered a space in the Mojave to live and to create. It really hit me when I saw “<a href=\"http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/a/aurora_borealis/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier\" title=\"More articles about the aurora borealis.\" class=\"meta-classifier\">Aurora Borealis</a>,” a large-scale sculpture of wood, chairs and other found objects. I could understand Purifoy as a person and how he moved through life. I remember quietly looking at Abigail look at that piece, and she saw a part of her reflecting back. It was a moment that almost brought me to tears, to realize we did have an ally and a predecessor. <em>AS TOLD TO JAIME LOWE</em></p><!--NYTREF {[\"region\":\"Embedded\", \"id\":\"100000004723617\"]} --><!--NYTREF {[\"region\":\"Embedded\", \"id\":\"100000004723616\"]} --><!--NYTREF {[\"region\":\"Embedded\", \"id\":\"100000004723615\"]} --><!--NYTREF {[\"region\":\"Embedded\", \"id\":\"100000004725667\"]} --><!--NYTREF {[\"region\":\"Embedded\", \"id\":\"100000004723614\"]} --><!--NYTREF {[\"region\":\"Embedded\", \"id\":\"100000004725666\"]} --><!--NYTREF {[\"region\":\"Embedded\", \"id\":\"100000004725665\"]} --><!--NYTREF {[\"region\":\"Embedded\", \"id\":\"100000004725664\"]} --><!--NYTREF {[\"region\":\"Embedded\", \"id\":\"100000004725663\"]} --><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":4, \"pNum\":4} --><p><em>LaToya Ruby Frazier is a photographer who creates work about industrialism, Rust Belt revitalization and environmental justice.</em></p>","scoop_slug":"latoya-ruby-frazier-photographs-noah-purifoy","promotional_media":100000004726613,"module_top":100000004726613,"modules_body":{"100000004723617":"JUMBO","100000004723616":"JUMBO","100000004723615":"JUMBO","100000004725667":"JUMBO","100000004723614":"JUMBO","100000004725666":"JUMBO","100000004725665":"JUMBO","100000004725664":"JUMBO","100000004725663":"JUMBO"},"ad_frequency":"","ad_sizes":"","ad_adjacencies":"[\"media-100000004723615\",\"media-100000004723614\",\"media-100000004725664\"]","ad_positions":""},"100000004723845":{"data_id":100000004723845,"print_headline":"Imagine That","headline":"The Profound Empathy of Yoko Tawada","summary":"Through the stories of polar bears, dogs and other animals, the novelist makes us see “the other” — including ourselves.","byline":"By RIVKA GALCHEN","byline_prefix":"By","authors":["Rivka Galchen"],"kicker":"The Culture Issue","body":"<p><span class=\"dropcap\">I</span>t was a gray and drizzly afternoon when Yoko Tawada and I crossed under a green-and-gold <em>paifang</em> to meet with mammals much larger than ourselves. Tawada had brought me to the Berlin Zoo because she had visited its famous polar bear, Knut, regularly while working on her 2014 novel, “Memoirs of a Polar Bear,” which will be published in English in November. The tale of the real-life Knut is at once moving and outlandish: His mother, Tosca, a retired performer from the German Democratic Republic circus, rejected Knut at birth, so he was raised instead by a male zookeeper “mother.” When an animal rights activist commented in a German newspaper that the zoo’s ethical responsibility was to let Knut die, children protested and the world fell in love with the poor animal. He became a celebrity, photographed by Annie Leibovitz for a cover of Vanity Fair, and lines to visit Knut formed daily for his scheduled appearances. “But by the time I knew him,” Tawada said, “it was later in his life, when people complained that he was less cute.”</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":1, \"pNum\":1} --><p>“Memoirs” is actually three memoirs: the first narrated by Knut’s circus-performing Russian grandmother, the second by Knut’s mother and the final by Knut. Tawada wrote “Memoirs” in Japanese, then translated it into German on her own. The novel’s matriarch polar bear also begins her book in a language other then German. When the bear tells her publisher that she wants to begin writing in German herself, rather than having it translated from Russian, she is told that part of the appeal of her work is that it’s written in “her mother tongue.” She doesn’t like that. “I’ve never spoken with my mother,” she protests. Her publisher counters that a mother is a mother, even if you never speak with her. “I don’t think my mother spoke Russian,” the polar bear says. The publisher is unpersuaded; she is discouraged. When, in another scene, a stranger presses the polar bear similarly about her language and origins, the stranger finally concludes: “Oh, I see, you’re a member of an ethnic minority, is that it? ... Minorities are fabulous!”</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":2, \"pNum\":2} --><p>There were no polar bears out when we arrived at their enclosure. Instead there was just a sign noting that one of them didn’t like noise. “They used to say it was unfair that Knut had to live with three old ladies,” Tawada said. “They said the ladies bullied him.” The last time Tawada saw Knut was two days before he died unexpectedly, of an undiagnosed encephalitis. “One thing that interested me was that Knut’s mother had been a performer, but Knut didn’t have to perform — and yet he still performed. He really played to the crowds.”</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":3, \"pNum\":3} --><p>I asked her if maybe that was the origin of her idea to write something from Knut’s perspective. She said: “I had memories of myself as a child, of how much I loved to use words to make not only my parents but also other adults smile. I don’t think of that as performing though. But it’s also the case that I wondered, as a child, and still: Was it also different for the animals, under communism and under capitalism?” She laughed. “I really did!”</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":4, \"pNum\":4} --><p>As we walked the grounds, Tawada said, “You see most of these animals were born here in the zoo, even though their labels still describe other countries.” We came upon a large dark bird with a yellow face labeled “<em>Schmutzgeier</em>,” or “Dirty Vulture.” “Poor guy!” Tawada said with a giggle. “They didn’t give him a very nice name.” We wandered past a sun bear, who in the book teases Knut for referring to himself in the third person, although this day the sun bear was sleeping. Farther along, we passed Rüppell’s glossy starlings and Luzon bleeding-hearts. In the hazy light, the birds seemed touchingly overdressed. Nearby was the enclosure of the magnificent polar wolves, two dead birds visible within. In “Memoirs,” one of the wolves harasses Knut for not having a proper family. “I do not like these wolves,” Tawada said. “I do not like them at all.” Somehow these relatively mild words sounded like swearing.</p><!--NYTREF {[\"region\":\"Embedded\", \"id\":\"100000004731199\", \"dropzone\":5, \"pNum\":5]} --><p>“How can you not like wolves?” I asked.</p><p>“They’re beautiful, I know. But they’re fascists. Only the best woman is allowed to make children — no one else.”</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":6, \"pNum\":7} --><p>Tawada and I looked together at the informational sign, which described the loyalty and family values of the wolves. In the novel, Knut notes: “The wolf was proud of the fact that the members of his family looked as alike as photocopies. But I revere Matthias [his human mother] for having suckled and cared for a creature like me who was not at all similar to him.”</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":7, \"pNum\":8} --><p>It struck me that you can be offended by an animal only if you take it seriously, as you would a human. Tawada has written most often about foreigners and outsiders, but also about people who metamorphose into animals (“The Bath”) or have intimate relations with people suspected to be animals (“The Bridegroom Was a Dog”). An elementary-school teacher who tells her students to wipe with used Kleenex feels, in Tawada’s portrayal of her, as familiar and alien as a household pet. In “Memoirs,” when a polar bear walks into a bookstore or a grocery store, there are no troubles stemming from a lack of opposable thumbs. As with Kafka’s animal characters, we are freed to dislike them in the special way we usually reserve only for ourselves.</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":8, \"pNum\":9} --><p><strong>“All immigrants are artists,” </strong>Edwidge Danticat has said. Under pressure to make themselves legible, immigrants have no choice but to invent new ways of speaking. And in their reading of the world around them, immigrants uncover the alien that always abides in what seems, for the natives, most familiar. But some people are foreign regardless of geography; they are naturally nonnative, immigrant or not. Tawada is one of these. “Sometimes I think maybe I’m a little bit Jewish,” she joked, after telling me that the writers that mean the most to her are Walter Benjamin for his essays, Kafka for his fiction and Paul Celan for his poetry. This kindred feeling makes sense. Benjamin, Kafka and Celan all worked, like Tawada, in a German language that was in some ways hostile to them — and this hostility is an essential aspect of their thought.</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":9, \"pNum\":10} --><p>The varied characters in Tawada’s work — from different countries, of different sexes and species — are united by the quality that Benjamin describes as “crepuscular”: “None has a firm place in the world, or firm, inalienable outlines. There is not one that is not either rising or falling, none that is not trading its qualities with its enemy or neighbor; none that has not completed its period of time and yet is unripe.”</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":10, \"pNum\":11} --><p>One of Tawada’s earliest pieces, “The Talisman,” published in the early 1990s, begins:</p><p>In this city there are a great many women who wear bits of metal on their ears. They have holes put in their earlobes especially for this purpose. Almost as soon as I got here, I wanted to ask what these bits of metal on people’s ears meant. But I didn’t know if I could speak of this openly. My guidebook, for instance, says that in Europe you should never ask people you don’t yet know very well anything related to their bodies or religion.</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":11, \"pNum\":12} --><p>Another of her short pieces, “Canned Foreign,” also among her earliest stories, opens with: “In any city one finds a surprisingly large number of people who cannot read. Some of them are still too young, others simply refuse to learn the letters of the alphabet.”</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":12, \"pNum\":13} --><p>Each opening is an accurate description that is nevertheless unsettling. In “Memoirs,” Tawada plays with this same effect through the simple drama of having her polar-bear narrator attending a conference — “how uninteresting the conference had been yet again” — and finding herself tripped into thoughts of her childhood by the topic of the day’s discussion: The Significance of Bicycles in the National Economy. (Tawada is very often very funny.) Here as elsewhere, Tawada is reminiscent of Nikolai Gogol, for whom the natural situation for a ghost story was a minor government employee saving up to buy a fancy coat, the natural destiny of a nose to haunt its owner as an overbearing nobleman.</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":13, \"pNum\":14} --><p>Tawada’s biography most likely amplifies her estrangements. Born in Tokyo in 1960, she moved to Hamburg in 1982 and has lived in Germany ever since. Her father worked as a translator of nonfiction books and eventually opened a bookstore specializing in academic books from abroad. Even today, she writes drafts sometimes in German, sometimes in Japanese and sometimes in alternating languages within the same novel. She reads in at least five languages. She has a different relationship than most of the rest of us do to words, to nations and even to taxonomy. One of her translators, Susan Bernofsky, remembers that Tawada asked her American press, New Directions, to work from the German version of “Memoirs,” not the Japanese one, “because she said she’d already translated it into a Western language.”</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":14, \"pNum\":15} --><p>Tawada has been awarded the most prestigious literary prizes in Germany and Japan, including the Goethe Medal and the Kleist and Akutagawa Prizes. In those countries, she’s heralded. In the United States, she has been a visiting writer at prestigious universities, as well as the subject of several dissertations, but she is notably less well known, even though New Directions has been steadily publishing her fiction since 2007. “Memoirs” is in certain ways distinct from Tawada’s work to date in English: It is longer, and much more eventful. Circus managers are vetted by the secret police; Soviet polar bears go on strike over working conditions in a circus; a mother polar bear gives up her child to be raised by another animal; the <a href=\"http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/b/berlin_wall/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier\" title=\"More articles about Berlin Wall.\" class=\"meta-classifier\">Berlin Wall</a> falls. But as in all of Tawada’s work, language is itself a character. When the matriarch polar bear finds herself aboard a train to leave East Germany, she thinks: “A fly bumped against my forehead, or wait, not a fly, a sentence: ‘I am going into exile.’ ” So even as “Memoirs” reads like a goofy comedy, it also reads as a profound meditation on alterity, labor conditions, language and love. Which is to say: It reads like classic Tawada.</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":15, \"pNum\":16} --><p>You could argue that it’s always a historical moment of hating (and not seeing) the “other,” but the sentiment seems now at a particularly precarious crescendo. “Memoirs” offers its own version of “seeing the other.” It does this not so much by compelling us to see the humanity in polar bears; polar bears are easy to love. But Knut’s mother, Tosca, devotes most of her memoir to imagining the inner life of her animal trainer, Barbara. The empathic ask there is to look with love and understanding at humans — even as they are implicated in the structures of brutality and dominance, moved most by their own small-minded fears and dreams and, of course, are hastening the melting of the poles. Even we deserve understanding and love.</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":16, \"pNum\":17} --><p><strong>Tawada and I walked </strong>to Berlin’s Museum für Naturkunde, a predecessor of the American Museum of Natural History in New York City. After the unexpected death of Knut in 2011, a sculpture of him was made, and it is now housed at the Berlin museum. When “Memoirs” came out in Germany, Tawada gave a reading in front of the glass-cased Knut. (“It was a little spooky,” she told me.) We were the only adults unaccompanied by children. We made our way past dinosaur bones, past gemstones. We stopped at an oversize Araneus diadematus specimen from 1951. Nearby, a catalog was open to the section for ordering glass mammal eyes. “I love these,” she said, calling my attention to the pages.</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":17, \"pNum\":18} --><p>Then, abruptly, there was the famous Knut. He stood in the glass case next to a gorilla named Bobby. Bobby was also famous in his day; he died in the Berlin Zoo of appendicitis in 1935. Bobby and Knut, side by side, seemed like a stage duo playing for contrast. “Somehow it’s easier to imagine what Knut is thinking than to imagine what Bobby is thinking,” Tawada said. “Bobby looks too much like us.”</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":18, \"pNum\":19} --><p>“I didn’t know Knut would look so skinny.”</p><p>“He was just an adolescent,” Tawada said. “I know, it’s very sad to see him. But it’s just a sculpture of his body, modeled by hand, and then with his real fur on it. It was important to people that Knut not be taxidermied. It’s a modern version of a stuffed animal.”</p><!--NYTREF {[\"region\":\"Embedded\", \"id\":\"100000004723844\", \"dropzone\":19, \"pNum\":21]} --><p>The first time I met Tawada was at a very crowded reading she gave at the Deutsches Haus of New York University. She read from fragments of prose-poetry written on a white glove she wore on her hand; she then took off the glove, turned it inside out and read what was written on the other side of the fingers. Barbara Epler, the publisher of New Directions, told me a story about seeing Tawada perform at the Goethe-Institut in New York with the avant-garde jazz pianist Aki Takase; Tawada’s role involved grating stale bread and throwing Ping-Pong balls onto the piano strings.</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":20, \"pNum\":22} --><p>But the Tawada I spent the day with in Berlin was quite shy, and too gently considerate to be at all strange. Her performance self seems constructed to prevent her from having to pretend to be at ease — a way of exaggerating the unnaturalness of a performance, so as to avoid the lie of “naturalness.”</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":21, \"pNum\":23} --><p>Tawada never particularly intended to move to Germany. “I was in university,” she said. “I loved the work of Dostoyevsky, of Bulgakov, also of Bruno Schulz, and so I wanted to go and study in the Soviet Union, or maybe Poland. But it was 1982 and not an easy time to go there.” With her father’s help, she found an internship in Hamburg with a business that was an intermediary between publishers and booksellers. Tawada already had some familiarity with German because she had studied it, along with English, in school. “Because of the 1968 student movement, there had been pressure on schools to offer more than just English,” she said. “The idea was, for example, if you wanted to learn about nuclear power and you were only reading in English, you were going to learn something very different than if you were reading in German.”</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":22, \"pNum\":24} --><p>In Hamburg at the time, it was common for students to attend classes at the university without officially enrolling. “Living in Germany in the ’80s and ’90s was so, so cheap,” she said. “Some of us studied 10 or 20 years! Just working part-time jobs as typists or assistants.” She enrolled officially in the mid-1980s and met her German publisher, Konkursbuch, a small, brainy press that is otherwise known for publishing thrillers and high-end lesbian erotica. Konkursbuch published her first work, in a bilingual edition, in 1987, and she has stayed with that press ever since. Her first publication in Japan wasn’t until four years later.</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":23, \"pNum\":25} --><p>Finally moving past the sad sculpture of Knut, Tawada and I made it over to a hippopotamus whose mouth was wide open; at the hippo’s side was a much smaller hippopotamus. Tawada said there was a famous German hippo, but she couldn’t remember if it was one of these: “The children know her from a book. She was saved from the zoo during the war.” Only 91 of at least 3,700 Berlin Zoo animals were rescued. “It’s very upsetting for children to learn that the wild animals, freed from the zoo, were shot,” she said. “We have a book in Japan about the Tokyo Zoo during the war. Maybe in a story about humans, it will always seem like the humans are at least somewhat guilty. But for the animals, the children can feel pure sadness.”</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":24, \"pNum\":26} --><p><strong>Like all animals, </strong>we eventually grew hungry. Tawada suggested that we eat at the cafe associated with the LiteraturHaus, in Wintergarten. As we headed there, we passed statues of two white bears. Then a blue bear. Then a multicolored bear. “They are the symbol of the city,” she said. “It’s funny, because they became popular again as a symbol at a time when there were no more bears in Germany. Just like the teddy bears became popular as real bear populations were falling,” she said, her voice trailing off. “But some wild animals have come back to Germany! After the Berlin Wall fell, some wolves started coming in from the formerly communist states. As if they understood what a border was. Though they didn’t need visas.”</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":25, \"pNum\":27} --><p>Is it possible for a great work of literature to be strongly reminiscent of Don Freeman’s “Corduroy,” that old children’s story of the bear in a department store, searching for a button? Corduroy sees the escalator as a mountain, the furniture floor as a palace. “Memoirs” makes as much use of the naïveté of its bears as of their insight. When the matriarch bear arrives in the West — in our world — she describes the opaque (to her) phenomenon of window shopping: “The boredom of the passers-by was apparently considerable, since they scrutinized every product in the shop windows.” When shopping for smoked salmon in the supermarket, she makes the beautiful and precise observation that it is found “where the coldest goods were displayed in the brightest light.” And in another scene, in a department store selling records, she observes: “A gramophone stood on a pedestal, and right beside it, a life-size, black-spotted white dog made of plastic. You could see his image on each of the phonograph records, which I found pathologically excessive.”</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":26, \"pNum\":28} --><p>Many books written for children are of no particular interest once you’re an adult, but the great works for children have the density of poetry and the depth of parable; very little in “adult” literature rivals it. The greatest animal characters come from kids’ books, and Kafka. Together they seem to suggest an alternative citizenship, that of the majorly minor, the brutally gentle. In that sense, Tawada’s work does seem to me to be fittingly that of and by and for a “child.”</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":27, \"pNum\":29} --><p>So maybe I shouldn’t have been surprised when Tawada told me that she was in the middle of writing essays on 10 children’s books. A publisher in Japan invited her to write them after reading a piece Tawada wrote about a hike she took in Switzerland passing through the village of a famous children’s-book author. “When I was young, I wrote to a writer I loved, a children’s writer, K.M. Peyton,” Tawada told me. “I remember this well, because this was the first letter I ever wrote in a foreign language, in English.”</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":28, \"pNum\":30} --><p>“Did she write you back?” I asked.</p><p>“She said she was very happy to get a letter from the end of the world! I thought Japan was the center of the world.”</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":29, \"pNum\":32} --><p>For her essays, she wrote about Curious George, who sees the city from up above rather than from down below, and she wrote about the Russian fable “The Snow Daughter,” in which the main character disappears by jumping over a fire. She wrote about “The Hundred Dresses,” which describes a Polish girl in Connecticut being picked on for always wearing the same dress, and about “Bedtime for Frances,” a sweet story about a badger who doesn’t want to go to sleep. And she also wrote about “Oley the Sea Monster,” an almost unbearably sad tale about a harbor seal taken from his mother and mistaken for a monster before a benevolent aquarium keeper disobeys orders to kill Oley and instead returns him to the harbor. Each of the children’s books was, in a sense, a story of alternative perspective, and of vulnerability. The happy endings felt heavy with sadness, the sad seemed to promise light.</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":30, \"pNum\":33} --><p>I wanted to say something to Tawada about how this reminded me of her work, but I felt as though English had turned into a language that was not my native one. Instead I asked Tawada if she had gone to the circus as a child. “I remember going once,” she said. Her parents took her to see a traveling Soviet circus when it visited Tokyo. “I remember there was a bear who rode a tricycle,” she said. “And that amazed me. And I knew even then that what was exciting was just that he was doing something normal, something even I could do.”</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":31, \"pNum\":34} --><p>A few of the children’s books Tawada had mentioned I didn’t know. When I got home, I ordered the ones I could find in English. “Jeanne-Marie Counts Her Sheep,” by Françoise Seignobosc, was a numbers book about a little girl dreaming of how many lambs her sheep, Patapon, will have, and what Jeanne-Marie will be able to buy with the money she makes from the lambs’ wool. Jeanne-Marie imagines many lambs and many purchases. But it turns out there is just one lamb. Jeanne-Marie (who in the illustrations is now an old, hunched woman) is able to knit only one pair of socks. “But Jeanne-Marie tried to look very happy, anyway, for she did not want Patapon to feel sad. Patapon was so pleased with her one little Lamb!”</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":32, \"pNum\":35} --><p>Was it a sad ending? Or a happy one?</p><p>I wrote to Tawada to ask what about the book had held her attention across so many years. She wrote that she loved its use of repetition, because “as a small child, the world won its shape repeating the same words and similar sentences.” But she also liked the ending. “The sheep is happy with only one child, that is not capital for her, but love.”</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":33, \"pNum\":37} --><p><em>Rivka Galchen is the author of three books, most recently “Little Labors.” She last wrote for the magazine about the <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/18/magazine/the-melancholy-mystery-of-lullabies.html?_r=0\">transformative power of lullabies</a>.</em></p>","scoop_slug":"yoko-tawada","promotional_media":100000004723843,"module_top":100000004723843,"modules_body":{"100000004731199":"LARGE","100000004723844":"JUMBO"},"ad_frequency":"","ad_sizes":"","ad_adjacencies":"[\"media-100000004723615\",\"media-100000004723614\",\"media-100000004725664\"]","ad_positions":""},"100000004724062":{"data_id":100000004724062,"print_headline":"The Exile","headline":"Kesha, Interrupted","summary":"Four years ago, she was a global superstar.

A Saturn return, she explained to me, happens to people between the ages of 27 and 31. “It’s when [expletive] gets really real and really hard, and you have to face life as an adult,” she said. Her hair was wet, and she wore eyelash extensions and no makeup. Her face, close up, is covered in freckles the color of very light coffee that make her look younger than 29. “It’s just a period in your life where you just kind of go from being more of a kid to a real adult.”</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":1, \"pNum\":1} --><p>She had been practicing this September day onstage at the Brooklyn club Warsaw, singing high and singing low, readying for her show that night, for which there had to be <em>glam,</em> a word that fits no intuitive part of speech and means that her hair and makeup were getting done. She used to cover those freckles, but she doesn’t anymore. She dressed in one of her two <a href=\"http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/magazine-feature/7341658/nudie-suits-fashion-comeback-history-gram-parsons-tex-williams\">Nudie suits</a>, the white one, the Western wear customized for her with an embroidered eye that matched the tattoo of an eye on the palm of her hand; a heart with a dagger in it; a few flowers; a couple of crosses. The Nudie suit was the same one she wore to the Billboard Music Awards in May. This is what she has taken to performing in since all this went down — fewer leotards, no more general pantslessness.</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":2, \"pNum\":2} --><p>In 2014, Kesha (née Kesha Rose Sebert) sued Dr. Luke (né Lukasz Gottwald), one of the music industry’s most successful and powerful pop music producers, and his various entities, saying he had drugged and raped her and emotionally abused her, and asked to be released from her contract. He countersued her for breach of contract and defamation hours later. A million briefs and filings and countercomplaints later, in February, a judge in New York <a href=\"http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/kesha-denied-injunction-against-dr-luke-must-record-for-sony-20160219\">denied her request</a> for an injunction on her recording contract (a recording contract can hold you hostage for life, or at least for a majority of your career).</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":3, \"pNum\":3} --><p>That day, her fans, known as her Animals, threw glitter across the steps of the courthouse, a reminder for her that whatever happened, she was still their queen. They chanted, “Free Kesha now!” It was to no avail: Kesha, in a white suit of far less merriment than the Nudie suit, sat in the gallery, her head on her mother’s shoulder, weeping. That day, #FreeKesha stormed social media, and within weeks, Adele spoke out from the stage in support of her. Taylor Swift, with whom she was only casually acquainted, donated $250,000 to help cover her crippling legal fees. Kelly Clarkson went on the record to say that Dr. Luke was a liar, that he was “kind of demeaning,” that she had been blackmailed into working with him. In April, the same judge said Kesha’s claims weren’t detailed enough to consider and that the statute of limitations had long since passed on her allegations of rape.</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":4, \"pNum\":4} --><p>Kesha is no longer the artist we met in the late aughts: blazing dollar sign in her name in place of the S, gold Trans Am that she said she wanted to have continuous sex in, 24-7 party girl, dredged in oil and breaded like a schnitzel in glitter. Now she is someone in suspended animation, unable to release new music pending contract litigation, touring small clubs to make some money to help fund her lawsuit and to make sure her fans don’t forget her; now she is someone who wants to work and make music, just without the man she says raped her; now Kesha is a cause.</p><!--NYTREF {[\"region\":\"Embedded\", \"id\":\"100000004724061\", \"dropzone\":5, \"pNum\":5]} --><p>Outside Warsaw, her fans also had (or did? or committed? It’s still unclear) glam. A myopic young man who held a vial of maroon glitter told me that he lost his mother two months ago and that he came in from out of state for this show. “If Kesha can get through this year,” he said, “so can I.” A young woman in ripped pantyhose and shorts used a blue glitter stick to apply tiger stripes to a friend’s face. “Kesha is such an inspiration to me,” she said. “I’m a survivor, too.” Before I could ask if she was talking about general lifelong survival or if she was a victim of sexual assault, her friend screamed, “She’s here!” and a mass of people in their early 20s rushed around the corner to find Kesha, who had emerged from the club beaming. One of them yelled: “Mom! She’s my mom! I have to go make sure she knows she’s my mom!” As her Animals approached, Kesha opened her arms to one of them.</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":6, \"pNum\":6} --><p>“Hi! <em>Hi!</em> You were in court!” Kesha said. “You were there!”</p><p>“Yes, yes, I was there,” the Animal said. “I’m so happy you’re free now!”</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":7, \"pNum\":8} --><p>Here Kesha got serious. She looked the Animal in the face and said very carefully: “No, no. I’m not free. Don’t think that, because there’s still a lawsuit. I have new music. I — ” She stopped herself, then hugged the Animal and a few more, took a picture with all of them and left.</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":8, \"pNum\":9} --><p>Later, she told me that people didn’t really understand the predicament she was in. They think it’s simple, that she’s free or not free, that she must have won her court case because she’s performing. “They were like, ‘Oh, my gosh, you’re free,’ and I was like, ‘No, sweetheart, I love you, but no, I am not, and I don’t know where you got that information.’ ” Her Animals, the world at large, they didn’t really get that she had written new songs — 22 of them — and recorded them at her own expense and that they were sitting somewhere waiting to be completed and polished and released. She told me that she wanted to get her story out so people really understood what was going on — that right now, she is the opposite of free.</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":9, \"pNum\":10} --><p>At Warsaw, she threw Christmas lights across the stage and performed in front of a sign lit up in jaunty cowboy letters that said “[Expletive] the World,” because that was how she was feeling. She prowled back and forth in her Nudie suit, which she eventually took off to reveal a fringed black hot-pants onesie that read “FTW” on its rear. There was no more hitting her cue, no more hyperchoreographed pop-star dances, except one done maybe as a joke, in dinosaur masks. At one point she played a guitar with her teeth after pretending to eat her boyfriend’s face. This was just a very strange, very Kesha club show.</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":10, \"pNum\":11} --><p>She sang some of her biggest hits, often modified with a country lilt. She sang a cover of the song she helped write for Britney Spears, “Till the World Ends,” like a haunted dirge. “I can’t take it, take it, take no more,” she sang, her voice deep and wounded. At one point, she shouted: “Anything outside of these four walls doesn’t matter tonight. I’m talking about rent. I’m talking about homework. I’m talking about your [expletive] ex-boyfriend. I’m talking about my lawsuit.” The crowd went berserk. “[Expletive] that!” she screamed as the Animals cheered and threw glitter.</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":11, \"pNum\":12} --><p><strong>On the rooftop of</strong> her hotel in Brooklyn the day after the show, Kesha was talking about the particular and peculiar predicament she finds herself in — a pop star suspended in a Jell-O mold of paralysis, unable to put out new music until all of this is resolved — when a bee began to circle her with intense interest and finally landed on the knee of her black jeans, within one of their artfully torn holes. “If I don’t freak out, I’ll be fine,” she said, her eyes watching the insect.</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":12, \"pNum\":13} --><p>It was an intimate discussion, just Kesha and me, a bee and four members of her team, including her lawyer, all leaning in and listening and ready to yank a hood over my head and remove me in the event that our talk broached anything that might seem antagonistic to her continuing litigation. The night before, at her concert, her lawyer stuck by my side as if we were on a date.</p><!--NYTREF {[\"region\":\"Embedded\", \"id\":\"100000004726337\", \"dropzone\":13, \"pNum\":14]} --><p>How disconcerting all this was: Kesha is someone whose image was built on a decidedly unchaperoned ferality, a spontaneity and a streak of rebellion and a lack of self-consciousness. Once she sang that she brushed her teeth with a bottle of Jack Daniels. She sang about suitors visiting her metaphoric gold Trans Am. A friend of mine interviewed her a few years ago and told me they’d had a hilarious time, sitting outside a loud bar, laughing and drinking. He called her “giddy” and “ready to rumble.” He showed me a piece of paper upon which she had scribbled a sketch of a penis and testicles and signed it “K$.” Her restlessness is still there, but now it bubbles like lava beneath her dormant-volcano facade. She has so much she wants to say, but while she spoke, she paused to figure out how best to word a sentence, or how it would look in print once she said it. The restraint was unnatural; it wore on her.</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":14, \"pNum\":15} --><p>In February, 16 months after she filed her first suit and 38 months after her last album was released, Kesha asked to have her contract, under which she still owed three albums, absorbed by RCA, the label that is the exclusive distribution arm for Dr. Luke’s label, Kemosabe/Kasz Money, Inc. (KMI). But Sony, which owns RCA, said that it had not been party to the original contract between Kesha and KMI; only Luke, who discovered her and made her famous, had the power to release her.</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":15, \"pNum\":16} --><p>In April, after the <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/07/arts/new-york-state-judge-rejects-keshas-claims-in-dr-luke-case.html\">judge dismissed</a> most of Kesha’s civil complaints (which included a request for monetary damages), Kesha’s lawyers filed appeals, which remain in their early stages. The same judge had said that she assumed Sony would provide Kesha with a new producer, just as it said it would. “Why would they take an artist who is popular, who is making them money, and not promote her work when they’ve already invested millions?” she had asked, according to a court transcript. It was a reasonable question. Kesha’s lawyer at the time, whom she has since replaced, argued that Kesha was less valuable to Sony than Luke. “Their business interest is in promoting Dr. Luke, because he’s their hit maker, not Kesha. Kesha’s been on ice for two years.”</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":16, \"pNum\":17} --><p>Luke’s lawyer, Christine Lepera, said in an email that the allegations of rape and emotional abuse are “horrific” and “simply not true,” that Kesha never intended to actually prove her claims in court, just to use them to get out of her contractual obligations. As part of Dr. Luke’s defamation case, his team cited a deposition from 2011, when Kesha was being sued by her former manager for breach of contract. In it she was asked if Luke had ever given her drugs or if they had ever had sex, insinuating that he had a Svengali hold on her. Kesha said she didn’t remember, she didn’t know, finally she said they had never had sex. Luke’s team uses this to say that after the time she says she was raped, in 2005, she swore under oath that they had never had sex and that she either was lying then or is now.</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":17, \"pNum\":18} --><p>But Kesha’s supporters would tell you that to take anything in that deposition at its face value is to pretend we know nothing about the pathology of victims of sexual assault, about power dynamics and about human fear, something much discussed in a post-Bill Cosby, post-Roger Ailes, one-more-week-of-Donald Trump world. But also consider that Dr. Luke presumably wouldn’t rush to work with someone who has accused him publicly of rape, no matter what the truth of is.</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":18, \"pNum\":19} --><p>Consider that until she can release music, Kesha has very limited means of income, with litigation that has gone on since 2014 and that costs at least $100,000 per month, the most conservative estimate I could calculate. Consider that Kesha has no ability to earn money, outside of touring for audiences of a few hundred, paying expenses from her own pocket, and that, as Kesha’s side has suggested, not allowing her to release music is a good way to prevent her from being able to afford continued litigation. But the least rewarding thing you can do is try to guess at any of this. You can read every one of the thousands of pages of filings and come no closer to the truth. Trust me, I tried. “Reading court filings doesn’t get you to the truth,” Dan Stone, an entertainment litigator at Greenberg Glusker Fields Claman &amp; Machtinger, told me. “Even if this case goes to trial, it’s possible that no one will ever know what did or did not happen when the parties were alone in a room.”</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":19, \"pNum\":20} --><p>On the Brooklyn rooftop, Kesha said that she submitted 22 songs to Sony in early summer. According to her representatives, Sony didn’t provide any meaningful feedback until after a judge intervened in late August. Her representatives told me that recording and releasing “Warrior,” her second album, took only eight months from start to finish. I knew that they were agreeing to let her talk about the case for the first time in part because of what Kesha said: that she wanted people to know what she was going through. I believe they also knew that public understanding of this case had worked for her so far, and that further understanding of the music-making predicament might only help. She wanted to play her new music for me. The bee was now circling her face. “Please go,” she whispered to it, but it lingered.</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":20, \"pNum\":21} --><p><strong>Kesha was supposed </strong>to be fun. That’s what she says she was told when she began preparing songs for “Animal,” her debut album. “Something that was always told to me is: ‘You’re fun. We’re going to capitalize on that.’ ” We were at her house in Los Angeles a few days after the concert. Her team and I had waited downstairs amid the fan art and the psychedelic Moroccan-mod décor — patterned couches and rugs, two full-size velvet sheep with silver heads, dinosaur figurines, wax skulls, crystal stones and various sketches of penises and testicles. Someone on her team mentioned displeasure with The Times’s <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/24/arts/music/kesha-the-world-tour-review.html\">review</a> of the Warsaw show. I had read it, too, and I said that it seemed that the critic was a Kesha fan — he’d written in praise of her several times — and that if he didn’t like the show, perhaps they should think about how Kesha fans will react to her new genre transitions and experimentation.</p><!--NYTREF {[\"region\":\"Embedded\", \"id\":\"100000004724060\", \"dropzone\":21, \"pNum\":22]} --><p>She came downstairs in pink leopard leggings and a T-shirt that had a picture of Iggy Pop on all fours and read “I Wanna Be Your Dog,” and she started to tell her story. “I was like, ‘I <em>am</em> fun, but I’m a lot of other things.’ But Luke’s like: ‘No, you’re fun. That’s all you are for your first record.’ ”</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":22, \"pNum\":23} --><p>Kesha moved from Los Angeles to Nashville when she was 4 with her mother, a songwriter who most notably helped write “Old Flames Can’t Hold a Candle to You,” which has been covered by Dolly Parton. Dr. Luke told <a href=\"http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/959321/keha-the-billboard-cover-story\">Billboard magazine</a> in 2010 that he was particularly impressed with an improvised rap Kesha did on her demo, that he liked her “bravado” and “chutzpah.” But after she arrived in Los Angeles and signed with Kemosabe, Luke was busy with other artists. Kesha spent her time writing songs, and eventually wrote for or with artists including Miley Cyrus and Alice Cooper. (According to an interview her mother gave <a href=\"http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/magazine-feature/6980931/kesha-dr-luke-battle-inside-story-mom-pebe-sebert-interview-exclusive\">Billboard magazine</a>, the purported rape happened somewhere during all this, in 2005, after a party at Paris Hilton’s house.) Then, in 2009, she was the featured vocalist on “Right Round,” by Flo Rida, produced by Dr. Luke. Things changed quickly after that.</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":23, \"pNum\":24} --><p>“Animal” was released the first week of 2010, going platinum in the United States and multiplatinum in other countries. She was something completely new in a female pop star, something grittier and less polished than we were used to. She sang about getting drunk and partying. She sang openly about sex, without the romance we’d been accustomed to, all in a voice that was half-teasing, half-moaning. The album contains “Party at a Rich Dude’s House,” and of course, “TiK ToK,” the album’s first single, which went multiplatinum, setting a <a href=\"http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/ke-ha-makes-digital-sales-history-as-tik-tok-explodes-20091231\">new record</a> for digital downloads in a single week by a female artist.</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":24, \"pNum\":25} --><p>“TiK ToK,” she told me, was written to be more nuanced and more definitively ironic at first. But her producers and co-writers on the song, Dr. Luke and Benny Blanco, had to keep her image in mind. She says of Dr. Luke: “I remember specifically him saying: ‘Make it more dumb. Make it more stupid. Make it more simple, just dumb.’ ” She tried, joking around with some lyrics she found silly. “I was like, O.K., ‘Boys try to touch my <em>junk.</em> Going to get <em>crunk.</em> Everybody getting <em>drunk,’</em> or whatever, and he was like, ‘Perfect.’ ”</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":25, \"pNum\":26} --><p>The problem was, she said, there was no balance. Every song was a song about partying, and yes, that was who she was, Kesha says that was definitely who she was, but she’s a real person having a complete human experience, and she wanted her album to reflect that. “To this day, I’ve never released a single that’s a true ballad, and I feel like those are the songs that balance out the perception of you, because you <em>can</em> be a fun girl. You <em>can</em> go and have a crazy night out, but you also, as a human being, have vulnerable emotions. You have love.”</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":26, \"pNum\":27} --><p>When the album was released, Kesha says, she was surprised that people criticized her for singing about the same things that her heroes, Bob Dylan and the Beastie Boys and Iggy Pop and Fugazi and Johnny Cash, had always been celebrated for. She thinks of the Beastie Boys’ “(You Gotta) Fight for Your Right (to Party)” as the soul sister of “TiK ToK.” “You know, when I first came out, I was saying I want to even the playing field. I’m a superfeminist. I am an ultra-till-the-day-I-die feminist, and I am allowed to do, and say, and participate in all the activities that men can do, and they get celebrated for it. And women get chastised for it.” It soon became clear that people thought she was something she truly wasn’t. They didn’t get that the dollar sign in her name was ironic — that it was not an image, but a kind of comment on image. They didn’t get that her talk-singing wasn’t an attempt at rap; it was its own thing, just a way she made music.</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":27, \"pNum\":28} --><p>She toured with the album, and she watched as her army of fans solidified and organized and named themselves. Her weirdness and her talk of inclusivity and her ways of distorting her looks with glitter made her the flagpole around which the freaks and rejects began to gather. There was something about her freedom, about how it appeared that she would never brook any discrimination, that called them to her. “I looked at people in the face, and they said: ‘You helped me.’ ‘You helped me come out to my parents.’ ‘You helped save my life.’ And all of a sudden, I, unbeknown to me, am changing the world in a positive way, and now that I’ve gained the knowledge that this is possible through music, that’s the most important part of it.”</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":28, \"pNum\":29} --><p>In her legal filings, she says that during this time, Luke became verbally abusive to her, that he called her a “fat [expletive] refrigerator” and criticized her weight in front of people. “I was under immense pressure to starve myself,” she told me. “And I tried to and almost killed myself in the process.” She put out an EP called “Cannibal” in late 2010, then “Warrior” in 2012, which had an even edgier sound than “Animal.” It was still dancey and poppy, but it had a hard 1970s-inspired rock roughness. There’s a punk-influenced song called “Dirty Love,” which she recorded with Iggy Pop.</p><!--NYTREF {[\"region\":\"Embedded\", \"id\":\"100000004726338\", \"dropzone\":29, \"pNum\":30]} --><p>She began to rebel against the lyrics that she says were finding their way into her songs. “Lyrics that would say: ‘Get that heifer out my face. I’m going to pull your ponytail back because you don’t know me, bitch, you phony trick,’ ” she says. “I was like, O.K., not going to sing that. I will not sing those words. Like, no. And then there was this argument about it.” (In statements made through his representatives, Luke denied that he had created an image for Kesha outside the one she originally crafted for herself; that he had pressured her to put only party songs on “Animal”; that he had dictated lyrics to her; or that he had emotionally abused her in any way.)</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":30, \"pNum\":31} --><p>In 2013, Kesha went on tour to promote “Warrior.” At the end of the year, she found herself exhausted and depressed. It had been eight long years since she’d signed her contract. Her self-consciousness about her body dovetailed with her general sense of helplessness. The only thing she could control was what went in and out of her body. In January 2014, Kesha checked herself into a treatment center that specializes in eating disorders.</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":31, \"pNum\":32} --><p>At this point in the story, at home in her chair, she stopped for a minute, then leaned toward me and touched my knee. “As you grow up and you grow awareness, some say ignorance is bliss, and in some ways, it is, but once you realize and you gain knowledge, it’s there, and you can’t deny it,” she said. “And now I’m very much aware of things that I wasn’t before, and it keeps me more accountable for my actions.”</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":32, \"pNum\":33} --><p>While she was at the clinic, she became desperate to write music. Her boyfriend found a toy keyboard for her, and after some negotiation, the staff let her keep it. She wrote songs and she did therapy and she received letters from fans. She did therapeutic coloring, and one day she began writing letters back to those fans on coloring-book pages, writing around pictures of dinosaurs and kittens playing with yarn, “Someone I work with has literally driven me into this disease, tortured me and [expletive] with me and my family,” she wrote in a letter that was posted to social media. “So I’m here taking time and getting my magic back dammit.” This was the first time the public had heard these claims.</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":33, \"pNum\":34} --><p>She left treatment in March after two months. The first thing she did was remove the dollar sign from her name. “I’m just fun,” she repeated, this time in a sour voice. “That’s all I am. That’s it. ‘That’s all you are. That’s all you are.’ ” She leaned toward me. “I was taking back my strength, and I was taking back my voice, and taking back my power, taking back my body. I’m just taking back my [expletive] life.”</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":34, \"pNum\":35} --><p>The second thing she did was file her lawsuit.</p><p><strong>In 2009, Kesha </strong>was introduced to Ben Folds, the singer-songwriter, musician and producer. It was right around when she was breaking out, and she found herself wounded by the things people say on the internet, including, as Folds recalled, “Eat [expletive] and die, you [expletive] slut.” Folds reassured her. It seemed clear to him that she was strong enough to survive it. Later, he did a string arrangement for her on “Past Lives,” the last song on the deluxe edition of “Warrior.” The thing he loves about her, something both he and another producer told me, is that she is unselfconscious about being wild and imperfect. She understands the value in her voice sounding off for a minute. She understands why a note should sound crazy.</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":35, \"pNum\":37} --><p>While she was in rehab, Kesha wrote a song called “Rainbow” on her tiny toy keyboard. Her mother had always told her that you could tell that a song was great if it could be sung against just one note and still sound good. As she sat singing it against one note, on the floor of the rehab facility, she knew she had something. She imagined “Rainbow” like a great orchestral production, something that Brian Wilson would have done on “Pet Sounds.” She wanted this song to be produced by Ben Folds, who just happened to have friends who could play cellos and violas and kettle drums and the oboe and the flute and the French horn. He called in all his favors, and they rented out the big room at Capitol Records and tried to do the song fast and cheap. He wanted her to stand where Nat King Cole and Frank Sinatra had stood, to understand her importance in the line of musicians that people remember.</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":36, \"pNum\":38} --><p>He had her play with the bridge a little, sending ideas into his voice mail over a couple of days until they got it exactly right for recording. The process was revelatory for her. “He just really helped pull out of me exactly what I wanted to be, but I’ve always kind of been scared to try,” she recalls. “And he’s like: ‘Try to sing that high C. Try to go higher. Try to do this weird thing with your voice.’ Instead of getting shamed, it was like I was being encouraged and validated, and it was so magical and so beautiful.” Folds produced the final version using just two takes.</p><!--NYTREF {[\"region\":\"Embedded\", \"id\":\"100000004724059\", \"dropzone\":37, \"pNum\":39]} --><p>Kesha was invited to sing at the Billboard Music Awards on May 22. On May 17, the show’s producers issued a statement saying that KMI had rescinded its approval of her performance. KMI suspected she would use the platform to make her case against Dr. Luke. Ultimately, it relented and allowed her to sing a cover, after she signed a statement saying she would not talk about Luke or give interviews at the awards. Folds asked her if she thought she could do a stripped-down version of Bob Dylan’s “It Ain’t Me, Babe,” and she said she thought she could. So he called his friend the violin player, and Kesha put on her white Nudie suit and got up there with just a piano playing a sparse two-note line and some spare violin, and with tears in her eyes <a href=\"https://youtu.be/SnwbXbvur4g\">she sang a version of the song</a> that was more poignant and beautiful and stirring than any of her pointed and literal covers at her club shows. Her pauses were extraordinary; her voice, which was her new voice, was revelatory — had we ever heard that voice before?</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":38, \"pNum\":40} --><p>“That’s what kills me, is the almost parable of her being held down for a little while,” Folds says. “She’s the only performer I can think of that has gone from being packaged to real. Most of the time people start off, and it’s like their rawness is what breaks through, and then they have to continue to build that into a more polished commercial thing. What she’s actually doing is the opposite, where she’s now showing that actually, there is something really huge beneath the whole thing.”</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":39, \"pNum\":41} --><p><strong>Kesha was tired; </strong>Kesha was right in the middle of her Saturn return. A recording contract acts as embalming fluid to the person you were when you first signed it. Kesha can create a new sound. She can use her new voice. She can sing her pop hits as country songs. But there’s no guarantee anyone will release those new songs: There’s a clause in her original contract that insists she remain “reasonably consistent in concept and style to the artistic concept and style” of the original recordings; there’s a clause that says she’s not even allowed to change her name without approval.</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":40, \"pNum\":42} --><p>The rape claim bubbles beneath every proceeding and every filing and every motion in this case. It shades every word of every page of every version of these suits. Our legal system isn’t set up to deal with a case like Lukasz Gottwald p/k/a Dr. Luke, Kasz Money, Inc. and Prescriptions Songs, L.L.C. v. Kesha Rose Sebert p/k/a Kesha: a rape claim that’s past its sell-by date, which has turned into a banal contract dispute. Kesha will not relent on her accusations, and Dr. Luke won’t relent on his defamation suit. How could they settle? Settling will only make either of them look as if they lied. The story of <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/22/arts/music/kesha-dr-luke-lawsuit.html\">Luke v. Kesha</a> is a story of reputational murder-suicide; it’s a grenade whose pin has been pulled; it’s a story of scorched earth.</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":41, \"pNum\":43} --><p>Over the last two months, I was given information that you are given when you work at a major magazine whose story stands to influence the situation. Kesha was provided with outside producers, Sony told me just days before this went to press, and Kesha and Kemosabe had agreed to work with about a dozen of them. Sony said it “has made it possible for Kesha to record without any connection, involvement or interaction with Luke whatsoever.” But a day later, representatives for Kesha told me that wasn’t the case, saying, “Dr. Luke has insisted Sony’s participation is just an ‘accommodation’ and has not denied that all decisions regarding the album are still being made by Dr. Luke.” Luke’s lawyer told me that Luke is looking forward to seeing his name cleared in court. His lawyer says that Kesha has always been welcome to record and can be in a recording studio as early as this week. But if you were to create a spectrum of emotional experience, you’d find that Luke v. Kesha sits on the opposite end of where we sit when we want to listen to a pop song. Their old music already sounds distorted and spoiled to me. The only thing we know for sure is that this case will forever define both of them, and that while it’s going on, the world doesn’t get to see this new side of Kesha. The only thing we know for sure is that even if it is ever resolved, this story is forever.</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":42, \"pNum\":44} --><p>At last, I was able to hear four of Kesha’s new songs. I went to an office in Manhattan and sat in a room and listened while two of her representatives looked on. Kesha told me that when the inspiration hits her with a song — a lyric, a hook, a melody, anything — she is struck dumb with it until she puts it down on paper, that the inspiration itself feels like a divine act. I heard “Hunt You Down,” which was a real country song with banjo and some real country sentiments: “If you [expletive] around, I’ll hunt you down.” I heard “Learn to Let It Go,” which sounded like something you’d hear in heavy rotation on radio with Kesha’s beautiful, low voice singing that a happy ending is up to you. I heard “Rosé,” a toast to an old boyfriend who has married. “The good things never last,” she sings.</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":43, \"pNum\":45} --><p>But the song I want to tell you about most is “Rainbow.” If it ever emerges from private listenings, it will be your favorite Kesha song. It’s big and sweeping, and you can hear every instrument that Ben Folds and his associates played — it does recall a Beach Boys vibe, just as she wanted it to. And as Folds said, the way she sings the song is so rich and so real that it jerks you out of your expectation of a pop song. “I found a rainbow, rainbow, baby,” she sings. “Trust me, I know life is scary, but just put those colors on, girl, and come and paint the world with me tonight.” In the final section, her voice becomes stronger and more strained, and the effect is devastating. I asked to hear it three more times.</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":44, \"pNum\":46} --><p><em>Taffy Brodesser-Akner is a contributing writer for the magazine and for GQ.</em></p>","scoop_slug":"kesha-lawsuit-dr-luke","promotional_media":100000004725653,"module_top":100000004725653,"modules_body":{"100000004724061":"JUMBO","100000004726337":"LARGE","100000004724060":"JUMBO","100000004726338":"LARGE","100000004724059":"JUMBO"},"ad_frequency":"","ad_sizes":"","ad_adjacencies":"","ad_positions":""},"100000004724205":{"data_id":100000004724205,"print_headline":"Last Taboo","headline":"Why Pop Culture Just Can’t Deal With Black Male Sexuality","summary":"On America’s deep and persistent fear of the black penis.","byline":"By WESLEY MORRIS","byline_prefix":"By","authors":["Wesley Morris"],"kicker":"The Culture Issue","body":"<p><strong><span class=\"dropcap\">T</span></strong>hese are banner times for penises onscreen. In the last 18 months or so, I’ve seen casually naked men on “The Affair” and on “Girls,” plus casually naked robots on “Westworld.” Penises have appeared on “Game of Thrones” (where one was once violently disappeared) and been simulated by a killer drill on “American Horror Story: Hotel.” They were in movies like “Get Hard” and “Unfinished Business”; one was there-ish on John Cena in “Trainwreck”; they showed up in stunt form on a meek Adam Scott in “The Overnight” and through the boxer briefs of a smugly sunny Chris Hemsworth in “Vacation.” Ralph Fiennes spent some of this spring’s “A Bigger Splash” having a glorious time wearing nothing. And then there was “Weiner,” a hit documentary about the scandal started by the disseminated bulge in a politician’s underwear. Once upon a time, just seeing a man’s rear on television might cause a scandal; now you don’t have to go too far out of your way to encounter his front. Our cultural standards have relaxed just enough to show a man in full.</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":1, \"pNum\":1} --><p>And why not? Women have long been asked to take off their clothes, out of both artistic necessity and rank gratuitousness. Isn’t it men’s turn? Even when the nudity veers into homophobia (and boy, can it), there is an “at last” quality to all of this bareness: It’s so matter-of-fact, so casual. (We’re not, to be clear, talking about erections; there’s still a line between a flaccid, out-of-focus penis attached to what’s probably a stunt double on “The Affair” and, say, a European troublemaker like Gaspar Noé filming aroused, ejaculating ones.) We’ve gotten more gender-neutral, more feminist, more comfortable with our various bodies, more used to seeing dudes in gym locker rooms, better at Instagram and Snapchat and Tumblr — and so, too, have we gotten more O.K. with penises.</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":2, \"pNum\":2} --><p>Some penises, anyway.</p><p>A vast majority of these penises are funny, casual, unserious. Their unceremonious appearance — as naturalism, comedy, symbolism, provocation — is new, and maybe progressive. But that progress is exclusive, because these penises almost always belong to white men. As commonplace as it has recently become to see black men on television and at the heart of films, and as normal as it’s becoming to see male nudity in general, it has been a lot more difficult to see those two changes expressed in the same body. A black penis, even the idea of one, is still too disturbingly bound up in how America sees — or refuses to see — itself. I enjoyed HBO’s summer crime thriller, “The Night Of,” but it offered some odd food for thought: The most lovingly photographed black penis I’ve ever seen on TV belonged to a corpse in the show’s morgue. Meanwhile, the series’s most sexual black character was a rapist inmate.</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":3, \"pNum\":4} --><p>The black penis is imagined more than it’s seen, which isn’t surprising. This newly relaxed standard for showing penises feels like a triumph of juvenile phallocentrism — it’s dudes peeking over a urinal divider and, as often as not, giggling at what they see. Not all of that peeking is harmless; some of those dudes are scared of what they’ve seen. And knowing that — knowing even a whiff of the American history of white men’s perception of the black penis — leaves you vulnerable to attack, even when all you think you’re doing is going to see, I don’t know, “<a href=\"http://grantland.com/features/dumber-than-your-average-bear/\">Ted 2</a>.”</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":4, \"pNum\":5} --><p>Officially, there are no penises in “Ted 2,” the comedy written by, directed by and starring Seth MacFarlane that was a hit last summer. And yet they’re everywhere — scary black ones. Mark Wahlberg plays a New England knucklehead named John, who swears that you can’t use the internet without running into one. When a mishap at a fertility clinic leaves him covered in semen, a staff member tells him not to worry; it’s just the sperm of men with sickle-cell anemia, a disease that, in the United States, overwhelmingly afflicts African-Americans. John’s best friend, Ted — a nasty animated teddy bear — gets a huge kick out of this: “You hear that? You’re covered in rejected black-guy sperm,” it says. “You look like a Kardashian!”</p><!--NYTREF {[\"region\":\"Embedded\", \"id\":\"100000004731037\", \"dropzone\":5, \"pNum\":6]} --><p>The sperm bank is the pair’s Plan B. Plan A entails Wahlberg and the bear breaking into Tom Brady’s house and stealing some of his spunk as he sleeps. When they lift the sheets, staring at his crotch, they’re bathed in the golden light of video-game treasure. In another movie, this might be a clever conceit. Here it feels like paranoid propaganda, a deluxe version of what entertainment and politics have been doing for more than 200 years: inventing new ways to assert black inferiority. Now a teddy bear has a greater claim to humanity than the black people it mocks.</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":6, \"pNum\":7} --><p>This is what’s been playing out in our culture all along: a curiosity about black sexuality, tempered by both guilt over its demonization and a conscious wish to see it degraded. It’s as old as America, and as old as our movies.</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":7, \"pNum\":8} --><p><strong>The national terror</strong> of black sexuality is a central pillar of the American blockbuster. In 1915, D.W. Griffith’s “The Birth of a Nation” envisioned a post-Civil War country run by feckless white abolitionists, nearly ruined by haughty blacks and then saved by the Ku Klux Klan — a mob whose energies are largely focused on rescuing a white woman from a half-black, half-white lieutenant governor’s attempt to force her into marriage. That’s just the plot; Griffith’s genius was at its most flagrant in the feverish surrounding details. The country isn’t even done being rebuilt in “The Birth of a Nation,” and here comes the K.K.K., already determined to make America great again. The movie crackles with sensationalist moral profanity. Many of the black characters, for starters, are played by white actors, all having a grand time making randy savages out of their roles.</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":8, \"pNum\":9} --><p>This was American cinema’s first feature-length masterpiece. A full century later, it has lost none of its hypnotic toxicity. Even now, to see this movie is to consider cheering for the Klan, to surmise that every black man is a lusty darkie unworthy of elected office, his libido, his life. Its biases are explicit and electric. Griffith established a permanent template with this movie, not just for filmed action but for American popular and political culture — a fantasia of white supremacy, black inhumanity and the tremendous racial anger that’s still with us today.</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":9, \"pNum\":10} --><p>Look at Gov. Paul LePage of Maine, who, speaking at a town-hall meeting in January, blamed invading dealers for the state’s drug problem — men with such cartoonishly “black” street names as “D-Money, Smoothie, Shifty.” They come north for business, he said, and “half the time, they impregnate a young, white girl.”</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":10, \"pNum\":11} --><p>LePage might have been channeling Griffith — or cockamamie pseudoscience like “The Negro as a Distinct Ethnic Factor in Civilization,” a 1903 article in which the Baltimore doctor William Lee Howard argued that integration was impossible, not simply because black people were savages but because they were savages who hungered to rape white women. “When education will reduce the large size of the Negro’s penis,” he surmised, “as well as bring about the sensitiveness of the terminal fibers which exist in the Caucasian, then will it also be able to prevent the African’s birthright to sexual madness and excess.”</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":11, \"pNum\":12} --><p>Finding the source of this fear isn’t difficult. You can read the history of the black penis in this country as a matter of eminent domain: If a slave master owned you, he also owned your body. Slaves were livestock, and their duties included propagating the labor pool. Sex wasn’t pleasure; it was work. Pleasure remained the prerogative of white owners and overseers, who put their penises where they pleased among the bodies they owned. Sex, for them, was power expressed through rape. And one side effect of that power was paranoia: Wouldn’t black revenge include rape? Won’t <em>they</em> want to do this to <em>our</em> women?</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":12, \"pNum\":13} --><p>So from the time of slavery to the civil rights era, with intermarriage illegal, black men faced every possible violence, including castration and far worse, as both punishment and prevention against even presumed sexual insult. An exchange as common as eye contact, as simple as salutation, could be construed as an assault. Black men were bludgeoned and lynched for so little as speaking to white women. In 1955, while visiting Mississippi from Chicago, <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/projects/cp/obituaries/archives/emmett-till?module=ConversationPieces&amp;region=Body&amp;action=click&amp;pgtype=article\">Emmett Till</a> was kidnapped, tortured and shot for supposedly whistling at a white woman. As a boy, I was told that story the way you warn a child about traffic lights, seatbelts and talking to strangers. Till’s age ensured that you never missed the point: He was 14.</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":13, \"pNum\":14} --><p>Claude Neal was 23 — a farmhand in Jackson County, Fla., who in 1934 was accused of raping and killing his white boss’s 20-year-old daughter, Lola Cannady. He was moved from jail to jail so white lynch mobs wouldn’t find him before the trial. But eventually they tracked him down in Alabama, holding the jailer at gunpoint and absconding with Neal. The news of his capture attracted a bloodthirsty crowd of as many as 3,000. Lest a riot ensue and someone get hurt — someone besides Neal — he was lynched by a group of six, who then dragged him behind a car to the Cannadys’ farm, where Lola’s family members took turns slashing and shooting his corpse. Onlookers stabbed at it, spit on it, ran their cars over it. His body was then driven back to town and strung up in an oak so that the full mob could have its way. People skinned him. His fingers were cut off and, eventually, jarred. He was set on fire.</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":14, \"pNum\":15} --><p>In 2011, Ben Montgomery <a href=\"http://www.tampabay.com/features/humaninterest/spectacle-the-lynching-of-claude-neal/1197360\">re-reported Neal’s murder for The Tampa Bay Times</a>. His article contains a passage in which one of those first six assailants recalls what happened that day: “Well, I guess we was pretty liquored up, and I ain’t like that no more, but we cut off his balls and made him eat them and say they was good. Then we cut off his pecker and made him eat it and say it was good.” The nadir might have been castration, but the bottom was reached well before Claude Neal was turned into a string of just-married cans, before his humanness was mistaken for a knife block, a sheet of shooting-range paper, kindling. Maybe he did take that poor girl’s life, but we’ll never know: He never went near a courtroom. There’s no unremembering that his own life ended as a chew toy for hellhounds.</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":15, \"pNum\":16} --><p>The warning in these stories is obvious: Be careful near white people. The warning between the lines isn’t hard to spot, either: Be careful because your sexuality, to them, is hazardous.</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":16, \"pNum\":17} --><p>It’s funny how often we’re forced to remember that. This year, the second season of Lifetime’s “UnREAL,” a juicy scripted drama set behind the scenes of a “Bachelor”-like reality show, introduced a black bachelor in order to toy with America’s dubious assumptions about the sexual prowess of black men. (The real show turned out to be as self-incriminating as the fictional one.) In September, Lena Dunham made an <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/08/fashion/odell-beckham-jr-lena-dunham-met-gala-response.html\">irritating paradox</a> of those assumptions when she took public umbrage after the football player Odell Beckham Jr. paid her insufficient attention at this year’s Met Gala, a perceived slight that seemingly devalued her worth as a white woman. It was a 21st-century offense that seems as if it could have been taken in the 19th.</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":17, \"pNum\":18} --><p>The nation’s subconscious was forged in a violent mess of fear, fantasy and the forbidden that still affects the most trivial things. A century after Griffith, you’re free to go to a theater and watch Chris Hemsworth throw his legs open and parade his fictional endowment, while sparing a thought for what it would mean if a black star who goes by the Rock were to do the same. By the end of the 1960s, some black people were wondering that about Sidney Poitier: How much longer would a 40-year-old man have to stay a movie virgin? How many more times could he be made a mannequin of palatable innocuousness? In 1967, after black neighborhoods across the country burned in race riots, Poitier slapped the face of a haughty racist at the emotional apex of “In the Heat of the Night,” when he was just about the biggest star in Hollywood and at the peak of his talent. By the end of the year, though, in “Guess Who’s Coming to Dinner,” he was back to his serene, tolerable self, playing the only kind of Negro a liberal white family could imagine as worthy of its young daughter: Johns Hopkins- and Yale-educated, excruciatingly well-mannered, neutered.</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":18, \"pNum\":19} --><p><strong>In his cultural history</strong> of the penis, “A Mind of Its Own,” David M. Friedman includes part of a letter that a Pennsylvania lieutenant named William Feltman wrote in 1781 after a dinner on a Virginia plantation, during which he was served by teenage boys whose penises were visible beneath their clothes. The plantation’s owners seemed to assume the casualness now reserved for all those white movie and TV penises, but Feltman was agog: “I am surprized this does not hurt the feelings of the fair Sex to see those young boys of Fourteen and Fifteen years old to Attend them, [their] whole nakedness Expos’d, and I can Assure you It would Surprize a person to see those damn black boys how well they are hung.” Abolitionists and others loosely sympathetic to black people were equally enthralled, writing stories that made heroes of slaves with names like Selico, Itanoko and Zami — men who were excellent lovers and, also, immodestly well-hung.</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":19, \"pNum\":20} --><p>Reading about yourself in this way — reduced — is disorienting. I don’t feel that way, like a savage, a Selico, a walking schlong. I know the fantasy exists. It renders black men desired on one hand and feared on the other. But that’s a script for somebody else’s movie, one that Blaxploitation films began to flip not long after Poitier showed up for dinner and, arguably, <em>because</em> he did.</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":20, \"pNum\":21} --><p>The ingenuity of the Blaxploitation era, with all its flamboyant, do-it-yourself carnality, was its belief in black women and men and its conflation of danger and desire. The movies — self-consciously, hyperkinetically black — were at full strength from the very end of the 1960s through the first half of the 1970s, and more or less kicked off with a literal bang: Melvin Van Peebles directing himself doing the nasty in “Sweet Sweetback’s Baadasssss Song.” If the movies are ridiculous, they’re ridiculous in the way bell-bottoms, platforms and hair the circumference of a disco ball can now seem like camp. But back then, that was simply the way things were: <em>baad</em>. You went to “Slaves,” “Super Fly,” “Dolemite” and “Blacula” because you wanted to see yourself, but also because these movies were the political repossession of toxic myths. “Shaft” named a detective while winking at his anatomy. Black men were swinging their dicks for black audiences. The films wanted not just to master the myth but also to throw it headfirst out the window.</p><!--NYTREF {[\"region\":\"Embedded\", \"id\":\"100000004731586\", \"dropzone\":21, \"pNum\":22]} --><p>But the myth has wings, and they’ve since attached themselves to white writers and directors — one or two of whom even know how to fly with them. For every couple of Seth MacFarlanes, there’s a Quentin Tarantino: someone who would consider himself an Enlightenment figure, an abolitionist, woke.</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":22, \"pNum\":23} --><p>“The Hateful Eight,” Tarantino’s Reconstruction western from last winter, is another of his Blaxploitation remixes. This one gathers a group of barely acquainted people — all positioned on negligibly opposite sides of morality, history and the law — and traps them, Agatha Christie-style, in a shack during a blizzard. A lot of them get to spinning yarns, but only one of those stories earns a flashback: the one told by Maj. Marquis Warren (Samuel L. Jackson), a cavalryman turned bounty hunter. At just about the movie’s halfway point, he tells a grizzled Confederate general named Sanford Smithers (Bruce Dern) a tale about the general’s dead son. Warren says he happened upon the younger Smithers and, recognizing him, staged an act of racial retribution, which the flashback shows us. The son crawls naked through snow toward Warren’s midsection and puts his head in front of the major’s genitals. Then the score goes horror-film crazy and cuts back to Jackson, who gives the narration all the Zeusian jive that you pay Jackson to summon. With the old Confederate officer shuddering in disbelief, Warren boasts that this shivering white boy sucked his “<em>warm</em>. <em>Black</em>. <em>Dingus</em>!”</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":23, \"pNum\":24} --><p>In the world of this film, Tarantino is playing with the truth. He’s playing with math (I at least found more than eight hateful people). But most important, he’s playing with fire. His movie runs along the third rail of race in America: that black dingus. Who knows if Warren made this story up. Courtesy of Tarantino, he knows that nothing turns a white man red faster than a black penis. The story’s probable falseness only makes it more devastating, because falseness is what the story messes with: the fear of black male sexuality; how it’s chasing your white wives, mothers and daughters; that the black penis can be a vengeful weapon. Opening up the threat to sons laughs at the ludicrousness of it all. That dingus is coming for everybody.</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":24, \"pNum\":25} --><p>This flamboyance is partly how Tarantino’s films have come to understand black people — as mighty movie types rather than as human beings. “The Hateful Eight” made its defiant appearance during the centennial of “The Birth of a Nation,” and the movies share the same post-Civil War era. Watching Jackson stand over that bobbing white head, you feel the inversion of Griffith’s template. Tarantino orchestrated lurid, white-on-black sexual violations for “Pulp Fiction” and “Django Unchained,” so you notice the inversion of his own template, too. This time it’s black power dominating white that’s presented both as a kind of rape and a mode of justice. Tarantino revises the social parameters of the Hollywood western so that racism and misogyny are its villains. Most of that revision, though, still hangs from a black penis.</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":25, \"pNum\":26} --><p>Even if you’re Tarantino and learned from Blaxploitation, why propagate these myths — what the Depression-era journalist W.J. Cash, late explicator of the Confederate psyche, once called the “Southern rape complex”? Why continue to frame black power as a genital threat? For white artists concerned with black life, the myth matters, and it should: It’s a white invention. But attempts to dispel that myth tend to reinforce it, sometimes because the myth-busters’ love for black men seems indistinguishable from what’s supposedly despicable about them. Hence those cartoon hero-slaves, Selico, Itanoko and Zami. It can be a peculiar thing being black in this country. Even the people who claim to love you are capable of these little accidents of hate — the social equivalent of finding hair in your food.</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":26, \"pNum\":27} --><p>This is it, isn’t it? Here’s our original sin metastasized into a perverted sticking point: The white dick means nothing, while, whether out of revulsion or lust, the black dick means too much.</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":27, \"pNum\":28} --><p><strong>One night, when</strong> I was 24 and living in San Francisco, I met a handsome white guy visiting from Germany. We stood near a window in a crowded bar and talked about an art show he’d just seen. Eventually I brought him to my apartment, where, after removing some of his clothes, he eagerly started to undo my pants. But then he stood there for a moment and gave my crotch a long, perplexed look, like Geraldo Rivera did when, after months of buildup, he opened what turned out to be Al Capone’s empty vault. He replaced his clothes and, before exiting, explained himself: “That’s not what I expected.”</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":28, \"pNum\":29} --><p>I knew what he meant. He was expecting a “Guinness Book of World Records” penis. He wasn’t the only one — just the last to do it with such efficiently rendered disappointment. That hurt, but I remember being amused that, for him, all our attraction came down to was what someone had told him my dick should look like. I remember standing there, half-dressed in my living room, and actually saying out loud, “Why does he know that?”</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":29, \"pNum\":30} --><p>But everybody knows. Anytime a pair of pants is prematurely rezipped or the line goes dead in a sex app’s chat window, I always know: He was expecting a banana, a cucumber, an eggplant, something that belongs to either a farm animal or NASA. He was expecting the mythical Big Black Dick (which, online, people just call “B.B.D.”). That presumption is something you tend to prepare for with interracial sex — that your dick could either render the rest of you disposable or put your humanity on a pedestal, out of reach. That it could make you a Mapplethorpe.</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":30, \"pNum\":31} --><p>Last year marked the 30th anniversary of <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/01/arts/design/why-mapplethorpe-still-matters.html\">Robert Mapplethorpe’s</a> “Black Book”: 97 black-and-white photographs taken between 1977 and 1986, before and during the AIDS crisis. In the photos, black men sit and stand and contort themselves for portraits, from entirely nude to fully clothed. There are looks of defiance, happiness and rapture; in a few, there’s no “look” at all, just a man in profile, say, his eyes closed, his skin emitting something lunar. There are photos of backs. There’s one of two feet, where the light makes the striations in the toes seem like a glacial landmass. There’s a bare rear that looks like ripe fruit, another that evokes a Rorschach blot and one more, taking up the entire lower half of the frame, that looks like a hippopotamus.</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":31, \"pNum\":32} --><p>Some of the photos are meant to be erotic, and all are meant to seem worthy of being looked at. They’re born of the same curiosity and fascination as the black characters in Tarantino’s movies. Sometimes what’s in the frame can seem hard to work out, almost intentionally miscomposed; in some early pictures I’m not sure Mapplethorpe always knew the difference. In many, though, he obviously did. With “Man in Polyester Suit,” he nailed it. Taken in 1980, the photo is still the star of the “Black Book” group. A gentleman stands in a matching blazer, vest and trousers, filling the frame from midchest to just above the knee. The image has the basic cheesiness of a department-store catalog photo — a headless person, not quite facing the camera, arms at his side, his brown hands open. His zipper is open, too, and out of it hangs his penis. It’s veiny, uncut, positioned almost equidistant between the hands and bigger than both. Its droop brings it close to Dalí’s melting clocks. My favorite detail is the bit of white shirt coming through the zipper. It makes the penis look as if it were getting out of bed. An everyday object — the male power suit — gets a scandalous comic assist.</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":32, \"pNum\":33} --><p>“Man in Polyester Suit” is one of the great jokes on American racism, one misconstrued as pornography and therefore as exploitation. Is that America’s problem or Mapplethorpe’s? (Or, for that matter, Tarantino’s?) Are these guys doing social politics or fetishization? The difference between fetishization and romance is that only romance really cares what its object wants. Mapplethorpe and Tarantino both have complicated relationships with that difference.</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":33, \"pNum\":34} --><p>To spend time with Mapplethorpe’s work now is to find in it a kind of distorted love — what that German guy came all the way to America to discover. Mapplethorpe found most bodies beautiful and otherworldly, but especially black ones. He lit dark skin so it looked like wet paint and arranged subjects until they became furniture or evoked slave auctions. That naïve, dehumanizing wonder complicates what, at the time, was the radical, defiant feat of inscribing black men — black <em>gay</em> men — into portraiture. It strikes a peculiarly foundational American note: This was another white man looking at black men, with effrontery but also with want. You can locate a sense of ownership, of possession, in many of the images. Two of Mapplethorpe’s last relationships were with black men. Any eroticism in the photos might have come from the possibility that, sexually, he himself was possessed.</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":34, \"pNum\":35} --><p>These pictures made Mapplethorpe, who died in 1989, one of the country’s most notorious men. Among his most hostile adversaries was the race-baiting Senator Jesse Helms of North Carolina, who called Mapplethorpe’s work “sickening obscenity.” Whatever we mean when we talk about the culture wars of the 1980s and 1990s culminates with this — Mapplethorpe’s pictures of black men, S.&amp;M. scenarios and fisting, and the 1990 retrospective at Cincinnati’s Contemporary Arts Center that led to an obscenity trial. In its defiance and its awkward ideology, that fellatio shot in “The Hateful Eight” is the opposite of a Mapplethorpe: Tarantino luxuriates in its anti-eroticism.</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":35, \"pNum\":36} --><p>The artist <a href=\"http://www.art21.org/artists/glenn-ligon\">Glenn Ligon</a> waged his own museum-ready critique in “Notes on the Margin of the Black Book” (1991-93), in which he dismantled Mapplethorpe’s collection and captioned each image with quotes from scholars, from Mapplethorpe’s subjects, from people he interviewed in bars. You could find James Baldwin, but you also had some lady named Rita Burke, who worried that these pictures would give you AIDS. Ligon, whose own sly, emotional work investigates the psychological contours of black ontology, doesn’t condemn his source material; he opens it out, argues with it. In the end, what he asserts is that a black penis is mysterious only to those who don’t have one. He’s right: Black male sexuality is of interest in American popular culture only when the people experiencing it are white.</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":36, \"pNum\":37} --><p>There is no paradigmatic white penis. To each man his own. But there is a paradigmatic black one, and how do you stunt-cast for that? When people are turning down sex with a perfectly good black penis to look for a perfectly better one, how do you determine what an authentic-seeming black penis even is? What does the Kevin Hart of black dicks look like? What about the Denzel? And how would a white casting director know?</p><!--NYTREF {[\"region\":\"Embedded\", \"id\":\"100000004724204\", \"dropzone\":37, \"pNum\":38]} --><p>There’s a more pernicious problem at work here, too. The underrepresentation of the black penis bespeaks a larger discomfort with depicting black male sexuality with the same range of seriousness, cheek and romance that’s afforded white sexuality. The history of American popular culture is an immersion in, if not loving white people, then knowing that white people can love. There’s been no comparably robust black equivalent. But there is a recent history of black people daring to create one.</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":38, \"pNum\":39} --><p><strong>So much is</strong> going on in the video for Cameo’s 1986 hit “<a href=\"https://youtu.be/sn8KYD1Vco0\">Candy</a>” that it makes you dizzy. The song is the happiest sort of funk number — hard-edged and insinuating yet bright. (They sing “candy” so that it rhymes with “today.”) In the video, which Zbigniew Rybczynski directed, the surfaces of a cityscape are composited and layered so that figures — musicians, models — keep leaping in and out of them. At some point the women are made to seem as if they’re floating upward, like fizz in a Champagne flute. The clothes are by Jean Paul Gaultier, who really has a gift for boldly dressing black people. But the most dizzying thing of all is the red codpiece Cameo’s frontman, Larry Blackmon, wears over his black tights. It looks like a piece of hard candy.</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":39, \"pNum\":40} --><p>The same codpiece appears in the video for Cameo’s biggest hit, “<a href=\"https://youtu.be/MZjAantupsA\">Word Up</a>,” and in “<a href=\"https://youtu.be/kP3DWSDiKIU\">You Make Me Work</a>.” Blackmon’s boiled-egg eyes and caterpillar mustache give him an out-of-left-field look, even for an R.&amp;B. artist near the start of the video era, and in Gaultier’s comically erotic costumes — form-fitting everything, breastplates, cutout chain mail tops, big polka-dotted hats — he looks like a trainer at a cartoon sex gym. In the opening shot for “Back and Forth,” the codpiece zooms toward the screen, then acts as a pendulum that, in swinging, wipes one scene into the next. The band was contemporaneous with Mapplethorpe, but it controls its own organ. And it’s not as though Blackmon had to do a lot of gesticulating or gyrating. The piece spoke for itself. It never said anything all that dirty, but it let Blackmon mess with presumptions and curiosities about his penis. (And about his orientation — that sex gym seemed pretty gay.)</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":40, \"pNum\":41} --><p>You didn’t have to see an actual penis to know when one was speaking to you. Around the time that Cameo was hitting its peak, so was Bo Jackson. He declared himself bi-athletic, playing football for the Raiders and baseball for the Royals. Nike made him the star of a classic campaign — “Bo Knows” — whose crowning image was a black-and-white Richard Noble photograph of Jackson holding a bat behind his head, wearing white baseball pants and football pads over his bare chest. Your eye almost doesn’t know where to look. His arms? His stomach? His perfectly symmetrical face?</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":41, \"pNum\":42} --><p>There’s no real threat in that picture. His hands don’t hold the bat; his shoulders do. The pads cover his chest in a way that, as a teenager, I found modest. But in the original photo you can see the tops of his thighs — twin sequoias — and the substantial bulge between them. With Larry Blackmon, I figured I was supposed to look at his crotch and probably laugh. Jackson’s was paralyzing — in a way that would have further appalled Lieutenant Feltman at that plantation dinner. But I was amazed. Jackson’s cockiness was comprehensive. He wasn’t coming after anybody. We were supposed to come to him. The slight lean of the legs alone had a gravitational pull. I mean, what else was that ad selling? There weren’t even any sneakers in it! Just that man, his black body, its power, his crotch. Just sex. It wasn’t an accidental picture, either. Bo knew. Apparently so did Nike, because many reproductions of that image covered up his crotch with ad copy or started at his midsection.</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":42, \"pNum\":43} --><p>The late 1980s and early 1990s might have been the nuttiest time for black male sexuality. It was a height of the culture wars and of identity politics, which pitted creative people against moralists and artists against one another. Black men were often the crux. On one hand, they were the antagonists of news reports and America’s nightmares: rapists, muggers, criminals, gangstas, kids liable to “wild out,” sometimes guilty, a lot of times not. On the other hand, hip-hop, African-American comedy and sports were moving them to the center of the culture, making stars of rappers, stand-up comedians and athletes, men like L.L. Cool J, Eddie Murphy and Michael Jordan. Prince was the 1980s’ greatest erotic adventurer. Madonna made a coffee-table scrapbook called “Sex” that featured the priapic rapper Big Daddy Kane in a three-way with her and Naomi Campbell. It was the Kim Kardashian’s “Selfish” of its day, except much further out there.</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":43, \"pNum\":44} --><p>America loved famous black men and feared the rest of them. Then someone murdered Nicole Brown Simpson and Ron Goldman, and the prime suspect was her black ex-husband, O.J. After that, the pride certain white people took in letting someone like O.J. be one of them must have seemed like a cruel, postlapsarian joke. Two recent major projects about Simpson, a drama and a documentary, made the whole tragedy seem inevitable, essential to our natures and the races’ relationship to each other, all bound up in the original sin of slavery and the racism it manufactured. No one can ever quite agree on who’s the sinner and who has been sinned against, whether it’s 1994 or right now.</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":44, \"pNum\":45} --><p>But at least now it’s easier to find more of the kind of sexual black imagery that was so freighted a few decades ago. The internet contains bottomless warrens of black men starring in their own pornos. There are pictorials of old celebrities and viral images of current celebrities’ wardrobe mishaps. The pride in some of these websites counteracts the fetishizing that sends some people hunting for “B.B.D.” and the self-reducing that leads other people to offer it up. Mainstream American culture is still ambivalent about what to do with black men’s sexuality, but you can find unequivocal comfort on shows like “House of Cards,” “Broad City” and “Jessica Jones,” in which white women are convincingly, inoffensively attracted to black men who aren’t the shows’ stars but are permitted to be sexual.</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":45, \"pNum\":46} --><p>But needing to be permitted is part of the problem.</p><p>We have a strong, ever-proliferating sense of how white people see the sexuality of black men, but we are estranged from how black men see themselves. Post-Blaxploitation, that connection was primarily confined to the art world. The queer film essays of Marlon Riggs and Isaac Julien, from the late 1980s and early 1990s, remain different but intellectually conjoined odysseys of the male gaze, aimed at himself — two black mirrors. Otherwise, there was virtually no television and very few movies that were seriously interested in normal black desire, straight or otherwise. That’s changing. The Starz crime drama “Power” is about an unfaithful black crime boss (Omari Hardwick), and a few months ago, it made room for a casual cameo by the rapper 50 Cent’s penis. And that bartender who slept with Jessica Jones happens to be Luke Cage (Mike Colter), who now has his own show, a so-so Blaxploitation-minded superhero drama that presents Colter as the sexiest man on television (or any streaming service). The record-industry soap opera “Empire” doesn’t even seem to know there ever <em>was</em> a white gaze; it’s the least self-consciously black show I’ve ever seen. The only people the power family at the show’s core won’t sleep with are one another, but we’re only two and a half seasons in. Give them time.</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":46, \"pNum\":48} --><p>There is still something missing from our picture of black male sexuality, though, regardless of who’s looking: romance. We know black men can grind, but rarely do we see them love — as though we’d have to upend too many stereotypes, shed too much pathology, making it impossible to get there.</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":47, \"pNum\":49} --><p>There’s a magnificent new movie called “<a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/21/movies/moonlight-review.html\">Moonlight</a>” that knows how hard that is. It’s the story of a young Miami man named Chiron (it’s pronounced “Shy-RONE”), who is portrayed, over about 20 years, by three different actors. His mother’s a junkie. A drug dealer becomes a father figure. Chiron flees bullies who suspect — as he does himself — that he might be gay. (“What’s a faggot?” he has to ask, at one point.) Barry Jenkins wrote and directed the movie and fights it past the clichés in Chiron’s biography, which are clichés only in the movies. For one thing, “Moonlight” is surpassingly gorgeous. The depth-of-field camera work and luscious soundtrack give the movie atmosphere. You can feel the humidity. You can also feel the hormones roiling this kid, who is desperate to connect them to someone, then desperate to bury them. But he can’t. And that’s because — and this is important to say because it’s <em>so rare</em> — Jenkins knows Chiron is a human being. Not because he’s a sex machine.</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":48, \"pNum\":50} --><p>It’s as if Jenkins has seen the punks and thugs and clowns who’ve popped up in so many movies, as if he knows about the fetishes and the gazing, about imperfect allies like Mapplethorpe and Tarantino, about all the gawking that’s done at black men and their penises without ever truly seeing. It’s as if he knows all of this and is determined to strip it all away. There’s nothing inherently wrong with black men’s sexuality — only the ways it has been distorted, demonized and denied. Blackmon had his codpiece for protection. Jenkins is certain that Chiron needs something even stronger: affection.</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":49, \"pNum\":51} --><p><strong>When I was</strong> 9 or 10, I spent the summer at a camp at my school. One day, after swimming, I was showering, zoned out but dialed in. I snapped out of it when I heard two older boys talking. “Yo, he’s looking at your dick!” “What going on, man? What are you doing?” They were talking to me. One of them was lean, very fit, a shade darker than I am and, incredibly enough, named David. His eyes were small but bright. And I had been looking at his penis.</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":50, \"pNum\":52} --><p>I didn’t know what to say, so I told the truth. “Yours is so much handsomer than mine!” They almost fell over laughing. The wonder with which I said it probably was funny. “You a faggot!” David said. I stayed a “faggot” for the rest of my school life.</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":51, \"pNum\":53} --><p>The only penises I’d ever seen at that point were as black as David’s. But I noticed his. He was 12 or 13 and more developed. Admiring it got me cast out of our little Eden — but only because that’s how boys are. We didn’t know about sexual myths or racial threats, about the taboos that we would discover are our particular birthright. I didn’t anyway. Not yet. I just saw a penis. And it was beautiful.</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":52, \"pNum\":54} --><p><em>Wesley Morris is a critic at large for The New York Times and a staff writer for the magazine.</em></p>","scoop_slug":"black-male-sexuality-last-taboo","promotional_media":100000004731068,"module_top":100000004726830,"modules_body":{"100000004731037":"LARGE","100000004731586":"embedded","100000004724204":"JUMBO"},"ad_frequency":"","ad_sizes":"","ad_adjacencies":"","ad_positions":""}}; });
