Amid the day-to-day juggle of work and family, we need to find time to build for the really big moments: starting a new business, buying a house, having a child and sending that child to college. With all this, it’s easy to get distracted and neglect goals that seem far off into the future, including one of our most important and challenging financial milestones — retirement.</h3> <p>A recent survey* on how Americans engage with their retirement accounts, conducted by YouGov on behalf of BlackRock and T Brand Studio, shows we still have some catching up to do when it comes to investing for a time of life, that for most of us, will last two or three decades. Twenty-four percent of respondents with retirement accounts don’t know what they’re invested in and an astonishing 44 percent of respondents have no retirement account at all. “Investing can be intimidating,” says Martin Small, head of U.S. iShares. “It&#x27;s hard to get started, whether you’re the most sophisticated professional or new to your career. But getting, and staying, in the market is key to achieving the retirement you want.”</p> <p>There is a bright side for people wanting to renew their focus on long-term investing, namely in the availability of solutions that make it easier to build portfolios that match their needs and goals. The emergence of flexible, low-cost exchange traded funds (ETFs), as well as all-in-one products like target risk and target date funds, has helped people in all walks of life start building for the long-term without being too overwhelmed. </p> <p></p> </div> <div class="left-icon"> <div class="desktop left-icon-container-desktop"> <div class="line-fa"><div class="line"></div></div> <!-- <img class="number" src="https://paidpost-assets.nyt.com/paidpost/blackrock/an-investment-in-the-future/images/num_44.svg" alt="" /> --> <div class="preload number" data-src="https://paidpost-assets.nyt.com/paidpost/blackrock/an-investment-in-the-future/images/num_44.svg"></div> <div class="white-text"> <p>OF RESPONDENTS&nbsp;</p> <p>DON'T HAVE ANY&nbsp;</p> <p>KIND OF RETIREMENT&nbsp;</p> <p>ACCOUNT.</p> </div> </div> <div class="mobile left-icon-container-mobile"> <div class="line-fa"><div class="line"></div></div> <!-- <img class="number" src="https://paidpost-assets.nyt.com/paidpost/blackrock/an-investment-in-the-future/images/num_44.svg" alt="" /> --> <div class="preload number" data-src="https://paidpost-assets.nyt.com/paidpost/blackrock/an-investment-in-the-future/images/num_44.svg"></div> <div class="white-text"> <p>OF RESPONDENTS DON'T&nbsp;</p> <p>HAVE ANY KIND OF&nbsp;</p> <p>RETIREMENT ACCOUNT.</p> </div> </div> </div> <div class="right-text"> <h3 class="desktop">Life is always changing.

The emergence of flexible, low-cost exchange traded funds (ETFs), as well as all-in-one products like target risk and target date funds, has helped people in all walks of life start building for the long-term without being too overwhelmed. </p> <p class="desktop"></p> </div> </div> </section> <section class="content content-2 need-init tracking-block" data-tracking="chart-1" data-smd="content-2" module-q3chart=""> <div class="chartp-main"> <div class="title">HOW OLD WERE YOU WHEN YOU FIRST <span>OPENED A RETIREMENT ACCOUNT?</span></div> <div id="q3-chart"></div> </div> </section> <section class="content content-3 need-init tracking-block" data-tracking="balancing risk-section" data-smd="content-3"> <div class="container-main"> <div class="right-text mobile"> <p><span class="title">Balancing risk, not just stocks and bonds</span>Just how engaged are Americans?

While 80 percent of those who have a retirement account say that they either fully or somewhat understand diversification, many experts feel investors are often unsure of what diversification really looks like in a portfolio. Brett Mossman, who heads up BlackRock Portfolio Solutions group, explains that diversification is not just about owning a certain percentage of stocks and bonds or even how many different funds you own. “It's actually more about the type of risk that you consume in the portfolio,” he says. This is often the part that eludes people.</p> </div> <div class="left-text"> <div class="line-light-fa"><div class="line-light"></div></div> <div class="title"> <p><span class="quote">“</span>IT’S ACTUALLY MORE ABOUT THE TYPE OF RISK THAT YOU CONSUME IN THE PORTFOLIO”</p> </div> <div class="white-text"> <p class="desktop-table">—BRETT MOSSMAN, BLACKROCK PORTFOLIO SOLUTIONS</p> <p class="table">—BRETT MOSSMAN, BLACKROCK&nbsp;</p> <p class="table">PORTFOLIO SOLUTIONS</p> </div> </div> <div class="right-text right-text-2"> <p>“For example, certain types of bonds have similar risks to stocks, which means that a portfolio that appears balanced may actually be riskier than you realize.

This may be in part because men and women are motivated differently, including how they get their financial information and attitudes about risk. “By not watching and reacting to the markets, like their male counterparts, women investors are often far better off long term,” says Hollie Fagan, head of the registered investment advisor business and retail direct platform at BlackRock. “History bears that out. What's more important to these women is whether they're able to achieve the goals they've set out for themselves.”</p> <p>There are also more beneficial forces that drive people to engage, notably positive changes in their work circumstances. A third of respondents who ever make changes to their portfolios (33 percent) said they do so when they get a raise, while 21 percent would do so if they got a new job. Other key triggers include getting married (7 percent) or making a large purchase (12 percent), with the numbers about evenly split between men and women in both cases.</p> <p>It's important for people to be aware of what kinds of changes these events bring about. “Changes in life circumstances are either going to create more assets to invest or create more liabilities,” Small says. “Individuals need to be able to manage both.”</p> </div> </div> </section> <section class="content content-6 need-init tracking-block" data-tracking="chart-3" data-smd="content-6" module-q10chart=""> <div class="chartp-main"> <div class="title">APPROXIMATELY WHAT PROPORTION OF YOUR <span>RETIREMENT INVESTMENTS ARE ETFS?</span></div> <div id="q10-chart"></div> </div> </section> <section class="content content-7 need-init tracking-block" data-tracking="hitting your target-section" data-smd="content-7"> <div class="container-main"> <div class="right-text mobile"> <p><span class="title">Hitting Your Target: Diversification through ETFs</span>While many Americans have 401(k)s, 24 percent of respondents said they have personal retirement accounts, such as IRAs.

Only 40 percent of those with a retirement account felt they either somewhat or fully understood ETFs.</p> <p>“An ETF is like a mutual fund that an investor can buy or sell just like a stock in a brokerage account,” Small says. Similar to a mutual fund, an ETF is a bundled group of assets such as stocks and bonds that are divided into shares. Most ETFs are designed to track an index and can be traded in the market throughout the day, while mutual funds can only be bought and sold with the fund company at the end of the trading day.</p> <p>“Their versatility gives individuals and advisors the choice to build any portfolio they want in a low-cost, tax efficient way,” Small says. These advantages can make them good vehicles for core, long-term holdings where global diversification and value really matter.</p> <p>ETFs are also popular because they can be acutely targeted.</p> <p>“In addition to rounding out the core of a portfolio, ETFs give people the ability to express a really precise view on the exposures they want,” Mossman says. “For example, if an individual wanted to invest solely in Asian technology stocks, or in small-cap value stocks or emerging markets bonds, there is an ETF for each one of those things.”</p> </div> </div> </section> <section class="content content-8 need-init tracking-block" data-tracking="chart-4" data-smd="content-8" module-q9chartv2=""> <div class="chartp-main"> <div class="title">KNOWLEDGE OF ETFS AMONG INDIVIDUALS</div> <div id="q9-chart"></div> <div class="sub-title">Question asked in survey: Prior to taking this survey, did you know what an ETF was?</div> </div> </section> <section class="content content-9 need-init tracking-block" data-tracking="trendsetters-section" data-smd="content-9"> <div class="container-main"> <div class="right-text mobile"> <p><span class="title">Trendsetters: Why Millennials Embrace ETFs</span>Almost two-thirds (60 percent) of those with retirement plans say at least some of their money is invested in ETFs.

Millennials are driving this trend as they seek greater transparency into where their money is going. Seventy-two percent of millennials with retirement accounts hold at least some of their money in ETFs.</p> <p>Transparency is just one piece of the puzzle for millennials and ETFs. Another is the growth of online platforms such as self-directed brokerages, which make access to ETFs even easier. “These platforms are particularly attractive to millennials, who are quicker to embrace technology and who tend to be more concerned about the impact of cost and taxes on the long-term growth of their money,” Small says. And with less money to invest, they may not meet required minimums for traditional advisory accounts.</p> <p>Of course, these reasons make ETFs appealing for all generations, not just millennials. “Today, as the challenges of investing have gotten more complex, we are seeing the creation of smarter and more innovative solutions to help people manage that complexity,” Small says. “In this world, more and more investors are turning to low cost, tax-efficient ETFs to build diversified, quality market exposures at a competitive price.”</p> <p><em>Illustration by Tamer Koseli.</em></p> <p>*Methodology: All figures, unless otherwise stated, are from YouGov Plc.
