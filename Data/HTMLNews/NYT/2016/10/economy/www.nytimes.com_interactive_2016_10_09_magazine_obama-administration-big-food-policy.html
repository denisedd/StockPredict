  <p><span class="dropcap">E</span>ight years ago this month, I published in these pages an open letter to the next president titled, “<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/12/magazine/12policy-t.html">Farmer in Chief</a>.” “It may surprise you to learn,” it began, “that among the issues that will occupy much of your time in the coming years is one you barely mentioned during the campaign: food.” Several of the big topics that Barack Obama and John McCain <em>were</em> campaigning on — including health care costs, climate change, energy independence and security threats at home and abroad — could not be successfully addressed without also addressing a broken food system.</p><!--NYTDROP {"id":1, "pNum":1} --><p>A food system organized around subsidized monocultures of corn and soy, I explained, guzzled tremendous amounts of fossil fuel (for everything from the chemical fertilizer and pesticide those fields depended on to the fuel needed to ship food around the world) and in the process emitted tremendous amounts of greenhouse gas — as much as a third of all emissions, by some estimates. At the same time, the types of food that can be made from all that subsidized corn and soy — feedlot meat and processed foods of all kinds — bear a large measure of responsibility for the steep rise in health care costs: A substantial portion of what we spend on health care in this country goes to treat chronic diseases linked to diet. Furthermore, the scale and centralization of a food system in which one factory washes 25 million servings of salad or grinds 20 million hamburger patties each week is uniquely vulnerable to food-safety threats, whether from negligence or terrorists. I went on to outline a handful of proposals aimed at reforming the food system so that it might contribute to the health of the public and the environment rather than undermine it.</p><!--NYTDROP {"id":2, "pNum":2} --><p>A few days after the letter was published, Obama the candidate gave<a href="http://swampland.time.com/2008/10/23/the_full_obama_interview/"> an interview to Joe Klein</a> for Time magazine in which he concisely summarized my 8,000-word article:</p><p>“I was just reading an article in The New York Times by Michael Pollan about food and the fact that our entire agricultural system is built on cheap oil. As a consequence, our agriculture sector actually is contributing more greenhouse gases than our transportation sector. And in the meantime, it’s creating monocultures that are vulnerable to national security threats, are now vulnerable to sky-high food prices or crashes in food prices, huge swings in commodity prices, and are partly responsible for the explosion in our health care costs because they’re contributing to Type 2 diabetes, stroke and heart disease, obesity.”</p><!--NYTDROP {"id":3, "pNum":3} --><p>Was it possible that the food movement — the loose-knit coalition of environmental, public-health, animal-welfare and social-justice advocates seeking reform of the food system — might soon have a friend in the White House?</p><!--NYTDROP {"id":4, "pNum":4} --><p>This, after all, was not the only sign that Barack Obama recognized the need to reform industrial agriculture and stand up to Big Food. In his long-shot quest to win the Iowa caucuses, he courted the state’s small farmers, many of whom feel victimized by the oligopolies that dictate the prices and terms by which they’re forced to sell their crops and livestock. He also courted rural Iowans whose communities are increasingly befouled by the hog and chicken CAFOs (Concentrated Animal Feeding Operations) replacing the state’s family farms. Though CAFOs pollute the air and water like factories, they are regulated like farms, which is to say very lightly, when at all. Obama promised to change all that, vowing on the campaign trail to bring CAFOs under the authority of the federal Clean Air and Clean Water Acts and Superfund program “<a href="http://obama.3cdn.net/6274ad7348d96cd410_2aumv2byv.pdf">just as any other polluter</a>.” He also promised to give communities “meaningful local choice about the placement, expansion and regulations of CAFOs.” To big pork and chicken producers, which had largely succeeded in gutting both local and federal authority over CAFOs, these were fighting words. And agricultural reformers cheered.</p><figure id="graphic-100000004689447" class="graphic">

<p>They also cheered when, at a 2007 agricultural meeting in Iowa, Obama declared that Americans had a right to know where in the world their food came from and whether it had been genetically modified. In ways small and large, Obama left the distinct impression during the campaign that he grasped the food movement’s critique of the food system and shared its aspirations for reforming it.</p><!--NYTDROP {"id":6, "pNum":6} --><p>But aspirations are cheap — and naïveté can be expensive. A few days after the candidate’s interview with Time, Senator Charles Grassley of Iowa, a.k.a. the Senior Senator from Corn, blasted Obama for his heretical views on American agriculture, suggesting he was blaming farmers for obesity and pollution. A campaign spokesman quickly walked back Obama’s remarks, explaining that the candidate was merely “paraphrasing an article he’d read.” Big Food had spoken, and the candidate — an urban politician from Chicago — got the first of what would turn out to be many unpleasant tutorials on the industry’s sway in Washington.</p><!--NYTDROP {"id":7, "pNum":7} --><p><span class="dropcap">I</span>n order to follow the eight-year drama starring Big Food and both Obamas — for soon after the inauguration, the first lady would step in to play a leading role — it’s important to know what Big Food is. Simply put, it is the $1.5 trillion industry that grows, rears, slaughters, processes, imports, packages and retails most of the food Americans eat. Actually, there are at least four distinct levels to this towering food pyramid. At its base stands Big Ag, which consists primarily of the corn-and-soybean-industrial complex in the Farm Belt, as well as the growers of the other so-called commodity crops and the small handful of companies that supply these farmers with seeds and chemicals. Big Ag in turn supplies the feed grain for Big Meat — all the animals funneled into the tiny number of companies that ultimately process most of the meat we eat — and the raw ingredients for the packaged-food sector, which transforms those commodity crops into the building blocks of processed food: the corn into high-fructose corn syrup and all the other chemical novelties on the processed-food ingredient label, and the soy into the oil in which much of fast food is fried. At the top of the Big Food pyramid sit the supermarket retailers and fast-food franchises.</p><!--NYTDROP {"id":8, "pNum":8} --><p>Each of these sectors is dominated by a remarkably small number of gigantic firms. According to one traditional yardstick, an industry is deemed excessively concentrated when the top four companies in it control more than 40 percent of the market. In the case of food and agriculture, that percentage is exceeded in beef slaughter (82 percent of steers and heifers), chicken processing (53 percent), corn and soy processing (roughly 85 percent), pesticides (62 percent) and seeds (58 percent). Bayer’s planned acquisition of Monsanto promises to increase concentration in both the seed and agrochemical markets.</p><!--NYTDROP {"id":9, "pNum":9} --><p>Each industry sector is represented in Washington by one or more powerful lobbying organizations. The Grocery Manufacturers Association (G.M.A.) represents the household brand names, like General Mills, Campbell’s, PepsiCo, Nestlé, that make and market the packaged foods and beverages in the supermarket. The North American Meat Institute represents Big Meat, working alongside each animal’s dedicated trade association (the National Pork Producers Council, the National Cattlemen’s Beef Association and the National Chicken Council). The American Farm Bureau Federation ostensibly speaks for the growers of the commodity crops. The National Restaurant Association is the voice of the fast-food chains. The euphemistically named CropLife America speaks for the pesticide industry.</p><!--NYTDROP {"id":10, "pNum":10} --><p>These groups each have their own parochial furrows to plow in Washington, but they frequently operate as one — on such issues as crop subsidies, which benefit all, or the labeling of genetically modified food, which disadvantages all. In recent years the various sectors have been driven closer by the emergence of a common adversary: a food movement bent on checking their dominance in the marketplace and their freedom to operate with a minimum of oversight. So while it is something of a simplification, it does make sense to talk about Big Food as a single entity — and an impressively powerful one at that.</p><!--NYTDROP {"id":11, "pNum":11} --><p><strong>Soon after the</strong> inauguration, the Obamas gave Big Food a case of heartburn when, in the spring of 2009, Michelle Obama planted an organic vegetable garden on the White House lawn, a symbolic but nevertheless powerful act that thrilled the food movement. (Alice Waters had first proposed the idea of a White House victory garden to the Clintons, and the idea was picked up in 2008 in an <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/mar/20/michelle-obama-garden">online petition</a>, as well as in my “Farmer in Chief” letter.) The first lady also helped establish a farmers’ market a block from the White House; a photo op featured her heaping a market basket with local produce and singing the praises of fresh vegetables.</p><!--NYTDROP {"id":12, "pNum":12} --><p>Big Food had a big problem with the first lady’s food talk, and especially with one modifier: organic. In fact, she seldom if ever used that word to describe her garden, but the White House news release announcing the garden made much of the organic practices they were using — fertilizing with compost, using beneficial insects instead of chemicals to control pests and so on — so the press invariably referred to it as the White House’s “organic garden.”</p>

<p>A spokesman for the American Council on Science and Health, a chemical-industry front group, called the Obamas “organic limousine liberals,” warning that organic farming would lead to famine and calling on the first lady to use pesticides in her garden — evidently whether she needed them or not. The Mid-America CropLife Association wrote a letter to the president suggesting that, by planting an organic garden, his wife had unfairly impugned conventional agriculture. A minor skirmish, perhaps, but also a shot across the bow.</p><!--NYTDROP {"id":14, "pNum":14} --><p>That summer, the new administration mounted what would turn out to be its most serious challenge to the food industry. In fulfillment of Obama’s pledge to America’s small farmers and ranchers, the administration began an ambitious antitrust initiative against Big Food, investigating the market power and anticompetitive practices of the poultry, dairy, cattle and seed industries. Attorney General Eric Holder and the chief of the Justice Department’s Antitrust Division, Christine Varney, joined with Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack in an unprecedented listening tour through rural America, holding a series of <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/department-justice-and-usda-workshops-explore-competition-and-regulatory-issues-agriculture">public hearings</a> on concentration in the food industry over the course of 2010.</p><!--NYTDROP {"id":15, "pNum":15} --><p>At considerable risk to their livelihoods, ranchers and farmers testified to the abuses they suffered at the hands of the small number of companies to which they were forced to sell, often on unfavorable terms. In many regions, the officials heard, there were so few buyers for cattle that the big four meatpackers were able to dictate prices, impose unfair contracts and simply refuse to buy from ranchers who spoke out. Chicken farmers testified about how they had been reduced to sharecroppers by the industry’s contract system. Companies like Tyson and Perdue make farmers sign contracts under which the companies supply the chicks and feed and then decide how much to pay for the finished chickens based on secret formulas; farmers who object or who refuse any processor demands (to upgrade facilities, for example) no longer receive chicks, effectively putting them out of business. Holder, Varney and Vilsack expressed sympathy, voiced concern, vowed action and promised the farmers who came forward that they would suffer no retaliation for their testimony. Varney even offered to give one skittish chicken farmer her phone number at Justice.</p><!--NYTDROP {"id":16, "pNum":16} --><p>The Agriculture Department already had the authority to curb many of these abuses under the Packers and Stockyard Act of 1921, which established a powerful antitrust unit in the department now called the Grain Inspection, Packers and Stockyard Administration, or Gipsa. But Gipsa was effectively shuttered during the George W. Bush administration; dozens of farmer complaints against the meatpackers were found stuffed in a drawer, according to an <a href="http://washingtonmonthly.com/magazine/novdec-2012/obamas-game-of-chicken/">article in Washington Monthly</a> by Lina Khan. In response to pressure from farmers to do something about anticompetitive practices in the meat industry, the 2008 farm bill — the gigantic piece of legislation that roughly every five years establishes the rules of the farming game in America — included a measure instructing the U.S.D.A. to issue new Gipsa rules and enforce them. In June 2010, Vilsack announced a set of regulations to “make sure the playing field is level for producers.” Specifically, the proposed rules made it easier for producers to sue packers for unfair or deceptive practices and protected them from retaliation.</p><!--NYTDROP {"id":17, "pNum":17} --><p>Big Meat, in particular, was not happy. It opened its wallet, spending roughly $9 million on lobbying in 2010, not including political contributions to members of the agriculture committees in Congress. One of those committees called Edward Avalos, a U.S.D.A. undersecretary, to Capitol Hill to defend the new rules in a hearing at which the poor fellow was grilled mercilessly for doing his job. (The story is well told in Christopher Leonard’s recent book, “The Meat Racket.”) Vilsack apparently got the message; he consented to postpone the new regulations. This gave the industry time to mount a “grass roots” lobbying campaign against the Gipsa rules, in which contract chicken farmers were recruited by the National Chicken Council to send Congress letters drafted by lobbyists. Vilsack, in retreat, offered to scale back the new rules to make them more palatable. But the industry would accept nothing less than complete victory: It succeeded in killing any new curbs on its market power when the House Appropriations Committee stripped funding for Gipsa enforcement from the U.S.D.A.’s spending bill for 2012. And 2013, and 2014, and 2015.</p><!--NYTDROP {"id":18, "pNum":18} --><p>But what about the listening tour and the public hearings? Even though the hearings had established a pattern of anticompetitive behavior, the entire antitrust effort was quietly and ignominiously dropped. No more was ever heard of it. The farmers who testified were left to fend for themselves in the marketplace. (As for dialing up Christine Varney? Forget it: She returned to private practice in 2011, seven months after the last public hearing.) Obama had launched the most serious government challenge to the power of Big Food since Teddy Roosevelt went after the Meat Trust a century ago, but in the face of opposition it simply evaporated.</p><!--NYTDROP {"id":19, "pNum":19} --><p><span class="dropcap">A</span> case can be made that Michelle Obama, with little more at her command than the power of persuasion and her personal example, has achieved more on food issues than the rest of the administration. (It helped that she chose to focus on issues that resonated with ordinary Americans concerned about their children and did it in a voice that never sounded elitist.) Among her most meaningful accomplishments: the Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act of 2010, which she made a priority and which raised nutritional standards for the meals served in the Federal school lunch program and eliminated the sale of junk food elsewhere in the public schools. At her urging, food companies have taken steps to make their products less unhealthful. Federal nutrition guidelines have been made clearer and more sensible. And her Let’s Move campaign has raised the public’s consciousness about the importance of food to our health and well-being, which has laid the groundwork for more far-reaching reform in the future.</p><!--NYTDROP {"id":20, "pNum":20} --><p>In March 2010, Michelle Obama <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/remarks-first-lady-a-grocery-manufacturers-association-conference">gave a speech</a> to the G.M.A. that surprised many of the executives in the room with its sophistication and toughness. She issued a stern challenge to Big Food, doing it in such a way as to make clear she wasn’t about to fall for the industry’s usual bag of P.R. “health” tricks. “We need you not just to tweak around the edges,” she said, “but to entirely rethink the products that you’re offering, the information that you provide about these products and how you market those products to our children.” She continued: “What it doesn’t mean is taking out one problematic ingredient only to replace it with another. While decreasing fat is certainly a good thing, replacing it with sugar and salt isn’t. And it doesn’t mean compensating for high amounts of problematic ingredients with small amounts of beneficial ones — for example, adding a little bit of vitamin C to a product with lots of sugar, or a gram of fiber to a product with tons of fat doesn’t suddenly make those products good for our kids. This isn’t about finding creative ways to market products as healthy. As you know, it’s about producing products that actually are healthy.”</p><figure id="graphic-100000004689424" class="graphic">

<p>The speech got the industry’s attention. Sean McBride, a food-industry consultant who at the time worked for the Grocery Manufacturers Association, <a href="http://www.politico.com/agenda/story/2016/03/michelle-obama-healthy-eating-school-lunch-food-policy-000066">told Politico</a> about the Obamas’ concern with the food system that “you had a number of companies who were scared to death.” But according to Scott Faber, then the chief lobbyist for G.M.A., several members of his group recognized an important opportunity when Michelle Obama came calling on the industry to “step up its game.” The obesity epidemic “had put a bull’s-eye on the food industry’s back,” Faber explained. Here was a chance to remove it, with the first lady’s help.</p><!--NYTDROP {"id":22, "pNum":22} --><p>In response, the industry adopted a clever two-track strategy to deal with the challenge laid down by the first lady. On a very public track, industry leaders engaged the foundation that she formed, the Partnership for a Healthier America, in negotiating a series of private-sector partnerships — a series of voluntary efforts that the industry hoped would help avert new regulations — a possibility that Obama raised in her speech. Supermarket retailers pledged to promote more healthful foods in their stores, like fresh produce. A group of 16 leading food makers pledged to reduce the total number of calories in the food supply by a whopping 1.5 trillion. Food makers pledged to reduce harmful ingredients in processed food, like salt and sugar, while boosting healthy ingredients, like whole grains. In exchange for entering into these agreements, several industry partners were granted invaluable photo ops with the first lady. In the case of Subway and Walmart, she made appearances in their stores.</p><!--NYTDROP {"id":23, "pNum":23} --><p>Michelle Obama has celebrated these partnerships as significant achievements, but do they match the ambitions of her 2010 speech, with its call for industry to do more than “tweak around the edges” and instead to “entirely rethink the products you’re offering”? Removing unhealthful ingredients from processed foods is undeniably a good thing. Yet making junk food incrementally less junky is a dubious achievement at best. It tends to obscure the more important distinction between processed food of any kind and whole foods. What began as a cultural conversation about gardens and farmers’ markets and real food became a conversation about improved packaged foods, a shift in emphasis that surely served the interests of Big Food. While it can be argued that this was simply a concession to reality — because most Americans eat processed foods most of the time — to give up on real food so fast was to give up a lot.</p><!--NYTDROP {"id":24, "pNum":24} --><p>As for Big Food’s ballyhooed 2010 agreement with the first lady to remove 1.5 trillion calories from the American food supply by 2015, well, what does this even mean? Precious little, it turns out. The Healthy Weight Commitment partnership agreement stipulated an independent evaluation of the results, sponsored by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and recently completed. It concluded that total calories in the food supply were already declining by more than a trillion a year — soda sales, for example, have been plunging — and the evaluators determined that market trends would have guaranteed greater declines even in the absence of any pledge by the industry. The dean of the School of Nutrition at Tufts characterized the whole initiative as “an easily publicized but deceptive ‘sham’ pledge” and “an apparent industry charade” — at the public’s and the first lady’s expense.</p><!--NYTDROP {"id":25, "pNum":25} --><p><span class="dropcap">E</span>ven as Big Food sought to publicly partner with the first lady in her war on obesity, it engaged in a much less visible campaign to forestall any new law or tax or regulation threatening its freedom to make and market junk food. Big Food’s biggest victory on an issue Michelle Obama cared about was its success in derailing voluntary guidelines for marketing food to kids. The proposed guidelines, which were developed by an interagency task force consisting of the Federal Trade Commission, the U.S.D.A., the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the F.D.A., set standards for salt, sugar and fat in processed foods that, if exceeded, could not be marketed to kids — at least by companies that agreed to participate in the program. The draft set of guidelines, released in April 2011, were written in such a way that several classic kids’ foods like sweetened yogurt (which can have more sugar per ounce than Coca-Cola), canned soups (many of which are sodium bombs) and even Cheerios (also full of salt) would not pass muster as currently formulated. Though the recommendations did not have the force of law, they were nevertheless anathema to industry. “The guidelines were a turning point for us,” Scott Faber told me. The G.M.A. was now prepared to directly take on the administration — and the first lady.</p><!--NYTDROP {"id":26, "pNum":26} --><p>At the time, the White House, spooked by the Tea Party election of 2010 (which cost the Democrats control of the House) and by charges from Republicans and business leaders that the president was unfriendly to business, had begun an effort to repair relations with corporate America. In January 2011, Bill Daley, the former commerce secretary and investment banker, was installed as a business-friendly chief of staff. That spring, the G.M.A. waged an aggressive lobbying campaign to water down the marketing guidelines, aimed at both Congress and the White House. In the months that followed, the G.M.A., along with leaders of food and media companies, was granted a meeting with Valerie Jarrett, a senior adviser to the president, in the White House to discuss the issue. Public-health advocates and congressional supporters of the guidelines were surprised that neither the first lady nor the president spoke out in support of them. “I’m upset with the White House,” Senator Tom Harkin, chairman of the Senate Health committee, told Reuters. “They went wobbly in the knees.”</p><!--NYTDROP {"id":27, "pNum":27} --><p>The White House had left the administration’s own interagency task force to the mercies of a Republican-controlled House, which effectively killed off the voluntary guidelines. Faber, who as the G.M.A.’s chief lobbyist helped orchestrate this rout, told me he was “frankly surprised the administration never came back with a revised set of guidelines.” Evidently the White House had lost its stomach for this particular fight.</p><!--NYTDROP {"id":28, "pNum":28} --><p>That wasn’t the only one, either. In the years after, Big Food scored a series of victories over even the most reasonable attempts to rein in its excesses. Remember the pledge to Iowans to regulate CAFOs (“just as any other polluter”) and stanch the flood of animal waste they were loosing on rural America? For the government to regulate CAFOs at all, it must first know where they are and how many animals they house, a survey the E.P.A. has been trying to conduct since 2008. But in July 2012, after lobbying by meat producers, the E.P.A. dropped its effort just to <em>count </em>the nation’s CAFOs.</p>

<p>Big Meat also prevailed when challenged on the misuse of antibiotics in animal agriculture — a problem that Margaret Hamburg, the F.D.A. chief, likened to having your “hair on fire,” since it is leading to antibiotic resistance and compromising the drugs we depend on. But when the F.D.A. finally acted in 2013, it came forth not with regulations but with a voluntary program, one that has so far failed to reduce the use of antibiotics in the meat industry. The food industry even managed to undermine the Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act, Michelle Obama’s signature legislation, which the Republican Congress is refusing to reauthorize.</p><!--NYTDROP {"id":30, "pNum":30} --><p>But perhaps we will look back on Big Food’s single most important victory during the Obama years as one it didn’t even have to break a sweat achieving, since it involved an issue on which it wasn’t even challenged. The administration undertook an ambitious campaign to tackle climate change by stringently regulating industries responsible for greenhouse gases, notably energy and transportation. For whatever reason, though, the administration chose not to confront one of the largest emitters of all: agriculture.</p><!--NYTDROP {"id":31, "pNum":31} --><p><strong>Yet the future</strong> of food will be decided not only in the corridors of power, but in the wider culture as well, and here Big Food has a big and growing problem — one that some of its political victories have only exacerbated. For example, the industry’s $100 million fight to stop G.M.O. labeling has pitted many food companies against the overwhelming majority of their consumers, who tell pollsters they want their food labeled. This is a most uncomfortable position for consumer-goods businesses to find themselves in, which is why many of the G.M.A. member companies sought (unsuccessfully) to hide their involvement in the fight. Battling against transparency is bound to sow seeds of distrust, potentially undermining the most precious pieces of cultural capital Big Food owns: its brands.</p><!--NYTDROP {"id":32, "pNum":32} --><p>These battles have exposed weaknesses in the facade of Big Food’s power, soft spots that some grass-roots food activists have recently figured out how to exploit. One example: Since the 1990s, the Coalition of Immokalee Workers has been organizing the tomato pickers of South Florida, some of the most underpaid and ill-treated workers in the country. In their decades-long quest to improve pay (by 1 cent per pound) and working conditions (until recently some Florida tomato pickers were effectively enslaved by their employers), the coalition tried every strategy in the book: labor strikes, hunger strikes, marches across the state. But the growers would not budge.</p><!--NYTDROP {"id":33, "pNum":33} --><p>“Then we found the unlocked door in the castle wall,” Lucas Benitez, the farmworker who helped establish the coalition, told me. “It was the corporate brand.” Instead of going after the anonymous growers and packers, who had nothing to lose by rejecting their demands, the coalition trained its sights on the Big Food brands that bought their tomatoes: McDonald’s, Burger King, Chipotle, Subway, Walmart. In 2011 the coalition drafted a Fair Food Agreement guaranteeing a raise of a penny per pound and spelling out strict new standards governing working conditions. They then pushed the big brands to sign it, using the threat of boycotts, marches on fast-food outlets, even the public shaming of top executives and their bankers. One by the one, the Big Food brands have given in, signing the agreement and, for the first time, accepting a measure of responsibility for the welfare of farmworkers at the far end of their food chain. The coalition achieved victories that never could have been achieved in Washington.</p><!--NYTDROP {"id":34, "pNum":34} --><p>Surely there is a lesson here for the food movement — a collection of disparate groups that seek change in food and agriculture but don’t always agree with one another on priorities. Under that big tent you will find animal rights activists who argue with sustainable farmers about meat; hunger activists who disagree with public-health advocates seeking to make soda and candy ineligible for food stamps; environmentalists who argue with sustainable cattle ranchers about climate change; and so on. To call this a movement is an act of generosity and hope. But whatever it is, it has been no match for Big Food, at least in Washington.</p><!--NYTDROP {"id":35, "pNum":35} --><p>Whenever the Obamas seriously poked at Big Food, they were quickly outlobbied and outgunned. Why? Because the food movement still barely exists as a political force in Washington. It doesn’t yet have the organization or the troops to light up a White House or congressional switchboard when one of its issues is at stake.</p><!--NYTDROP {"id":36, "pNum":36} --><p>“Show me a movement,” the president told Dan Barber, the New York chef and writer, who cooked a meal for the Obamas on the eve of the inauguration. The discussion had turned to the possibility of reforming the food system. Eight years later, it isn’t entirely clear that Obama has been shown that movement. You can see why the president might have concluded that it would have been foolhardy for his administration to get too far out ahead of the culture on food issues. And why he might have turned to Michelle Obama at that same meal and said, <em>“You</em> can talk about these issues,” as Barber recalls. “It’ll be a hell of a lot more effective than me.”</p><figure id="graphic-100000004689449" class="graphic">

<p><strong>The power of</strong> the food movement is the force of its ideas and the appeal of its aspirations — to build community, to reconnect us with nature and to nourish both our health and the health of the land. By comparison, what ideas does Big Food have? One, basically: “If you leave us alone and pay no attention to how we do it, we can produce vast amounts of acceptable food incredibly cheaply.”</p><!--NYTDROP {"id":38, "pNum":38} --><p>Big Food knows it has a serious story problem, and early in the administration it began an aggressive P.R. effort. The immediate impetus appears to have been the 2009 release of the Oscar-nominated documentary “Food, Inc.” (for which I was interviewed and served as a consultant). The film made the case that the entire food system, from the Midwestern monocultures of G.M.O. corn to the fast-food meals wrecking America’s health, was sorely in need of reform. In response to the film, and facing an administration that appeared sympathetic to such views, a coalition of agribusiness corporations, along with the Farm Bureau and various commodity groups got serious about defending the industrial food system and going after its critics. According to a September 2010 article in Agri-Pulse, a trade publication, not only was the industry gearing up for “a pre-emptive strike against a long list of new regulations” expected from the new administration, but, just as important, it also felt the need to confront “people like Michael Pollan.”</p><!--NYTDROP {"id":39, "pNum":39} --><p>“We’ve seen so many attacks,” a corn industry spokesman was quoted as saying. “We see Michael Pollan go on Oprah” — as I did after “Food, Inc.” came out. “What’s going to happen when those people ... start to have an impact in Washington on policies and regulations?” Thus spooked, a coalition of Big Ag companies and trade groups, including Monsanto, DuPont and the National Cattlemen’s Beef Association, hired Ketchum Communications, the New York P.R. firm, to organize a multimillion-dollar campaign. Ketchum promoted something called the U.S. Farmers and Ranchers Alliance, ostensibly a group of independent farmers and ranchers — though much of the funding came from agribusiness corporations — who would speak out, in public forums and on op-ed pages, to counter the writers and filmmakers who, at the time, had a big and largely uncontested microphone.</p><!--NYTDROP {"id":40, "pNum":40} --><p>It was around this time that some of my speaking engagements at agriculture schools began falling prey to unexpected snafus and changes in plan. An invitation to speak at Washington State University in 2009, which had organized a community read of one of my books, was suddenly withdrawn, supposedly because of a budgetary crisis but according to media reports at the behest of a wheat grower on its Board of Regents. (When a prominent alumnus, a lawyer and food-industry gadfly named Bill Marler, stepped forward offering to cover my expenses, the school abruptly reversed course.) In 2010, an invitation to speak at Cal Poly, another ag school, was transformed into a debate after a donor to the school, the chairman of the biggest cattle feedlot in California, wrote to the president of the university threatening to withdraw his gift if I was allowed to speak without challenge. The University of Wisconsin, Madison, also made my book a community read and invited me to talk about it. To protest my presence, the Wisconsin Farm Bureau bused in several hundred farmers from across the state, all of them wearing the same T-shirt, printed with the legend “In Defense of Farmers.” Only the fabled niceness of Midwesterners saved me from a hail of rotten tomatoes that night.</p><!--NYTDROP {"id":41, "pNum":41} --><p>Surely Big Food was overreacting to the threat posed by a handful of writers and filmmakers, yet the fact that they did suggests that, behind the industry’s wall of political power, there indeed lurks a vulnerability. That vulnerability is the conscience of the American eater, who in the past decade or so has taken a keen interest in the question of where our food comes from, how it is produced and the impact of our everyday food choices on the land, on the hands that feed us, on the animals we eat and, increasingly, on the climate. Though still a minority, the eaters who care about these questions have come to distrust Big Food and reject what it is selling. Looking for options better aligned with their values, they have created, purchase by purchase, a $50 billion alternative food economy, comprising organic food, local food and artisanal food. Call it Little Food. And while it is still tiny in comparison with Big Food, it is nevertheless the fastest-growing sector of the food economy.</p><!--NYTDROP {"id":42, "pNum":42} --><p>While Big Food can continue to forestall change in Washington, that strategy simply will not succeed in the marketplace. There, Big Food is struggling to adapt to a rapidly shifting landscape it cannot control. That’s why it’s gobbling up organic and artisanal brands, hoping to learn the secret of their success — which, of course, is simply that they understand and respect the values of the new food consumer better than Big Food does. Some large food companies are voluntarily changing their practices in response to the concerns of these consumers, whether about antibiotics, animal welfare or the welfare of farmworkers. One future of food politics may lie in grass-roots campaigns targeted not at politicians in Washington but directly at Big Food and its consumers, taking aim at its Achilles’ heel: those precious brands.</p><!--NYTDROP {"id":43, "pNum":43} --><p>For all the disappointments, the Obamas deserve credit for celebrating and nourishing Little Food. If nothing else, the spotlight of their attention helped elevate the idea of food as something worthy of public attention. As the Obamas prepare to leave the White House, Big Food can congratulate itself on retaining its political grip on Washington. It seems very unlikely that the next occupant of the White House is going to pose as stiff a challenge. Donald Trump professes to love fast food, and Hillary Clinton has longstanding ties to Big Food: Tyson was one of Bill Clinton’s first political patrons, and as a lawyer in Arkansas, Hillary Clinton served on the board at Walmart. (Though as a New York senator, she worked hard on behalf of small upstate farmers, so perhaps there is hope.) But like Goliath, Big Food can’t afford to be complacent about its size or power, not when the culture of food is shifting underfoot. Perhaps it is a sign of things to come that Scott Faber, the lobbyist who helped the industry navigate the first Obama administration, has left the G.M.A. to work for the Environmental Working Group, where he now plies his skills on behalf of the food movement’s David. Politics and policy in Washington seldom move before the larger culture does, but when that happens, it can sweep away everything in its path — Goliath included.</p><!--NYTDROP {"id":44, "pNum":44} --><p><em>Michael Pollan is a contributing writer and the Knight professor of journalism at U.C.

At the same time, the types of food that can be made from all that subsidized corn and soy — feedlot meat and processed foods of all kinds — bear a large measure of responsibility for the steep rise in health care costs: A substantial portion of what we spend on health care in this country goes to treat chronic diseases linked to diet. Furthermore, the scale and centralization of a food system in which one factory washes 25 million servings of salad or grinds 20 million hamburger patties each week is uniquely vulnerable to food-safety threats, whether from negligence or terrorists.

As a consequence, our agriculture sector actually is contributing more greenhouse gases than our transportation sector. And in the meantime, it’s creating monocultures that are vulnerable to national security threats, are now vulnerable to sky-high food prices or crashes in food prices, huge swings in commodity prices, and are partly responsible for the explosion in our health care costs because they’re contributing to Type 2 diabetes, stroke and heart disease, obesity.”</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":3, \"pNum\":3} --><p>Was it possible that the food movement — the loose-knit coalition of environmental, public-health, animal-welfare and social-justice advocates seeking reform of the food system — might soon have a friend in the White House?</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":4, \"pNum\":4} --><p>This, after all, was not the only sign that Barack Obama recognized the need to reform industrial agriculture and stand up to Big Food. In his long-shot quest to win the Iowa caucuses, he courted the state’s small farmers, many of whom feel victimized by the oligopolies that dictate the prices and terms by which they’re forced to sell their crops and livestock. He also courted rural Iowans whose communities are increasingly befouled by the hog and chicken CAFOs (Concentrated Animal Feeding Operations) replacing the state’s family farms. Though CAFOs pollute the air and water like factories, they are regulated like farms, which is to say very lightly, when at all. Obama promised to change all that, vowing on the campaign trail to bring CAFOs under the authority of the federal Clean Air and Clean Water Acts and Superfund program “<a href=\"http://obama.3cdn.net/6274ad7348d96cd410_2aumv2byv.pdf\">just as any other polluter</a>.” He also promised to give communities “meaningful local choice about the placement, expansion and regulations of CAFOs.” To big pork and chicken producers, which had largely succeeded in gutting both local and federal authority over CAFOs, these were fighting words. And agricultural reformers cheered.</p><!--NYTREF {[\"region\":\"Embedded\", \"id\":\"100000004689447\", \"dropzone\":5, \"pNum\":5]} --><p>They also cheered when, at a 2007 agricultural meeting in Iowa, Obama declared that Americans had a right to know where in the world their food came from and whether it had been genetically modified.

A few days after the candidate’s interview with Time, Senator Charles Grassley of Iowa, a.k.a. the Senior Senator from Corn, blasted Obama for his heretical views on American agriculture, suggesting he was blaming farmers for obesity and pollution. A campaign spokesman quickly walked back Obama’s remarks, explaining that the candidate was merely “paraphrasing an article he’d read.” Big Food had spoken, and the candidate — an urban politician from Chicago — got the first of what would turn out to be many unpleasant tutorials on the industry’s sway in Washington.</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":7, \"pNum\":7} --><p><span class=\"dropcap\">I</span>n order to follow the eight-year drama starring Big Food and both Obamas — for soon after the inauguration, the first lady would step in to play a leading role — it’s important to know what Big Food is. Simply put, it is the $1.5 trillion industry that grows, rears, slaughters, processes, imports, packages and retails most of the food Americans eat. Actually, there are at least four distinct levels to this towering food pyramid. At its base stands Big Ag, which consists primarily of the corn-and-soybean-industrial complex in the Farm Belt, as well as the growers of the other so-called commodity crops and the small handful of companies that supply these farmers with seeds and chemicals. Big Ag in turn supplies the feed grain for Big Meat — all the animals funneled into the tiny number of companies that ultimately process most of the meat we eat — and the raw ingredients for the packaged-food sector, which transforms those commodity crops into the building blocks of processed food: the corn into high-fructose corn syrup and all the other chemical novelties on the processed-food ingredient label, and the soy into the oil in which much of fast food is fried. At the top of the Big Food pyramid sit the supermarket retailers and fast-food franchises.</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":8, \"pNum\":8} --><p>Each of these sectors is dominated by a remarkably small number of gigantic firms. According to one traditional yardstick, an industry is deemed excessively concentrated when the top four companies in it control more than 40 percent of the market. In the case of food and agriculture, that percentage is exceeded in beef slaughter (82 percent of steers and heifers), chicken processing (53 percent), corn and soy processing (roughly 85 percent), pesticides (62 percent) and seeds (58 percent). Bayer’s planned acquisition of Monsanto promises to increase concentration in both the seed and agrochemical markets.</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":9, \"pNum\":9} --><p>Each industry sector is represented in Washington by one or more powerful lobbying organizations. The Grocery Manufacturers Association (G.M.A.) represents the household brand names, like General Mills, Campbell’s, PepsiCo, Nestlé, that make and market the packaged foods and beverages in the supermarket. The North American Meat Institute represents Big Meat, working alongside each animal’s dedicated trade association (the National Pork Producers Council, the National Cattlemen’s Beef Association and the National Chicken Council). The American Farm Bureau Federation ostensibly speaks for the growers of the commodity crops. The National Restaurant Association is the voice of the fast-food chains. The euphemistically named CropLife America speaks for the pesticide industry.</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":10, \"pNum\":10} --><p>These groups each have their own parochial furrows to plow in Washington, but they frequently operate as one — on such issues as crop subsidies, which benefit all, or the labeling of genetically modified food, which disadvantages all. In recent years the various sectors have been driven closer by the emergence of a common adversary: a food movement bent on checking their dominance in the marketplace and their freedom to operate with a minimum of oversight. So while it is something of a simplification, it does make sense to talk about Big Food as a single entity — and an impressively powerful one at that.</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":11, \"pNum\":11} --><p><strong>Soon after the</strong> inauguration, the Obamas gave Big Food a case of heartburn when, in the spring of 2009, Michelle Obama planted an organic vegetable garden on the White House lawn, a symbolic but nevertheless powerful act that thrilled the food movement. (Alice Waters had first proposed the idea of a White House victory garden to the Clintons, and the idea was picked up in 2008 in an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/mar/20/michelle-obama-garden\">online petition</a>, as well as in my “Farmer in Chief” letter.) The first lady also helped establish a farmers’ market a block from the White House; a photo op featured her heaping a market basket with local produce and singing the praises of fresh vegetables.</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":12, \"pNum\":12} --><p>Big Food had a big problem with the first lady’s food talk, and especially with one modifier: organic. In fact, she seldom if ever used that word to describe her garden, but the White House news release announcing the garden made much of the organic practices they were using — fertilizing with compost, using beneficial insects instead of chemicals to control pests and so on — so the press invariably referred to it as the White House’s “organic garden.”</p><!--NYTREF {[\"region\":\"Embedded\", \"id\":\"100000004683099\", \"dropzone\":13, \"pNum\":13]} --><p>A spokesman for the American Council on Science and Health, a chemical-industry front group, called the Obamas “organic limousine liberals,” warning that organic farming would lead to famine and calling on the first lady to use pesticides in her garden — evidently whether she needed them or not. The Mid-America CropLife Association wrote a letter to the president suggesting that, by planting an organic garden, his wife had unfairly impugned conventional agriculture. A minor skirmish, perhaps, but also a shot across the bow.</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":14, \"pNum\":14} --><p>That summer, the new administration mounted what would turn out to be its most serious challenge to the food industry. In fulfillment of Obama’s pledge to America’s small farmers and ranchers, the administration began an ambitious antitrust initiative against Big Food, investigating the market power and anticompetitive practices of the poultry, dairy, cattle and seed industries. Attorney General Eric Holder and the chief of the Justice Department’s Antitrust Division, Christine Varney, joined with Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack in an unprecedented listening tour through rural America, holding a series of <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/department-justice-and-usda-workshops-explore-competition-and-regulatory-issues-agriculture\">public hearings</a> on concentration in the food industry over the course of 2010.</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":15, \"pNum\":15} --><p>At considerable risk to their livelihoods, ranchers and farmers testified to the abuses they suffered at the hands of the small number of companies to which they were forced to sell, often on unfavorable terms. In many regions, the officials heard, there were so few buyers for cattle that the big four meatpackers were able to dictate prices, impose unfair contracts and simply refuse to buy from ranchers who spoke out. Chicken farmers testified about how they had been reduced to sharecroppers by the industry’s contract system. Companies like Tyson and Perdue make farmers sign contracts under which the companies supply the chicks and feed and then decide how much to pay for the finished chickens based on secret formulas; farmers who object or who refuse any processor demands (to upgrade facilities, for example) no longer receive chicks, effectively putting them out of business. Holder, Varney and Vilsack expressed sympathy, voiced concern, vowed action and promised the farmers who came forward that they would suffer no retaliation for their testimony. Varney even offered to give one skittish chicken farmer her phone number at Justice.</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":16, \"pNum\":16} --><p>The Agriculture Department already had the authority to curb many of these abuses under the Packers and Stockyard Act of 1921, which established a powerful antitrust unit in the department now called the Grain Inspection, Packers and Stockyard Administration, or Gipsa. But Gipsa was effectively shuttered during the George W. Bush administration; dozens of farmer complaints against the meatpackers were found stuffed in a drawer, according to an <a href=\"http://washingtonmonthly.com/magazine/novdec-2012/obamas-game-of-chicken/\">article in Washington Monthly</a> by Lina Khan. In response to pressure from farmers to do something about anticompetitive practices in the meat industry, the 2008 farm bill — the gigantic piece of legislation that roughly every five years establishes the rules of the farming game in America — included a measure instructing the U.S.D.A. to issue new Gipsa rules and enforce them. In June 2010, Vilsack announced a set of regulations to “make sure the playing field is level for producers.” Specifically, the proposed rules made it easier for producers to sue packers for unfair or deceptive practices and protected them from retaliation.</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":17, \"pNum\":17} --><p>Big Meat, in particular, was not happy. It opened its wallet, spending roughly $9 million on lobbying in 2010, not including political contributions to members of the agriculture committees in Congress. One of those committees called Edward Avalos, a U.S.D.A. undersecretary, to Capitol Hill to defend the new rules in a hearing at which the poor fellow was grilled mercilessly for doing his job. (The story is well told in Christopher Leonard’s recent book, “The Meat Racket.”) Vilsack apparently got the message; he consented to postpone the new regulations. This gave the industry time to mount a “grass roots” lobbying campaign against the Gipsa rules, in which contract chicken farmers were recruited by the National Chicken Council to send Congress letters drafted by lobbyists. Vilsack, in retreat, offered to scale back the new rules to make them more palatable. But the industry would accept nothing less than complete victory: It succeeded in killing any new curbs on its market power when the House Appropriations Committee stripped funding for Gipsa enforcement from the U.S.D.A.’s spending bill for 2012. And 2013, and 2014, and 2015.</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":18, \"pNum\":18} --><p>But what about the listening tour and the public hearings? Even though the hearings had established a pattern of anticompetitive behavior, the entire antitrust effort was quietly and ignominiously dropped. No more was ever heard of it. The farmers who testified were left to fend for themselves in the marketplace. (As for dialing up Christine Varney? Forget it: She returned to private practice in 2011, seven months after the last public hearing.) Obama had launched the most serious government challenge to the power of Big Food since Teddy Roosevelt went after the Meat Trust a century ago, but in the face of opposition it simply evaporated.</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":19, \"pNum\":19} --><p><span class=\"dropcap\">A</span> case can be made that Michelle Obama, with little more at her command than the power of persuasion and her personal example, has achieved more on food issues than the rest of the administration. (It helped that she chose to focus on issues that resonated with ordinary Americans concerned about their children and did it in a voice that never sounded elitist.) Among her most meaningful accomplishments: the Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act of 2010, which she made a priority and which raised nutritional standards for the meals served in the Federal school lunch program and eliminated the sale of junk food elsewhere in the public schools. At her urging, food companies have taken steps to make their products less unhealthful. Federal nutrition guidelines have been made clearer and more sensible. And her Let’s Move campaign has raised the public’s consciousness about the importance of food to our health and well-being, which has laid the groundwork for more far-reaching reform in the future.</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":20, \"pNum\":20} --><p>In March 2010, Michelle Obama <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/remarks-first-lady-a-grocery-manufacturers-association-conference\">gave a speech</a> to the G.M.A. that surprised many of the executives in the room with its sophistication and toughness. She issued a stern challenge to Big Food, doing it in such a way as to make clear she wasn’t about to fall for the industry’s usual bag of P.R. “health” tricks. “We need you not just to tweak around the edges,” she said, “but to entirely rethink the products that you’re offering, the information that you provide about these products and how you market those products to our children.” She continued: “What it doesn’t mean is taking out one problematic ingredient only to replace it with another. While decreasing fat is certainly a good thing, replacing it with sugar and salt isn’t. And it doesn’t mean compensating for high amounts of problematic ingredients with small amounts of beneficial ones — for example, adding a little bit of vitamin C to a product with lots of sugar, or a gram of fiber to a product with tons of fat doesn’t suddenly make those products good for our kids. This isn’t about finding creative ways to market products as healthy. As you know, it’s about producing products that actually are healthy.”</p><!--NYTREF {[\"region\":\"Embedded\", \"id\":\"100000004689424\", \"dropzone\":21, \"pNum\":21]} --><p>The speech got the industry’s attention. Sean McBride, a food-industry consultant who at the time worked for the Grocery Manufacturers Association, <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/agenda/story/2016/03/michelle-obama-healthy-eating-school-lunch-food-policy-000066\">told Politico</a> about the Obamas’ concern with the food system that “you had a number of companies who were scared to death.” But according to Scott Faber, then the chief lobbyist for G.M.A., several members of his group recognized an important opportunity when Michelle Obama came calling on the industry to “step up its game.” The obesity epidemic “had put a bull’s-eye on the food industry’s back,” Faber explained. Here was a chance to remove it, with the first lady’s help.</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":22, \"pNum\":22} --><p>In response, the industry adopted a clever two-track strategy to deal with the challenge laid down by the first lady. On a very public track, industry leaders engaged the foundation that she formed, the Partnership for a Healthier America, in negotiating a series of private-sector partnerships — a series of voluntary efforts that the industry hoped would help avert new regulations — a possibility that Obama raised in her speech. Supermarket retailers pledged to promote more healthful foods in their stores, like fresh produce. A group of 16 leading food makers pledged to reduce the total number of calories in the food supply by a whopping 1.5 trillion. Food makers pledged to reduce harmful ingredients in processed food, like salt and sugar, while boosting healthy ingredients, like whole grains. In exchange for entering into these agreements, several industry partners were granted invaluable photo ops with the first lady. In the case of Subway and Walmart, she made appearances in their stores.</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":23, \"pNum\":23} --><p>Michelle Obama has celebrated these partnerships as significant achievements, but do they match the ambitions of her 2010 speech, with its call for industry to do more than “tweak around the edges” and instead to “entirely rethink the products you’re offering”? Removing unhealthful ingredients from processed foods is undeniably a good thing. Yet making junk food incrementally less junky is a dubious achievement at best. It tends to obscure the more important distinction between processed food of any kind and whole foods. What began as a cultural conversation about gardens and farmers’ markets and real food became a conversation about improved packaged foods, a shift in emphasis that surely served the interests of Big Food. While it can be argued that this was simply a concession to reality — because most Americans eat processed foods most of the time — to give up on real food so fast was to give up a lot.</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":24, \"pNum\":24} --><p>As for Big Food’s ballyhooed 2010 agreement with the first lady to remove 1.5 trillion calories from the American food supply by 2015, well, what does this even mean? Precious little, it turns out. The Healthy Weight Commitment partnership agreement stipulated an independent evaluation of the results, sponsored by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and recently completed. It concluded that total calories in the food supply were already declining by more than a trillion a year — soda sales, for example, have been plunging — and the evaluators determined that market trends would have guaranteed greater declines even in the absence of any pledge by the industry. The dean of the School of Nutrition at Tufts characterized the whole initiative as “an easily publicized but deceptive ‘sham’ pledge” and “an apparent industry charade” — at the public’s and the first lady’s expense.</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":25, \"pNum\":25} --><p><span class=\"dropcap\">E</span>ven as Big Food sought to publicly partner with the first lady in her war on obesity, it engaged in a much less visible campaign to forestall any new law or tax or regulation threatening its freedom to make and market junk food. Big Food’s biggest victory on an issue Michelle Obama cared about was its success in derailing voluntary guidelines for marketing food to kids. The proposed guidelines, which were developed by an interagency task force consisting of the Federal Trade Commission, the U.S.D.A., the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the F.D.A., set standards for salt, sugar and fat in processed foods that, if exceeded, could not be marketed to kids — at least by companies that agreed to participate in the program. The draft set of guidelines, released in April 2011, were written in such a way that several classic kids’ foods like sweetened yogurt (which can have more sugar per ounce than Coca-Cola), canned soups (many of which are sodium bombs) and even Cheerios (also full of salt) would not pass muster as currently formulated. Though the recommendations did not have the force of law, they were nevertheless anathema to industry. “The guidelines were a turning point for us,” Scott Faber told me. The G.M.A. was now prepared to directly take on the administration — and the first lady.</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":26, \"pNum\":26} --><p>At the time, the White House, spooked by the Tea Party election of 2010 (which cost the Democrats control of the House) and by charges from Republicans and business leaders that the president was unfriendly to business, had begun an effort to repair relations with corporate America. In January 2011, Bill Daley, the former commerce secretary and investment banker, was installed as a business-friendly chief of staff. That spring, the G.M.A. waged an aggressive lobbying campaign to water down the marketing guidelines, aimed at both Congress and the White House. In the months that followed, the G.M.A., along with leaders of food and media companies, was granted a meeting with Valerie Jarrett, a senior adviser to the president, in the White House to discuss the issue. Public-health advocates and congressional supporters of the guidelines were surprised that neither the first lady nor the president spoke out in support of them. “I’m upset with the White House,” Senator Tom Harkin, chairman of the Senate Health committee, told Reuters. “They went wobbly in the knees.”</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":27, \"pNum\":27} --><p>The White House had left the administration’s own interagency task force to the mercies of a Republican-controlled House, which effectively killed off the voluntary guidelines. Faber, who as the G.M.A.’s chief lobbyist helped orchestrate this rout, told me he was “frankly surprised the administration never came back with a revised set of guidelines.” Evidently the White House had lost its stomach for this particular fight.</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":28, \"pNum\":28} --><p>That wasn’t the only one, either. In the years after, Big Food scored a series of victories over even the most reasonable attempts to rein in its excesses. Remember the pledge to Iowans to regulate CAFOs (“just as any other polluter”) and stanch the flood of animal waste they were loosing on rural America? For the government to regulate CAFOs at all, it must first know where they are and how many animals they house, a survey the E.P.A. has been trying to conduct since 2008. But in July 2012, after lobbying by meat producers, the E.P.A. dropped its effort just to <em>count </em>the nation’s CAFOs.</p><!--NYTREF {[\"region\":\"Embedded\", \"id\":\"100000004683103\", \"dropzone\":29, \"pNum\":29]} --><p>Big Meat also prevailed when challenged on the misuse of antibiotics in animal agriculture — a problem that Margaret Hamburg, the F.D.A. chief, likened to having your “hair on fire,” since it is leading to antibiotic resistance and compromising the drugs we depend on. But when the F.D.A. finally acted in 2013, it came forth not with regulations but with a voluntary program, one that has so far failed to reduce the use of antibiotics in the meat industry. The food industry even managed to undermine the Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act, Michelle Obama’s signature legislation, which the Republican Congress is refusing to reauthorize.</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":30, \"pNum\":30} --><p>But perhaps we will look back on Big Food’s single most important victory during the Obama years as one it didn’t even have to break a sweat achieving, since it involved an issue on which it wasn’t even challenged. The administration undertook an ambitious campaign to tackle climate change by stringently regulating industries responsible for greenhouse gases, notably energy and transportation. For whatever reason, though, the administration chose not to confront one of the largest emitters of all: agriculture.</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":31, \"pNum\":31} --><p><strong>Yet the future</strong> of food will be decided not only in the corridors of power, but in the wider culture as well, and here Big Food has a big and growing problem — one that some of its political victories have only exacerbated. For example, the industry’s $100 million fight to stop G.M.O. labeling has pitted many food companies against the overwhelming majority of their consumers, who tell pollsters they want their food labeled. This is a most uncomfortable position for consumer-goods businesses to find themselves in, which is why many of the G.M.A. member companies sought (unsuccessfully) to hide their involvement in the fight. Battling against transparency is bound to sow seeds of distrust, potentially undermining the most precious pieces of cultural capital Big Food owns: its brands.</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":32, \"pNum\":32} --><p>These battles have exposed weaknesses in the facade of Big Food’s power, soft spots that some grass-roots food activists have recently figured out how to exploit. One example: Since the 1990s, the Coalition of Immokalee Workers has been organizing the tomato pickers of South Florida, some of the most underpaid and ill-treated workers in the country. In their decades-long quest to improve pay (by 1 cent per pound) and working conditions (until recently some Florida tomato pickers were effectively enslaved by their employers), the coalition tried every strategy in the book: labor strikes, hunger strikes, marches across the state. But the growers would not budge.</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":33, \"pNum\":33} --><p>“Then we found the unlocked door in the castle wall,” Lucas Benitez, the farmworker who helped establish the coalition, told me. “It was the corporate brand.” Instead of going after the anonymous growers and packers, who had nothing to lose by rejecting their demands, the coalition trained its sights on the Big Food brands that bought their tomatoes: McDonald’s, Burger King, Chipotle, Subway, Walmart. In 2011 the coalition drafted a Fair Food Agreement guaranteeing a raise of a penny per pound and spelling out strict new standards governing working conditions. They then pushed the big brands to sign it, using the threat of boycotts, marches on fast-food outlets, even the public shaming of top executives and their bankers. One by the one, the Big Food brands have given in, signing the agreement and, for the first time, accepting a measure of responsibility for the welfare of farmworkers at the far end of their food chain. The coalition achieved victories that never could have been achieved in Washington.</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":34, \"pNum\":34} --><p>Surely there is a lesson here for the food movement — a collection of disparate groups that seek change in food and agriculture but don’t always agree with one another on priorities. Under that big tent you will find animal rights activists who argue with sustainable farmers about meat; hunger activists who disagree with public-health advocates seeking to make soda and candy ineligible for food stamps; environmentalists who argue with sustainable cattle ranchers about climate change; and so on. To call this a movement is an act of generosity and hope. But whatever it is, it has been no match for Big Food, at least in Washington.</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":35, \"pNum\":35} --><p>Whenever the Obamas seriously poked at Big Food, they were quickly outlobbied and outgunned. Why? Because the food movement still barely exists as a political force in Washington. It doesn’t yet have the organization or the troops to light up a White House or congressional switchboard when one of its issues is at stake.</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":36, \"pNum\":36} --><p>“Show me a movement,” the president told Dan Barber, the New York chef and writer, who cooked a meal for the Obamas on the eve of the inauguration. The discussion had turned to the possibility of reforming the food system. Eight years later, it isn’t entirely clear that Obama has been shown that movement. You can see why the president might have concluded that it would have been foolhardy for his administration to get too far out ahead of the culture on food issues. And why he might have turned to Michelle Obama at that same meal and said, <em>“You</em> can talk about these issues,” as Barber recalls. “It’ll be a hell of a lot more effective than me.”</p><!--NYTREF {[\"region\":\"Embedded\", \"id\":\"100000004689449\", \"dropzone\":37, \"pNum\":37]} --><p><strong>The power of</strong> the food movement is the force of its ideas and the appeal of its aspirations — to build community, to reconnect us with nature and to nourish both our health and the health of the land. By comparison, what ideas does Big Food have? One, basically: “If you leave us alone and pay no attention to how we do it, we can produce vast amounts of acceptable food incredibly cheaply.”</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":38, \"pNum\":38} --><p>Big Food knows it has a serious story problem, and early in the administration it began an aggressive P.R. effort. The immediate impetus appears to have been the 2009 release of the Oscar-nominated documentary “Food, Inc.” (for which I was interviewed and served as a consultant). The film made the case that the entire food system, from the Midwestern monocultures of G.M.O. corn to the fast-food meals wrecking America’s health, was sorely in need of reform. In response to the film, and facing an administration that appeared sympathetic to such views, a coalition of agribusiness corporations, along with the Farm Bureau and various commodity groups got serious about defending the industrial food system and going after its critics. According to a September 2010 article in Agri-Pulse, a trade publication, not only was the industry gearing up for “a pre-emptive strike against a long list of new regulations” expected from the new administration, but, just as important, it also felt the need to confront “people like Michael Pollan.”</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":39, \"pNum\":39} --><p>“We’ve seen so many attacks,” a corn industry spokesman was quoted as saying. “We see Michael Pollan go on Oprah” — as I did after “Food, Inc.” came out. “What’s going to happen when those people ... start to have an impact in Washington on policies and regulations?” Thus spooked, a coalition of Big Ag companies and trade groups, including Monsanto, DuPont and the National Cattlemen’s Beef Association, hired Ketchum Communications, the New York P.R. firm, to organize a multimillion-dollar campaign. Ketchum promoted something called the U.S. Farmers and Ranchers Alliance, ostensibly a group of independent farmers and ranchers — though much of the funding came from agribusiness corporations — who would speak out, in public forums and on op-ed pages, to counter the writers and filmmakers who, at the time, had a big and largely uncontested microphone.</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":40, \"pNum\":40} --><p>It was around this time that some of my speaking engagements at agriculture schools began falling prey to unexpected snafus and changes in plan. An invitation to speak at Washington State University in 2009, which had organized a community read of one of my books, was suddenly withdrawn, supposedly because of a budgetary crisis but according to media reports at the behest of a wheat grower on its Board of Regents. (When a prominent alumnus, a lawyer and food-industry gadfly named Bill Marler, stepped forward offering to cover my expenses, the school abruptly reversed course.) In 2010, an invitation to speak at Cal Poly, another ag school, was transformed into a debate after a donor to the school, the chairman of the biggest cattle feedlot in California, wrote to the president of the university threatening to withdraw his gift if I was allowed to speak without challenge. The University of Wisconsin, Madison, also made my book a community read and invited me to talk about it. To protest my presence, the Wisconsin Farm Bureau bused in several hundred farmers from across the state, all of them wearing the same T-shirt, printed with the legend “In Defense of Farmers.” Only the fabled niceness of Midwesterners saved me from a hail of rotten tomatoes that night.</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":41, \"pNum\":41} --><p>Surely Big Food was overreacting to the threat posed by a handful of writers and filmmakers, yet the fact that they did suggests that, behind the industry’s wall of political power, there indeed lurks a vulnerability. That vulnerability is the conscience of the American eater, who in the past decade or so has taken a keen interest in the question of where our food comes from, how it is produced and the impact of our everyday food choices on the land, on the hands that feed us, on the animals we eat and, increasingly, on the climate. Though still a minority, the eaters who care about these questions have come to distrust Big Food and reject what it is selling. Looking for options better aligned with their values, they have created, purchase by purchase, a $50 billion alternative food economy, comprising organic food, local food and artisanal food. Call it Little Food. And while it is still tiny in comparison with Big Food, it is nevertheless the fastest-growing sector of the food economy.</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":42, \"pNum\":42} --><p>While Big Food can continue to forestall change in Washington, that strategy simply will not succeed in the marketplace. There, Big Food is struggling to adapt to a rapidly shifting landscape it cannot control. That’s why it’s gobbling up organic and artisanal brands, hoping to learn the secret of their success — which, of course, is simply that they understand and respect the values of the new food consumer better than Big Food does. Some large food companies are voluntarily changing their practices in response to the concerns of these consumers, whether about antibiotics, animal welfare or the welfare of farmworkers. One future of food politics may lie in grass-roots campaigns targeted not at politicians in Washington but directly at Big Food and its consumers, taking aim at its Achilles’ heel: those precious brands.</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":43, \"pNum\":43} --><p>For all the disappointments, the Obamas deserve credit for celebrating and nourishing Little Food. If nothing else, the spotlight of their attention helped elevate the idea of food as something worthy of public attention. As the Obamas prepare to leave the White House, Big Food can congratulate itself on retaining its political grip on Washington. It seems very unlikely that the next occupant of the White House is going to pose as stiff a challenge. Donald Trump professes to love fast food, and Hillary Clinton has longstanding ties to Big Food: Tyson was one of Bill Clinton’s first political patrons, and as a lawyer in Arkansas, Hillary Clinton served on the board at Walmart. (Though as a New York senator, she worked hard on behalf of small upstate farmers, so perhaps there is hope.) But like Goliath, Big Food can’t afford to be complacent about its size or power, not when the culture of food is shifting underfoot. Perhaps it is a sign of things to come that Scott Faber, the lobbyist who helped the industry navigate the first Obama administration, has left the G.M.A. to work for the Environmental Working Group, where he now plies his skills on behalf of the food movement’s David. Politics and policy in Washington seldom move before the larger culture does, but when that happens, it can sweep away everything in its path — Goliath included.</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":44, \"pNum\":44} --><p><em>Michael Pollan is a contributing writer and the Knight professor of journalism at U.C.

They had been summoned to report to Paul Bakus, an executive at Nestlé. This team had developed DiGiorno pizza for Kraft, and came along when Nestlé bought Kraft’s frozen-food business in January of that year. Nestlé is known for its chocolate Crunch bars, of course, but it makes all sorts of food: frozen meals, bottled water, bouillon cubes, Hot Pockets, instant noodles, baby food and dog food. It is, in fact, the world’s largest food company. But unless Stouffer’s French Bread Pizza counts, Nestlé didn’t make pizza in the United States at that time. Bakus was new to pizza, too. He had done a tour of duty at Nestlé’s Swiss headquarters before he was sent home to head the American baked-goods division. From there, he was transferred to run the frozen-pizza business from Solon, a suburb of Cleveland where Nestlé develops all its frozen foods.</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":1, \"pNum\":1} --><p>DiGiorno, the line Kraft created in 1995, became a market leader for its “rising crust,” which, unlike other frozen pizza crusts, started raw and rose in the oven. The crust was the centerpiece of DiGiorno’s pitch to consumers: that it could pass for delivery. But now that DiGiorno was a Nestlé product, it would have to be brought into compliance with Nestlé’s nutritional standards. Bakus was sent to Chicago to talk about sodium.</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":2, \"pNum\":2} --><p>Sodium is in pretty much everything we eat, in part because it tastes good and in part because it’s an effective and cheap preservative. Some 75 percent of the salt in our diets comes from packaged and restaurant food, leaving just about 25 percent under most people’s control. Many public-health officials say the single most important thing we can do to fight heart disease — still the country’s leading killer — is cut back on sodium. In June, the Food and Drug Administration released new preliminary guidelines for reducing sodium that it urged food makers to follow. As of now, the rules do not have the force of law. But food makers have seen the writing on the wall for some time.</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":3, \"pNum\":3} --><p>Ahead of the day when guidelines become mandatory reductions, these companies have for years been working on systematically lowering the sodium in their products. Kraft did. Mars and Campbell’s did, too. Walmart reformulated its private-label line with an across-the-board 25 percent sodium reduction. For any company, however, this long-term strategy brings with it near-term risk: Consumers associate low sodium with less flavor, and they tend to avoid products touting it.</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":4, \"pNum\":4} --><p>At the same time, Bakus’s competition was cutting away at frozen pizza’s main advantage over delivery: convenience. Domino’s has been investing in technology, shortening delivery times with Uber-influenced algorithms. The company has even outfitted delivery trucks with ovens so they can muscle through traffic while cooking their cargo.</p><!--NYTREF {[\"region\":\"Embedded\", \"id\":\"100000004689464\", \"dropzone\":5, \"pNum\":5]} --><p>Frozen pizza had to adapt — something everyone in the room knew perfectly well, they told Bakus. They’d been trying. But pizza is tricky. In the sauce, salt is there for taste and can be turned up or down at will. In cheese and sausage, it’s part of traditional preservation that became encased in the F.D.A.’s “standards of identity,” which determine what manufacturers are allowed to say about ingredients on labels. Take out too much salt, and they might have to call their provolone something like “cheese product.”</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":6, \"pNum\":6} --><p>The problem, the team told Bakus, is that on top of the meat and cheese — considerable in DiGiorno’s three-meat pizzas and cheese-stuffed crusts — the dough had higher-than-usual amounts of sodium. Packaged bread, in which sodium is used for texture and preservation more than for flavor, is one of the greatest sources of salt in the American diet. In the DiGiorno’s crust, the higher-than-usual sodium came from the baking powder Kraft used to make the dough rise. The DiGiorno food scientists had managed to create a pepperoni pizza with 10 percent less sodium, already something of a feat. Bakus thought they’d done fine: At a tasting, he couldn’t tell the difference between the original and the reduced-sodium version. But pepperoni loyalists could.</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":7, \"pNum\":7} --><p>The chief requirement for reformulating a beloved product is to change it imperceptibly, so that in blind tastings customers prefer the new version to rival products or to the old version. (Nestlé’s rule is that six in 10 people must prefer an item in blind tastings before it is cleared for production.) And once a reformulated food passes the test, companies often avoid saying anything on the label or in advertisements about the nutritional improvements — especially when it comes to salt. Most people don’t think they need to cut back on sodium. Better to say nothing. It’s known in the trade as “stealth health.”</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":8, \"pNum\":8} --><p>Big food makers are pinned between two groups with overlapping interests. One is consumers looking to improve their health, many of whom have long been deeply suspicious of big food companies, and are even more so today. The other is public-health officials and regulators who are willing to force companies to make bigger changes than they might want to, before they might want to. Do too much, and they’ll lose their customers; do nothing, and they’ll keep making money — but risk losing a future lawsuit. Nestlé and its competitors are busily trying to figure out a way to split the difference. But can frozen pizza really be expected to improve the health of the American public? And will anyone want to eat it if it does?</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":9, \"pNum\":9} --><p><strong>Your taste for</strong> salt is not hard-wired from birth. The excessive amount we eat today is a result of what Matthias Berninger, vice president of public affairs for Mars, calls an “arms race” between food producers and restaurant chains. One turns up the salt; customers get used to that; the next producer does the same thing. Over time, the whole population’s palate changes. Today Americans consume two to three times the sodium we need, and one in three Americans suffers from high blood pressure, which can lead to heart disease — which can lead to the grave.</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":10, \"pNum\":10} --><p>Some public-health advocates think lessening Americans’ dependence on sodium will be easier than doing the same with sugar — in large part because it won’t require weaning an entire nation off soda. It takes only days or weeks to recalibrate your palate. Making that happen for the American public means negotiating, essentially, a new arms treaty. Marion Nestle (no relation to the company), a professor of nutrition and food studies at New York University and one of the fiercest and most lucid critics of the food industry, believes that food companies and restaurant chains could play a role in fixing the problem they’ve created. “The trick is to get the makers of processed and pre-prepared foods to agree to gradually reduce the amount of salt in their products,” she says. “If everyone did that, nobody would notice.”</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":11, \"pNum\":11} --><p>Thomas Frieden, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, recently published <a href=\"http://jama.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleID=2527053\">a paper</a> in The Journal of the American Medical Association calling for more companies to agree to voluntary sodium-reduction targets. Frieden is no stranger to this sort of crusade: He led the charge against trans fats for Mayor Michael Bloomberg while he was New York City’s health commissioner. His article points to British data showing that a 15 percent reduction in sodium intake from 2003 to 2011, a result of voluntary targets Britain set in 2003, was followed by a 40 percent reduction in deaths from ischemic heart disease and stroke. “Sodium reduction,” he told me, “could save hundreds of thousands of lives and billions of dollars in health care costs.”</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":12, \"pNum\":12} --><p>These kinds of recommendations were given heft in June when the F.D.A. released its sodium guidelines. “We’ve used educational strategies for years,” says Susan Mayne, director of the F.D.A.’s Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition. “But we found that education alone is not sufficient.” The F.D.A. recognizes that, as with any arms-reduction deal, all parties need assurance that other parties are following the rules, too, so the agency aims to coax the sodium out of our diet slowly. It knows that every company thinking about lowering sodium has Campbell’s in its rearview mirror.</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":13, \"pNum\":13} --><p>Campbell’s is the cautionary tale of what can happen when a company gets ahead of the competition. For years, it has wanted to demonstrate its commitment to public health, and its core product, canned soup, was a fat target for sodium reduction. Baseline levels of salt are generally so high that they’re easy to make a big dent in. And with canned soup, you can do so without worrying about, say, a deflated crust. So in 2010, Campbell’s reduced its soups’ sodium by as much as 45 percent. Tip-off on the label or not — only some reductions were announced — customers didn’t buy more. The salt went back in.</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":14, \"pNum\":14} --><p>Another reason to keep quiet about sodium reduction is the efforts of some groups to dispute recommended levels. No sooner had the F.D.A. reduced its guidelines than the Salt Institute, a trade organization “dedicated to advocating the many benefits of salt,” put out a news release lamenting the “government’s war on salt,” calling it “malpractice” and pointing to numerous studies indicating the risks, not benefits, of lowering sodium consumption. (Frieden has said that those studies had “fundamental flaws.”)</p><!--NYTREF {[\"region\":\"Embedded\", \"id\":\"100000004683324\", \"dropzone\":15, \"pNum\":15]} --><p>Nestlé and other multinationals have decided to tune out in-country noise and look at the big picture, for which they look to the World Health Organization. “A lot of the food industry wants to follow not-excellent but self-serving information,” Berninger, of Mars, says. “We believe the best and most profitable way forward is to stop the constant bickering. Just pick targets to meet.”</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":16, \"pNum\":16} --><p>Bakus was feeling the pressure. At a Nestlé gathering of health experts in 2013, William Dietz, then focusing on obesity reduction at the Centers for Disease Control, pulled Bakus aside to say that pizza was a nutritional train wreck — the single greatest source of sodium for children ages 6 to 18. A paper Dietz later published in Pediatrics, the official journal of the American Academy of Pediatrics, associates pizza with higher caloric and saturated fat intake as well as higher sodium in children’s diets. Bakus told me that running Nestlé’s pizza business made him feel as if he were walking around with a bull’s-eye on his back.</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":17, \"pNum\":17} --><p><span class=\"dropcap\">T</span>he Nestlé R.&amp;D. lab is on a subterranean floor of the campuslike research center in the hills above Lausanne, Switzerland. It looks more like a sterile medical-research lab than a kitchen. But the smells are not medicinal: deep mushroom-broth and fermented-fish odors mingling with unidentifiable but sharp, acidic, vinegary scents. When I visited several years ago, the company was already deep into what it calls its “kitchen cupboard” project, trying to cut out unpronounceable ingredients and build flavors without scary-sounding chemicals and hillocks of salt. I had recently visited David Chang’s test kitchen for his Momofuku restaurants, where cooks were making variations on traditional fish sauce for new sauces, and the Nordic Food Lab, started with the Copenhagen restaurant Noma, where I saw racks and racks of koji, the mold that ferments rice to sake, being used to flavor all manner of grains.</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":18, \"pNum\":18} --><p>By now, fermentation has become a very fashionable flavor-creation trick among chefs. Nestlé’s scientists hoped it could lead to substitutes for the dough conditioners they use to make their crust rise, which are not only bad for flavor but also have names that look particularly menacing on labels. Sean Westcott, an energetic Australian who was then in charge of frozen and chilled foods, told me about a barley particularly rich in enzymes, which the company is using to ferment pizza dough — helping it rise and create flavors at the same time, and removing acres of syllables from the label.</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":19, \"pNum\":19} --><p>Nestlé was also toying with potassium chloride, a compound similar to sodium chloride — table salt. Jeff Hamilton, president of Nestlé’s United States prepared-foods division, told me that it gives most people the sensation of saltiness, with the added advantage of supplying potassium, a mineral many Americans don’t get enough of. The problem is that a subset of the population perceives potassium chloride as bitter or metallic. And “potassium chloride” doesn’t exactly have a kitchen-cupboard ring to it. Nestlé is encouraging the F.D.A. to call it “mineral salt (potassium)” on labels.</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":20, \"pNum\":20} --><p>When the DiGiorno team told Bakus they’d gone as far as they could to reduce sodium without having customers notice, and failed, he knew they needed to find out what was going on in the research-center labs and at Nestlé’s pizza businesses in other countries. So he took the team to Germany, Italy and Switzerland to learn new tricks. Within a year and a half of the initial discouraging tasting, the first reduced-sodium DiGiorno went on the market — with no mention of the reduction. I tried several varieties in Solon during a wide-ranging tasting. For the most part, I found them a little too salty; but that’s just what people are used to.</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":21, \"pNum\":21} --><p>There is, however, a larger problem with the American diet that lowering sodium cannot address: portion size. Frozen pizza is a particularly menacing vector for overeating. Chavanne Hanson, head of nutrition, health and wellness in global public affairs at the Swiss headquarters, says that customers know that candy and ice cream are occasional treats. They don’t tend to eat too much of it at one sitting — or are conscious of indulging when they do. Pizzas are different. They’re big, and they’re inviting. It’s easy to take one more slice, and then another. “There’s staggering social- media chatter on pizza,” says Mary Colleen Hershey, who monitors online discussion of company products for Nestlé. “You can’t believe how many people will admit they eat a whole pizza.”</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":22, \"pNum\":22} --><p>With Bakus’s encouragement, Hanson began a “portion guidance” program, telling customers to eat less of its product on the back of the package. The graphics on the package show what one-sixth of a pizza looks like — about the size of a hand put over the pie as you cut a wedge, an easy mnemonic — and tell people to eat one slice for dinner and no more. “Our surefire recommendation,” the company’s guidance reads, is one slice “along with a salad, roasted vegetables, fresh fruit and a glass of water or low-fat milk.” Well, it’s a nice thought.</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":23, \"pNum\":23} --><p>Such a civilized dinner might be an unlikely choice for the throngs who still think one pizza is one serving. And frozen pizza is an unlikely solution to the vast and intertwined set of problems in our diet. But it’s a start. Food makers’ relentless advertising and bloated products, full of unnecessary sugar and salt, contributed to many of the incredibly expensive chronic illnesses our health care system has been left to deal with. Lowering those costs might mean depending on big food companies and restaurant chains to clean up the mess they’ve helped create. Even their biggest critic agrees.

At 6 o’clock that morning, he would be starting his first shift at Quality Pork Processors, part of the Hormel Foods complex in Austin, Minn., almost an hour’s drive down Interstate 90 from his rented apartment in Rochester. He’d applied for the job on the meatpacking line barely a week earlier and was still mentally preparing for it. “When you’re in the car,” he told me recently, “you have to go over everything again.” He had to remember his story: where he was from, why he was there. He had to remind himself what he could and couldn’t say. He was going to be meeting a lot of new people that day, and it would be essential not to arouse suspicions.</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":1, \"pNum\":1} --><p>Just before the exit off the Interstate, Jay passed an illuminated billboard for Austin’s Spam Museum: “FIND SALIVATION.” He steered down the winding road along the plant perimeter, past the high wall guarding the loading docks, until he came to the Q.P.P. employee entrance on Hormel Century Parkway. The factory was already enveloped in steam; overnight cleaning crews had hosed down the stainless-steel cutting line, and now the compound’s six-story hydrostatic Spam cooker was warming for the day shift. The steam billowed and swirled in the lights of the plant. Jay shuffled into the line of workers making their way through the employee turnstile. He swiped in and headed through the glass doors to where the day’s freshly laundered uniforms were being handed out, color-coded according to department.</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":2, \"pNum\":2} --><p>“What station?” the person at the window asked.</p><p>“Gam table,” Jay said. His job would be slicing open the rear legs of hog carcasses, loosening the tendons of the trotters and inserting a gambrel. “It looks like a clothes hanger, but with hook tips that point up,” he told me. The gambrel attaches to a trolley that carries the carcass on a chain conveyor system as it is broken down into “primal cuts,” before being sent to the Hormel Foods side of the plant for final processing and packaging.</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":3, \"pNum\":4} --><p>Jay knew that the job would be physically grueling. To keep up with the speed of the line, a carcass had to be cut and hung in about six seconds. But more than that, it was going to be psychologically — even morally — taxing for him. Jay had been a vegetarian since he was in college. He couldn’t say why he quit eating meat, really, only that he always loved animals and that his vegetarian younger sister convinced him.</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":4, \"pNum\":5} --><p>But in recent years, Jay’s commitment had grown. He became a vegan. When he was online, he found himself drifting toward websites of animal rights groups, pulling up footage of abuse shot by undercover investigators. One day it occurred to him that he should try to find such work. On a job site, he found an opening at Compassion Over Killing, or C.O.K., an advocacy group intent on ending cruelty to animals in agriculture and promoting vegetarianism. And just like that, he entered the shadowy world of undercover video activism, where no one around you knows whom you really work for and few people, not even your family and friends, know where you are or what you’re doing for months at a stretch. (To protect his identity, Jay uses only his middle name when speaking to reporters.)</p><!--NYTREF {[\"region\":\"Embedded\", \"id\":\"100000004683234\", \"dropzone\":5, \"pNum\":6]} --><p>Now, as Jay dressed in the locker room, put on a hard hat and picked up gloves in the equipment room, he could feel a weight descend on him. Once you’re inside, he said, you realize how alone you are. “You’re going to be out there pretty much by yourself,” he told me. “You’re going to be working these really long hours and seeing animal abuse on a day-to-day basis.”</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":6, \"pNum\":7} --><p>His manager at C.O.K. had warned him that it would be months before he could transfer to the kill side of the plant, where live animals are handled, and weeks more before he would have enough video to complete the investigation. Every day for five or maybe six months, Jay would have to walk past posters reminding employees that all cameras were strictly prohibited inside the plant and to immediately report any suspicious individual, even if that person was a co-worker. The isolation and paranoia can be consuming, he said, coloring every sidelong glance, every passing conversation. “It’s definitely something that’s always there in the back of your mind,” Jay told me. “When you’re talking to people, you really have to just focus on who you’re supposed to be.”</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":7, \"pNum\":8} --><p><span class=\"dropcap\">W</span>hen picking among shrink-wrapped packages in the meat aisle of your local grocery, it’s remarkable how little information you’re provided about the steak, pork chop or chicken breast inside. The label tells you the particular cut, its weight and the price per pound, but store brands almost never give even basic information about how that animal was raised. In December, Congress repealed its country-of-origin labeling requirements for beef and pork, so now meatpackers don’t identify where the animal came from. Beef commands a premium if it is labeled “grass-fed” or “naturally raised,” but the Department of Agriculture withdrew oversight of those terms in January and no longer verifies such claims. Even in cases where the U.S.D.A. does certify labels, the rules can be slippery. The term “humanely raised,” for example, has no standard definition, and the U.S.D.A. does not conduct site visits to confirm enforcement for those approved to use the label.</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":8, \"pNum\":9} --><p>Amid such dwindling transparency and oversight, animal rights activists, once regarded as the radical fringe, have taken on a somewhat unlikely role as consumer watchdogs. Trading provocations (splattering fur-wearing models with fake blood) for middle-ground strategies (“Meatless Monday”), they are drawing the attention of not only shoppers concerned about humane animal handling but also food-safety advocates and environmental groups who worry about the ecological impact of large-scale meat production. The principal tool of this public-relations effort has been daring hidden-camera footage, released in slickly edited videos that aim to shock consumers about what really happens on the production line.</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":9, \"pNum\":10} --><p>Undercover investigations of the American meat industry go back at least as far as the early 20th century, when Upton Sinclair lived in the Packingtown section of Chicago, gathering material for his classic muckraking novel, “The Jungle.” During his two months there, Sinclair made several visits to the Armour slaughterhouse, which he rendered in vivid detail. Sinclair had hoped to arouse public outcry over the treatment of workers; instead, readers were horrified by the unsanitary conditions in which their meat was slaughtered and butchered. J.Ogden Armour publicly denounced the book, declaring, “Not one atom of any condemned animal or carcass finds its way, directly or indirectly, from any source, into any food product or food ingredient.” Sinclair responded with a letter addressed to President Theodore Roosevelt: “I saw with my own eyes hams, which had spoiled in pickle, being pumped full of chemicals to destroy the odor. ... I saw hogs which had died of cholera in shipment, being loaded into box cars to be taken to a place called Globe, in Indiana, to be rendered into lard.”</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":10, \"pNum\":11} --><p>Roosevelt demanded that Congress pass immediate reforms. The Federal Meat Inspection Act of 1906 mandated adherence to new sanitary standards and the presence of federal inspectors to enforce these rules. Any product that failed to meet the new standard was to be condemned.</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":11, \"pNum\":12} --><p>The strength of these reforms, combined with consumer eagerness for cheap meat during the hard times of <a href=\"http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/g/great_depression_1930s/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier\" title=\"Recent and archival news about the Great Depression.\" class=\"meta-classifier\">the Great Depression</a> and food rationing of World War II, ushered in a golden age for the industry. Meat sales soared, workers’ wages climbed and the industry engaged consumers in a new spirit of openness and transparency. As late as 1965, a business like George A. Hormel &amp; Company was advertising public tours of its plants. The company even produced a half-hour educational film called “This Is ... Hormel,” showing four farm boys and their father on a tour of the Austin slaughterhouse. “From balconies,” the narrator says, “you can look across entire rooms of assembly — or rather disassembly — activity.”</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":12, \"pNum\":13} --><p>All that started to change in the 1970s, as the meatpacking industry mechanized and moved away from skilled labor. Confined animal-feeding operations, commonly known as “factory farms,” were born and sustained by the intensified production of crops like corn and soybeans for feed. By the Reagan era, Americans had fallen in love with microwaveable food, frozen food and especially fast food. The number of McDonald’s franchises, as just one metric, had grown from fewer than 150 stores in 1959 to more than 11,000 in 1990.</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":13, \"pNum\":14} --><p>In this new climate, the industry began to manage its image as aggressively as it had begun to manage its animals. Large producers successfully lobbied Congress to create a “checkoff” program, which imbued private industry with the power, via the U.S.D.A., to collect a percentage of all beef and pork sales to be used for the general promotion of eating meat. But the bill also included language from meat producers, specifying that “despite the fact that many of our members may produce a commodity that is the subject of governmental price supports, we are opposed to increased government intervention or regulation.” Thus began an era in which U.S.D.A. officials began to view themselves as partnering with industry, rather than monitoring it.</p><!--NYTREF {[\"region\":\"Embedded\", \"id\":\"100000004689530\", \"dropzone\":14, \"pNum\":15]} --><p>Soon groups like People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, which had focused almost exclusively on abuses of laboratory animals and anti-fur campaigns, decided to begin conducting their own sorts of inspections. C.O.K. scored an important victory when its investigators videotaped chickens crowded, sometimes eight per crate, into rows of wire cages stacked at a barn owned by I.S.E. America, which sold eggs with the industry-created Animal Care Certified seal. C.O.K. filed a Better Business Bureau challenge to that self-certification and eventually won. I.S.E. dropped the label.</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":15, \"pNum\":16} --><p>The North American Meat Institute, the lobbying group representing most of the country’s largest meat companies, complains that consumers are being misled by animal rights activists, who, they say, are not simply encouraging consumers to reduce meat consumption but are also opposing consumers’ right to eat meat, cheese and dairy, all as part of what one headline on the institute’s website called “the liberal vegan agenda.” Mike Wolf, the manager of C.O.K.’s undercover investigations, doesn’t deny that animal rights organizations are trying to persuade consumers “to move toward a plant-based diet,” but he insists that meatpackers are the ones who have created the necessity for undercover investigations by blocking consumers from seeing how their food is made. With the government working hand in hand with business, the only remaining window into the food system is the lens of an activist’s camera.</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":16, \"pNum\":17} --><p>Exposing the industry’s standard practices, Wolf argues, generates a demand for change from legislators and, perhaps more significant, from major restaurant chains. In 2012, for instance, after the Humane Society of the United States released undercover footage of pregnant sows immobilized for months in narrow “gestation crates” at a Smithfield Foods subsidiary, McDonald’s announced that its breakfast sausage would no longer be made from pork bred in gestation crates — and Smithfield, along with other major pork producers, raced to announce that it was phasing the devices out. The industry opposes undercover investigations, Wolf says, precisely because they work.</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":17, \"pNum\":18} --><p><strong>When Jay arrived</strong> in Minnesota, he wasn’t specifically targeting Quality Pork Processors. He applied for jobs at several plants, and Q.P.P., which sends all the fresh meat it processes to the Hormel Food Corporation in another part of the complex in Austin, was simply the first to call him back. But once he got the offer, Mike Wolf let him know that this wasn’t just any meatpacking plant. It was one of only five pork packinghouses nationwide where the U.S.D.A. was experimenting with a controversial new form of oversight. Introduced in 1999, the program — called Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points-Based Inspection Models Project, or HIMP — replaced traditional manual inspection with a “risk based” approach. Meat-industry managers would hire their own quality-assurance auditors to identify and remove obviously sick or defective animals from the line before they reached government inspection stations, and employees from the U.S.D.A.’s Food Safety and Inspection Service would instead focus their efforts on more sophisticated microbiological testing in places where contamination was most likely to occur.</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":18, \"pNum\":19} --><p>The U.S.D.A. called HIMP a “hog-slaughter modernization” program that allows the F.S.I.S. to perform more inspections, but activists contend that the program is less about modernization than it is about reducing government oversight in order to increase production speed and therefore profits.</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":19, \"pNum\":20} --><p>In May 2013, two years before Jay went undercover in Austin, the inspector general’s office for the U.S.D.A. issued a stinging critique of HIMP. Three HIMP plants had made it into the top 10 for food-safety violations out of 616 pork-processing plants nationwide. Such numbers, it reported, represented “a systemic failure” that should have resulted in more aggressive enforcement action or even a halt in production. In 2014, though, the U.S.D.A. not only approved the continuation of the HIMP pilot project but also called for a review to determine if the program “could be applied to additional establishments.” In January 2015, the Government Accountability Project, a nonprofit whistle-blower-protection organization, released affidavits from four federal inspectors from HIMP facilities attesting to food-safety violations. A U.S.D.A. spokesman dismissed them as being “part of a well-funded and organized public-relations campaign.”</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":20, \"pNum\":21} --><p>In Jay’s time at the gam table, he shot video of numerous hogs with obvious fecal contamination being processed for food. In one sequence, Jay cuts into the hind legs of four different carcasses, and pus-filled abscesses under the skin pour forth a brownish-green ooze or spray clear liquid across the workstation. Though the footage Jay collected at the gam table was disgusting, the U.S.D.A. says procedures were in place to ensure that the infected tissue was removed farther down the line.</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":21, \"pNum\":22} --><p>Jay was eager to move to the live-animal area, where he could see how hogs were treated in a part of the plant where U.S.D.A. inspectors had been virtually replaced by Q.P.P.—hired quality-assurance auditors. Once Jay had enough seniority, he bid on a transfer to the station known as “stick, stun and shackle,” where pigs are shocked to death, drained of their blood and shackled to the conveyance chain.</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":22, \"pNum\":23} --><p>Almost immediately after Jay was transferred, he saw — and was able to record — multiple instances of behavior that seemed far out of compliance with U.S.D.A. rules for the humane treatment of livestock. (Q.P.P. maintains that he never reported any of that behavior to supervisors, as was his duty.) He filmed a hog being hit in the face with plastic rattle paddles and electrically prodded on the head. He filmed another hog being repeatedly beaten then rolled and pushed by its hindquarters. He filmed hogs having their throats slit while still alive and — in one particularly harrowing sequence — appeared to capture a hog struggling to right itself in its shackle as it is carried toward processing. A spokesman for Q.P.P. said all the hogs “had been properly rendered insensible,” but the video itself seems to contradict that claim. At one point, a worker shouts over the din of machinery and squealing pigs: “Too many sensibles. If U.S.D.A. is around, they could shut us down.” Because of HIMP reductions, however, the U.S.D.A. wasn’t around.</p><!--NYTREF {[\"region\":\"Embedded\", \"id\":\"100000004683192\", \"dropzone\":23, \"pNum\":24]} --><p>In October 2015, when Compassion Over Killing put out a news release and a five-minute video made from Jay’s footage, the story was national news. “The actions depicted in the video under review are appalling and completely unacceptable,” said Adam Tarr, a U.S.D.A. spokesman. Q.P.P. said that, before the release of the video, it reprimanded the worker — Jay — who cut into the pus-filled abscesses for departing from company procedure and would now reprimand another employee for aggressive behavior and would introduce “corrective measures” to improve animal handling.</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":24, \"pNum\":25} --><p>In January 2016, Representatives Rosa DeLauro of Connecticut and Louise Slaughter of New York led a bipartisan group of 60 members of Congress urging the U.S.D.A. to delay proceeding further with HIMP until the U.S.D.A. could provide evidence that it is an effective program. The very next day, the U.S.D.A.’s Office of Investigation, Enforcement and Audit closed its inquiry into the plant. “The actions depicted in the video occurred at times when U.S.D.A. inspection personnel were not performing verifications,” a letter from the U.S.D.A. to C.O.K., in response to the beatings, reads. “Had these actions been observed by F.S.I.S. inspectors, they would have resulted in immediate regulatory action against the plant.” But because these actions were not directly observed by U.S.D.A. inspectors, the department could only demand that Q.P.P. document how it would improve animal handling.</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":25, \"pNum\":26} --><p>Mike Wolf was exasperated: “How can you say, ‘If we were there to see it, we would have done something,’ on one hand, and on the other hand say, ‘O.K., well, we’re going to pass this [rule] now so that we’re not going to be able to see anything’?”</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":26, \"pNum\":27} --><p><span class=\"dropcap\">A</span>s video activists push harder, the industry is pushing back, against not just activists but also journalists and whistle-blowers, with laws to prosecute a new kind of crime: “animal-facility interference.”</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":27, \"pNum\":28} --><p>In 2011, State Representative Annette Sweeney of Iowa introduced H.F.431, a bill that sought to make it illegal to produce, possess or distribute any record of “a visual or audio experience occurring at [an] animal facility.” Sweeney, a former executive director of the Iowa Angus Association, wrote the bill at her kitchen table with input from lawyers for the Iowa Poultry Association. The law that eventually passed, H.B. 589, makes it a crime only to give a false name on a job application, but the intention was clear.</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":28, \"pNum\":29} --><p>Since then, four more states have passed similar measures, known collectively as “ag gag,” with each law more ambitious than the last. Last year, for example, legislators in North Carolina, still the largest hog producer in the United States, passed an anti-whistle-blower law that gives businesses the authority to sue any person, including employees, who have accessed nonpublic areas of the workplace in order to document company lawbreaking. Wyoming passed a law that makes it a crime to “preserve information in any form” about any “private land” if you intend to share the data with the federal government — potentially shielding cattle ranchers from being cited by the Environmental Protection Agency for polluting state waterways.</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":29, \"pNum\":30} --><p>Wolf told me that the industry response over the last decade has made him think hard about the limits of undercover videos. While the camera may expose inhumane or unappetizing actions at a place like Quality Pork Processors, it doesn’t capture the corporate higher-up who demanded increased production, the industrial engineer who came up with a work flow to make it happen, the union boss who approved the speedup or the floor supervisor who berates workers who fail to keep pace. The hidden cameras carried by undercover investigators provide our only view onto the meatpacking industry, but they are a pinhole, not a panorama.</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":30, \"pNum\":31} --><p>As such, the view is imperfect — and, the meat industry says, distorted. But its best defense from the animal rights activists may be simply to reinstate the power of the government-led transparency that we had in the mid-20th century. If companies like Hormel feel that they have been misrepresented, they might do better seeking more transparency, not less.</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":31, \"pNum\":32} --><p><em>Ted Genoways is a writer whose book “This Blessed Earth: A Year in the Life of an American Farm” will be published next year by W.W.

She propped open the lid to show off a muted array of gray, tan, mauve, pale purple and sickly pink chocolate nuggets. Each attenuated shade was the disappointing outcome of an early attempt by Mars to replace a bright, artificial dye with natural pigments extracted from algae, roots, seeds and other parts of plants. Not a single piece of candy in this tackle box of failure looked edible — let alone tempting.</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":1, \"pNum\":1} --><p>Noticeably absent was any M&amp;M that even vaguely resembled blue, the most coveted, and hardest to find, of colors. Blue is a rarity among plants and animals. When it does occur in nature, it often isn’t <em>truly</em> blue, but rather a trick of diffraction, or the scattering of light, which is the case for bird feathers, sky, ice, water and iridescent butterfly wings. A blueberry is actually more red than blue when you mash it. “Unfortunately, you can’t just grind up a peacock feather,” said Robbins, a petite woman with a Ph.D. in organic chemistry and the empathic, wide-set blue eyes of a small-town bartender, with what sounded like genuine regret.</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":2, \"pNum\":2} --><p>The Mars research kitchen lacks many of the familiar accouterments of a home kitchen and is really more of a laboratory. Located at the North American headquarters of Mars Chocolate in Hackettstown, N.J., it adjoins a huge manufacturing facility that makes half the country’s M&amp;M supply; when I visited at the end of July, the place was already months into its pre-Halloween production frenzy. In response to growing pressure from consumers across the globe, Mars announced in February that over the next five years it would remove artificial colors from all the processed foods it makes for human consumption, and that pigments found in natural substances would take their place. This research kitchen is where scientists are now cautiously tinkering with the chemistry of some of America’s most celebrated candies.</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":3, \"pNum\":3} --><p>Mars has joined a growing list of global food manufacturers removing artificial dyes from some or all of their products. The companies include Nestlé USA, General Mills, Kraft, Frito-Lay, Campbell’s, Kellogg’s and Mondelez International (the maker of Oreos, Tang and Sour Patch Kids). The orange glow of Kraft’s revamped macaroni and cheese now comes from paprika, turmeric and annatto, a coloring extracted from tree seeds. General Mills experimented with 69 different natural dyes before it released a naturally colored Trix and six other reconfigured cereals in January. (The company was unable to find a workable blue or green, so those colors have been left out for now.)</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":4, \"pNum\":4} --><p>In 2013, the Food and Drug Administration approved Mars’s petition to use the microscopic algae spirulina to make the first natural blue dye approved for use in the United States. As a result, any food manufacturer in the country can legally use spirulina as a colorant. Mars spent years researching spirulina’s safety; in order to overhaul 1,700 or so recipes and update its global manufacturing capabilities, the company desperately needs a substitute for synthetic Blue No. 1, as does the rest of the industry. But right now, there isn’t nearly enough spirulina dye to go around — and in any case, sometimes it doesn’t yield just the right blue, or the color degrades and comes out blotchy, or it tastes odd. So researchers are still looking everywhere for other natural blue pigments. Among the contenders being tested in laboratories are a berry found in Central and South America, the huito, traditionally used to make dark blue, semi-permanent ceremonial tattoos and as a bug repellent; a blue gardenia flower; red cabbage; aged red wine; a bacteria used to make Swiss cheese; the Japanese kusagi berry; butterfly-pea flowers; and pigments derived from soil bacteria, tree-root fungi, sea sponges and mushrooms. With funding from PepsiCo, another business expanding its use of natural colors, a University of Illinois grad student in pharmacognosy (the study of medicinal substances found in nature), who has spent several years searching for new blues, recently found a previously unknown blue pigment in algae growing in a hot spring in Yellowstone National Park.</p><!--NYTREF {[\"region\":\"Embedded\", \"id\":\"100000004683143\", \"dropzone\":5, \"pNum\":5]} --><p>Many colors have well-established natural-dye alternatives: orange from beta-carotene, for example, or yellow from turmeric, a mainstay in curry. Robbins has spent seven years studying the molecular structures of these dyes, and here’s what she has learned: Natural compounds are unpredictable. The molecules hold on to remnants of the places where they grew — the minerals in the water, say, or the weather during a growing season — and sometimes those earthy, atmospheric residues look strange or taste and smell funky. Artificial colors are simple, stable and nonreactive; Robbins calls them “happy campers.” Yellow No. 5 looks the same whether it’s in an acidic product (a Skittle, for instance) or a more basic one (an M&amp;M), while acidic conditions can change a natural pigment from pink to dark blue.</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":6, \"pNum\":6} --><p>On the day I saw her kitchen, Robbins was preparing to produce a test batch of M&amp;Ms colored blue using pigment from red cabbage. The smell of warm chocolate was tinged with a faint, sulfuric sauerkraut smell. Despite the sterile setting, earthy odor molecules from natural dyes somehow made their presence known — a borscht aroma from the beet dye, a slight eggy scent from the radish. Over the last century, the processed-food industry largely succeeded in replacing fickle nature with synthetic, shelf-stable colors and flavors and preservatives concocted in laboratories. Now that work has to be undone. As Neil Willcocks, vice president of global research and development for the Wrigley division of Mars, told me, “This is the most complex technical undertaking that any of us have ever seen in the history of the company.”</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":7, \"pNum\":7} --><p><span class=\"dropcap\">S</span>cientists estimate that more than half the human brain is involved in processing what we see. Only about 1 percent or so is dedicated to taste. Within the first few months of life, babies begin to distinguish among colors, showing a preference for more saturated ones, especially blues and reds. Vision overwhelms the other senses. If researchers want you to really taste something, feel its texture against your tongue and smell its subtle notes, they will make you eat it in the dark or under lights that mask colors. Humans are color-seeking animals, and food companies learned to manipulate that trait early.</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":8, \"pNum\":8} --><p>In the early 1800s, just as chemistry emerged as a real science from the murky realm of alchemy, food sellers increasingly began to add things to their products, usually to hide discoloration or spoilage. Copper made pallid pickles green again; children ate candies turned red with lead; old milk was watered down, dyed yellow and thickened with flour and other dubious powders. Sometimes these colorants and heavy metals killed people directly, but more often — in milk, for example — they simply concealed the presence of contaminants or bacteria that caused illness and death.</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":9, \"pNum\":9} --><p>In 1906, Congress passed the Food and Drugs Act, which banned poisonous colors. Most of the approved dyes were derived from aromatic hydrocarbons found in the thick black liquid left over from processing coal for fuel. A young British chemist stumbled on mauve, the first coal-tar dye, while trying to distill artificial quinine in 1856. Six years later, a New York Times article hailing the role played by the new dyes in textile production noted how fortuitous the discovery was for coal manufacturers. Before mauve and other so-called coal-tar dyes became the basic ingredients in this new synthetic-color industry, coal companies were repeatedly prosecuted for polluting waterways with what <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/1862/07/28/news/great-exhibition-about-dyes-beauty-coal-tar-mauve-magenta-made-extraordinary.html?pagewanted=all\">The Times referred</a> to as “singularly repulsive refuse.” These coal-tar colors revolutionized fashion, medicine and food, becoming essential components in cereals, snacks and candy. In 1941, Mars made the first M&amp;Ms, which were included in American soldiers’ rations, by coating heat-resistant, transportable chocolates with coal-tar colors and stamping them with a lowercase “M.”</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":10, \"pNum\":10} --><p>The potential dark side of these garish colors began to emerge on Halloween in 1950. Dozens of trick-or-treating children, in a couple of cities, became ill after eating candy tinted with high levels of Orange No. 1, then one of the most widely used coal-tar additives found in soft drinks, candy, baked goods and processed meats like hot dogs. Government officials collected candy samples and sent them to Washington, where volunteers who ate them became sick with diarrhea and abdominal pain. The episode caused an outcry among parents and politicians, prompting tests of all artificial colorants. Some of the coal-tar dyes — different colors were created by mixing the hydrocarbons with other chemical compounds — were found to be relatively safe, but nearly every rat and dog given Orange No. 1 showed signs of distress, ranging from weight loss to death. Scientists deemed the dye an acute toxin. Red No. 32 fared even worse; in one experiment, all 48 rats fed Red No. 32 died.</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":11, \"pNum\":11} --><p>After years of haggling between government and industry, a Supreme Court ruling in 1958 resulted in a final ban for Orange No. 1 and Red No. 32. Two years later, federal legislation led to the prohibition of numerous other dyes and required more rigorous testing of all food colors, eventually leaving us with the seven colors still in use today: Blue No. 1, Blue No. 2, Green No. 3, Yellow No. 5, Yellow No. 6, Red No. 3 and Red No. 40. But fears were renewed in 1973 when a pediatric allergist from San Francisco named Benjamin F. Feingold presented a paper at a medical conference suggesting that the consumption of artificial colors caused hyperactivity in children. Though he had little but anecdotal evidence to support his theory, Feingold wrote two best-selling books that advised parents to remove artificial colors and flavors from the diets of hyperactive children. Despite the popularity of what was called the Feingold Diet, the production of F.D.A.-certified artificial colorants in the United States surged to more than 17 million pounds of powder in 2015 from 1.6 million pounds in 1955. A study released earlier this year found that 43 percent of all food products marketed to children, and 95 percent of fruit-flavored snacks, contain artificial dyes.</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":12, \"pNum\":12} --><p>A meta-analysis of 23 studies undertaken in the decade after Feingold first put forward his advice found the link between diet and hyperactivity too small to be statistically significant. But then in 2004 and 2007, two landmark scientific articles, one published in The Lancet, revealed that consuming some artificial colors had a small but noteworthy effect on hyperactivity in more than 300 British children. The studies prompted the European Union in 2010 to begin requiring food labels to clearly note the presence of several artificial dyes along with the warning that they “may have an adverse effect on activity and attention in children.” To avoid having to include that alarming label, many food manufacturers began phasing out synthetic colors in the European market. A year later, an F.D.A. advisory panel voted that no such label was necessary in the United States. (The panel also noted that more research was needed.)</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":13, \"pNum\":13} --><p>Label or no label, American consumers began to lose their appetite for synthetic dyes, too. A survey of some 26,000 American adults over the last three years shows that a full half of them say they want to avoid artificial colors and preservatives. A recent Nielsen poll ranked the absence of artificial food dyes as the third-most-important factor in food-purchasing decisions among consumers worldwide. Parents have created YouTube testimonials and petitions on change.org claiming that their children have become more focused or their nightmares have gone away after cutting artificial dyes from their diet. Videos and blogs show toddlers turning into “monsters” minutes after eating synthetically colored candies and cupcakes. Some people appeal to companies directly, like the mother of a 9-year-old named Trenton, who said her son abruptly stopped being disruptive at school and hockey practice after he quit eating artificial colors. Her petition to Mars to make M&amp;Ms — one of the boy’s favorite candies — with natural colors received nearly 217,000 signatures.</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":14, \"pNum\":14} --><p>There are things we still don’t know about how artificial colors interact with the human body. Research shows that Blue No. 1 is the only dye that crosses the blood-brain barrier, which exists to protect the brain from toxins and pathogens. It enters the fluid inside the skull, but scientists know almost nothing about what it does once it’s there. Rather than continue to defend themselves against these growing concerns, big food companies last year began making public commitments to give up synthetic dyes. Fulfilling those promises has set off a quest for novel colors that calls to mind the preindustrial days when explorers and traders traveled the world collecting indigo from South Asia or a dark red powder derived from cochineal insects used by the Aztecs.</p><!--NYTREF {[\"region\":\"Embedded\", \"id\":\"100000004689476\", \"dropzone\":15, \"pNum\":15]} --><p><span class=\"dropcap\">T</span>he blue-extraction facility looks like just another dun-colored building rising out of Southern California’s Imperial Valley near the Salton Sea. The buildings and sand are the same hue as the maximum-security prison next door, the abundant crickets and the tumbleweeds. This is not somewhere you’d go looking for blue, or any color other than beige. But inside the factory, stainless-steel tanks and industrial-size kilns extract a blue powder from a thick sludge of algae sucked out of 100 acres of man-made ponds nearby. The fine powder coats the white uniforms of workers, collecting in the sweaty creases of their necks and noses, leaving smudges across garbage cans, walls and hand-washing stations like the impressionistic cave paintings of some blue-loving tribe.</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":16, \"pNum\":16} --><p>This blue-extraction operation, the first in the United States, was opened a year ago by a Japanese chemical company called DIC, which also runs a similar extraction plant in southern China. DIC now produces 90 percent of the world’s supply of spirulina-based blue pigment in these two facilities, and it projects that the market will increase as much as 10-fold over the next two years as the food industry scrambles to replace Blue No. 1. One Mars executive told me that to convert only its blue M&amp;Ms to spirulina blue, the company would, in his estimation, need twice the current global supply. And Mars has committed to converting all the food it makes for humans to natural colors. (Its pet food will still contain artificial colors.)</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":17, \"pNum\":17} --><p>“Blue is going to just explode,” Amha Belay, the affable, crinkly-eyed chief technology officer at the extraction facility, told me in a lilting Ethiopian accent. We were standing atop the four-story-high hot-air dryer, which turns the wet muck into green powder. About 10 percent of that powder is made up of molecules called phycocyanins, which, when wrested from the green, make the highly prized blue dust. Belay looked proud up there, pointing out across the desert, where the company is planning to nearly double the pond acreage over the next couple of years.</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":18, \"pNum\":18} --><p>By 9 a.m., the temperature around the blue extractor was already near 100 degrees, and the air was thick with monsoon moisture pushing up from Mexico. “Spirulina like it hot,” Belay said. Microalgae are an especially promising source of natural pigments, not just blues but also oranges, reds, greens and yellows. Scientists estimate that there may be as many as a million different species of microalgae, and Belay is a natural evangelist for the tiny blobs. He grew up in Addis Ababa, not far from alkaline lakes that teemed with naturally growing spirulina and flocks of flamingos, whose bright pink feathers are colored by pigments called carotenoids found in the algae, which is consumed by brine shrimp, which are eaten by the birds. Without carotenoids, flamingos would be gray (and deciduous trees would not erupt in autumnal glory).</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":19, \"pNum\":19} --><p>Belay and I peeked through a window at the brand-new research-and-development lab next to the extractor. The company, worried that I might give away secrets about its methods and technology, wouldn’t let me inside, but behind the glass I could see Japanese researchers trying to extract other colors from the pond slime. The search feels almost feverish; last year the global market in natural colors was worth an estimated $970 million, up 60 percent since 2011. Natural colors now represent more than half the food-colors market in dollar terms. From here, the blue powder will go to one of the large dye companies (known as the color houses), whose scientists will further tinker with it before selling it to food companies like Mars.</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":20, \"pNum\":20} --><p>“Blue is just the beginning,” said Belay, who thinks about color not as a static thing but as a dynamic universe of visible light. Looking at a mound of algal glop, he knows that it appears green because in the process of converting the sun’s energy, the algae’s chlorophyll molecules absorb blue and red waves and reflect green back to our eyes. Vision is a subtractive process: The human eye sees only what’s left behind, unabsorbed. Strip away the chlorophyll, and underneath there are other pigment molecules like carotenoids, which can be used to make yellows, reds, oranges and browns. In a handful of soggy spirulina, Belay can see the potential for a sort of Crayola wonderland.</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":21, \"pNum\":21} --><p><span class=\"dropcap\">‘B</span>lue, he can’t just be any blue.” Hank Izzo, a vice president of research and development, kept using male pronouns to refer to the color blue while I was at Mars in Hackettstown. This confused me at first. It seemed off, maybe even sexist. Why was blue a <em>he</em>? Then, when we entered a conference room, he pointed to the wall and said: “Wherever he is, he needs to be that blue.” And there they were, painted on the wall behind me, those bulbous, anthropomorphic M&amp;M characters that show up in TV commercials. The green and brown M&amp;Ms are female, with long eyelashes and white high heels. The rest of the colors are male. Blue’s official webpage reveals that his turn-ons are “moonlit nights, jazz, the ladies.”</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":22, \"pNum\":22} --><p>Everyone I talked to at Mars insisted that they needed to find natural colors that exactly replicate the current artificial ones. The changing of an extremely popular food’s color is viewed warily for legitimate reasons. Humans have learned over millenniums to see in colors signposts indicating safety and danger, so we can avoid having to stick everything in our mouths to find out whether it is poisonous or not.</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":23, \"pNum\":23} --><p>There are two dominant theories about why human vision evolved as it did. Either our perception of color helped us locate food, training us to differentiate the reds of ripened fruit from green foliage, or the way we see emerged from our need to detect changes in one another’s skin tone that might indicate anger or sexual arousal. However it developed, the human perception of color is, like emotion, experiential. As soon as we open our eyes each morning, we’re surrounded by shimmering light that must be converted into something knowable and navigable. Humans can ordinarily distinguish more than two million different colors. Instead of continually reconstructing images of everything we see, our brains take shortcuts by creating color memories as filters. A ripe banana is assigned a particular yellow based on previous experience with bananas. Researchers call this the “memory color effect,” and not all cultures see and know colors in the same way. A global food conglomerate like Mars, which sells products in 150 countries, wants its goods to be uniformly recognizable anywhere in the world. Aided by marketing and chemistry, brands fight against the different experiences of individual retinas. Companies want their colors to become, in essence, memory colors for the entire species.</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":24, \"pNum\":24} --><p>People also don’t like the <em>taste</em> of change (or think they don’t). Market researchers point out that if a company calls attention to a tweak in a product (a shift in color, for example, or new “natural” or “healthy” labeling), consumers will claim to taste a difference — even when there is none — and they won’t like it. To compare the natural pigments with their artificial counterparts, Mars uses a colorimeter that measures the exact absorbance of specific wavelengths of light. It knows, for example, that the M&amp;M colored with Blue No. 1 is more cyan than the one colored with spirulina. The company is continually running tasting panels with consumers, and they indicate Americans are especially sensitive to even slight alterations in color. If a naturally colored M&amp;M tastes the same but has a lighter tinge, Americans will say it does not taste “as fun,” while Europeans are more likely to accept such slight color changes or miss them altogether. The enormous amount of money and effort researchers at food companies are putting into the development of highly saturated natural colors is partly an effort to maintain the status quo, the legacy of products through time. But they also know that, biologically speaking, deep, contrasting colors are more attractive to people than mere nostalgia for a specific candy.</p><!--NYTREF {[\"region\":\"Embedded\", \"id\":\"100000004683136\", \"dropzone\":25, \"pNum\":25]} --><p>Just adding a red coloring can make food taste 10 percent sweeter. In one well-known 1980 study, researchers gave people differently colored beverages. Some drinks appropriately matched colors and flavors (cherry with red, say), while others scrambled them. More than a quarter of the taste testers reported that the cherry-flavored drink had a lemon-lime taste when it was colored green, but no one mentioned lemon-lime when the same cherry drink was red. Their brains determined flavors based on color before the liquid touched their tongues.</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":26, \"pNum\":26} --><p>Colors can also influence how much people eat. The greater the variety of colors consumed, the longer it takes someone to feel full. Scientists call this phenomenon “sensory-specific satiety.” “If you look at something that has five or six different colors in it, you go, Wow, that’s going to be fun to eat,” says Brian Wansink, director of the Food and Brand Lab at Cornell University. “Even if someone says to you, ‘All those M&amp;Ms taste exactly the same.’ It doesn’t matter. Your mind sees that variety as more enjoyable and tempting than a plain bowl of blue M&amp;Ms, and so you eat more.”</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":27, \"pNum\":27} --><p>Why anyone wants to eat blue foods in the first place has long confused food scientists. In the natural world, the color tends to flag the presence of things to avoid, like mold, spoiled meat or poisonous berries. People asked to name flavors associated with specific colors easily rattle off answers. Yellow? Bananas, lemons. Red? Cherries, strawberries, apples, ripeness. But blue stumps people, after they mention blueberries. In one study, British participants associated blue with raspberry; in Taiwan, subjects linked blue to mint. But these flavor associations have nothing to do with what’s growing in the soil or ripening on the vine and are instead flavor-color connections created by food companies. Blue was, in some ways, the final frontier in food coloring. Survey respondents around the world overwhelmingly say their favorite color is blue. Yet in the 1960s and ’70s, marketers and food anthropologists argued that consumers would reject the inherently unappetizing color. In a famous study from the era, a researcher fed subjects steak under color-masking lights. Halfway through the meal, he switched on the regular lights to reveal that the steaks were dyed blue, which induced nausea and illness in the participants who had, until then, been relishing the meat.</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":28, \"pNum\":28} --><p>The predictions that blue food would fail were, of course, wrong. Gatorade introduced the first of several blue drinks in 1995. Blue M&amp;Ms came out the same year, after consumers chose the new color over pink and purple in a contest. By the early 2000s, Heinz had introduced a teal-colored ketchup, Kraft a blue macaroni and cheese and Kellogg’s a cereal that turned milk baby blue. The most gimmicky blue products were eventually discontinued, but the color became a mainstay, especially in the “fun foods” category dominated by candy, sugary drinks and cereals.</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":29, \"pNum\":29} --><p>Look at a bowl of naturally colored Trix cereal set beside its artificially colored predecessor. The effect is akin to putting a watercolor of a desert landscape next to an Andy Warhol print: Nature’s colors are more muted, gentle. For many snack and candy makers, that wimpy palette will not suffice. Until more vibrant colors can be extracted from nonsynthetic sources, some food marketers may have to rely on manipulating visual responses in other ways. “Consumers mostly want things to stay the same as they always have, to taste the same as they always have, to look the same as they always have,” says Charles Spence, a professor of experimental psychology at Oxford University whose research has shown that so-called extrinsic colors surrounding a food item — the color of the plate, say, or flatware — influence how people see and experience what they’re eating. In one of Spence’s studies, participants rated a pink strawberry mousse as 10 percent sweeter and 15 percent more flavorful when eaten from a white plate compared with a black plate. He’s now consulting with food manufacturers that want to alter their packaging so consumers will be less likely to notice the subtler colors produced by natural dyes.</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":30, \"pNum\":30} --><p><strong>The Mars color</strong> scientists circled me, looking worried, even protective. The first item on our menu was an M&amp;M dyed blue with spirulina. After that, they gave me a vermilion one colored with radish, a bright yellow one (turmeric root), a deeper red one (beet), jelly beans tinted with purple carrots and spirulina-blue Skittles and Starbursts. “I think you’re the first person in the world who doesn’t work for Mars to taste those,” someone told me.</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":31, \"pNum\":31} --><p>“Do you need a spit cup?”</p><p>“Someone get her some water, quick.”</p><p>Despite the furrowed brows of the scientists, the spirulina-blue M&amp;M tasted good. The hard sugar coating clicked pleasantly against my teeth just before releasing that familiar wash of milk chocolate, the same as any M&amp;M. When I nodded approvingly, the scientists seemed to be relieved. It’s true, the blue is not the same — “It’s a different blue, but that doesn’t necessarily make it a bad blue,” Robbins, the color-chemistry manager, said — but it is vibrant, chipper even, and does not come across as a shoddy knockoff. My approval, as a proxy for sweet-toothed consumers, seemed to make these scientists a little giddy.</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":32, \"pNum\":34} --><p>But that changed when we moved on to the spirulina Skittle. I could feel the nervousness of the white-smocked group rise as I was handed a small, clear, plastic cup — the kind hospitals sometimes use to administer medications — containing a single round blue candy. I put it on my tongue, and at first all I noticed was the tart hit of sugar and acid inducing that expected rush of saliva. I’ve never chewed under such scrutiny. I quickly swallowed and smiled reassuringly. “Just wait,” Robbins said, and then there it was: a distinct, boggy, shallow-pond-in-late-summer aftertaste.</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":33, \"pNum\":35} --><p>I would have spit, but the scientists seemed so vulnerable already. I took a gulp of water. Their disappointment was understandable: They’ve spent years trying to control these rowdy pigments when what they need and want is something stable and predictable. I felt for them. But I could not help rooting for the spirulina-blue phycocyanin molecule, doggedly carrying with it the turbid water where it grew, the scalding sun in a cloudless azure sky, the white birds wheeling above, hovering for a moment to catch insects on the water’s surface. How brazen this little bit of blue, untamed by the industrial dryers and stainless-steel separation tanks at the pigment-extraction facility; unwilling to be broken by the labs at the big biosciences companies that take that blue powder, further refine it and sell it to food companies as dye. It’s obstinate, even here, so many chemical interventions later, at Mars, where it manifests a whisper of its origin story in a Skittle. Just a faint, lingering flavor, as if to say, “I’m blue because the world, in all its unruly variety, made me this color.”</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":34, \"pNum\":36} --><p><em>Malia Wollan is a frequent contributor to The New York Times and the Tip columnist for the magazine.

A corn-industry spokesman&#160; &#8212; not Agri-Pulse &#8212; said: &#8220;We&#8217;ve seen so&#160;many attacks. We see Michael Pollan go&#160;on Oprah. What&#8217;s going to happen when&#160;those people . . . start to have an impact in&#160;Washington on policies and regulations?&#8221;&#160;The article also misstated the year Agri-Pulse published the quotation. It was 2010,&#160;not 2009.</p>
