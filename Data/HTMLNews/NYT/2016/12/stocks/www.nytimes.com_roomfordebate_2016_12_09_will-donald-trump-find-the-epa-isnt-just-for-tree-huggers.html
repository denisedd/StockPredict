        <img alt="Christine_whitman-thumbstandard" class="nytint-mugshot" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/12/08/opinion/Christine_Whitman/Christine_Whitman-thumbStandard.jpg" />

        <p>During the presidential campaign, President-elect Donald J. Trump heralded the idea of eliminating the Environmental Protection Agency. His proposed E.P.A. administrator, Scott Pruitt, frequently fought the agency as Oklahoma attorney general. </p>

<p>But both may have forgotten that the E.P.A. was created by President Richard Nixon because people were being hospitalized in record numbers during bad air days and rivers were spontaneously combusting due to the dumping of pollutants into our waterways.  If cost-savings is our goal, we must remember that the cost of remediation is far more than prevention. The price we pay for ignoring these issues is much greater than we can afford, both in terms of dollars and human lives. </p>

<div class="w190 right module"><div class="entry"><blockquote>The cost of fixing environmental damage is far more than preventing it. We can't afford the price we pay for ignoring these issues.</blockquote></div></div>

<p>In March of this year, a Gallup <a href="//www.gallup.com/poll/1615/environment.aspx)">poll</a>  found that 81 percent of respondents said they cared a “great deal” or a “fair amount” about the pollution of rivers, lakes and reservoirs. Eighty percent said the same about the pollution of drinking water, 77 percent about the contamination of soil and water by toxic waste and 74 percent about air pollution. A substantial majority of people believe these issues are important, and situations like the Flint water crisis have brought these topics to the forefront of people’s concerns. Environmental protection is not merely the passion of a select few advocates or an “elite” viewpoint, it is now a grass-roots concern. </p>

<p>We have seen a glimpse of an increasingly widespread concern for the environment in a number of recent campaigns. The sustained and widespread opposition to the Dakota Access pipeline, which would cross just upstream of the the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe’s drinking water supply, led the Army Corps of Engineers to stop the project and reconsider its route.</p>

<p>Beyond Coal is a national environmental network of many local efforts whose mission is to replace coal plants with renewable energy sources. Between 2002 and 2013, the initiative <a href="//www.motherjones.com/environment/2012/04/beyond-coal-plant-activism">helped stop 184 coal plants</a> that were being considered across the country. The organizers recognize that it’s not actually up to the president or Congress to determine how electricity works in America; rather, it’s the aggregate of hundreds of local decisions. They have convinced local leaders in communities across America that continuing to promote coal, our dirtiest energy source, is not good for the nation’s health or economy. These pervasive efforts have helped produce the retirement of <a href="//content.sierraclub.org/coal/victories">45 percent of U.S. coal plants</a> so far and the corresponding creation of renewable sources of energy.</p>

<p>While environmental protection may not have been the foremost issue animating Trump’s supporters, it is important to a much larger segment of our population than ever before. Eliminating the E.P.A. altogether would be shortsighted and foolish; we need to take a longer-term view of the affects that our actions toward our surroundings have on our health and our safety – two resources that once lost cannot simply be repurchased.</p>

<p>The American people did not elect Trump and other Republicans because they suddenly all joined the G.O.P., they voted because they wanted a change from politics as usual in Washington. President-elect Trump and congressional leaders should remember that the electorate voted against the hyper-partisanship that has rendered governing at the federal level almost impossible.  The new administration has the opportunity to make a huge difference by recognizing that the environment is not a partisan issue and real, everyday people, genuinely care about their health and quality of life.

        <p>There is angst in the environmental community about what President-elect Donald J. Trump’s appointment of Scott Pruitt as E.P.A. administrator means for the agency and environmental policy. The fear is that recent efforts — ranging from implementing the Clean Power Plan, a cornerstone of U.S. compliance with the 2015 Paris Climate Agreement, to redefining watersheds regulated under the Clean Water Act — will be rolled back or cancelled.  Broad objectives could be lost.</p>

<div class="w190 right module"><div class="entry"><blockquote>By more fairly and accurately assessing costs,   environmental policies can be more realistic and less controversial.</blockquote></div></div>

<p>While these two efforts might be critically modified, over all, environmental policies can be more realistic and less controversial under the new administration’s E.P.A. If so, this will be good for the environment and society. Why is that? </p>

<p>Environmental policy relies on interest-group politics.  Advocates and opponents provide information to the agency about benefits and costs of proposed programs.  Where interest groups compete, the agency receives balanced appraisals.  When they do not, the agency receives one view. Support for federal environmental policy is strongly associated with income, education, residence and political party — the same characteristics that statistically explain interest-group effectiveness. Where opponents are unorganized, poorer and lack information on policy proposals, they are less effective in lobbying.  As a result, environmental policies, even when portrayed as providing general public goods, can be favored by a well-organized few, but not by the broader electorate. Moreover the E.P.A. is unlikely to be a disinterested party. Staff identify with expanding their mission and the agency benefits from greater regulatory mandates that increase budgets and staffing.   </p>

<p>Mixed political support is compounded by the way environmental policy works.  It primarily uses a “polluter pays” rule, whereby parties who inflict environmental harm are fined or required to make costly production or consumption adjustments.  While there is a logic for this, the result is that those parties bear the costs of providing a public good. If these costs are high enough and the policies are not as broadly valued as they are by advocates, then environmental regulations are seen as being inequitable and economically damaging to certain constituents.  These parties are motivated to organize, and political push back occurs.  </p>

<p>The E.P.A.’s Clean Power Plan, for example, imposes direct costs on fossil-fuel producing regions — their communities, workers and mineral rights owners.  Lower-income consumers nationwide, as well as employees and firm/property owners in energy-intensive industrial areas are harmed.  These groups disproportionately bear the costs of reducing global greenhouse gas emissions.  A similar skewed distribution of benefits and costs applies to Clean Water Act extensions, where Midwestern farmers will have to pay fees or secure permits to cultivate near peripheral water, depending on “stream” definition under E.P.A. rules.  Again, overall benefits come at a cost to these parties.    </p>

<p>It seems clear why both vague general benefits and policy costs and their unequal distributions have made the E.P.A. a flashpoint for many.  Political reaction undermines policy objectives. We have seen this in the response to free trade policies that are nationally beneficial, but inflict harm on certain groups and regions.  If the new E.P.A. changes this distributional dynamic through adoption of “beneficiary pays” rules and other compensation to those who bear direct costs, the country may achieve more balanced environmental regulation.   </p>

<p>“Beneficiary pays” shifts the cost burden to those who value the environmental policy more and hence, leads to a more proportionate distribution of benefits and costs.  Research has shown that these distributions are far more successful in eliciting the support of those who must take action to provide the environmental good.  And when advocates or advocate organizations have to pay, they more carefully weigh benefits and costs in setting objectives, then when the costs are off loaded to others.  Under those circumstances, we are more apt to get the “right” amount of environmental goods through regulation. We have experience with such compensation schemes and positive responses on a small-scale basis in payments to irrigators to fallow land or to line ditches, releasing the water for environmental instream flows. Similar incentive payments are used to pay fishers to reduce fishing to protect fish stocks. These schemes primarily have been used by nongovernmental organizations, such as Environmental Defense, Freshwater Trust and The Nature Conservancy. </p>

<p>The new E.P.A. might learn from these experiences and adopt them more generally in devising and implementing policies that are more politically robust and successful in achieving long-term environmental goals.  </p>

<p>With his <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/07/us/politics/scott-pruitt-epa-trump.html?ref=politics"> selection of Scott Pruitt</a> as head of the Environmental Protection Agency,  President-elect Donald J. Trump chose someone who shares the disdain for the agency that he <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3c3xqKTx7aw">expressed</a> during the campaign. At the same time, environmental issues like the Flint water crisis and rising seas caused by global warming made news during the campaign.</p>

<p>Will Trump and his new E.P.A. chief have public support if they try to dismantle environmental protections?</p>
