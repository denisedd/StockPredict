    <meta itemprop="description" name="description" content="JAFFEE--Dwight M.,passed away peacefully on Thursday, January 28, 2016, in San Francisco, CA. He was 72 and lived in Berkeley, CA. Dr. Jaffee was the Willis Booth Professor of Banking, Finance, and Real Estate and Co-Chairman of the Fisher Center for Real Estate and Urban Economics at the Haas School of Business, University of California, Berkeley. In the early 1990s, he led a joint project between the Haas School of Business and the Graduate School of Management, St. Petersburg University, to establish St. Petersburg&apos;s first post-Soviet era school of business. Prior to joining the Haas School of Business in 1991, Dr. Jaffee was a professor of Economics at Princeton University from 1968 to 1990. Dr. Jaffee was an expert on mortgage markets, banking, risk and catastrophe insurance, and international trade. Most recently, he testified in front of Congress and the SEC involving Freddie Mac, Fannie Mae, and the recent banking and housing crisis. He was also an advisor to many central banks throughout Europe. He was the author of more than seven books and 171 papers in the fields of money and banking, finance, and risk and catastrophe insurance. He received many awards, including the 2007 Robert I. Mehr Award from the Journal of Risk and Insurance. Dr. Jaffee will always be known for his mentorship of countless undergraduate and graduate students at both Princeton and Berkeley. Dwight M. Jaffee was born in Chicago on February 7, 1943, to Gertrude and Woodrow Jaffee and grew up in Chicago. He received his B.A. from Northwestern University in 1964 and Ph.D. in Economics from MIT in 1968. In 1997, he married Lynne LaMarca Heinrich, a Senior Consultant and Principal of Marts &amp; Lundy and an Instructor at the Haas School of Business. In addition to his wife, he is survived by his mother, Gertrude of Boca Raton; daughter, Elizabeth, known as Betsy, of Washington, D.C.; son Jonathan of Santa Monica; and two grandchildren. Known for his connoisseurship of fine wine, love of travel, hiking in the hills of Marin County, and loving friendships, Dwight will be missed by many.

&lt;br&gt;JAFFEE, DWIGHT M." data-url="https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9507E1D71F3AF932A05752C0A9609D8B63" data-description="JAFFEE--Dwight M.,passed away peacefully on Thursday, January 28, 2016, in San Francisco, CA. He was 72 and lived in Berkeley, CA. Dr. Jaffee was the Willis Booth Professor of Banking, Finance, and Real Estate and Co-Chairman of the Fisher Center for Real Estate and Urban Economics at the Haas School of Business, University of California, Berkeley. In the early 1990s, he led a joint project between the Haas School of Business and the Graduate School of Management, St. Petersburg University, to establish St. Petersburg&apos;s first post-Soviet era school of business. Prior to joining the Haas School of Business in 1991, Dr. Jaffee was a professor of Economics at Princeton University from 1968 to 1990. Dr. Jaffee was an expert on mortgage markets, banking, risk and catastrophe insurance, and international trade. Most recently, he testified in front of Congress and the SEC involving Freddie Mac, Fannie Mae, and the recent banking and housing crisis. He was also an advisor to many central banks throughout Europe. He was the author of more than seven books and 171 papers in the fields of money and banking, finance, and risk and catastrophe insurance. He received many awards, including the 2007 Robert I. Mehr Award from the Journal of Risk and Insurance. Dr. Jaffee will always be known for his mentorship of countless undergraduate and graduate students at both Princeton and Berkeley. Dwight M. Jaffee was born in Chicago on February 7, 1943, to Gertrude and Woodrow Jaffee and grew up in Chicago. He received his B.A. from Northwestern University in 1964 and Ph.D. in Economics from MIT in 1968. In 1997, he married Lynne LaMarca Heinrich, a Senior Consultant and Principal of Marts &amp; Lundy and an Instructor at the Haas School of Business. In addition to his wife, he is survived by his mother, Gertrude of Boca Raton; daughter, Elizabeth, known as Betsy, of Washington, D.C.; son Jonathan of Santa Monica; and two grandchildren. Known for his connoisseurship of fine wine, love of travel, hiking in the hills of Marin County, and loving friendships, Dwight will be missed by many. In lieu of flowers, the family has asked that gifts be directed to the Dwight M. Jaffee (1968) Endowed Fund for Graduate Students at MIT, c/o Advancement Office, 77 Massachusetts Avenue, Cambridge, MA 02139. 1/3"></div>
