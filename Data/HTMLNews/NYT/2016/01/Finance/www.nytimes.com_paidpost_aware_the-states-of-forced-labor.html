</header>
<section class="content">
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt;">With thousands of migrant workers subjected to abuse and exploitation, development in the Middle East comes at a high human cost.</span></p>
<p>FOR UNSKILLED LABORERS from Bangladesh, India, Nepal and other populous developing economies, jobs are scarce and wages are very low, some less than $100 per month. It is little surprise, then, that a job in the Middle East advertised as paying upward of $500 per month can seem irresistible.</p>
<p>Yet for the hundreds of thousands of laborers who jump at this opportunity and migrate to the oil-rich Gulf region, this vision often proves to be a mirage.&nbsp;</p>
<p>First, securing a position often means paying a local recruiter a $2,000 fee, usually obtained through a loan with an extortionate interest rate. Upon arrival, workers may have to sign a contract — often in Arabic, a language most of them cannot read — the terms of which may state that the job pays only $200 a month, far less than promised, with housing costs deducted from that. This leaves approximately $100 a month — barely enough to cover the loan interest on their recruiting fee.</p>
<p>The exploitation, however, often extends beyond mere money. In many cases, the company they signed up to work for confiscates their passports, making it impossible for them to leave without the permission of their employer. Unable to access labor protections, many are&nbsp;forced to live in cramped, unsanitary conditions with no time off.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The result is a form of modern-day slavery that exists together with human trafficking, debt bondage, child labor and forced marriage.</p>
<p>And some pay the ultimate price. Between 2010 and 2013, for example, the International Trade Union Confederation estimates that about 1,200 migrant workers died in the state of Qatar; some&nbsp;of these casualties were related to the massive drive to build stadiums for the 2022 World Cup. Additionally, in 2015 seven workers were killed, six were injured and 15 were trapped under the concrete of a building site at a university in Qassim, northwest of Saudi Arabia’s capital, Riyadh.</p>
<p>Flawed as these labor practices are, they have become the lifeblood of many industries in&nbsp;the Gulf’s wealthiest nations. Today, migrant workers make up more than 70 percent of the work force in the countries of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) — Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, the United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Bahrain and Oman. A large proportion of the workers, meanwhile, are almost entirely from South Asia: Nearly all migrant laborers from India, Pakistan and Sri Lanka, for example, take jobs in a GCC country.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Those who do are all too often left stranded, broke and trapped as forced laborers in the deserts of the Gulf, building the gleaming skyscrapers, huge stadiums and world-class airport facilities that are redefining the architecture and economy of these oil-rich nations.&nbsp;</p>

<p>With local labor shortages and high-profile construction projects underway&nbsp;—&nbsp;such as Qatar’s&nbsp;World Cup stadiums; new airports in Doha, Dubai and Abu Dhabi; and branches of art museums such as the Louvre and the Guggenheim&nbsp;—&nbsp;migrant workers are needed more&nbsp;than ever across the region.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“You have significant demand for workers from Bangladesh, Nepal and India,” says Nick Grono, CEO of the Freedom Fund, a philanthropic initiative focused on the fight against modern slavery. “And there’s a whole bunch of structural factors that facilitate exploitation.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>For example, in a 2015 investigative report, it emerged that roughly one-third (about 10,000 people) of the migrant workers employed in the construction of New York University’s Abu Dhabi campus were unable to access the protections of the university’s labor guidelines on fair wages, working hours and living conditions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>According to the U.S. Department of State’s 2014 Trafficking in Persons Report, in Kuwait, despite 2010 legislation setting maximum working hours, the law excludes migrant domestic workers. Meanwhile, Human Rights Watch found that in Qatar these laborers are not allowed to form unions or engage in strikes.</p>

<p>Back in their home countries, migrants are driven into the hands of unscrupulous recruiters by everything from joblessness and poverty to corruption and political conflict.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“At its core, it’s about global inequality,” says David Segall, a policy associate at the NYU Stern Center for Business and Human Rights. “Because of that supply and demand, workers have a strong incentive not to ruffle any feathers by asserting their rights,” adds Segall, who focuses on the recruitment and migration of construction workers from South Asia to the Persian Gulf. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Male laborers are not alone in their suffering. Human Rights Watch estimates that there are 236,500 domestic workers in the United Arab Emirates, of whom 146,100 are female, accounting for 12.8 percent of the total employment in the country. &nbsp;</p>
<p>In a 2014 study conducted by the organization, a few of them talked about enduring physical and sexual abuse, being confined to their employers’ homes and working long hours without time off, with insufficient food and no medical treatment.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Meanwhile, under the Middle Eastern <em>kafala</em>, or work-sponsorship system used to monitor migrant workers, unskilled laborers must have an in-country sponsor, usually their employer, who is responsible for their visa and legal status. This makes it hard for them to change employers or return home to their families if they find conditions too harsh.</p>
<p>As in other parts of the world, the chain of responsibility for migrant workers in the Middle East is long and complex. “Each stakeholder tends to pass the buck on to others,” says Segall.</p>

<p>With huge demand for construction laborers and domestic workers means millions of migrants from poor communities have traveled to the Middle East enticed with promises of high wages, only to find themselves forced into labor. The International Labor Organization (ILO) estimates that there are 600,000 forced labor victims in the region. These workers are often subjected to abuse and exploitation with no legal or social networks to support them.</p>

<h1 class="head">Labor Rights: The Middle East in a Global Context</h1>
</header>
<p>The Gulf is&nbsp;a major destination for&nbsp;this global flow of migrant labor, where workers leave their homes to work temporarily in wealthier economies. But this region is not the exception. Worldwide, there are 232 million international migrants and the International Labour Organization estimates that about 21 million of them are trapped in jobs into which they were coerced or deceived.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Indeed, with the globalization of trade and commerce has come the globalization of labor. In manufacturing industries, companies have outsourced production of everything from textiles to toys and electronics to developing countries, where wages are lower, even if human rights may not be respected and working conditions can be harsh. In the Middle East, due to the construction boom, the dynamic is similar but transposed — it is the workers who are imported rather than the goods they make.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“In a globalized economy, we’re going to continue to see risks and cost reductions pushed down to the most vulnerable in society, and that often means migrants, refugees, people affected by conflict, women and children, and those in lower social castes,” says James Cockayne of the United Nations University, who has studied modern slavery. “That’s definitely part of what we see in the Middle East.”</p>

<h1 class="head">What’s Next: Changing the Incentives?</h1>
</header>
<p>If the drivers of labor-rights abuses in the Middle East are complex, so too will be the solutions. And many argue that this means not only addressing the complex networks of unregulated subcontractors and unscrupulous recruiters but also helping change the practices of large global corporations.</p>
<p>Some see consumer pressure playing a role, particularly in the case of high-profile projects. “Companies&nbsp;—&nbsp;especially Western-based construction firms&nbsp;—&nbsp;are beginning to realize&nbsp;that&nbsp;reputation risk is increasing, especially with regard to the World Cup,” says Segall.</p>
<figure class="media-image right-fl"><img id="undefined" src="//paidpost-assets.nyt.com/paidpost/aware/forced-labor/images/quote2_v2.jpg" alt="" data-alignment="right-fl"><figcaption class="caption"><span class="caption-text"> </span><span class="credit"></span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Others see incentives for companies to combat forced labor because of the risk of legal consequences they face if found contravening legislation such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. “If you are a U.K. or U.S. corporation and you’re employing a work force, there’s potential court liability,” says Grono.</p>
<p>Financing provides another leverage point. Duncan Jepson, founder of Liberty Asia, believes persuading banks to treat these risks like any other investment risk could bring about change. “In this area of the Middle East, these projects are vulnerable to corruption, exploitation and fraud and they should think about this before they invest,” he says.</p>
<p>Others argue that highlighting the business case for promoting a better labor environment&nbsp;could help companies address safety and poor working&nbsp;conditions. “The turnover rate is extraordinary and it costs money to bring in new workers,” says Segall. “And a happy work force is a more productive work force.”</p>
<p>There is a powerful message here for governments, too, since a stable, skilled work force with legal protections is necessary to advance their development goals. The fight against forced and bonded labor is therefore important not only to end injustice and abuse, but also because workers who are released from modern-day slavery and forced labor could become a happy and healthy work force with the potential to advance development in nations and local communities around the world.</p>
