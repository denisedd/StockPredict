<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">John Kasich, the Republican primaryâs most moderate candidate, worked to expand on promising poll numbers in New York with a speech this morning sharply criticizing Donald Trump and Ted Cruz, without mentioning them by name.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">In the speech, the Ohio governor cast himself as a nuts-and-bolts choice who is more tolerant, more compassionate, and, as a successful state governor and a budget hawk while in Congress, more adept at handling the nationâs economy. Thatâs hardly a leap, given his opponentsâ vows to deport millions of immigrants, ban Muslims from entering the United States and patrol neighborhoods where they live.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Polls suggest that Mr. Kasich is the Republican candidate who would give Hillary Clinton the toughest battle in November, should they each become their respective partiesâ nominees. But he has struggled to gain traction, so far winning only his home state. He is currently in second place in New York, which votes on April 19, behind Mr. Trump. Mr. Kasich remains in the race in hopes that if neither Mr. Trump nor Mr. Cruz, both deeply unpopular with the partyâs leadership, garner enough delegates necessary to win the nomination outright, he could prevail in a contested nominating convention in July.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">âWhen we come together, when we unite as a country, America always wins,â Mr. Kasich said this morning to the Womenâs National Republican Club, according to the prepared text. Though Mr. Kasich has criticized Mr. Trumpâs misogynistic statements, he oddly did not address them in this speech.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">However, Mr. Kasich hit Mr. Trump hard on his immigration and foreign policy stances, such as they are, as part of the âpath to darknessâ Mr. Trump and Mr. Cruz represent.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">âWe have heard proposals to create a religious test for immigration, to target neighborhoods for surveillance, impose draconian tariffs which would crush trade and destroy American jobs,â he said.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">âWe have heard proposals to drop out of NATO, abandon Europe to Russia, possibly use nuclear weapons in Europe, end our defense partnerships in Asia, and tell our Middle East allies that they have to go it alone.â</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">âWe have been offered hollow promises to impose a value-added tax, balance budgets through simple and whimsical cuts in âfraud, waste and abuse.ââ</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">In an optimistic speech that aimed to be Reaganesque, Mr. Kasich presented plans for a first 100 days in office. They include a balanced-budget plan, a menu of tax cuts and a plan for welfare, education, Medicaid, highway infrastructure and job training back to where we live in the states and strengthening of the nationâs border in combination with a guest worker program.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">The full text of the speech is below.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody"><strong>âTwo Pathsâ</strong></p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody"><strong><u>INTRODUCTION</u></strong></p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Thank you.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">And, thank you to the Womenâs National Republican Club.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Itâs a pleasure to be here in this wonderful and historic clubhouse.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">This organization is so steeped in history of its own as well as in the history of this city, our party and the country.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">The Womenâs National Republican Club was founded by leaders of the suffrage movement.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">With their new voting rights in mind, this clubhouse was intended to be a place where women could meet and share knowledge about political issues so as to be better informed participants in the electoral process.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">As new voters, women could participate in the choice between candidates and ideas.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">It is in that spirit that I speak to you today.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">I am going to talk today about the choice America faces in this election.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">It is a choice between two pathsâtwo very different paths.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">As we make this choice, the world is watching.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">The world is watching because America is civilizationâs brightest beacon.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Freedom-loving people depend on our leadership for peace and stability.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Civilizationâs enemies only seek our fall.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Presidents come and presidents go, and while the President does really matter, itâs the democratic principles that have made us that leader for more than two centuries and that have been sturdy enough to transcend political and ideological differences, a civil war, two world wars, and a century of technological and societal upheaval.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Through it all we have remained historyâs greatest force for good because we have stayed true to who we are â one nation, under God, with liberty and justice for all.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">This election may well be one of the most consequential of many generations because the next President will face so many complex pressures â from within and without.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">They will force tough decisions from not only our leaders but from each of us, and we wonât always like our options.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">The issues we confront &#8211; from fighting ISIS, handling Russia, China, North Korea and the Middle East to addressing displaced workers, civil rights and the new plague of drug addiction at home as well as slow economic growth and rising debt are all âCRITICAL.â</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">The importance of making the right choices certainly cannot be under-stated.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">It can overload us if we let it.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">But even in the face of this multitude of complex, thorny problems, clarity can emerge.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">From the fog of anxiety, the seemingly endless choices can be reduced and then reduced again and reduced again and they eventually are whittled down to just two.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Here they are: Will we turn our backs on the ideals of America that have seen us through for more than two centuries; or, are we going to reaffirm that America is, in Ronald Reaganâs words, âThis last best hope for man on earth?â</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">This is our choice.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody"><strong><u>Â </u></strong></p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody"><strong><u>A Path to Darkness</u></strong></p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">For some, the challenges we face, the myriad choices, the potential changes that each decision presents â it could give rise to fear or anger.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">It could be paralyzing.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">The response for some is to retreat into the pastâto yearn for âthe way things used to be.â</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">To these people, todayâs America is only seen as a broken place, and the people who did the breaking are âthe other:â people with more moneyâor less money, people with different-sounding last names, or different religious beliefs, or different colored skin or lifestyles or â whateverâ¦you get the idea&#8230;</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">We have been told that, because of all this change, America has become dark, that we have succumbed and that we are no longer strong.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">We are told that we are no longer respected in the world.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">In fact, we are even told that foreign governments are actually controlling our destiny because they have become smarter than us and tougher than us.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">This picture of America in economic and moral decline is, of course, always followed up with warnings of our impending destruction.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">For many Americans these fears and this outlook are as real as the building we are in today.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">And the anger they cause is real.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">It is true, we are fighters in America, but we fight for what is good and what is right â and when we do that we win.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Donât let anyone ever tell you otherwise.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">When we come together, when we unite as a country, America always wins.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">For those who are angry or afraid, I want to assure you there is another, better way.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Some who feed off of the fears and anger that is felt by some of us and exploit it feed their own insatiable desire for fame or attention.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">That could drive America down into a ditch, not make us great again.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Just as disturbing are the solutions they offer.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">We have heard proposals to create a religious test for immigration, to target neighborhoods for surveillance, impose draconian tariffs which would crush trade and destroy American jobs.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">We have heard proposals to drop out of NATO, abandon Europe to Russia, possibly use nuclear weapons in Europe, end our defense partnerships in Asia, and tell our Middle East allies that they have to go it alone.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">We have been offered hollow promises to impose a value-added tax, balance budgets through simple and whimsical cuts in âfraud, waste and abuse.â</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">We have been promised that unpopular laws shall be repealed simply through the will of a strong man in the White House and that Supreme Court justices will be empowered with some new extra-constitutional ability to investigate former public officials.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">I have stood on a stage and watched with amazement as candidates wallowed in the mud, viciously attacked one another, called each other liars and disparaged each otherâs character.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Those who continuously push that type of behavior are not worthy of the office they are seeking.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">And as for me, I will not take the low road to the highest office in the land.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Just as an all-consuming fear of America in decline ends in visions of Americaâs destruction, a political strategy based on exploiting Americans instead of lifting them up inevitably leads to divisions, paranoia, isolation, and promises that can never, ever be fulfilled.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">I say to you that this path to darkness is the antithesis of all that America has meant for 240 years.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody"><strong><u>Â </u></strong></p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody"><strong><u>America IS Great</u></strong></p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Some have a different response to the pressures they see bearing down on Americaâand themselves.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">It would never occur to me that America would breakâor could breakâfrom challenges to our economy or security.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">We harden with resolve through ingenuity and coming together.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">We canât sit by idly and expect fate or destiny to sweep in and rescue us.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">We always roll up our sleeves and get to work when the going gets tough.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">We have never seen the American spirit fail.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Americaâs strength is that we are bound by shared ideas, by communities and families and people who are free, creative and giving.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">This is what makes America great, not some politician or some law.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">The spirit of our country rests in us.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">And, notwithstanding all our challenges, America still is great.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Take any measure, whether itâs life expectancy, medicine, nutrition, technology, innovation, transportation or even economic power.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Americaâs economy is still the largest and most productive in the world.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Weâre bigger than the next two economies &#8211; China and Japan &#8211; combined.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">America still leads the world in making things.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">America is among the largest exporters of goods and services in the world.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">America is home to six out of the top ten universities in the world.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">America is the worldâs inventor and leads in intellectual property.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Donât let anybody, particularly a politician, tell you that America is not great.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">That doesnât mean we arenât capable of drifting.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">We canâand we have been.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">And, too many Americans are still being left behindâor are making it but feel betrayed by a system that became âtoo big to fail.â</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Too many feel that government and politicians have betrayed them.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">There are a lot of Americans who ask why no one is speaking for them?</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Why is it, no one is working for you?</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Why is it, you hear all these promises from politicians and nothing comes of it?</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">And, you are right.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">For too long, politicians have been making promises based upon polling or what was politically expedient.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">That is not leadership.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Leadership is the willingness to walk a lonely road with a team of people with their eyes fixed on the horizon focused on solving problems and healing our country.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Leading is serving.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody"><strong><u>Â </u></strong></p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody"><strong><u>Another Path</u></strong></p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">There is a better, higher path.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">True leadership means pursuing it, even if it is hard.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">The sacrifice is part of the job, however, because leaders canât lead unless they are servants first.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">To run for President you have to respect the dignity of a job where close to 320 million people are depending on you.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Our campaigns should be full of ideas that provide energy and solutions, innovations and excitement for whatever office we are running for.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Because we all have to look our families in the eyes and know that we raised the bar.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">I want to be able to look my wife and daughters in the eyes and know that theyâre proud of me and the campaign we are running.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">American leadership is at its finest when it buckles on that irrepressible âcan doâ spirit that says anything is possible and that everyone can participate in Americaâs blessings.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">You see, we can restore our economy, rebuild our military, make America safe from terrorism and re-engage as the leader in the world again.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">We can do this with reasonable and proven solutions rooted in the American ideals that have seen us through tough days before.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">The proven solutions are right in front of us.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">We know what needs to be done.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">There is no better and quicker cure to Americaâs challenges than to grow the economy and stimulate private sector job creation.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">To have the resources to solve problems we need economic strength.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">In the 90s when we balanced the federal budget, paid down the federal debt, cut taxes and created surpluses, the result was a sustained period of economic growth, lower interest rates, job creation and national prosperity.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Businesses were growing, unemployment was at historic lows and nearly anyone who wanted a job, could have one.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">In fact, the labor market became a buyerâs market for the job seeker.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">This was no small feat.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Think for a moment about what we did: for the first time since Americans walked on the moon the federal government had a balanced budget.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">We didnât only balance the budget.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">We were also able to reform welfare, end generational dependency; reform the pentagon to strengthen our defenses, cut the capital gains tax and much more.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">You know, I tell younger audiences about this and they look at me like Iâm crazy.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">They donât believe it ever happened.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">But, we know it did and it can happen again.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">It just takes leadership, the will to challenge the status quo and a willingness to work across the aisle.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Yes, we have to be willing to work with the other party.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">I believe that Americans are not only fed up with Washington for what they have not done but also tired of the partisan bickering.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">That doesnât mean you compromise your principles.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">I donât think anyone would accuse Ronald Reagan of compromising his principles, but he did work with the Democrat Speaker, Tip OâNeil.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Thatâs because Ronald Reagan was a leader.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">The job of a leader is to first slow down and listen.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Then, you set an agenda that meets Americaâs needs and you bring everyone together to make it reality.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Thereâs no place for dividing, polarizing, pointing fingers or trading on short term political gain.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">I hold to this philosophy of leadership because I watched great leaders practice it successfully and Iâve seen it work in my own experience.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">I worked for ten years to pass that balanced budget.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">It was hard work.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">When I became chairman of the budget committee, our team was able to get it done &#8211; even with a Democrat in the White House.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">We were proud when we reformed welfare and as a member of the Armed Services Committee we all came together to reform the Pentagon and realign our military services that resulted in a central command structure that allowed the services to work together.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Itâs the same formula we used in Ohio.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">We were facing an $8 billion deficit and had lost 350,000 jobs.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">In a few short years we turned that deficit into a surplus of $2 billion and gave Ohioans the largest tax cut of any state in the country.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">We even repealed the death tax.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Ohio has now created 417,000 private sector jobs.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Itâs working.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">And we continue to work to make sure that no one is left behind.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">This can work for America again as well.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">This is why Iâve proposed a 100 Day agenda for when I am President.</p>
<ul>
<li>We will restore our economy with a fiscal plan to balance the budget.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>We will freeze all federal regulations for one year except health and safety, and rebuild our rulemaking system to stop crushing small businesses.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>We will simplify and reduce the taxes on individuals so all Americans keep more of what they earn.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>We will reduce taxes on businesses and end double taxation so that they will invest in America and not in Europe.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>We will send welfare, education, Medicaid, highway infrastructure and job training back to where we live in the states.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>We will protect the border and use common sense on immigration reform that includes a guest worker program.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>And, we will fix social security so that we keep the promise to our seniors and future generations.</li>
</ul>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">When we do these things, we will unleash economic growth which means more jobs, higher wages, and the restoration of the American Dream that our children will inherit a better America than we received from our parents.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">With increased stability and strength America can rebuild its military while at the same time reform the pentagon to operate like a 21<sup>st</sup> century enterprise.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">We will resume leadership of the world and as we do that we will treat our veterans with respect and lift them to make sure they have what they need whether itâs healthcare, jobs or housing.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">When America is strong, less dependent on debt and growing economically, we can reclaim our place as a leader in the world.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Finally, when America is strong and actively engaged in the world, the world is a safer place and America is a safer place.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">You know, this is why we do these things.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">This is about how we want our country to be.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">You see, economic growth is not an end unto itself.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">It is a means to make possible everything we want for our nation and our communities and our families.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">And, by the way, as we have growth, we have the ability to bring in from the cold those who live in the shadows, those who are forgotten.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">The poor, the mentally ill, the disabled.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">As Americans, we believe that everyone deserves a chance to get ahead.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">We give them the chance when we give them a hand.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Everyone should have an opportunity to pursue their God given destiny.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody"><strong><u>Â </u></strong></p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody"><strong><u>The American Spirit</u></strong></p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Yes, there is much to fix in America.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Yes, there are reasons for our anxieties and fears.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Our country has been drifting.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Why?</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Because we have forgotten the formula that makes us strong and caved to political considerations instead.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Weâve seemed to have lost our way.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">We are stalled.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">We are at risk of jeopardizing a better future for our children.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">I understand why Americans are fearful and distrustful and looking for a reason for the way they feel.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">I was raised in a small Pennsylvania steel town where if the wind blew the wrong way, people would be out of work.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Itâs awful to feel that insecurity.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">To feel that circumstances are out of your control.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">To feel like nobody cares and all the institutions have abandoned you.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">But, we Americans have overcome challenges before.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Some think that the anger some Americans are expressing is defined by some nostalgic look backward for simpler times.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">I donât agree.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">What Americans are looking for is that quality of leadership we are sorely missing from the past to address todayâs problems.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">At each moment of crises in America, we have united as a country and a people.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Itâs always been our secret weapon.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Itâs so simple but it is also invincible.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">I spoke earlier about the spirit of our country.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">But, let me say, our strength and spirit does not reside with a president or any politician.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Our strength resides within ourselves.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">The spirit of our country rests in the neighborhoods.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">It rests in our people.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">We are the ones with the strength to change the world.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">The power is within each and every one of us.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">A united America is undefeatable.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">We are an exceptional country.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">And thatâs because we are the exception in history â we are not an ethnic group or religion or language.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">We are that last great hope for earth that Reagan often spoke of, because we have shown that when people from many different backgrounds and ideas and beliefs come together with a common, noble purposeâto be free and justâwe are unbeatable.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody"><strong><u>Â </u></strong></p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody"><strong><u>Two Paths</u></strong></p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Two paths.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">One choiceâthe path that exploits anger, encourages resentment, turns fear into hatred and divides people.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">This path solves nothing, demeans our history, weakens our country and cheapens each of us.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">It has but one beneficiary and that is to the politician who speaks of it.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">The other path is the one America has been down before.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">It is well trod, it is at times steep, but it is solid.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">It is the same path our forebears took together.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">It is from this higher path that we are offered the greater view.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">And, imagine for a moment with me that view.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Fear turns to hope because we remember to take strength from each other.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Uncertainty turns to peace because we reclaim our faith in the American ideals that have carried us upward before.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">And Americaâs supposed decline becomes its finest hour, because we came together to say ânoâ to those who would prey on our human weakness and instead chose leadership that serves, helping us look up, not down.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">This is the path I believe in.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">This is the America I believe in.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">And, this is the America I know all Americans want us to be.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Please, join me on this higher path.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Together, united, we can reclaim the America we love and hold so dear.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">And lift all of us up to partake in its, and the Lordâs, many blessings.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Thank you.</p>
