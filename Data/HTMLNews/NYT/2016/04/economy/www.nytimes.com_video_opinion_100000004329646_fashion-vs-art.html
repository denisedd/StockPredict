Harold Koda interview
	There is the perennial debate about whether or not fashion can ever be art.

LOWER THIRD

Curator in Charge, The Costume Institute
The Metropolitan Museum of Art

Shots in Museum Great Hall

Harold Koda (V.O)
	It has in some instances  to do with intention.  But just because it&#39;s clothes, doesn&#39;t mean it can&#39;t be art.

Shots of tour group gathering.

Tour Guide
	The name of this tour is &quot;Fashion and Art&quot;

Harold Koda (V.O)
	Fashion is laden with cultural, social, aesthetic ideas--everything that we subject the criteria of art to.

Tour Guide
	What we do is look at the objects of art--masterpieces and highlights of our collection--from a very interesting viewpoint: what are the people wearing in the object of art?  And more than that: what does it mean?  This is something almost no one talks about, but sometimes it&#39;s 60 to 70 percent of the object of art anyway.  So I hope you will see fashion is not trivial.

Thomas Campbell interview
	When I started off as a curator, art was considered to be painting, architecture, and sculpture.  Anything outside of that was decorative arts, and, quite frankly, looked down on--costume and fashion being one example of that.

LOWER THIRD
Thomas Campbell
Director, The Metropolitan Museum of Art

Shots of tour stopped at Greek sculpture

Tour Guide
	Our first object dates from Ancient Greece.  The basic garment was made by one long length of linen.  The flax had to be picked, it had to be spun, it had to be woven by hand, and in war the soldiers who were victorious would kill the men and capture the women as slaves to do the spinning and the weaving.  So the fabric represents a great deal.

Andrew Bolton interview
Fashion is still considered more in the female domain than something like painting, and I think that&#39;s the reason why some people are quick to dismiss fashion as art.

Tour moving on to new gallery

Tour Guide
	So we will move on to another culture altogether, another civilization altogether.

Thomas Campbell (V.O)
	It&#39;s our role as a center of art and culture to give fashion and costume respect and attention.

Shots of Anna Wintour Costume Center

Anna Wintour interview
	Fashion should be recognized for how it defines a time, how it can be controversial, how it can be revolutionary.

LOWER THIRD
Anna Wintour
Trustee, The Metropolitan Museum of Art
Editor in Chief, Vogue

Shots of Tour Guide in medieval gallery

Tour Guide
	So right now we are in Burgundy in France.  These are courtiers in a rose garden.  This is one of the earliest examples we have of cut and tailored clothing.  With the growth of big, powerful courts, people began to want to outdo each other in a fashion sense.  You are looking at the red carpet of the 1450s and 60s.

Cross Dissolve to Met Gala red carpet

Harold Koda (V.O)
	Fashion seems frivolous and trivial to the 19th century attitudes about fine art.  There&#39;s a kind of puritanical tradition, and we hate the notion that there might be commerce associated with anything, because somehow that makes it less pure.
But as the definitions of art have become more elastic--post-Dada, post-Warhol--we&#39;re no longer bound by the 19th century categories of art.

Anna Wintour interview
	In the world that we work in, you need the mixture of art and commerce. They need to exist hand in hand.

Harold Koda (V.O)
	High fashion paired with celebrity becomes something bigger than both.

Tour group looking at &quot;Madame X&quot; by John Singer Sargent

Tour Guide
	Alright, we&#39;re going to finish the tour with John Singer Sargent.  This is Madame X.  People wanted the artists of the day to advance themselves, and the artists of the day wanted the famous people in order to advance their career.

Shots of red carpet

Baz Luhrmann interview
	The art of what someone wears is as important and as revealing an artifact as a particular portrait painted at a particular time.

LOWER THIRD
Baz Luhrmann
Film Director
Creative Consultant for the Met Gala

Tour Group at John Singer Sargent portrait

Tour Guide
	What we don&#39;t see and what we don&#39;t know about this white duck skirt is what it&#39;s saying about society.  When people were in the industrial world, and they were in factories all day long, it suddenly became a status symbol to have a suntan.  So this shows a complete switch in values.

Andrew Bolton interview
	Fashion can be used to tell stories about gender, race, and identity, and challenge us to rethink what is beautiful and challenge our prejudices and our expecations.

Shots of red carpet

Andre Leon Talley interview
	Everyone aspires to go higher in life, to be better than they are, and these moments in a museum give you moments of betterment.  Escapism, yes, but this could be inspiring. This could inspire someone.

LOWER THIRD
André Leon Talley
Contributing Editor, Vogue

Baz Luhrmann interview
	This is the achievement of having no delineation between what is high and low culture, what is right and wrong history.

Harold Koda interview
	There is the perennial debate about whether or not fashion can ever be art.

LOWER THIRD

Curator in Charge, The Costume Institute

Shots in Museum Great Hall

Harold Koda (V.O)
	It has in some instances  to do with intention.  But just because it&#39;s clothes, doesn&#39;t mean it can&#39;t be art.

Shots of tour group gathering.

Tour Guide
	The name of this tour is &quot;Fashion and Art&quot;

Harold Koda (V.O)
	Fashion is laden with cultural, social, aesthetic ideas--everything that we subject the criteria of art to.

Tour Guide
	What we do is look at the objects of art--masterpieces and highlights of our collection--from a very interesting viewpoint: what are the people wearing in the object of art?  And more than that: what does it mean?  This is something almost no one talks about, but sometimes it&#39;s 60 to 70 percent of the object of art anyway.  So I hope you will see fashion is not trivial.

Thomas Campbell interview
	When I started off as a curator, art was considered to be painting, architecture, and sculpture.  Anything outside of that was decorative arts, and, quite frankly, looked down on--costume and fashion being one example of that.

LOWER THIRD
Thomas Campbell
Director, The Metropolitan Museum of Art

Shots of tour stopped at Greek sculpture

Tour Guide
	Our first object dates from Ancient Greece.  The basic garment was made by one long length of linen.  The flax had to be picked, it had to be spun, it had to be woven by hand, and in war the soldiers who were victorious would kill the men and capture the women as slaves to do the spinning and the weaving.  So the fabric represents a great deal.

Andrew Bolton interview
Fashion is still considered more in the female domain than something like painting, and I think that&#39;s the reason why some people are quick to dismiss fashion as art.

Tour moving on to new gallery

Tour Guide
	So we will move on to another culture altogether, another civilization altogether.

Thomas Campbell (V.O)
	It&#39;s our role as a center of art and culture to give fashion and costume respect and attention.

Shots of Anna Wintour Costume Center

Anna Wintour interview
	Fashion should be recognized for how it defines a time, how it can be controversial, how it can be revolutionary.

LOWER THIRD
Anna Wintour
Trustee, The Metropolitan Museum of Art
Editor in Chief, Vogue

Shots of Tour Guide in medieval gallery

Tour Guide
	So right now we are in Burgundy in France.  These are courtiers in a rose garden.  This is one of the earliest examples we have of cut and tailored clothing.  With the growth of big, powerful courts, people began to want to outdo each other in a fashion sense.  You are looking at the red carpet of the 1450s and 60s.

Cross Dissolve to Met Gala red carpet

Harold Koda (V.O)
	Fashion seems frivolous and trivial to the 19th century attitudes about fine art.  There&#39;s a kind of puritanical tradition, and we hate the notion that there might be commerce associated with anything, because somehow that makes it less pure.
But as the definitions of art have become more elastic--post-Dada, post-Warhol--we&#39;re no longer bound by the 19th century categories of art.

Anna Wintour interview
	In the world that we work in, you need the mixture of art and commerce. They need to exist hand in hand.

Harold Koda (V.O)
	High fashion paired with celebrity becomes something bigger than both.

Tour group looking at &quot;Madame X&quot; by John Singer Sargent

Tour Guide
	Alright, we&#39;re going to finish the tour with John Singer Sargent.  This is Madame X.  People wanted the artists of the day to advance themselves, and the artists of the day wanted the famous people in order to advance their career.

Shots of red carpet

Baz Luhrmann interview
	The art of what someone wears is as important and as revealing an artifact as a particular portrait painted at a particular time.

LOWER THIRD
Baz Luhrmann
Film Director
Creative Consultant for the Met Gala

Tour Group at John Singer Sargent portrait

Tour Guide
	What we don&#39;t see and what we don&#39;t know about this white duck skirt is what it&#39;s saying about society.  When people were in the industrial world, and they were in factories all day long, it suddenly became a status symbol to have a suntan.  So this shows a complete switch in values.

Andrew Bolton interview
	Fashion can be used to tell stories about gender, race, and identity, and challenge us to rethink what is beautiful and challenge our prejudices and our expecations.

Shots of red carpet

Andre Leon Talley interview
	Everyone aspires to go higher in life, to be better than they are, and these moments in a museum give you moments of betterment.  Escapism, yes, but this could be inspiring. This could inspire someone.

LOWER THIRD
André Leon Talley
Contributing Editor, Vogue

Baz Luhrmann interview
	This is the achievement of having no delineation between what is high and low culture, what is right and wrong history.
