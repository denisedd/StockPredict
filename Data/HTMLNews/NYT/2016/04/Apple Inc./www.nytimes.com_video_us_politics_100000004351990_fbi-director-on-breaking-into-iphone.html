Wide of James Comey talking to moderator Brooke Masters
//
SOUNDBITE (English) James Comey, FBI Director:
&quot;We were able to get into the phone because in an odd way all of the controversy and attention around the litigation I think stimulated a bit of a marketplace around the world, which didn&#39;t exist before then, for people trying to figure out could they break into an Apple 5C running iOS9. And those details matter, obviously, because that&#39;s the phone that the terrorist left behind and as a result of that stimulation, while the litigation was ongoing, we didn&#39;t stop trying to figure whether or not we could get in, but somebody approached us from outside the government and said we think we&#39;ve come up with a solution and we tested it and tested it and tested it and then we purchased it and we were able to, once we knew it would get us into the phone we were able to withdraw the litigation and in my view that&#39;s a good reason, a good thing for a couple of different reasons. First, we got into the phone, which is a very important part of the investigation. And second, litigation is not a great place to resolve hard values questions that implicate all kinds of things that all of us care about and the emotion and pain around that case was a bit of a distraction frankly from a more important conversation that I think we have to have. And so in that sense it&#39;s also good that the litigation was no longer necessary but I hope it doesn&#39;t lead people to stop talking about it. And from your question, it&#39;s clear to me people aren&#39;t going to stop. They shouldn&#39;t. They should continue to talk about it because we have a problem where all of us share a set of values that are in conflict and we have to figure out how to resolve privacy and security on the internet and on our devices with public safety and they&#39;re crashing into each other in terrorism cases and really all the work the FBI does. And I don&#39;t know exactly what the answer is, but we need an answer and we can&#39;t let ourselves drift. So I hope the conversation will continue. So that&#39;s the story of how we ended up getting into the phone and the investigation obviously continues but this will be a feature of our work. There will be other litigation I&#39;m sure but it will be a feature of our work increasingly over the months and years to come.&quot;

UPSOUND (English) Brooke Masters, Moderator: &quot;So how much did you pay for this software?&quot;
//
SOUNDBITE (English) James Comey, FBI Director:
&quot;A lot. More than I will make in the remainder of this job, which is seven years and four months for sure. And so, but it was in my view worth it.&quot;">

Wide of James Comey talking to moderator Brooke Masters
//
SOUNDBITE (English) James Comey, FBI Director:
&quot;We were able to get into the phone because in an odd way all of the controversy and attention around the litigation I think stimulated a bit of a marketplace around the world, which didn&#39;t exist before then, for people trying to figure out could they break into an Apple 5C running iOS9. And those details matter, obviously, because that&#39;s the phone that the terrorist left behind and as a result of that stimulation, while the litigation was ongoing, we didn&#39;t stop trying to figure whether or not we could get in, but somebody approached us from outside the government and said we think we&#39;ve come up with a solution and we tested it and tested it and tested it and then we purchased it and we were able to, once we knew it would get us into the phone we were able to withdraw the litigation and in my view that&#39;s a good reason, a good thing for a couple of different reasons. First, we got into the phone, which is a very important part of the investigation. And second, litigation is not a great place to resolve hard values questions that implicate all kinds of things that all of us care about and the emotion and pain around that case was a bit of a distraction frankly from a more important conversation that I think we have to have. And so in that sense it&#39;s also good that the litigation was no longer necessary but I hope it doesn&#39;t lead people to stop talking about it. And from your question, it&#39;s clear to me people aren&#39;t going to stop. They shouldn&#39;t. They should continue to talk about it because we have a problem where all of us share a set of values that are in conflict and we have to figure out how to resolve privacy and security on the internet and on our devices with public safety and they&#39;re crashing into each other in terrorism cases and really all the work the FBI does. And I don&#39;t know exactly what the answer is, but we need an answer and we can&#39;t let ourselves drift. So I hope the conversation will continue. So that&#39;s the story of how we ended up getting into the phone and the investigation obviously continues but this will be a feature of our work. There will be other litigation I&#39;m sure but it will be a feature of our work increasingly over the months and years to come.&quot;

UPSOUND (English) Brooke Masters, Moderator: &quot;So how much did you pay for this software?&quot;
//
SOUNDBITE (English) James Comey, FBI Director:
&quot;A lot. More than I will make in the remainder of this job, which is seven years and four months for sure. And so, but it was in my view worth it.&quot;">
