Writing Her Own History
</div>
<div class='listy_subhead'>
By Frank Bruni
</div>
<div class='listy_body'>
<p>PHILADELPHIA — To hear her daughter, to watch a video about her life and to listen to her own words, it was hard to believe that a significant majority of Americans hold a negative view of Hillary Clinton, finding her untrustworthy and dishonest. </p><p>How could that be true of such a devoted mother, such an exuberant grandmother and such a champion of the underprivileged, with such a big, ready laugh? Do we know her at all? Have we gotten her entirely wrong?</p><p>Those were the precise questions that the climactic hours of the Democratic National Convention <span class="aBn"><span class="aQJ">on Thursday</span></span> night meant for us to ask.</p><p>The party was making history with a female nominee, and it rightly and fully celebrated that, imagining a woman in the American presidency for the first time, after all this time. “When any barrier falls in America,” Clinton said in her speech, “it clears the way for everyone. After all, when there are no ceilings, the sky’s the limit.”</p><p>But this particular woman needed to be humanized, softened. In order to touch the sky, she had to reach out as never before. Her story had to be transformed from one of unquenchable ambition to one of boundless heart, and the urgency of the task was underscored by the attention to detail with which she and her campaign team went about it.</p><p>That video, shown just before Clinton took the stage, was produced by Shonda Rhimes. It was narrated by Morgan Freeman. He concluded by telling Americans that “this is the woman.”</p><p>Then Clinton appeared, to music with these lyrics: “This is my fight song, take-back-my-life song.”</p><p>She was taking back her life in order to claim her desired future.</p><p>“Sometimes, the people at this podium are new to the national stage,” she said. “As you know, I’m not one of those people.” Then she gave a quick recitation of her resume.</p><p>“But my job titles only tell you what I’ve done,” she added. “They don’t tell you why. The truth is, through all these years of public service, the ‘service’ part has always come easier to me than the ‘public’ part. I get it that some people just don’t know what to make of me.”</p><p>It was an extraordinary admission for someone who’s been in the public eye for a quarter century. It was also a necessary one. And it spoke to one of the many oddities of this transcendently odd election. Perhaps the most familiar person ever to run for the White House must use the process to introduce herself — or, rather, re-re-reintroduce herself — to voters.</p><p>In any other year, with any other matchup, that might be politically fatal. I don’t think it will be for Clinton, and her speech, like much of the convention, showed why. The case against Donald Trump is a damning one, and she and other Democrats know how to make it, presenting him as someone who will threaten our national security and throw our most cherished values in the trash, someone of inadequate preparation and an undetectable soul.</p><p>“A man you can bait with a Tweet is not a man we can trust with nuclear weapons,” Clinton said at one point, to a roar from the crowd.</p><p>“For the past year,” she later added, “many people made the mistake of laughing off Donald Trump’s comments — excusing him as an entertainer just putting on a show. They thought he couldn’t possibly mean all the horrible things he says, like when he called women ‘pigs.’ Or said that an American judge couldn’t be fair because of his Mexican heritage. Or when he mocks and mimics a reporter with a disability.” She gave additional examples from the seemingly endless list.</p><p>“But here’s the sad truth: There is no other Donald Trump,” she concluded. “This is it. And in the end, it comes down to what Donald Trump doesn’t get — America <em>is</em> great, because America is good.”</p><p>Her speech wasn’t a memorable one. It was too much of a laundry list, with too little shape and a delivery that was rushed and mechanical at times. But it was full of terrific lines, and the crowd went wild when she acknowledged the milestone of her nomination, saying: “Standing here as my mother’s daughter, and my daughter’s mother, I’m so happy this day has come. I’m happy for grandmothers and little girls and everyone in between.”</p><p>Before <span class="aBn"><span class="aQJ">Thursday</span></span> night, there was extensive talk about the tough acts she was following, the long shadows cast by Michelle Obama, by Joe Biden and, above all, by Barack Obama, whose remarks <span class="aBn"><span class="aQJ">on Wednesday</span></span> night were some of his most exquisite.</p><p>But the yardstick for her wasn’t really any of those more polished or accessible orators. Nor was it Trump, whose own big convention speech presented the peculiar vision of an even more peculiar candidate not readily comparable to anyone else.</p><p>The yardstick for Clinton was Clinton herself — and her tendency to come across as programmed, guarded, remote. If many Americans look askance at her, it’s not just because Republicans have so persistently encouraged them to. It’s because she can seem so far away, on the opposite side of a moat that she dug herself and has little interest in letting people traverse.</p><p><span class="aBn"><span class="aQJ">On Thursday</span></span> night she needed to drop a few of her defenses, step outside of her fortress and assure Americans that her famous capacity for grueling work includes whatever effort is necessary to repair the breach of trust reflected in those unfavorable ratings.</p><p>She got only part of the way there, but that distance was crucial and could well be enough. She shared tales — carefully selected, of course — about her grandfather, her father and her mother, who, she recounted, “was abandoned by her parents as a young girl. She ended up on her own at 14, working as a house maid.”</p><p>Mothers and daughters and children in general: Clinton and the people who talked about her kept coming back to that, and while the intent was obvious — to communicate that she wasn’t all stiffness and steel — the tactic verged on overkill and was a discouraging confirmation of sexist double standards.</p><p>A man doesn’t have to prove first that he’s been a model father to be allowed to ascend to the pinnacle of his career. But apparently a woman has to show that she hasn’t shortchanged motherhood in order to get the green light.</p><p>Her conduct as a mother is seen as a window into her character, and she can’t possibly be a warm person unless she’s been a warm parent. That was the context for much of Bill Clinton’s tribute to Hillary and for almost all of Chelsea Clinton’s.</p><p>Chelsea introduced Hillary as a grandmother who will drop everything on her way to a speech or a debate and use FaceTime “for a few minutes of blowing kisses and reading ‘Chugga-Chugga Choo-Choo’ with her granddaughter.” She said that Hillary faithfully attended her soccer games and music recitals.</p><p>“Thoughtful,” she called her. “Hilarious.”</p><p>I’ll be fascinated to see what kind of bounce Hillary gets in the polls. I predict that it will be a big one, not because Americans suddenly see her in a wholly new light but because the Democrats’ gathering here was everything that the Republicans’ in Cleveland was not: coherently choreographed, packed full of emotional highlights, packed even fuller with the party’s most respected leaders, and consistent in its messaging about Trump, which was lethal.</p><p>No one who was watching during the early hours <span class="aBn"><span class="aQJ">Thursday</span></span> night will soon shake off the words of Khizr Khan, whose son, Humayun Khan, was killed in combat in Iraq in 2004. Humayun was a United States Army captain. He was also a Muslim. He died for his country, in an act of altruism and bravery, and his father summoned that memory as he said: “Hillary Clinton was right when she called my son ‘the best of America.’ If it was up to Donald Trump, he would never have been in America.”</p><p>He looked toward the cameras and addressed Trump directly: “Let me ask you, have you even read the United States constitution? I will gladly lend you my copy.” He held it in its hand.</p><p>That’s the kind of question and gesture that should doom Trump and likely will. Warm or cold, accessible or aloof, Clinton is smart enough to take advantage of that.</p><p>“Our country’s motto is ‘e pluribus unum’ — out of many, we are one,” she said <span class="aBn"><span class="aQJ">on Thursday</span></span> night, in a speech whose importance to her, and to the country, cannot be overstated. “Will we stay true to that motto?”</p><p> <br><em></em></p><p><em>Frank Bruni is an Op-Ed columnist for The Times.</em></p>

How Twitter Shaped Convention Slogans
</div>
<div class='listy_subhead'>
By Virginia Heffernan
</div>
<div class='listy_body'>
<p>On social media over the past two weeks, each party’s convention generated impressive entries in what became a massively multiplayer game of digital “dozens” — a battle to insult, nickname, meme, gif and hashtag both Donald J. Trump and Hillary Clinton. On Twitter, one measure of the success of a convention speech was how quickly a succinct phrase from it appeared and proliferated. </p><p>Throughout the Democratic National Convention, three-word slogans proved especially suitable for hashtags. Barack Obama reprised “don’t boo, vote” (for delegates who jeered mention of Mr. Trump), while Senator Tim Kaine landed on “not one word” (for the number of believable words spoken by Mr. Trump). Mr. Kaine had another winner with “si se puede,” the Spanish twist on Mr. Obama’s original “Yes, we can.” @CharlesLandy cheered Mr. Kaine’s hashtag prowess, tweeting that he was “CRUSHING this” by “making trending hashtags with every sentence.” </p><p>Vice President Joe Biden nailed “not a clue” (for Mr. Trump’s understanding of the middle class), which, together with Mr. Kaine’s #notoneword, made one-two punch attack on Mr. Trump’s ignorance and mendacity. The Clinton campaign, of course, had seeded the hashtags #imwithher, #dealusin and #lovetrumpshate, and when Senator Al Franken and the actresses Lena Dunham and America Ferrera used the campaign slogans, Twitter dutifully echoed them. </p><p>Last week, the Republican National Convention had a hit with #lockherup, a vigilante cry that sounded in the arena and then played brilliantly on Twitter, even during the Democratic National Convention’s broadcast last night. A subplot emerged, however, when the concerted effort to get the hashtag to “trend” led to conspiracy musings about how Twitter might have hidden its popularity. A tweeter called @Lion_PartyUSA asked why #lockherup wasn’t trending, concluding, “I hope WikiLeaks builds an alternative.” A WikiLeaks Twitter? Interesting idea. </p><p>When speakers and candidates work backward from Twitter’s conventions and space constraints to build phrases aimed to trend as hashtags, it’s clear that the medium is profoundly shaping the message. However, as Mrs. Clinton said last night in what might have been her best line, there’s a time to jump off Twitter, especially when the stakes get high. “A man you can bait with a tweet is not a man you can trust with nuclear weapons,” she said, breaking free of hashtag character constraints. </p><p>“Don’t tweet, vote,” she might have added. </p><p><em>Virginia Heffernan, a former television critic and internet columnist at The Times, is the author of “Magic and Loss: The Internet as Art.”</em></p>

Big Night for Wellesley ‘69
</div>
<div class='listy_subhead'>
By Emma Roller
</div>
<div class='listy_body'>
<p>PHILADELPHIA — <span class="aBn"><span class="aQJ">Tonight</span></span> is a big night for the alumnae of Wellesley College, the all-women’s liberal arts school in Massachusetts that counts Hillary Clinton as a graduate. Eleven of her fellow members of the class of 1969 are in the Wells Fargo Center <span class="aBn"><span class="aQJ">tonight</span></span> to watch their friend and former classmate formally accept the Democratic Party’s nomination. </p><p>I asked a few Wellesley alumnae and current students how it has felt to see Mrs. Clinton’s ascension in politics, and what this moment means. Here’s what they had to say. </p><p><strong>Suzanne Salomon, </strong><strong>Class of 1969</strong> </p><p>Ms. Salomon lived with Mrs. Clinton for three years in college. </p><p>“I thought she was incredibly warm, amazingly smart, directed, caring about the people around her and her friends. She’s one of the most loyal people I’ve met,” she said. “It makes me very sad that she comes across — apparently, to many people — as being cold, reserved, calculating. She’s so warm and caring.” </p><p>She added, “This is one of the most exciting moments in my whole life.” </p><p><strong>Janet Hill, </strong><strong>Class of 1969</strong> </p><p>Ms. Hill was involved in student government at Wellesley with Mrs. Clinton. Ms. Hill said she had some “adjustment problems” when she entered Wellesley in 1965, as a black woman coming from a segregated upbringing in New Orleans. Mrs. Clinton was one of the first white people she’d met, Ms. Hill said. She said she wanted to drop out of college after the first few days, but her mother and Mrs. Clinton both encouraged her to stay. Her son is now working for the Clinton campaign in Florida. </p><p>“It’s sobering to know that a person I’ve known 51 years and who’s always been a friend and been supportive of me and my family and someone to look up to is going to become the president of the United States,” she said. “I’m thrilled. I’m thrilled for her, but I’m thrilled for the country.” </p><p><strong>Mary Ross-Dolen, </strong><strong>Class of 1988</strong> </p><p>Ms. Ross-Dolen said she decided to run to be a delegate in Ohio’s 3rd Congressional District, despite having no previous political experience. </p><p>“It is a thrill to take part in the political process in order to propel Hillary to victory and make history,” Ms. Ross-Dolen wrote over email. </p><p><strong>Jennifer Sjogren, </strong><strong>Class of 2018</strong> </p><p>Ms. Sjogren, a rising junior, works for the Wellesley Students for Hillary group and said she was “ecstatic that Hillary will be president.” </p><p>“I don’t understand exactly how big of a deal a major party nominating their first woman presidential candidate is. Unlike Hillary and unlike my grandmothers, I didn’t grow up in a world that told me that I couldn’t because I was a girl,” she said. “Unlike every American woman who never got to see last night, I never doubted the possibility of a female president.” </p> <em>Emma Roller </em>(<a href="https://twitter.com/emmaroller">@EmmaRoller</a>)<em>, a former reporter for National Journal, is a contributing opinion writer.<br><br></em><p style="display: inline !important;"><em>An earlier version of this article misspelled the family name of a member of the Wellesley Class of 1969. She is Suzanne Salomon, not Solomon.</em> </p><div> </div><p style="text-decoration: line-through;"><br> </p>

Advice From Iowa for Hillary Clinton
</div>
<div class='listy_subhead'>
By Anna North
</div>
<div class='listy_body'>
<p>PHILADELPHIA — “We elect presidents in Iowa,” said Ora McQueen. </p><p>A 72-year-old Hillary Clinton delegate, Ms. McQueen noted that President Obama had carried Iowa twice. Mrs. Clinton barely eked out a win over Bernie Sanders there in January. </p><p>In the run-up to the caucus, <a href="http://takingnote.blogs.nytimes.com/2016/02/01/the-spirit-of-2008/" target="_blank">some Iowa voters</a> seemed torn between voting with their hearts, for Mr. Sanders, and with their heads, for Mrs. Clinton. And that divide was still in evidence among Iowa delegates in the Wells Fargo Center <span class="aBn"><span class="aQJ">on Thursday</span></span>, though some had advice for closing it. </p><p>“There’s good buzz in Iowa for our girl,” said Tara McNulty, a Clinton delegate, before the day’s convention proceedings began. Still, she said, “some people think she’s too reserved.” </p><p>“A lot of people feel like she’s a robot,” said Corey Jones, a 19-year-old Sanders delegate. “They don’t feel like she’s human.” </p><p>One solution, he said, was to show more emotion: “I think if she cried onstage, that would help a lot.” </p><p>Ms. McNulty thinks Mrs. Clinton needs to spend more face-to-face time with Iowa voters to counter the perception that she’s unapproachable and to win the state in November. </p><p>Ms. McQueen, too, wants Mrs. Clinton to spend more time in Iowa. In particular, she said, “I want to see Hillary continue addressing the women.” </p><p>Working in the male-dominated field of corrections, Ms. McQueen has seen many men she trained advance to executive positions, so equal pay for women is a key issue for her. Mrs. Clinton’s strength on wage equality helped Ms. McQueen make the decision to support her. </p><p>Aside from appealing to voters with sound proposals, Mrs. Clinton also has to manage sometimes-conflicting expectations that her male opponents — first Mr. Sanders, now Donald Trump — haven’t had to reckon with. As Mr. Jones put it, “being a woman in politics, she has to be tough, she has to be emotionless.” </p><p>“She has to put on that barrier,” he explained, but “if she doesn’t break that barrier, then we won’t really know who she is.” </p><p>“Striking a balance is hard,” said his friend Allie Hoskins, an 18-year-old Clinton delegate. “But I think she can do it. I think she can do it <span class="aBn"><span class="aQJ">tonight</span></span>.”<span class="st"><br><em></em></span> </p><p><em><span class="st">Anna North is a member of the Editorial Board.</span></em> </p>

Why It’s Still Hard for Women to Break Through
</div>
<div class='listy_subhead'>
By Elizabeth Williamson
</div>
<div class='listy_body'>
<p>PHILADELPHIA — The historian Annette Gordon-Reed said recently that she thinks it was easier for a black man to win the presidency than it will be for a white woman. </p><p>It was Ms. Gordon-Reed’s research that erased any doubt that Thomas Jefferson was the father of the children of his slave Sally Hemings. Her magisterial book, “The Hemingses of Monticello: An American Family,” won the Pulitzer Prize for history in 2009 and made her the first African-American woman to win that prize. Of course, that was also the year Barack Obama became the first black president of the United States. </p><p>Ms. Gordon-Reed believes it was easier for Mr. Obama to become the first black president than it will be for Hillary Clinton to become the first female one. She said that she didn’t think when the book was published in 2008 “there was any doubt about who most black people were going to vote for. But the gender thing is different. You can never get women to vote as a monolith — this is a deep cultural thing. </p><p>“Black men got the vote before women, which caused great dissension. Feminists supported abolition, but didn’t get the vote.” </p><p>The <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/07/25/us/politics/political-firsts.html" target="_blank">data </a>bears her out — white women are often the second or third group to break through the glass ceiling, usually after a black or Hispanic man has done it first. </p><p>For female candidates, she said: “If you’re too motherly that’s a problem, if you’re too young or sexual or pretty that’s a problem. Getting there, persuading people to love you, to trust you — how does a woman do that across a wide swath of the nation?” </p><p>Political analysts once thought a black presidential candidate would face a comparable, complicated challenge: For example, some thought that the first black president had to be a Republican, like Colin Powell. But along came Barack Obama, whose win blew away those notions — and suggested that Americans were more ready to embrace a minority president than a female one. </p><p>Now Mrs. Clinton is pitted against Donald Trump, a candidate who has a record of insulting women. Her candidacy, Ms. Gordon-Reed says, “is a test of the character of the American people. She should not underestimate the power of the forces aligned with Trump. She should continue to run an inclusive campaign, tell people what she’s for and focus on the positive things rather than trying to out-negative him.” </p><p>Convincing people to vote out of optimism, rather than fear, she said, was what John F. Kennedy and Ronald Reagan were about, as was Bill Clinton in the 1990s. </p><p>“Jefferson said you should not try to change people’s beliefs about things, because it will harden them in their stance. You’re better off sticking to your story, and maybe, in the fullness of time, people will be persuaded.” </p><em> Elizabeth Williamson is a member of the Times’s Editorial Board.</em>

Donald Trump’s Itchy Twitter Fingers
</div>
<div class='listy_subhead'>
By Mark Singer
</div>
<div class='listy_body'>
<p>All week, I’ve been wondering about Donald Trump’s hands. Yes, those hands, though not in <em>that</em> way. What have they been doing each night during prime time? Does he have full command of both thumbs and those eight — let us, for the moment, stipulate — normal-size fingers? </p><p>The Trump campaign has famously been understaffed. Still, might there possibly be a senior … handler whose sole duty each night is to snatch the Republican nominee’s cellphone at the sign of his Twitter fingers twitching? Someone to intervene before he goes digitally nuclear? Because he’s been known to do that. </p><p>Day 1, after the Bernie Sanders delegate mutiny was subdued, Trump tweeted a few fistfuls of salt to rub in the wounds. (“Sad to watch Bernie Sanders abandon his revolution … totally sold out to Crooked Hillary Clinton.”) Mid-evening, he went all mean girl on Elizabeth Warren: “Pocahontas … spoke glowingly about Crooked Hillary, who she always hated.” Then silence, of an ominous sort. </p><p>Could he possibly have been as mesmerized by Michelle Obama as the crowd inside the Wells Fargo Center? Almost an hour elapsed. Even when Mrs. Obama took dead aim, “The issues a president faces are not black and white, and cannot be boiled down into 140 characters” — still nothing. </p><p>I envisioned him sequestered in Trump Tower, handcuffed to the arms of his faux Louis XIV ormolu throne. (“For your own safety, Mr. Trump,” the handler whispered.) The cuffs finally came off, but only for a final swipe at Bernie Sanders. He was done for the night. After a massage and cold-cream application, the handler gave him his silk sleeping gloves. </p><p>It turned out Mr. Trump was actually in North Carolina, where the following day he told a Veterans of Foreign Wars convention audience: “We will create a private White House hotline to field complaints about the Veterans Administration. This could keep me very busy at night, folks. This could take the place of Twitter.” Though not, nota bene, “so fast your head will spin.” The key word was “could.” </p><p>That afternoon, Bernie Sanders, microphone in hand, said, “I move that Hillary Clinton be selected as the nominee of the Democratic Party for president of the United States.” As the evening proceedings got underway, Mr. Trump struck a Twitter tone more petulant than savage. Unaware that Bill Clinton would be telling an ultimately not-so-shaggy-dog story about a “girl” he once saw in a library, he pre-emptively reviewed it: “No matter what Bill Clinton says and no matter how well he says it, the phony media will exclaim it to be incredible. Highly overrated.” </p><p>Anything else? </p><p>“I hate to say it, but the Republican Convention was far more interesting (with a much more beautiful set) than the Democratic Convention!” A minority opinion. </p><p>That night, Trump barely slept. He was at it at <span class="aBn"><span class="aQJ">12:01 a.m.</span></span> and then again started at dawn: (“Crooked Hillary … failing @nytimes … Putin said ‘Trump is a genius’ … Crooked Hillary” — again — “… flood our country with Syrian immigrants … Our not very bright vice president, Joe Biden …)” </p><p>For the rest of the day his hands were full with the fallout from his invitation to Vladimir Putin to join his cabinet. Which perhaps accounts for his failure to offer any specific critiques of President Obama’s Night 3 valedictory/paean to Hillary Clinton. No matter, other Republicans stepped in. On MSNBC, Nicolle Wallace, a senior adviser to John McCain’s presidential campaign, said: “President Obama made the case against Trumpism. He made the definitive case.” Her fellow commentator Steve Schmidt, who was a senior adviser both for Mr. McCain’s campaign and for George W. Bush in 2004, concurred. “A master class in American character,” Schmidt said. “His attacks on Donald Trump from a character basis were shattering.” </p><p><span class="aBn"><span class="aQJ">Tonight</span></span>, Hillary Clinton — or, for those who must, “Crooked Hillary” — will step forward to deliver an acceptance speech brimming with optimism, the antithesis of Mr. Trump’s “<span class="aBn"><span class="aQJ">midnight</span></span> in America” harangue in Cleveland. From @realdonaldtrump, the chivalry will surely flow. The world will be watching. As will he, with both hands. </p> <em>Mark Singer is a staff writer for The New Yorker.

Who’s Googling to Learn How to Vote?
</div>
<div class='listy_subhead'>
By Seth Stephens-Davidowitz
</div>
<div class='listy_body'>
<p><span>The Democrats are having a hugely successful convention thus far — at least by one metric.</span> </p><p>Many people are Googling for information related to voting. </p><p>Through the first three days of the Democratic convention, Google searches that include the word “vote” are twice as high as they were during the comparable days of the Republican convention. </p><p>If you look at all conventions since 2004, the current Democratic convention is generating the second-highest interest in voting, after the 2004 Republican convention. The recent Republican convention generated the second-lowest interest in voting, just beating out the 2012 Republican convention. </p><p>There is also evidence that the majority of searches for voting during a party’s convention come from supporters. During the recent Republican convention, searches for voting were higher in states that voted Republican in the previous presidential election. Thus far, during the Democratic convention, searches for voting are higher in states that voted Democratic. </p><p>Of course, for this to truly be good news for Democrats, a large number of the people now motivated to vote will have to successfully pull it off. In the United States, that isn’t so simple. </p>

Go Dark, Hillary
</div>
<div class='listy_subhead'>
By Ross Douthat
</div>
<div class='listy_body'>
<p><span>There’s a lot of talk today about how hard it will be for Hillary Clinton to match the rhetorical appeal of President Obama’s speech last night — the soaring cadences, the patriotic uplift, the defense of American ideals against Donald Trump’s strongman appeal, the deliberate appropriation of “morning in America” themes from a Republican Party that’s gone way down into the dark.</span></p><p>But if Clinton’s eloquence is likely to fall short of the Obama standard, she also has reasons to try something different with her speech anyway, something few speakers at this convention have attempted, and go a little bit into the dark herself.</p><p>The cold reality of American politics in the year 2016 is that most people don’t seem to share President Obama’s sweeping optimism about the country’s future. When Ronald Reagan gave his own “morning in America” ad in 1984, half the country was satisfied with the country’s direction. Today the same number, from <a href="http://www.gallup.com/poll/1669/general-mood-country.aspx" target="_blank">Gallup’s polling</a>, is 17 percent.</p><p>This isn’t just a Trumpista phenomenon, and it isn’t just a reaction to Trump’s rise. Fear of his demagogy may have pushed the “<a href="http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/other/direction_of_country-902.html" target="_blank">wrong track</a>” numbers somewhat higher, but a general dissatisfaction with the American trajectory has been a hallmark of the Obama era. The last time more than 40 percent of Americans said the country was on the right track was a month after the president’s re-election, and the wrong track number was stuck above 60 percent well before Trump’s primary-season ascent.</p><p>No single theory explains this persistent discontent. There are sociological factors at work: America is an older society than it was in Reagan’s day, a more individualistic and more atomized one, more ideologically polarized and less religious, with more diversity but less solidarity and social trust. There are economic trends: The Obama era, like the Bush era before it, hasn’t generated sustained wage growth even when the unemployment rate is low, creating a feeling of stagnation even in periods of rising gross domestic product.</p><p>But then there are also more immediate factors. Trump’s doom-laden litany last week was exaggerated but not fabricated. Homicides really have spiked in the last two years, <a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/article/436138/immigration-rises-legal-and-illegal-alike-it-remains-issue-us-politics" target="_blank">illegal immigration is up</a> since Obama’s attempted executive amnesty, Islamic State-inspired terrorist attacks are clearly on the rise. More broadly, the Western liberal order seems considerably less stable than it did even in the depths of the Great Recession.</p><p>True, electing Trump to deal with these problems seems far more likely hasten any unraveling than to reverse it. But President Obama and his party, in the course of defending his legacy this week, have struggled to acknowledge the legitimacy of American anxiety, the depth of disappointment and discontent.</p><p>If there’s anything that Hillary Clinton can try to do that Obama did not, it’s to show that she understands these fears as something more than atavism or paranoia, to promise something more than <em>just</em> a continuation of this administration’s approach to leadership, to demonstrate that she’s prepared to lead a country that many, many people feel is somehow out of joint.</p><p>The first three days of this convention have been about stability, continuity, progress, uplift — all intended to contrast with the reckless and reactionary candidacy of Donald Trump.</p><p>But to fully deal with her rival’s appeal, Clinton still needs to become, to some degree at least, a candidate for darker times.</p><p><em>Ross Douthat is an Op-Ed columnist for The Times. </em><br></p>

At the Convention, a Hero’s Journey
</div>
<div class='listy_subhead'>
By Virginia Heffernan
</div>
<div class='listy_body'>
<p>Like an ancient myth or a Hollywood fantasy adventure, most political conventions aim to dramatize a hero’s journey. You know, that one where a regular Joe hears the call of destiny, refuses the call, gets some supernatural aid, ventures forth, conquers, atones to his father, <em>something something </em>then goes home changed to spread the word. </p><p>This year’s Democratic National Convention, however, has not tracked the hero’s journey of the party’s nominee, Hillary Clinton. Perhaps the hero’s journey doesn’t work all that well with female experience. Indeed, Mrs. Clinton’s narrative this week has been that of a nurturer, one who has methodically dedicated herself to recognizing and facilitating the heroism of others — the handicapped, the kids, the unions, the Mothers of the Movement. </p><p>Instead, the hero whose journey is being thematized at the engrossing spectacle in Philadelphia is that of the male voter. The voter in conflict. The one who hears the call of Hillary Clinton but refuses it. The one who experiences some supernatural interference in the form of the arch-imago Donald J. Trump. And the one who finally braves, say, another party’s convention or the scorn of his supporters to emerge a changed man, ready to spread the word. </p><p>This is Michael Bloomberg hero’s journey. This is the one <a href="http://www.vox.com/2016/7/27/12302828/michael-bloomberg-dnc-speech-transcript-2016-democratic-convention" target="_blank">he narrated last night</a> at the convention, when the self-described “outsider” — having confronted the “dangerous demagogue” dragon in Mr. Trump — enjoined the crowd to vote for Mrs. Clinton for president. </p><p>It is the story of Bernie Sanders. Man, did Mr. Sanders refuse that Clinton call. Refuse, refuse, refuse — some heroes do that. But having done battle with his conscience, Mr. Sanders now shows up chivalrically at the convention, day after day, where he sits by his gently encouraging wife, sometimes seeming to brood but also recognizing that this is destiny. </p><p>And it is the story of Barack Obama. Last night, President Obama was a gracious victor. He is farther along in his hero’s journey than Mr. Bloomberg or Mr. Sanders, having won the brass ring himself. In fact, having fought and trounced the Clintons years ago, gallantry now requires that he overcome any last resentments, embrace Mrs. Clinton and become her knight. </p><p>Then there’s Bill Clinton, who, in speech and demeanor, has looked this week more like a man whose steepest bill has come due than a contented Gandalf. His strangely roundabout formulation about his wife’s sacrifices — “I really hoped that her choosing me and rejecting my advice to pursue her own career was a decision she would never regret” — was ambivalence itself. But even if it sounded a touch phony and begrudging, he seemed to get it: He has been dodging creditors for a long time and now he is ready to face them. </p><p>Does jumping into a supporting role as first gentleman — an inevitably feminized role — mean that he will have to forfeit his ambitions, his authority, his very virility and life force? </p><p>This is a question for many American voters — male and female. Does voting for Hillary Clinton mean giving up on the myth of men as the world’s provider-protectors and of women as its lovely and cherished Melania Trumps? Or does voting for her mean rising to the call of country, surmounting one’s doubts and superstitions and nobly recognizing that (to paraphrase Mr. Obama), “We don’t need a hero; we <em>are</em> the heroes”? </p><p><em>Virginia Heffernan, a former television critic and internet columnist at The Times, is the author of “Magic and Loss: The Internet as Art.”</em></p>

Vladimir Putin Is Donald Trump’s Leadership Role Model
</div>
<div class='listy_subhead'>
By Andrew Rosenthal
</div>
<div class='listy_body'>
<p><span>PHILADELPHIA — Here is what Donald Trump considers great leadership:</span> </p><p>Vladimir Putin invaded Ukraine and seized Crimea. He threatens the freedom of the Baltic States, which the West struggled to obtain for decades. He rigged elections. He kept Bashar al-Assad in power in Syria while he used chemical weapons against his own people. </p><p>Putin took over Russia’s fledgling independent media and has been suspected in the murder of journalists. He stole billions for himself and his pals while ordinary Russians struggle to put food on their tables. </p><p>And what is the assessment of the man who wants to build a wall to keep out impoverished Mexicans but offers open arms to the Russians? </p><p>Trump said <span class="aBn"><span class="aQJ">Thursday</span></span> that Putin is “a better leader than Obama, because Obama’s not a leader, so he’s certainly doing a better job than Obama is, and that’s all.” </p><p>Speaking on “Fox and Friends,” Trump said he was being “sarcastic” when he said <span class="aBn"><span class="aQJ">on Wednesday</span></span> that he hoped the Russians had hacked Hillary Clinton’s email when she was secretary of state — and suggested he might actually recognize the seizure of Crimea if he becomes president. </p><p>(By the way, not even Mike Pence, his newly anointed running mate, agreed with Trump on Russia and the emails. “If it is Russia and they are interfering in our elections, I can assure you both parties and the United States government will ensure there are serious consequences,” Pence said <span class="aBn"><span class="aQJ">on Wednesday</span></span>.) </p><p>Was Trump also being sarcastic last week when he said he would not necessarily come to the aid of countries threatened by Russia, making a mockery of the North Atlantic alliance that has kept the peace in Europe for some 70 years? </p><p>And was he being sarcastic last December when <a href="http://www.msnbc.com/morning-joe/watch/trump--putin-is-a-leader--unlike-our-president-588186691983" target="_blank">Joe Scarborough asked</a> him about all the journalists who have been killed in Putin’s Russia — scores, at least, according to reliable accounts, of reporters who were critical of Putin, including the courageous Anna Politkovskaya? </p><p>Trump offered the same mindless response then that he made <span class="aBn"><span class="aQJ">Thursday</span></span>. “He’s running his country, and at least he’s a leader, unlike what we have in this country,” Trump said. </p><p>Trump added, “I think our country does plenty of killing also, Joe, so you know.” (That, by the way, is an old Kremlin propaganda line that was intended to create a false moral equivalency between the Soviet Union and the United States.) </p><p>“I’m confused,” Scarborough said with admirable understatement. “You obviously condemn Vladimir Putin killing journalists and political opponents, right?” </p><p>“Oh, sure, absolutely,” Trump said. </p><p>Well, that’s a relief — unless, of course, he was being “sarcastic.” </p><p>If Trump becomes president, will we constantly have to parse his words to figure out if he’s being sarcastic? I can’t imagine Putin will make the effort. </p><p><em>Andrew Rosenthal is an Op-Ed columnist for The Times.</em> </p>

What It Means to Be a Democrat
</div>
<div class='listy_subhead'>
By Mark Schmitt
</div>
<div class='listy_body'>
<p><span>If you’ve watched or attended past Democratic conventions, you know that the party’s coalition was stitched together from organized interest groups, and the seams start to show quickly.</span> </p><p>They were mentioned line by line in speeches: unions, especially those for teachers and public employees; environmental groups; workers for reproductive rights, L.G.B.T. rights, civil rights and gun-control laws; campaign-finance reformers; and so forth. </p><p>Not many of these causes had universal support among elected Democrats, and keeping this coalition of interests intact was the work of the party. When Democratic leaders did their job right, as in the 1990s, this coalition held together. An ideological movement needs a steady diet of enemies and ever bigger promises, whereas interest groups are satisfied with incremental progress and a seat at the table. </p><p>But the interest-group party had drawbacks, too. It was difficult to present a coherent vision to the many voters who weren’t committed to one particular cause. It neglected dozens of issues, like Wall Street regulation, that had no advocacy groups to counter the interests of campaign donors. Deep structural conflicts, like trade, were often ignored. Racial justice issues were spoken of quietly, as the party struggled to retain its hold on working-class white voters. The phrase “Black Lives Matter” would have terrified the Democrats of 1996. </p><p>The first two days of the Democratic convention felt different, reflecting a long transition that began in the mid-2000s to a more seamless party vision. It started with Howard Dean’s term as chairman of the Democratic National Committee and an effort to build a stronger sense of the party itself, and with Elizabeth Warren’s work, before she was a senator, to call attention to such everyday economic issues as bankruptcy laws. </p><p>Hillary Clinton’s political lifetime is wholly within the interest-group party, but she has adapted slowly to the more robustly ideological world of this decade, more open to ideas once considered too far left and leery of compromise. But, as the convention is showing, what that means still isn’t quite clear. </p><p>For supporters of Bernie Sanders and allies like Ms. Warren, that means naming both heroes and villains, as on Monday night, when Ms. Warren <a href="http://time.com/4421731/democratic-convention-elizabeth-warren-transcript-speech/" target="_blank">described </a>the “huge difference between the people fighting for a level playing field, and the people keeping the system rigged.” </p><p>But other convention speakers, notably Michelle Obama and Senator Cory Booker, showed a different kind of ideology, one that incorporates racial justice, inclusion, tolerance and a commitment to economic justice in a way that doesn’t just check off interest-group boxes. Mr. Booker, for example, laid out a broad agenda of economic and individual justice and yet embedded it in the abstractions of the Declaration of Independence. </p><p>It’s a new voice for the Democratic Party, not the familiar checklist, not quite Mr. Sanders’s bigger and more confrontational dreams, but also not quite the same as Barack Obama’s frustrated dreams of unity and compromise. </p><p>The question for the week will be whether Hillary Clinton can master this new voice. </p><p><em>Mark Schmitt is the director of the political reform program at the research organization New America.</em></p>

Women at the Top

<div class='listy_subhead'>
By Frank Bruni
</div>
<div class='listy_body'>
<p><span class="anchor" id="women-on-top"></span> </p> <p><span>PHILADELPHIA — I asked Gina Raimondo, the governor of Rhode Island, how much the possible election of this country’s first female president mattered. She told me a story about a conversation that she overheard on Sunday.</span> </p> <p>She was on her state’s shoreline for Governor’s Bay Day, when there’s free parking at the beaches and free public transportation to them. </p> <p>“There was a girl there, maybe 8 years old, from Massachusetts,” Raimondo recalled. “Her mom said, ‘I heard the governor is at this event.’ And the little girl said: ‘Where is he? I want to see him.’ ” </p> <p>Even after all this time, even after so much progress, “When you close your eyes and you think ‘leader,’ you probably picture a man,” Raimondo, 45, observed. The little girl from Massachusetts still did. Little girls from everywhere still do. </p> <p>Raimondo, a Democrat who took office early last year, is Rhode Island’s first female governor. And although Democrats pride themselves on diversity, only two other Democratic governors in America are women. One, Maggie Hassan, of New Hampshire, is running for the Senate and will soon exit the governor’s office, to be replaced in all likelihood by a man. </p> <p>The other, Kate Brown, of Oregon, is in a seemingly tight race against a Republican challenger — male — and could also be out of office next year. </p> <p>Women have come far, but not all that far, and Raimondo said that she is constantly reflecting on this as she watches Hillary Clinton’s progress, rooting for her to win the presidency. </p> <p>“The only way we’re going to really break through is if people become more accustomed to seeing female leaders,” she told me during an interview here late Wednesday afternoon. In particular, she said, “There aren’t enough women in public executive roles — people don’t even really know what they want to see in a female leader.” </p> <p>She was Rhode Island’s treasurer before she was its governor, and had an all-business, no-nonsense image. Then, at the start of her gubernatorial campaign, she released a television commercial that showed her riding bikes with her husband and two children. </p> <p>“The press could not get their heads around it,” she said, adding that reporters asked her, “Are you trying to convince voters that you’re not this tough executive but that you’re this warm and fuzzy person?” </p> <p>“Why can’t I be both?” she said. “Why can’t I be a loving mother and also a competent finance person? It’s binary with women.” </p> <p>To listen to her was to think about Clinton and the stretches of Clinton’s political career when she felt compelled to project toughness, the other chapters when she had to show warmth and her endless struggle to get the ratio just right. Most male politicians don’t go through that. </p> <p>“I just admire her perseverance and her personal resilience,” Raimondo said. “That isn’t to say she’s perfect. She’s made plenty of mistakes.” </p> <p>In addition to the three Democratic women who are governors right now, there are three Republicans: Nikki Haley of South Carolina, Mary Fallin of Oklahoma and Susana Martinez of New Mexico. </p> <p>Out of 50 current governors, six women. </p> <p>And out of 44 American presidents, none. </p> <p>If Clinton changes that, Raimondo said, it will help to change the way girls like that 8-year-old from Massachusetts see their futures and their world. </p> <p>“Little girls — 8 years old, 9 years old, 10 — come up to me and say, literally, ‘You make me think that I can do that,’ ” Raimondo said. “I know it sounds like something you read in a book, but it’s happened to me 500 times. It’s a much bigger impact than I ever realized.” </p> <p>That’s not reason alone to elect someone. Raimondo wasn’t suggesting as much. But it’s something to consider well beyond the 2016 presidential race: what our lineup of leaders — corporate as well as political — says to the next generation, and how the paucity of women on top puts the ones who’ve made it there under a special microscope. </p> <p><em>Frank Bruni is an Op-Ed columnist for The Times.</em> </p>

The Clear and Present Danger of Donald Trump
</div>
<div class='listy_subhead'>
By David Leonhardt
</div>
<div class='listy_body'>
<p>Time and again as president, Barack Obama has chosen to use cautious language, at times frustrating both his allies and critics. His descriptions of corporate America’s misbehavior during the financial crisis sounded like cocktail-party chatter compared with Franklin D. Roosevelt’s jeremiads. Obama’s sporadic refusal to utter “terrorism” or “radical Islam” has become a Republican meme.</p><p>All of which highlights the bluntness and harshness of his attacks on Donald Trump on Wednesday night.</p><p>“Anyone who threatens our values, whether fascists or communists or jihadists or,” Obama said, pausing slightly, “homegrown demagogues, will always fail in the end.” Look at that list: A president notorious for his cool demeanor compared the opposing party’s presidential nominee to America’s two great 20th-century enemies and its bloodthirsty 21st-century enemy.</p><p>Mr. Obama has now been on the national scene for 12 years and a day, dating to his 2004 speech at this same convention. Can you think of any personal insult that he has levied in that time that remotely approaches this one? I cannot. And I don’t think Obama did it casually.</p><p>Trump represents a political threat to the country that is unmatched in our lifetime. He <a href="http://www.vox.com/2016/7/25/12270880/donald-trump-racism-history" target="_blank">traffics</a> in the language of white supremacy with a wink, a nod and <a href="https://www.washingtonian.com/2016/05/17/melania-trump-says-julia-ioffe-provoked-antisemitic-outbursts/" target="_blank">no apologies</a>. He <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/22/us/politics/donald-trump-foreign-policy-interview.html" target="_blank">threatens</a> to throw out decades’ old alliances that are the bedrock of American interests. He <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/28/us/politics/donald-trump-russia-clinton-emails.html" target="_blank">invites</a> a foreign strongman to intrude in our elections on his behalf.</p><p>Every living person who has held the office of the presidency – three Democrats and two Republicans, spanning 32 years in the White House – views Trump as unfit to hold it. Were he to win, the country could enter a period of instability few of us have known.</p><p>The third night of the Democratic convention was the night that the party tried to raise the level of alarm about the Trump danger.</p><p>It wasn’t just Obama. Joe Biden delivered a withering attack on Mr. Trump as a sadist who enjoys nothing so much as firing other human beings. John Hutson, a retired Navy admiral, <a href="http://www.slate.com/blogs/the_slatest/2016/07/27/donald_trump_gets_dan_quayle_john_f_kennedy_d_by_ret_adm_john_hutson.html" target="_blank">noted</a> that more than 120 Republican foreign-policy experts recently said Mr. Trump would “make America less safe.” Tim Kaine attempted a shtick-filled imitation rare at the highest levels of modern politics. Michael Bloomberg – not even a Democrat – went off script to say that Trump was neither competent nor sane.</p><p>The coordinated barrage came after a couple of days in which a Trump presidency seemed to become both more plausible and even more worrisome. He received a typical <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/us/elections/polls.html?_r=0" target="_blank">polling bounce</a> from his own convention and now leads some polls. Meanwhile, a small but raucous group of liberals unhappy with Hillary Clinton has been attempting to disrupt the Democratic convention and <a href="http://nyti.ms/2aeBg3T" target="_blank">hurt her campaign</a>. And then Mr. Trump took to a microphone Wednesday morning to suggest that he hopes Russia hacks into Clinton’s computers.</p><p>Will the bracing honesty about Trump work? My instinct is that it will make a difference. Yet after all of 2016’s surprises, I’m deeply humble about anyone’s ability to forecast matters pertaining to Trump.</p><p>I do know this: If October rolls around and Trump appears to have a serious chance of winning, many people will wonder if they had done enough to halt his rise. On Wednesday, Obama and the Democrats decided to err on the side of aggressiveness. On principle, it was the right decision.</p><p>And it raises a question many Americans should begin to ask themselves: Am I doing enough?</p><p><em>David Leonhardt, who will begin an Op-Ed column later this year, is writing a daily opinion post during the conventions.</em><br></p>
