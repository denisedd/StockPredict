He was 33, his hair flecked with gray, an ancient in the world of sprinters. He had arrived at this moment, the finals of the 100-meter dash at the world track championships last August in Beijing, caught between expectation and hope. With a win, Justin Gatlin would complete his near-decade-long trek back from disgrace and exile, which began with a four-year ban for testosterone doping.</p>
              
              
  					  
            
              <p class="paragraph">One man blocked his path: Usain Bolt, from Sherwood Content, Jamaica &#x2014; the charismatic star who dominated sprinting after Gatlin was banished from the sport in 2006. Bolt won gold medals in both the 100 and 200 meters at the 2008 and 2012 Olympics. &#x201C;I had a target all season long, and it was Bolt in Beijing,&#x201D; Gatlin told me recently. &#x201C;I knew I needed to run 9.7 to beat him.&#x201D; He seemed ready to do so: He was conquering 2015 so far, having run 100 meters in 9.74 seconds in Qatar in May, followed by a 9.75 in Rome in June and another in Lausanne in July. His times were less than two-tenths of a second off Bolt&#x2019;s world record.</p>
              
              
  					  
            
              <p class="paragraph">The gun sounded. Gatlin&#x2019;s head-down drive was instantaneous. Forty yards out, his acceleration mechanically perfect, he was a step ahead. But the beauty of Bolt is to be found not in his starts but in his top-end speed and his ferocious competitiveness. With racehorselike strides, he pulled even. World-class sprints are blink-of-eye affairs, yet the best runners talk as if these races occur in slow motion; they notice everything. Gatlin saw Bolt at the edge of his vision. With 20 meters to go, he started to come undone. His chest flew out; his stride grew long and wild. &#x201C;I ran like I was out there on the streets,&#x201D; Gatlin recounted to me with disgust. &#x201C;Instead of concentrating on my technique and my race, I got sucked into all the hype.&#x201D;</p>
              
              
  					  
            
              <p class="paragraph">Both men lunged for the line. Gatlin crossed at 9.8 seconds. As he had predicted, that was not enough. Bolt got there four inches ahead of him, in 9.79 seconds.</p>
              
              
  					  
            
              <p class="paragraph">In the BBC television booth, in seats set aside for track insiders and former champions, ecstatic cheering broke out for Bolt, a man the British press had celebrated as a savior and &#x201C;superhero.&#x201D; Sebastian Coe, twice an Olympic gold medalist in the 1,500 meters and now the president of track&#x2019;s ruling body, the International Association of Athletics Federations, had opined to BBC One that track &#x201C;needs Usain to come through in Beijing.&#x201D;</p>
              
              
  					  
            
              <p class="paragraph">When a television reporter caught up with Gatlin after the race, he said, &#x201C;I&#x2019;m happy&#x201D; &#x2014; his voice caught &#x2014; &#x201C;happy to be an American.&#x201D; He tried again, speaking of those who loved him. &#x201C;It keeps me emotional inside. I&#x2019;m just happy to be here, man.&#x201D; Gatlin tried to say more but could not.</p>
              
              
  					  
            
              <p class="paragraph"><strong>The great dash</strong> men of recent history have been overtaken by the specter of doping. Four of the five fastest men ever, whose records were all set in the last eight years, have tested positive for steroids or stimulants. The preceding generation of sprinters, like Ben Johnson and Carl Lewis, was no less defined by doping. Gatlin won a 2004 Olympic gold medal in the 100 meters when he was coached by Trevor Graham, a former Olympian who later received a lifetime ban from track for helping his athletes obtain the drugs they used to dope. Graham&#x2019;s best runners, including the Olympic sprinters Marion Jones and Tim Montgomery, tested positive for banned substances. Gatlin&#x2019;s current coach, Dennis Mitchell, also a former Olympic sprinter, was suspended after a positive test in the late 1990s.</p>
              
              
  					  
            
              <p class="paragraph">The pressure to seek chemical advantages in a sport where the margins of victory are so small cannot be overstated. Gatlin finished first at the United States Olympic trials earlier this month. Michael Rodgers finished two-tenths of a second behind him, in fourth place, and did not qualify for the Olympics in that event.</p>
              
              
  					  
            
              <p class="paragraph">Sprinters&#x2019; prospects can hinge on balky hamstrings and pulled calf muscles. They take piles of vitamins and supplements, visit doctors in hopes of finding and keeping an edge. An industry has popped up to certify which supplements are clean of banned substances. A no-less-vigorous underground industry of pharmacists and endocrinologists boasts to athletes and coaches of being able to increase muscle mass and endurance and speed the healing of injuries while evading ever more sophisticated tests. Anonymous surveys suggest that significantly more athletes dope, often in microdoses, than are caught. &#x201C;We can&#x2019;t be na&#xEF;ve: There&#x2019;s a win-at-any-cost in every sport,&#x201D; says Travis T. Tygart, chief executive of the United States Anti-Doping Agency. Too many coaches, he adds, ask runners to sign public pledges not to use drugs and then, in private, press them to do just that.</p>
              
              
  					  
            
              <p class="paragraph">Ross Tucker, a professor of exercise physiology at the University of the Free State in South Africa whose website, The Science of Sport, is much respected in the world of running, points out that &#x201C;very few people in history have sprinted under 9.9 seconds without testing positive for a drug at some point.&#x201D; Bolt, 29, is in that group, but Gatlin is not. Now he is about to become the oldest sprinter in United States Olympic history while also representing the nation&#x2019;s best shot at beating Bolt and winning gold medals in the 100 and 200 meters. Gatlin is one of a tiny handful of men in their mid-30s who have run 100 meters in under 10 seconds, and his times have improved in five of the past seven years. &#x201C;He&#x2019;s running faster than when he won the 2004 gold medal,&#x201D; Tucker says. &#x201C;That makes him an extreme outlier in a sport known for doping.&#x201D;</p>
              
              
  					  
            
              <p class="paragraph">He is tested often and randomly by the United States Anti-Doping Agency; screeners have checked his blood four times and his urine 10 times this year. They look for evidence of steroids, stimulants, blood doping and human growth hormone. The more Gatlin wins, the more he is tested. He consistently passes these tests. Yet he cannot outpace suspicion &#x2014; either that he might still be doping or that he continues to derive benefits from past steroid use, a phenomenon scientists have seen in experiments on mice. Studies suggest that the muscle mass acquired through steroid use could remain for many months, perhaps years, after that use ends.</p>
              
              
  					  
            
              <p class="paragraph">Gatlin bridles at his skeptics. No one cared when he returned in 2010, heavy and slow, having lost four peak years to suspension &#x2014; a penalty, it&#x2019;s worth noting, far more severe than athletes in pro baseball, football and basketball face for similar transgressions. <em>That </em>Gatlin fit a comfortable narrative. Since then, he has overhauled his diet and technique and mechanics, treated his body with exquisite care, studied video obsessively. This has allowed him to shave shards of seconds from his times. &#x201C;I&#x2019;m not the first person who tested positive,&#x201D; Gatlin says. &#x201C;I won&#x2019;t be the last, let&#x2019;s be honest. I&#x2019;ve paid my penalty.&#x201D;</p>

              <p class="paragraph"><strong>Born in Brooklyn</strong>, Gatlin would sprint ahead of his mother as a youngster in Sheepshead Bay, hurdling fire hydrants. When he was 6, Gatlin and his family moved to Pensacola, Fla., on the Gulf of Mexico. In elementary school, a problem arose: During a test, he spotted a bird in the window and drew its image rather than complete the exam. He received a diagnosis of attention-deficit disorder and took medication for years.</p>
              
              
  					  
            
              <p class="paragraph">Running was like breathing. He raced along oak-shaded streets, while his friends rode bicycles beside him. In high school, he was a coach&#x2019;s dream, running hurdles on a team that won a state championship. His mother laid down the rules for the college recruiters who took turns visiting their home: He had to remain within a day&#x2019;s drive from Pensacola. He went to the University of Tennessee, where, as a freshman in 2001, he won N.C.A.A. titles in the 100 and 200 meters. &#x201C;In high school, you get to leave school early and see girls in short shorts,&#x201D; he says. &#x201C;In college, everything was an intense blur.&#x201D;</p>
              
              
  					  
            
              <p class="paragraph">At the end of his freshman year, Gatlin tested positive for a minute trace of amphetamine after running as an amateur in an event sponsored by USA Track &amp; Field. Amphetamines are ingredients in Adderall, which Gatlin had a prescription for and had taken while preparing for midterms in two summer courses. That accorded with N.C.A.A. rules and was consistent with the guidance offered to professional athletes. Gatlin figured the drug would exit his body by the time he raced three days later.</p>
              
              
  					  
            
              <p class="paragraph">This would become a foundation stone in the narrative of Gatlin as unrepentant cheat. Except that there was nothing to repent for: An American Arbitration Association panel concluded that Gatlin took a permitted medication in the appropriate dosage, and that it did not aid his performance. &#x201C;He neither cheated nor intended to cheat,&#x201D; the panel stated. &#x201C;He is certainly not a doper.&#x201D; His transgression consisted of not having told officials in advance that he had taken Adderall. The international body that governs professional track cut what was initially a two-year suspension to a single year. Because Gatlin remained in school, competing as an amateur, the suspension had no practical effect on him.</p>
              
              
  					  
            
              <p class="paragraph">Gatlin left college after his sophomore year, having won six N.C.A.A. titles, in order to turn pro. &#x201C;I&#x2019;m like, &#x2018;Let&#x2019;s take a plane, bring it on,&#x2019; &#x201D; Gatlin says. &#x201C;I want to make a name for myself.&#x201D; His first professional race pitted him against his idol, Maurice Greene. Gatlin was vibrating with nerves, but he finished ahead of Greene.</p>
              
              
  					  
            
              <p class="paragraph">Just before he turned pro, Gatlin and his parents, Willie and Jeanette, drove from Pensacola to New York for a funeral. (They could not afford the airfare.) On the drive, Gatlin&#x2019;s cellphone rang. It was Trevor Graham, who wanted to be his coach. &#x201C;I told him I&#x2019;d never heard of him &#x2014; Trevor was kind of taken aback,&#x201D; Gatlin recalls. He got a crash course in finances. Graham had a formidable reputation and coached a stable of athletes affiliated with Nike, a colossus in the track world and a company Graham served as a frontman. According to Jeanette Gatlin&#x2019;s testimony in a later hearing, Graham told her son that Nike wanted to cut a deal with him years earlier but feared bad publicity if it persuaded him to skip college.</p>
              
              
  					  
            
              <p class="paragraph">Graham promised to treat Gatlin like a son, though his parents never stopped feeling uneasy about the rumors of doping that swirled around the world of pro track. (In 2004, Willie saw something online saying that his son had failed a drug test. He would learn it was an April Fool&#x2019;s gag &#x2014; but not before Jeanette found him packing his pistol. He told her: &#x201C;I&#x2019;m driving to North Carolina to kill Trevor. He promised this would not happen.&#x201D;)</p>
              
              
  					  
            
              <p class="paragraph">Graham guided Gatlin to his greatest moment as a sprinter when he won gold, silver and bronze medals in Athens in 2004. But Gatlin&#x2019;s triumph was soon dimmed by his association with his coach. In the months leading up to the Games, Graham&#x2019;s name became linked to the Bay Area Laboratory Co-Operative, or Balco &#x2014; then the target of a widely publicized doping investigation that involved numerous pro athletes &#x2014; suggesting he had helped an earlier generation of his athletes acquire steroids. Then, at the Olympics, Graham told reporters that he had anonymously mailed a syringe containing a steroid to the United States Anti-Doping Agency in an effort to implicate Balco.</p>
              
              
  					  
            
              <p class="paragraph">Executives from Nike and USA Track &amp; Field were worried; they viewed Gatlin as the new and marketable face of American track. They told Gatlin he had to be beyond reproach, meeting with him, his parents and his agent, Renaldo Nehemiah, who would later refer to this as a &#x201C;coming-to-Jesus talk.&#x201D; Yet Gatlin elected to remain with Graham. Pro runners are loners, one bad injury removed from obscurity. The eighth-ranked sprinter in the world makes a fraction of the riches that go to the top ranked; sponsors want winners, and Graham had helped Gatlin win.</p>
              
              
  					  
            
              <p class="paragraph">Two years later, Gatlin was tested following a relay race in Lawrence, Kan. Weeks later, his parents received an express-mail packet (Jeanette was his business manager and received his mail): Testosterone had been detected in Gatlin&#x2019;s urine. As a repeat offender, he faced a lifetime ban. His parents called him, and Gatlin fell to his knees. &#x201C;<em>Oh, my God, Mommy, I&#x2019;m dead,&#x201D; he told them</em>. He drove home. &#x201C;We heard him in his bedroom crying all night,&#x201D; his mother recalls. &#x201C;He just kept shaking and saying: &#x2018;My life is over.&#x2019; &#x201D;</p>
              
              
  					  
            
              <p class="paragraph">The financial blow was immediate. Nike dropped him, as did other sponsors. His income, expected to reach $2.5 million that year, disappeared. He sold his house in North Carolina and ended up in a small bug-infested apartment in Atlanta. He had to ask his mother if he had enough money to buy jeans. &#x201C;I was collecting unemployment checks and eating ramen noodles,&#x201D; Gatlin says. &#x201C;You go to the supermarket and you&#x2019;re marked. It feels like everyone is staring at you.&#x201D;</p>
              
              
  					  
            
              <p class="paragraph">He never contested the doping result, but his admission was hedged. Gatlin speculated publicly that a masseur, disgruntled at the lack of a bonus, had spread steroid cream on him after a race. A three-person panel with the American Arbitration Association heard the case, and the majority decision concluded that Gatlin&#x2019;s testimony related to the cream &#x201C;was not credible, was not substantiated.&#x201D; (One panel member dissented, saying Gatlin&#x2019;s account was credible.) The panel laid out a different scenario: Suffering from a hamstring tear in the spring of 2006, Gatlin was sent by his coach to see a doctor, who in turn let an assistant coach give an injection to Gatlin&#x2019;s thigh to speed healing. &#x201C;It was a vitamin,&#x201D; Gatlin had told the arbitration panel. &#x201C;It was supposed to help heal my torn hamstring and the microfiber tears and reduce swelling.&#x201D; The panel was skeptical. It pointed out that the coach could as easily have injected Gatlin with steroids, leading in turn to the positive test. World antidoping regulators take the view that athletes are responsible for what goes into their bodies and cannot blame their support staff.</p>
              
              
  					  
            
              <p class="paragraph">A federal investigator, Jeffrey Novitzky, contacted Gatlin and asked if he would work undercover to help build a steroid trafficking case. (Novitzky also led the Balco investigation.) If Gatlin lied or tipped off anyone, Novitzky told him, he would be prosecuted. &#x201C;He didn&#x2019;t ask to think about it,&#x201D; Novitzky, who now works for the U.F.C., told me this spring. &#x201C;He said he had nothing to hide.&#x201D; Gatlin recorded 11 conversations with Graham. When I asked Gatlin about that time, he shook his head in disbelief. &#x201C;It was like living in a soap opera, or a spy novel.&#x201D; Though Gatlin&#x2019;s recordings did not uncover new evidence of wrongdoing by Graham, the coach would later be convicted of a felony for lying to federal investigators.</p>
              
              
  					  
            
              <p class="paragraph">That Gatlin earned his suspension is beyond doubt. Still, a question nagged at me, and I put it to Novitzky: Did Gatlin dope intentionally or was he far too credulous? Novitzky paused. &#x201C;Athletes who test positive don&#x2019;t materialize out of thin air,&#x201D; he told me. &#x201C;Justin surrounded himself with questionable people and needed better judgment. He did not do due diligence.&#x201D;</p>
              
              
  					  
            
              <p class="paragraph">I asked again: Did Gatlin know? He hesitated again. Gatlin had helped him, of course, but he has also worked with a wide range of informants. &#x201C;I had many years of training in how to read untruthfulness,&#x201D; Novitzky said. &#x201C;Unless Justin was an Academy Award-winning actor, I didn&#x2019;t see evidence of purposeful, knowing use.&#x201D;</p>
              
              
  					  
            
              <p class="paragraph"><strong>Surely this was</strong> the end of Gatlin&#x2019;s running career. Time would slow his legs and dull his competitive edge. Gatlin, anxious and worried, tried out for three N.F.L. teams as a wide receiver and discovered he lacked a gift for memorizing 20 plays each day. He also disliked getting hit. In a motel room one night, facing the likelihood of being cut again, he came to a realization. &#x201C;I said to myself: If I&#x2019;m going to struggle this hard, why not try to return to a sport where once I was king?&#x201D;</p>
              
              
  					  
            
              <p class="paragraph">In 2010, in an early comeback meet in Finland, he ran the 100 meters in 10.28 seconds. That&#x2019;s blindingly fast for a normal person and a slog through mud for a top-end sprinter. &#x201C;Let&#x2019;s be real,&#x201D; Gatlin says. &#x201C;My opponents were the best Finns in Helsinki. And I had to claw for every meter.&#x201D; Two years later, Gatlin was back in the Olympics, where he won a bronze medal at the London Games, finishing a couple of strides behind Bolt. At 30, Gatlin had no real plan for coming up with those missing strides.</p>
              
              
  					  
            
              <p class="paragraph">One night while scrolling through Facebook he came across the coach Dennis Mitchell, who was known to be obsessed with proper technique, and sent him a message. &#x201C;It took Dennis a month to reply,&#x201D; Gatlin says. &#x201C;He&#x2019;s not computer savvy.&#x201D; Mitchell, a top 100-meter sprinter who was caught doping in 1998 (at the time, he attributed the positive test to five beers and lots of sex with his fianc&#xE9;e), possessed swagger, knowledge and a hunger for redemption as great as Gatlin&#x2019;s. &#x201C;Dennis was like, &#x2018;We&#x2019;re training for gold, period,&#x2019; &#x201D; Gatlin says. &#x201C;That&#x2019;s all I wanted to hear.&#x201D;</p>
              
              
  					  
            
              <p class="paragraph">Mitchell dismantled and reconstructed Gatlin&#x2019;s form, from start to stride. Nothing about the process was polite: No, that&#x2019;s not right, do it again. Do it again. &#x201C;It was like &#x2018;Rocky,&#x2019; &#x201D; Gatlin says. &#x201C;I wanted to kill him some days.&#x201D; In the evenings, Gatlin watched hours of video &#x2014; of himself and of sprinters past, going back to Jesse Owens. To view Gatlin&#x2019;s races from his early 20s is to see a runner relying far less on technique than on intense competitiveness and raw talent.</p>
              
              
  					  
            
              <p class="paragraph">Gatlin changed that. He began exploding out of the blocks. His drive phase, in which a runner reaches maximum speed, became tight, with an emphasis on quick strides. A sprinter reaches peak speed at about 70 meters; any appearance of increasing speed after that is an optical illusion. By 2014, having overhauled his mechanics and diet &#x2014; he weighed 174 pounds, down from 205 pounds at the beginning of his comeback, his muscles now long rivers instead of thick knots &#x2014; he began to win every time out. And after every race, Gatlin heard the same doubting questions from reporters: How are your times possible? Are you doping? Did you apologize for your doping? Each question was more or less reasonable; collectively, heard day after day, they were difficult to answer with equanimity.</p>
              
              
  					  
            
              <p class="paragraph">Gatlin was not interested in equanimity. Stubborn anger and hurt fueled him. &#x201C;Dennis trained me like a sensei trained his warrior,&#x201D; he says. &#x201C; &#x2018;Remember your ethos! Don&#x2019;t give them nothing!&#x2019; &#x201D; Anger made Gatlin &#x2014; who laughs easily with fellow runners and shows grace with teenagers seeking autographs and selfies &#x2014; unlikable as a public figure. Last year, he barked at reporters who asked about doping. &#x201C;Why would I answer that? I answered it 10 years ago.&#x201D;</p>
              
              
  					  
            
              <p class="paragraph">This April, I traveled through the pine forests of Central Florida &#x2014; Gatlin lives in Clermont, outside Orlando &#x2014; and found him seated underneath the stands at a track meet in Gainesville, waiting out a downpour. He spoke of taking months off after that Beijing race against Bolt, the longest break he&#x2019;d ever allowed himself. &#x201C;People who love me, they said: &#x2018;Why are you doing this to yourself?&#x2019; &#x201D; Gatlin recalled. &#x201C;Even a warrior puts that sword and shield down.&#x201D;</p>
              
              
  					  
            
              <p class="paragraph">Early in his comeback, Gatlin saw his role as, in his words, the &#x201C;the Batman of track, a vigilante.&#x201D; While Bolt smiled and pantomimed shooting an arrow, Gatlin scowled. But he came to find the mask becoming the face. &#x201C;I was too angry; it was deteriorating my character,&#x201D; he says. &#x201C;I didn&#x2019;t like who I had become.&#x201D;</p>
              
              
  					  
            
              <p class="paragraph">One afternoon a teenager at a local gym invited Gatlin to attend his church. The teenager did not let on that his father was the pastor. Gatlin took a seat in the pews. The pastor, Everett Gates, had left a handsome salary at a big church in Atlanta to found his own, much smaller congregation. He knew who Gatlin was, and so what? In the weeks to come, Gatlin talked with Gates. &#x201C;Justin told me, &#x2018;I&#x2019;m focused on running, but I want to be at peace,&#x2019; &#x201D; Gates recalls.</p>
              
              
  					  
            
              <p class="paragraph">Top runners from different Florida camps found their way to this little church. It became that rare place where they could shed their competitive armor. &#x201C;Trust is not part of their sport,&#x201D; Gates says. One Sunday, Gates recalls, he asked who wanted to find God, and Gatlin raised his hand. Gatlin walked over and held the pastor in an embrace, and cried uncontrollably. &#x201C;Pastor, I am broken,&#x201D; Gatlin said. &#x201C;Completely broken.&#x201D;</p>
              
              
  					  
            
              <p class="paragraph">Gatlin got off to a slow start this season. He had a serious ankle sprain; he was 34; perhaps age finally had put in a grappling hook. But a few weeks ago, at the Olympic trials in Eugene, Ore., he ran a 9.83 in the semifinals. Ninety minutes later, he ran a 9.80 in the finals, the fastest time in the world this year.</p>
              
              
  					  
            
              <p class="paragraph">I visited Gatlin the next day in a house where his family was staying during the trials. The sunlight through the pines was dappled, and his son, Jace, played with puzzles on the floor as Gatlin talked with affection of a young runner, Trayvon Bromell, who also made the American team as a 100-meter sprinter. &#x201C;Trayvon, he is like d&#xE9;j&#xE0; vu for me.&#x201D;</p>
              
              
  					  
            
              <p class="paragraph">Gatlin knows that his generation is dropping away. Bolt told me this Olympics would be his last. Gatlin spoke of the grind of training, taking Epsom salt baths and ice baths and trying to fall asleep at 2 a.m. after a race, his mind still afire. &#x201C;I know how old I am every morning,&#x201D; he said. &#x201C;Each year, it becomes harder to draw on something to keep that edge.&#x201D; The longer he runs, and the better his times, the more questions circle around him. Several European athletes have denounced him. In early March, the American middle-distance runner Alysia Monta&#xF1;o told reporters at an Olympics press event that Gatlin should be barred from the Games. &#x201C;You are 100 percent held accountable for what you put in your body,&#x201D; she said. &#x201C;You can&#x2019;t say, &#x2018;Oh, someone gave me a massage.&#x2019; &#x201D;</p>
              
              
  					  
            
              <p class="paragraph">Does he hear that disbelief? He smiled faintly. He has said many times that he is not doping. He noted that his 6-year-old son sat on his lap for the post-race news conference at the United States trials, and he spoke of the joy that brought him. Maybe that would be enough. Or maybe not. I asked if he had thought about retirement. He shook his head. &#x201C;Being suspended, losing all those years, it&#x2019;s like I constantly have to prove a point,&#x201D; he said. &#x201C;I can&#x2019;t stop yet. I can&#x2019;t.&#x201D;</p>

              <p class="paragraph"><strong><span class="dropcap">K</span>atie Ledecky is</strong> so nice. So normal. &#x201C;She&#x2019;s a better person than a swimmer,&#x201D; says her coach, Bruce Gemmell &#x2014; a comment that, strictly speaking, would put her in the running for best person in the world. After she came home from London in 2012 with an Olympic gold medal, she rejoined her high-school swim team in Bethesda, Md., and when she wasn&#x2019;t in the water, she stood and cheered on her teammates. At lower-level meets that she&#x2019;s not attending, members of her club team can count on texts from her: <em>Good luck! Swim fast!</em> She stands just under six feet, but her coach insists that she is shorter than most of her rivals, which is not the case but advances the conceit of Katie being, well, normal.</p>
              
              
  					  
            
              <p class="paragraph">Ledecky, 19, is also happy, seemingly just about all the time. When you start listing the factors that make her so freakishly good at what she does, being freakishly happy has to rank very high. She rarely has anxieties about her swimming or anything else, and when she does, she says: &#x201C;I can get rid of them. I&#x2019;m pretty good at doing that. If I&#x2019;m worried about something, I&#x2019;m able to make myself just think about something else.&#x201D;</p>
              
              
  					  
            
              <p class="paragraph">The sport she has come to dominate makes almost impossible demands of the body and spirit. It imposes a ratio of hard training to exhilaration that is depressingly out of whack. Top swimmers train as often as nine times a week, 50-plus weeks a year, with their heads submerged in water for two or more hours at each of those sessions. What they hear is the rhythm of their own strokes, their teammates&#x2019; kicking, their coach&#x2019;s muffled voice. One of the sport&#x2019;s cruelties is that all this extreme training produces, on the whole, lackluster competitive performances. Swimmers try to peak just once or twice a year, and they prepare for these occasions in scientific and ritualistic ways. They swim fewer yards in the weeks leading up to a big competition, in order to be rested and fresh. They also, on the eve of major races, shave: women their legs and arms, men their legs, arms, chests, backs and sometimes their heads. The idea is to feel sleek and fast in the water.</p>
              
              
  					  
            
              <p class="paragraph">Ledecky wants practices and all but the biggest meets to feel harder, not easier. &#x201C;I haven&#x2019;t shaved my legs since Russia,&#x201D; she told me late last year in one of our first conversations, referring to a competition many months earlier. She laughed, which she does often. She has a big, engaging smile. &#x201C;I&#x2019;m sorry,&#x201D; she added. &#x201C;That&#x2019;s probably too much information, right?&#x201D;</p>
              
              
  					  
            
              <p class="paragraph">Ledecky grew up in the suburbs of Washington and started swimming at 6 in a local summer league. Early on, she was fast but not a prodigy. She participated in a weekly Irish dance program and until she was 11 still played soccer and basketball. Her emergence as an elite swimmer was sudden, and it surprised her parents. At a meet at a neighborhood pool when she was 13, the volunteer announcer introduced her before one heat by saying, &#x201C;I&#x2019;m sure you&#x2019;ll see her in the Olympics someday.&#x201D; It bothered her father. &#x201C;I was like, Come on, she&#x2019;s <em>13 years old</em>,&#x201D; David Ledecky told me.</p>

              <p class="paragraph">His daughter, though, was quietly setting goals, sharing them only with her coach &#x2014; first, make the Olympic trials, then qualify for the Summer Games. In one of her first meets with world-class competition, she swam a 400-meter freestyle against Allison Schmitt, a top American swimmer who is seven years older. &#x201C;I gave her a bit of a race,&#x201D; is how Ledecky recalls it. &#x201C;After that, I knew I could compete against those people. I wasn&#x2019;t afraid to race them.&#x201D;</p>
              
              
  					  
            
              <p class="paragraph">In 2012 in London, Ledecky, a little-known 15-year-old, won the gold medal in the 800-meter freestyle, defeating Rebecca Adlington, a British swimmer and world-record holder so heavily favored that Prince William, Kate Middleton and other members of the British royal family were in attendance at the Olympic aquatic center, anticipating a coronation. As the crowd chanted Adlington&#x2019;s name, Ledecky channeled its energy and imagined the shouts were &#x201C;Ledecky, Ledecky, Ledecky.&#x201D; In the four years since, she has been on a world-record spree, setting them at all times of the year and over a stunning range of distances. First she established her supremacy in the distance freestyles, then she took command of shorter events. She is now the world&#x2019;s top female swimmer in the 200, 400, 800 and 1,500 freestyles. She is among the best Americans in the 100 free. No swimmer has conquered this combination of distances in nearly half a century, and to many in the sport, her achievement is hard to fathom &#x2014; it would be like the Jamaican star sprinter Usain Bolt taking up and winning mile races.</p>
              
              
  					  
            
              <p class="paragraph">In mid-January, I attended a three-day meet at the University of Texas in Austin. A large contingent of top American and international swimmers were there. Most of them talked about using the weekend to measure the state of their training; no one, or almost no one, was expecting to produce particularly fast results.</p>
              
              
  					  
            
              <p class="paragraph">On the day before the racing began, Ledecky, who took a gap year after high school to train for the Olympics before she enrolls at Stanford this September, was led into a small media room by a staff member of USA Swimming. Not uncommon for a swimmer, she can seem a little awkward on land, and she approached the lectern with a gangly, slightly slope-shouldered gait. When the questioning began, she seemed to try to fall in line with the other swimmers&#x2019; modest goals. She said, for example, that she was just hoping to &#x201C;implement&#x201D; some of what she had been working on in practices. A poised public speaker, she referred to the coming competition more than once as &#x201C;one of these kinds of meets&#x201D; &#x2014; meaning not too big a deal. But when someone asked what times she anticipated, she smiled, and it was a thinner smile, almost a smirk. &#x201C;I think it&#x2019;s going to be a good weekend,&#x201D; she said. It was Ledecky&#x2019;s demure way of saying: Keep your eye on me.</p>
              
              
  					  
            
              <p class="paragraph">On the meet&#x2019;s last day, she broke her own world record in the 800 freestyle, her 11th world mark since London. At the United States Swim Trials in Omaha, Neb., earlier this summer, she won three events. She could end up with four or possibly even five gold medals in Rio, depending on how many relays she participates in. The first eight nights of NBC&#x2019;s Olympic coverage will focus on swimming, with about 90 minutes of live coverage from the pool every evening, and Ledecky will play a starring role. She will get the kind of exposure that recent American Olympians have eagerly converted into riches, but Ledecky has distinguished herself in another way too: She has not become a professional athlete. This has little to do with pursuing some notion of Olympic purity, which never existed anyway; instead, it is a savvy decision that serves her swimming and may very well give her a competitive advantage. While some others are out chasing endorsement dollars, she is focused only on gold.</p>

              <p class="paragraph"><strong>When you see</strong> Ledecky race, it looks as if she is sprinting every length, even the distance events &#x2014; which seems impossible, because who could sprint full-out for, say, 800 meters, 16 lengths of a 50-meter pool? But Ledecky does. &#x201C;That&#x2019;s kind of how I treat it,&#x201D; she said when I asked if she was really sprinting. She saves her legs in the early portions of a distance event, kicking just enough to keep her body riding high in the water, but she pulls at a fast tempo and with near maximum effort. One way to explain how she has become a sprinter, adding shorter races to her area of dominance, is to recognize that it is what she has already been doing. (The 100-meter freestyle is considered a sprint, the 200 and 400 middle-distance events and the 800 and 1,500 distance races.)</p>
              
              
  					  
            
              <p class="paragraph">In Austin, I sat down with Bob Bowman, Michael Phelps&#x2019;s coach, whom I first met while writing about Phelps when he was roughly the same age that Ledecky is now. &#x201C;She has an intensity to her swimming that I have never seen in a distance athlete,&#x201D; he said. &#x201C;She&#x2019;s completely fearless&#x201D; &#x2014; by which he meant she goes out fast without the fear of fading at the end.</p>
              
              
  					  
            
              <p class="paragraph">Swimming is a highly technical sport, and there are different approaches to each stroke, but Ledecky&#x2019;s freestyle is a near replica of Phelps&#x2019;s. In what she recalls as a &#x201C;eureka moment,&#x201D; it was taught to her in 2011, when she was 14, by her coach Yuri Suguiyama, who has since moved on to become the associate head coach of the men&#x2019;s swim team at the University of California, Berkeley. He showed her a video of Phelps setting a world record in a 200 free at a world championship meet, and they set out to copy his form.</p>
              
              
  					  
            
              <p class="paragraph">Unlike Phelps, whose physique is built for swimming &#x2014; a long torso, big hands that serve as paddles and relatively short legs (which create less drag in the water) &#x2014; Ledecky is unremarkably proportioned. She describes her stroke as &#x201C;loping,&#x201D; but there is nothing leisurely-looking about it. She has what swim coaches call a &#x201C;high elbow catch&#x201D; and a quick connection to the water. Her arms are never up in the air very long. Like Phelps, she has a &#x201C;gallop&#x201D; in her stroke: She glides on one side just an instant longer, like a sailboat keeling.</p>
              
              
  					  
            
              <p class="paragraph">Her future coach at Stanford, Greg Meehan, uses the term &#x201C;aquatic strength&#x201D; in talking about her prowess, adding that it&#x2019;s hard to quantify and not related to how much weight a person can lift in a gym. &#x201C;She grabs a lot of water and holds onto it through every stroke,&#x201D; is how he explains it. &#x201C;And she is able to do that again and again, without letting up.&#x201D;</p>
              
              
  					  
            
              <p class="paragraph">Until the year of the London Games, Ledecky breathed to both sides, every third stroke, but that creates too much side-to-side body sway for efficient racing. She now breathes to her right side, with her left arm in the water &#x2014; and so smoothly that the goggle on her left eye never comes fully out of the water. You wonder how she even gets air.</p>

              <p class="paragraph">&#x201C;Her form is as close to perfect as exists,&#x201D; says Russell Mark, a former college swimmer with a degree in aerospace engineering who is a high-performance consultant for USA Swimming. Mark compiles metrics for America&#x2019;s top swimmers. His numbers indicate that Ledecky has been steadily increasing her tempo &#x2014; turning her strokes over faster &#x2014; while also improving the quality of her stroke, meaning each one takes her farther. This combination is enormously difficult to accomplish. When younger swimmers increase their tempo, they often &#x201C;spin&#x201D; &#x2014; they don&#x2019;t get anywhere &#x2014; but even the best swimmers can fall into a version of the same trap. In her 800-meter races, in which her world record is 8:06.68, Ledecky is now completing a full cycle &#x2014; or strokes with each arm &#x2014; approximately every 1.4 seconds. After her push off the wall, she covers 50 meters with 20 cycles.</p>
              
              
  					  
            
              <p class="paragraph">&#x201C;People trying to go fast are like animals,&#x201D; said Bowman, who happens to own thoroughbreds and sees in them some of the same biomechanical habits of the swimmers he trains. &#x201C;You watch a horse. The first thing they do is increase their stride length. And the second thing is the rate. She followed the natural progression. She picked up the rate of her stroke to keep the thing moving forward, which is how she got from 8:14 to 8:06 in the 800. Sooner or later she&#x2019;ll have to go back to length. It&#x2019;s a balance. You can&#x2019;t just do one or the other.&#x201D;</p>
              
              
  					  
            
              <p class="paragraph"><strong>Swimmers race the</strong> clock and one another every day in practice. Carol Capitani, who has coached male and female swimmers and now coaches the women&#x2019;s swim team at Texas, says that women training together have &#x201C;a different community&#x201D; and often see one another as friends first, rather than competitors. Women &#x201C;need to get permission from each other that it&#x2019;s all right to lay it on the line every day,&#x201D; she says. &#x201C;They have to do it with grace and humility, but they have to learn, and sometimes I have to coach them to understand, that it&#x2019;s not about taking turns or making allowances for someone having a bad day. You have to try to beat that person next to you every time. Be happy that you&#x2019;re fast.&#x201D;</p>
              
              
  					  
            
              <p class="paragraph">Ledecky&#x2019;s competitiveness is apparent at practices and in meets, even if it is expressed quietly. About 15 minutes before their events, swimmers gather in a &#x201C;ready room&#x201D; that usually consists of a few rows of chairs and a TV showing the races. Ledecky invariably sits in a kind of trance with her parka zipped up and her hood pulled over her head. The intensity she radiates causes even friends to keep their distance. &#x201C;At practice, she&#x2019;s a nice girl,&#x201D; Anna Belousova, a 19-year-old Russian breaststroker who trains with Ledecky, told me. &#x201C;At meets, I&#x2019;m afraid to go near her.&#x201D;</p>
              
              
  					  
            
              <p class="paragraph">One afternoon this spring, I was sitting with Ledecky by the pool at Georgetown Prep, an all-boys school where her team, the Nation&#x2019;s Capital Swim Club, practices. A couple of freshmen came over and asked for an autograph, and she signed. I suggested to her that she seemed to enjoy beating her opponents, not just by a bit, but really crushing them. &#x201C;Sure I do,&#x201D; she said. &#x201C;It&#x2019;s not like you can be nice when you race. But it&#x2019;s not personal. I&#x2019;m mostly focused on my own time, and you&#x2019;ve got to be mean to the clock, right?&#x201D;</p>
              
              
  					  
            
              <p class="paragraph">In the starting blocks before a race, Ledecky does not stroke her biceps or pound her fists against her own body, as some male swimmers do. (In Omaha, a swimmer billing himself as the Dark Knight went to the blocks in a Batman mask.) She just stretches her neck a bit and shakes her arms out, then dives in the pool and wins.</p>

              <p class="paragraph">In Bethesda, Ledecky trains with about 30 swimmers, spread out over eight lanes, coached by Bruce Gemmell and two assistant coaches. But she has only three real training partners, all of them male, because they are the only ones with the ability to keep up with her. They swim either in the same lane or in an adjoining lane to Ledecky. Her training mates told me that when they are supposed to be going at a slower pace &#x2014; practices consist of repeated sets of distances swum at variable rates of speed and effort &#x2014; she tends to swim fast, pulling the whole group along with her. The ability to coast is something she either does not want or does not have. Ledecky told me that sometimes she has bad days at practice, when she is just not feeling energetic, and shrugs them off. If she has two in a row, it frustrates her. Her aerobic fitness is a combination of her genetics &#x2014; her &#x201C;big engine,&#x201D; as Meehan, the Stanford coach says &#x2014; and the fact that she works so hard.</p>
              
              
  					  
            
              <p class="paragraph">It&#x2019;s not unusual for men and women swimmers to train together, but being in the pool with Ledecky is something that many men can&#x2019;t handle. In April, Conor Dwyer, a 6-foot-5, 27-year-old American swimmer who won a gold medal in the 4-by-200 freestyle relay in London, gave a revealing interview posted online by USA Swimming. In it, he talked about male swimmers being &#x201C;broken&#x201D; by Ledecky when they practiced together at the Olympic Training Center in Colorado Springs.</p>
              
              
  					  
            
              <p class="paragraph">&#x201C;She is no easy task to beat in practice, even as a male,&#x201D; he said. &#x201C;I didn&#x2019;t get broken by her, so I&#x2019;m happy with that.&#x201D; He added: &#x201C;I saw her break a lot of guys in practice. ... What I mean is if we&#x2019;re doing a 3K threshold&#x201D; &#x2014; 30 all-out 100 frees &#x2014; &#x201C;she&#x2019;ll just start beating you every single hundred, and slowly but surely you get broken like you do in a long race, like a mile. Your morale goes down pretty quickly when you get broken by a female in practice. I saw a couple of guys have to get yanked out of workout because they got beat by her.&#x201D;</p>
              
              
  					  
            
              <p class="paragraph">When I asked Ledecky about this, she claimed not to have noticed. &#x201C;I was probably just concentrating on doing my own work,&#x201D; she said.</p>
              
              
  					  
            
              <p class="paragraph">Ledecky&#x2019;s training partners include Andrew Gemmell, the coach&#x2019;s son, who is 25 and finished ninth in the 1,500 at the 2012 London Games, and Matthew Hirschberger, 17, who competed at this summer&#x2019;s Olympic trials and is one of the nation&#x2019;s top young middle-distance swimmers. (Neither qualified for the games in Rio.) &#x201C;I&#x2019;m not gonna lie, it can be annoying when she beats you,&#x201D; Hirschberger told me. Even if the person getting the best of him is a reigning world-record holder in three events? &#x201C;You&#x2019;re just not used to getting beat by a girl,&#x201D; he said.</p>
              
              
  					  
            
              <p class="paragraph">When Gemmell swam for the college team at Georgia, he trained with both male and female Olympians. &#x201C;Look, I understand, he&#x2019;s a little younger,&#x201D; he said, when I told him what Hirschberger had shared. &#x201C;I&#x2019;ve got a little more of a perspective. There have been a couple of times where I&#x2019;ve come really close to asking my dad: Can I pop out of practice to watch? Because what&#x2019;s going on next to me is just ridiculous. It&#x2019;s unreal.&#x201D;</p>

              <p class="paragraph">Ledecky&#x2019;s ability to crush men in practice does not necessarily mean she would defeat them in competition. There&#x2019;s a difference between imposing her will, and perhaps superior conditioning, over the course of a two-hour practice and doing it in a shorter race in which men&#x2019;s generally greater strength provides an advantage. Her best chance would probably be in the 1,500 freestyle, which women race at the FINA World Championships but not at the Olympics. (The men don&#x2019;t swim the 800 in the Olympics, so there are the same number of events for male and female swimmers.) Ledecky&#x2019;s best time in the event would put her among the dozen or so top American men and is 25 seconds faster than their qualifying time at the United States Olympic trials &#x2014; but it is much too slow to earn a medal at the Games. On the other hand, because no other woman offers a real challenge to her, she is never pushed in that event. I asked Andrew Gemmell, who specializes in the 1,500 free, a hypothetical question: What if, in some dystopian swim universe, Ledecky was told that there would be no women&#x2019;s events and that she would have to try to make the American team by competing with the men in the 1,500?</p>
              
              
  					  
            
              <p class="paragraph">His father, who trains her, had told me that he did not think she could qualify, a feat that under current rules would require her to finish first or second at the trials. Andrew, who trains side by side with her, had a different answer. &#x201C;It would be really difficult, but I would never bet against her,&#x201D; he said. &#x201C;I don&#x2019;t think anybody knows yet what she&#x2019;s capable of.&#x201D;</p>
              
              
  					  
            
              <p class="paragraph">Ledecky is, in a sense, the last amateur of the Olympic Games. She is not the only Olympian who has opted against turning pro &#x2014; in many sports, there is no appreciable money to be made &#x2014; but she is the only one at her exalted level. In order to accept a swimming scholarship at Stanford, she chose to pass up millions of dollars in potential endorsement contracts.</p>
              
              
  					  
            
              <p class="paragraph">For many years, Olympians had to remain amateurs, at least ostensibly. The &#x201C;amateur ideal&#x201D; may have been outdated from the start, and it hurt many athletes, going all the way back to Jim Thorpe, who was stripped of his medals from the 1912 Games when it was later discovered that he had accepted money to play semipro baseball. (The medals were restored posthumously.) But professionalism has its own costs. At the Olympic trials in Omaha, it was hard to miss the pure joy with which Ledecky seemed to be swimming, especially compared with rivals who spoke of the immense pressure they were feeling. It helped, of course, that she was so far ahead of her competition and did not really have to worry about qualifying. But one reason for this might be that she has achieved an ideal that is so difficult for others to reach &#x2014; truly racing for herself. &#x201C;The more money that gets put into something, the more it gets messed up,&#x201D; Bowman, Phelps&#x2019;s coach, told me. &#x201C;Nobody is demanding her time. She never misses a day. That&#x2019;s how you maintain that level.&#x201D;</p>
              
              
  					  
            
              <p class="paragraph">There are just a handful of swimmers who have made life-changing money from the sport, but for those who do, most notably Phelps, it can be a lot. &#x201C;She would have had the earnings potential that no one but Michael has had, if she wanted it,&#x201D; Bowman said. I asked Matt Powell, a sports-industry analyst with the NPD Group, a market-research firm, about Ledecky&#x2019;s commercial value. &#x201C;She has a terrific personality &#x2014; great kid, great smile, she&#x2019;s excelling at a really high level,&#x201D; he said. &#x201C;The endorsement side could be worth millions to her, as much as $10 to $15 million per year.&#x201D;</p>
              
              
  					  
            
              <p class="paragraph">At different times, I heard Ledecky&#x2019;s coach, Bruce Gemmell, say that she was going to be a performer &#x201C;in NBC&#x2019;s billion-dollar reality show,&#x201D; referring to the network&#x2019;s telecasts from Rio. It was said with an edge. Her parents and coach well understand, of course, why she matters to NBC and the vast commercial enterprise of the Games. The network&#x2019;s cameras gravitate to American winners, and she is the surest bet. Phelps, now 31, is back in the water after a brief retirement and then a suspension after a second arrest on D.U.I. charges, but he will be entered in fewer events than he raced in his prime &#x2014; and he won&#x2019;t be a solid favorite in any of them. The American swim team, both the men and the women, looks weaker than it has in past Olympiads, based on the times in Omaha; swimmers like Ryan Lochte and Missy Franklin, who starred in past Summer Games, will most likely have to improve their times to compete for gold. Ledecky won three events in Omaha &#x2014; the 200 freestyle, in which she is likely to be challenged by the Italian star Federica Pellegrini for gold, and the 400 and 800 frees, in which she looks untouchable. She could also win medals in the 4-by-200 freestyle relay and, if coaches place her in it, the 4-by-100 relay.</p>
              
              
  					  
            
              <p class="paragraph">Her parents zealously protect her time and have rejected requests from the late-night shows &#x2014; and even NBC Sports and USA Swimming &#x2014; when they felt it would interfere with her preparation. They attend almost all her meets and will be in Rio, but they avoid attention. Her father often sits in corners of arenas where the TV cameras won&#x2019;t find him. &#x201C;You can sit there stoically while she&#x2019;s swimming or jump up and down,&#x201D; he says. &#x201C;You look like an idiot one way or the other.&#x201D; The family discussed whether she should turn pro, but it was never seriously considered, they say, nor did they really endeavor to attach a number to how much money she might be passing up.</p>
              
              
  					  
            
              <p class="paragraph">To turn pro at a young age means separating from peers who have gone off to college and instead joining a training group of other professional swimmers, all of them most likely older. There is a risk that an already difficult sport will become a lonely one too. Ledecky is aware, as well, that several female swimmers who turned professional out of high school have experienced steep declines in their performance. &#x201C;It didn&#x2019;t really tempt me,&#x201D; Ledecky says. &#x201C;Nobody ever told me, &#x2018;You&#x2019;ll get this certain amount of money if you go pro.&#x2019; I don&#x2019;t know what it would be, but it&#x2019;s not something that bothers me.&#x201D;</p>
              
              
  					  
            
              <p class="paragraph">The decision that Ledecky made was one she could make. The youngest of two children, she has grown up in a fair degree of comfort. Her father is a lawyer, and her mother, Mary Gen, a former college swimmer, worked as a hospital administrator, and they now spend much of their time shuttling their daughter to and from practices. Her older brother graduated from Harvard in May. An uncle, Jonathan Ledecky, is a venture capitalist and co-majority owner of the New York Islanders. Ledecky is an excellent student, and whenever she puts swimming behind her, she should have a Stanford degree to add to what will, in all likelihood, be a display case full of Olympic gold medals.</p>
              
              
  					  
            
              <p class="paragraph">But there is also the possibility that we are just at the beginning of her reign. Four years ago, Ledecky was the youngest swimmer, male or female, on the American team in London. She will be the youngest again in Rio. And four years from now, at the Summer Games in Tokyo, she will be just 23 and probably still in her prime.</p>
              
              
  					  
            
              <p class="paragraph">She has said that after this summer, she will probably put more work into the shorter races, including the 100, which she did not qualify for at the trials in Omaha. She could start competing in the 400 individual medley, which combines all four competitive strokes (butterfly, backstroke, breaststroke and freestyle); she ranks among the top Americans in the event even though it has been an afterthought for her. But to continue setting new world records in the distance events, she may need something that&#x2019;s out of her control &#x2014; real competitors.</p>
              
              
  					  
            
              <p class="paragraph">No other woman has ever come within seven seconds of her top time in the 800 freestyle; in the 1,500, the gap is a ridiculous 13 seconds. At the Olympic trials, Leah Smith, an emerging middle-distance swimmer, came within two seconds of her in the 400. She said she was excited because, in her races against Ledecky, &#x201C;I had never been able to see her feet before.&#x201D;</p>
              
              
  					  
            
              <p class="paragraph">Rowdy Gaines, the longtime commentator on NBC&#x2019;s swim telecasts and himself an Olympic gold medalist, told me that Ledecky is already the most dominant swimmer he has seen in his four decades in the sport, even more so than Phelps. &#x201C;Michael had rivals, swimmers who could stay at least somewhat close to him,&#x201D; he said. &#x201C;In Katie&#x2019;s best events, she has none. To be fair, they are longer races. But she&#x2019;s swimming them by herself.&#x201D;</p>

              <p class="paragraph">I compete in a sport that is decided by one one-hundredth of a second. It&#x2019;s difficult to be in a sport that measures you that way. Joanna was very transparent about what it took to get the gold medal. She was always going above what the standard was; I saw that, no matter what, I always have to push harder. When I run, I don&#x2019;t notice anything: It&#x2019;s just me and the track and nothing else. I&#x2019;m there to do a job. I know that anything less than winning a gold medal is failure.</p>

              <p class="paragraph">Allyson is very different than anyone I&#x2019;ve ever met on the track. She was born with a gift that is unlike any I have ever seen &#x2014; it&#x2019;s effortless. She&#x2019;s a gazelle when she runs: She just opens up these long legs and goes. I get bored when I just run. When I was younger, I thought hurdling was completely crazy. You fall all the time! I clipped three hurdles in a race in Athens, but I was able to keep going. It&#x2019;s just like in life: Make the right choice, don&#x2019;t mess this up.</p>

              <p class="paragraph">Jimmy&#x2019;s been my hero since I was 6 years old. I didn&#x2019;t have a lot of American athletes to look up to, and he was the most decorated judo athlete at the time. I met him when I was 9, and he signed a poster and my uniform and I thought, Someday I want to be as good as him.</p>
              
              
  					  
            
              <p class="paragraph">When I was 16, my first coach was arrested for sexually abusing me. I ended up in Jimmy&#x2019;s office, crying. I remember him looking at me and saying that what happened was wrong and that I needed to heal. I couldn&#x2019;t wrap my head around it, but he and his father saved my life.</p>
              
              
  					  
            
              <p class="paragraph">I&#x2019;ve been with the Pedros almost 10 years now, and I have cried at every practice. They&#x2019;re grueling. They make me cry every night, and I&#x2019;m an Olympic champion. So to get to beat up on Jimmy for a little bit ... well, I&#x2019;ve been waiting for this for 10 years. That particular move is our school&#x2019;s specialty, <em>juji gatame</em>: It&#x2019;s a form of a cross armlock, it&#x2019;s a submission hold. And while it may not look like it, I am in total control!</p>

              <p class="paragraph">When Kayla first came to us, she was completely broken down, completely torn apart. She didn&#x2019;t want to do judo, but it was the only thing she knew. Her parents basically said: Please rebuild this girl. We got her psychological assistance; judo was secondary. We got her around people who are positive, people with similar goals. We got her enrolled in high school, we gave her a job. She trained with Ronda Rousey, and it became her normal.</p>
              
              
  					  
            
              <p class="paragraph">As a coach, you always want your athletes to surpass what you did. That was my father&#x2019;s mentality too, when I went to the Olympics &#x2014; I fulfilled his dream. When I was a young kid, my father was a huge fan of the Olympics. I watched every Olympic Games on the TV. Carl Lewis and Nadia Comaneci and Bruce Jenner &#x2014; I was trying to be like them.</p>

              <p class="paragraph"><strong><span class="dropcap">W</span>hen the idea</strong> of bringing the 2024 Summer Olympics to Boston surfaced in the media in the spring of 2013, one of the first Bostonians to turn a critical eye toward it was Chris Dempsey, a consultant at Mitt Romney&#x2019;s old firm, Bain &amp; Company. Dempsey, then 30, was the sort of person who, all things being equal, might have been expected to champion Boston&#x2019;s Olympic bid. He had been an assistant transportation secretary in Gov. Deval Patrick&#x2019;s administration and was a friend and former colleague of Rich Davey, who would eventually become the chief executive of Boston 2024, the private nonprofit group formed to organize the bid.</p>
              
              
  					  
            
              <p class="paragraph">Dempsey understood Boston&#x2019;s appeal to the Games&#x2019; organizers. In December 2014, shortly after Boston submitted its bid, the International Olympics Committee announced its &#x201C;Agenda 2020,&#x201D; a suite of reforms aimed at making the Games more affordable and sustainable and thus more accessible to smaller cities. It was an acknowledgment of criticism, following excesses like Beijing&#x2019;s starchitecture-studded 2008 spectacle, that the Olympics had become a showy indulgence for a handful of deep-coffered world cities and a boondoggle for everyone else.</p>
              
              
  					  
            
              <p class="paragraph">Boston, which was proposing a temporary stadium and a walkable footprint for the Games, seemed an ideal showpiece for this new direction. Dempsey had read in news reports that the I.O.C., which had not staged a summer Games in America since Atlanta in 1996, was eager to return to the United States. And the East Coast was one of the most lucrative time zones in the world for live broadcasts.</p>
              
              
  					  
            
              <p class="paragraph">Dempsey also understood what Boston&#x2019;s Olympics boosters thought the city would get out of the deal. In the vision they laid out to the city, the Games &#x2014; or, more specifically, the billions in private funding promised by Boston&#x2019;s Olympic organizing committee &#x2014; could provide the city with a cash infusion, and the infrastructure investments could help Boston make headway on its most intractable problems: worsening economic inequality, a lack of affordable housing and a crumbling public-transit system with an estimated $7 billion repair bill. Rather than leaving behind an architectural legacy of crumbling eyesores, as the Olympics infamously had elsewhere, the Boston Games would contribute to the permanent redevelopment of the city: the down-at-the-heels industrial district slated to host the temporary stadium would be reborn as a whole new mixed-income neighborhood called Midtown, and the Olympic Village would be transformed into housing for college students and senior citizens, among other things. It was a chance for one of America&#x2019;s most innovative and creative cities to reinvent itself and perhaps reinvent the Olympics in the process.</p>
              
              
  					  
            
              <p class="paragraph">But the more Dempsey thought about it, the less sense it all made. &#x201C;You will be pulling time and attention away from education and housing and putting it into questions like &#x2018;Where does the velodrome go? Who&#x2019;s paying for it?&#x2019;&#x2009;&#x201D; he told me. &#x201C;It was very clear to me that if 2024 won, for a number of years leading up to 2024, the single biggest issue was going to be 2024.&#x201D; Dempsey found an ally in his friend Liam Kerr, the state director for Democrats for Education Reform. The two vowed to derail Boston&#x2019;s bid as quickly as possible. With little more than a Twitter account, a website and a PowerPoint presentation they threw together in a couple of weeks, they started an organization whose name spoke for itself: No Boston Olympics.</p>

              <p class="paragraph">The Olympics are often sold as a kind of gold medal for the world&#x2019;s brightest cities. They are seen as an opportunity to shine on the world stage and a financial prize to be reaped: hundreds of millions of dollars in ticket revenue, plus billions in long-term economic development, all wrapped in a gleaming two-week-long pageant of international good will. But they are also an incredibly risky investment. Cities are forced to sign agreements promising extraordinary fiscal and regulatory power to Olympic organizers and to pick up the tab if the production goes overbudget, which it often does.</p>
              
              
  					  
            
              <p class="paragraph">Few cities have taken these lessons quite as much to heart as Boston, whose residents, led by Dempsey and Kerr&#x2019;s unexpected rebellion, shocked city leaders and the United States Olympic Committee last year by rejecting the proposal to host the 2024 Games, after a protracted and very public fight that the chief executive of the U.S.O.C., Scott Blackmun, would later call &#x201C;the most unsettling and challenging time in my professional life.&#x201D; The defeat was all the more stunning because the Boston bid epitomized, for Olympics supporters inside and outside the city, a blueprint for a smarter, more impact-conscious Games. Instead, it became a referendum on the Olympics&#x2019; ability to wreak political and fiscal havoc.</p>
              
              
  					  
            
              <p class="paragraph"><strong>At the outset,</strong> it was hard to imagine how No Boston Olympics could possibly succeed. With a virtually nonexistent budget and a team of three volunteers, the organization was taking on a coalition that included some of the city&#x2019;s biggest business leaders, philanthropists, political operatives and sports legends like David Ortiz and Larry Bird. But what Dempsey&#x2019;s group did have on its side were some unsettling facts. A growing body of academic research showed the poisonous effects of the Olympics on cities. Some of the researchers who assembled it lived in Massachusetts.</p>
              
              
  					  
            
              <p class="paragraph">Among them was Andrew Zimbalist, an economist at Smith College. Zimbalist had stumbled into writing about the economics of baseball at the suggestion of his young son, and he began scrutinizing the deals that cities cut with baseball teams to build new stadiums. In 2003, Zimbalist was asked by the chairman of the Shubert Organization, Broadway&#x2019;s largest theater owner and operator, to take a look at the impact of New York&#x2019;s bid for the 2012 Olympics, which piqued his interest in the Games. In his book &#x201C;Circus Maximus: The Economic Gamble Behind Hosting the Olympics and the World Cup,&#x201D; published amid the debate over Boston&#x2019;s proposal, Zimbalist dismantled the prevailing arguments that the Olympics led to long-term financial growth.</p>
              
              
  					  
            
              <p class="paragraph">The Olympics promised economic benefits to all, but in fact, Zimbalist wrote, the beneficiaries are usually few: construction companies, trade unions, architectural firms, investment banks and insurance companies. In other words, the winners just happen to be the same sorts of entities that often support Olympic bids in their cities. You might assume the hospitality industry would benefit, but studies showed it usually didn&#x2019;t. The direct tourism benefits of the Games were often more than offset with losses caused by congestion, elevated prices and security concerns.</p>
              
              
  					  
            
              <p class="paragraph">Zimbalist dissected the various costs of the Games and found that claims of budget surpluses were often built on hidden government subsidies. He argued that hosting the Olympics often increased inequality, because public housing was frequently demolished to make way for new venues. He found no evidence to suggest that hosting the Olympics helped cities attract new foreign investment.</p>
              
              
  					  
            
              <p class="paragraph">In fact, in the not-so-distant past, before the myth of the Olympics&#x2019; economic benefits had taken hold, the Games were seen by many cities as a bad bet. When the I.O.C. went looking for a host city for the 1984 Games, it found virtually no takers; the memories of Munich 1972 (the Palestinian terrorist attack) and Montreal 1976 (a financial disaster that would leave the city in debt for 30 years) were too fresh. Los Angeles finally broke the losing streak in 1984, hosting a turmoil-free Games and turning a nominal profit, but this was partly because the city had more pre-existing sports infrastructure than others did and partly because, as the only city willing to host the Games, it was able to cut a better deal with the I.O.C., which waived its customary demand that the host city pay for any cost overruns and revenue shortfalls. Los Angeles was the exception, not the rule.</p>
              
              
  					  
            
              <p class="paragraph">Los Angeles might have been the exception, rather than the rule, but it nevertheless bolstered the dream of a profitable Olympics. For a couple of decades, the world&#x2019;s great cities competed vigorously for the honor of hosting the games. In recent years, however, reluctance has once again crept in. Four of the six cities initially bidding for the 2022 Olympics in 2013 and 2014 eventually pulled out of the running.</p>

<div class="descript">&ldquo;Olympics meets city, city builds stadiums, stadiums lose millions and millions of dollars&rdquo; is a story we've heard countless time, but the disastrously expensive 1976 Montreal Games weren't just bad in the short run. Nearly 30 years later, the Montreal Expos were stuck playing in the excessively spacious, hastily constructed Olympic Stadium carpeted with AstroTurf. By the 2005 season, the franchise was in Washington and brought misery to a new generation of Montreal sports fans.</div>

              <p class="paragraph">The Boston Games, boosters argued, would be smaller, more sustainable and more transparent in their planning than past Olympics. But from the beginning, the process seemed suspiciously tight-lipped. Under pressure from the U.S.O.C. to keep details of the bid secret, Boston 2024 failed to reach out to community partners until it was too late, and its own disclosures were outflanked by details uncovered through public-records requests by sleuthing newspaper columnists and citizen journalists. In November 2014, it was revealed that Boston 2024&#x2019;s plans included taking over Franklin Park in the Jamaica Plain neighborhood, the crown jewel in the city&#x2019;s Frederick Law Olmsted-designed Emerald Necklace, an idea about which the boosters had not yet consulted the public-private partnership that helped manage the park. &#x201C;That&#x2019;s when I got really scared,&#x201D; John Ruch, then the editor of The Jamaica Plain Gazette, says. &#x201C;I started to panic.&#x201D; He published a scathing editorial railing against Boston 2024 as a &#x201C;secretive, private committee of tycoons and special interests,&#x201D; then called for residents to organize to oppose it. Within 12 hours, they did.</p>
              
              
  					  
            
              <p class="paragraph">Ruch expected resistance to the Olympics would come from baby boomers weaned on the transportation fights of the 1960s and &#x2019;70s. Instead, the movement Ruch inspired &#x2014; an eventual ad hoc, grass-roots ally to Dempsey&#x2019;s and Kerr&#x2019;s No Boston Olympics, called No Boston 2024 &#x2014; was organized by younger activists who had been involved with the Occupy movement, Black Lives Matter and the A.C.L.U. Within three days they held a public meeting in a church, an event notable enough that Boston 2024 sent a delegation including Doug Rubin, the state&#x2019;s most-celebrated political strategist, who had recently helped put Elizabeth Warren in the Senate.</p>
              
              
  					  
            
              <p class="paragraph"><strong>Meanwhile, No Boston </strong>Olympics used its political connections to focus on the inside game. The group&#x2019;s message first centered on what it called the &#x201C;opportunity costs&#x201D; of the Games: The Olympics, they argued, would consume the city&#x2019;s and state&#x2019;s attention for a decade, making it much harder for Boston to address critical issues in housing and public transportation. But Dempsey and Kerr soon broadened their objections. They warned state lawmakers that they would be financially and politically responsible for whatever mistakes the Olympics planners made. They showed local businesspeople studies demonstrating that hosting the Games failed to promote tourism or growth. A public-relations strategist named Raymond Howell, a former campaign manager to the former Massachusetts governor William Weld, advised Dempsey to focus his message on the taxpayer guarantee: The more No Boston Olympics reminded people that the city and the state were obliged to pay for excess costs, the less enthusiastic people would be to support the bid.</p>
              
              
  					  
            
              <p class="paragraph">In truth, Bostonians were lukewarm about the Olympics from the beginning. Support for the Games peaked in January 2015, just after Boston was named the U.S.O.C.&#x2019;s bid city, with polls showing 51 to 55 percent of those surveyed in the greater Boston area in favor. By contrast, 67 percent of New Yorkers initially supported hosting the 2012 Games. When Chicago was competing for the 2016 Games, support reached 75 percent but plunged below 50 percent when the city admitted it, like Boston, would have to sign a taxpayer guarantee.</p>
              
              
  					  
            
              <p class="paragraph">Boston&#x2019;s mayor, Martin J. Walsh, insisted that polls would show that the majority of people were excited about the Games. But the polls instead showed lukewarm support. Steve Koczela, president of the MassInc Polling Group, who conducted surveys throughout the campaign, says that &#x201C;what happened was, the more people learned about it, the more they thought they would be on the hook to pay for it.&#x201D; By March, approval numbers bottomed out at just 36 percent. &#x201C;And when you&#x2019;re competing against cities and countries where 75 or 80 or 90 percent want the Olympics,&#x201D; Koczela told me, &#x201C;that&#x2019;s not good enough.&#x201D;</p>
              
              
  					  
            
              <p class="paragraph">By spring, the bungled bid rollout, the sagging poll numbers and a series of contentious public meetings had Boston 2024 playing defense. In May, Boston 2024&#x2019;s leader, John Fish, one of the city&#x2019;s most powerful businessmen, stepped down from day-to-day leadership of the bid. &#x201C;Democracy can be very messy,&#x201D; he says today. &#x201C;And I think it got a little more messy than I thought it would.&#x201D; Boston 2024 prepared a last-ditch attempt to salvage Boston&#x2019;s bid, starting a belated effort to incorporate community feedback into the plan for the Games. But state officials had grown wary of what the state&#x2019;s secretary of transportation called, in an email to the governor&#x2019;s chief of staff, &#x201C;projected costs ... based solely on &#x2018;back of the envelope&#x2019; calculations&#x201D; and &#x201C;disingenuous&#x201D; claims about where the money would come from. An independent report financed by the state would later conclude that Boston 2024 underestimated costs by as much as $970 million, while overstating likely revenue by more than $300 million.</p>

              <p class="paragraph">On a Monday in July 2015, Walsh strode to the lectern at a hastily convened news conference to say the city was pulling its support for the bid. But by then, the plan was essentially dead already. The U.S.O.C. turned its attention to Los Angeles, which remains a contender. (The host city will be announced next year.) Boston 2024 reportedly ended its campaign facing more than $4 million in debt.</p>
              
              
  					  
            
              <p class="paragraph">Today, Fish says he takes full responsibility for the loss. He concedes that his group should have taken the time, immediately after Boston was announced as the U.S.O.C.&#x2019;s bid city, to educate residents, gather feedback and incorporate public sentiment into the bid. &#x201C;If we did it all over again, I think we&#x2019;d win,&#x201D; he said, &#x201C;and if someone asked me to do it all over again, I would absolutely do it all over again.&#x201D; But opponents insist the deal wouldn&#x2019;t have gotten any better. &#x201C;It was not a plan that got screwed up,&#x201D; Ruch told me. &#x201C;It was a scam that got exposed.&#x201D;</p>
              
              
  					  
            
              <p class="paragraph">For the I.O.C., the Boston bid laid bare a paradox. The organization&#x2019;s Agenda 2020 might have argued for leaner, less-extravagant Games that wouldn&#x2019;t force smaller cities to take on untenable financial risk. But as the state-financed report suggests, the only truly foolproof way of mitigating the cost and risk of the Games would be to create permanent sites for the Winter and Summer Olympics to which the Games would return every four years. The next best thing would be returning the Games to a megacity that has already invested in the infrastructure needed to support them. What Boston demonstrated was that the twin dreams of making Olympics hosting more egalitarian and more affordable may ultimately not be reconcilable.</p>
              
              
  					  
            
              <p class="paragraph">Dempsey and his No Boston Olympics colleague Kelley Gossett flew to Hamburg, Germany, last October, to advise a group opposing an effort to bring the 2024 Games there. In November, Hamburg residents voted to withdraw the city&#x2019;s bid. &#x201C;I like to think that the I.O.C. has a lot to learn from what happened in Boston,&#x201D; Dempsey told me, &#x201C;even if they are too proud to admit it.&#x201D;</p>

              <p class="paragraph">DICK FOSBURY OUTSMARTS THE HIGH JUMP</p>
              
              
  					  
            
              <p class="paragraph">By Tom Whyman</p>
              
              
  					  
            
              <p class="paragraph"><strong>When I was</strong> a kid, I was a terrible athlete: weak, uncoordinated, too fat, out of breath walking up stairs; the sort of kid who is picked last for everything and loses every race. But I loved sports. Not playing them; I never enjoyed playing them, and I still never get that &#x201C;endorphin rush&#x201D; other people are apparently chasing when they exercise. Not even really <em>watching</em> sports, either. I just loved thinking about sports, reading about them, collecting memorabilia relating to them.</p>
              
              
  					  
            
              <p class="paragraph">As with any child, for me a large part of the joy of reading and thinking about sports was imagining that I myself might someday enjoy real sporting success. But I knew, having the sort of body that I did &#x2014; overweight, flailing, racked by nervous tics &#x2014; that I would never be able to enjoy this sort of success on the usual terms. Instead, I dreamed of finding some trick or innovation that would place me not just on everybody else&#x2019;s level, but above it: a new way of keeping goal in soccer, a new way of bowling a cricket ball.</p>
              
              
  					  
            
              <p class="paragraph">Really, I dreamed of being like Dick Fosbury.</p>
              
              
  					  
            
              <p class="paragraph">When he was growing up, in the 1950s and &#x2019;60s, Dick Fosbury was a pretty mediocre athlete as well. He was a high jumper, but only after he failed to make it onto his school&#x2019;s football and basketball teams. And even when he started practicing the high jump seriously, in college, he still wasn&#x2019;t especially good at it. Using the standard techniques of the time, Fosbury was only able to clear a height of 5 feet 4 inches &#x2014; well below anything like an Olympic standard.</p>
              
              
  					  
            
              <p class="paragraph">This all changed when Fosbury found his innovation. For whatever reason, Fosbury started leaping over the bar by pushing himself up back first, a bizarre technique that necessitated landing on his neck, looking every bit like a corpse being pushed out of a window. Coaches were skeptical, particularly about the technique&#x2019;s safety, but it worked: Fosbury instantly improved his personal best by six inches, and the &#x201C;Fosbury Flop&#x201D; was born. At the 1968 Summer Olympics in Mexico City, Fosbury definitively proved the superiority of his unorthodox method when, as an unheralded outsider, he used it to flop not only to the high-jump gold medal but to an Olympic record.</p>
              
              
  					  
            
              <p class="paragraph">The Fosbury Flop has since become the standard high-jump technique. But it retains, I think, an essential strangeness. Watching the high jumpers flop over the bar back first, I am fascinated by the fact that it would ever occur to someone to do that in the first place; it seems to run contrary to all the logic of the human body. And yet it is, objectively, the best way of jumping over a high bar that we know of. Fosbury discovered that, and what&#x2019;s more, he convinced the world of its correctness.</p>
              
              
  					  
            
              <p class="paragraph">The Olympics ostensibly celebrate human excellence. But all too often, what this means is extreme displays of mere human competence: We witness men and women who have spent their whole lives training to be the best in a particular discipline as it is traditionally practiced and as they have been coached. They are supposed to do some single thing that they have been told to do, exceptionally well, within the limits of the rules, so there is little room in their performances for creativity, innovation or cunning. But an athlete like Fosbury can give Olympic performance a twist &#x2014; and the spontaneity of real art.</p>

              <p class="paragraph">SEOUL, 1988</p>
              
              
  					  
            
              <p class="paragraph">CARL LEWIS IS OUTRUN</p>
              
              
  					  
            
              <p class="paragraph">By Carvell Wallace</p>
              
              
  					  
            
              <p class="paragraph"><strong>In 1988, the</strong> American sprinter, long-jumper and, at the time, four-time gold medalist Carl Lewis lost an Olympic event for the first time in his life. That summer, in Seoul, he was defeated by Ben Johnson, a stoic Canadian of Jamaican descent who had been something of a silent-shadow nemesis to Lewis ever since taking bronze in the 1984 100-meter finals. Lewis was a natural pitchman who courted fame, flashing a perfect smile and a studied elegance; Johnson had the terse indifference of a man who would rather be doing almost anything than speaking in front of a camera. It took Johnson precisely 9.79 seconds to turn Lewis into the kind of man who comes in second.</p>
              
              
  					  
            
              <p class="paragraph">A funny thing happens when a hero stumbles: The qualities that made him great in the first place are instantly recast as the character defects that brought on his downfall. With that 1988 loss, Lewis was suddenly deemed too garish, too full of himself. The beauty and confidence we embraced four years earlier turned into categorical proof that Lewis lacked rigor, that a quiet, hardworking man from the cold north could simply outmuscle the spoiled American.</p>
              
              
  					  
            
              <p class="paragraph">If only it were that simple. Two days after the race, Johnson was informed that he had failed a doping test. The next day, the I.O.C. stripped him of his medal and declared Lewis the true victor. It would later emerge that Lewis himself had tested positive for banned substances during trials. Four of the top five finishers in the 100 that year would fail doping tests at some point in their careers, giving that championship a nickname that has stuck: &#x201C;the Dirtiest Race in History.&#x201D;</p>
              
              
  					  
            
              <p class="paragraph">I was 13 that summer, watching on TV. I had just moved to Los Angeles to live with my mother, who had a lot in common with Lewis: She, too, was intense and exquisite, flamboyant and competitive. She, too, had that particular brand of beauty that can make you feel intimidated by someone at the same time you are irrefutably drawn to them. In my early years, when she and I were a nation&#x2019;s distance away from each other, she was only a dream to me, a promise of family and home; if I could just be with her again, everything would be wonderful. But in the summer of &#x2019;88, our real life in Los Angeles was hot and severe. Eviction and homelessness threatened. I had discovered skateboarding and cursing in secret and drinking gin from a plastic bottle. I had discovered the freedom of leaving our small apartment to ride the bus through endless city blocks, watching the world from behind a graffiti-scrawled window.</p>
              
              
  					  
            
              <p class="paragraph">I had visited my mother in Los Angeles for the first time the summer of 1984. She lived in a studio apartment just four miles from the Olympic stadium where Carl Lewis was dominating men&#x2019;s track and field. His power seemed to inhabit the city: It was in the way the announcers talked about him, the way the cameras followed his every move, as if his most mundane gestures held the secret to otherworldly strength. It was in the prideful way my mother said his name, smiling and laughing, clapping her hands as though &#x201C;Carl Lewis&#x201D; were the most important words in a favorite hymn. That summer was the golden one, with my mother by my side and Carl Lewis forever on the victory podium.</p>
              
              
  					  
            
              <p class="paragraph">But by 1988, that was already a long time ago, a thin and indiscernible vapor of reverie. Growing up is a series of dreams evaporating; the reality is always more wearisome and less dignified than you had hoped. Carl Lewis lost in 1988. He went on to lose in other ways too: a bungled run for office, a notoriously botched attempt at the national anthem at a 1993 N.B.A. game. Each defeat felt personal. I wanted Lewis to be as great forever as he was in the summer of &#x2019;84. I wanted whatever hope I had &#x2014; for him, for my mother, for myself &#x2014; to continue in a straight line until the end of time. But after he lost, nothing was the same. Nothing ever is.</p>

              <p class="paragraph">By Taffy Brodesser-Akner</p>
              
              
  					  
            
              <p class="paragraph"><strong>I want to</strong> take a moment to say that what happened to Nancy Kerrigan was awful, and I in no way endorse it. I want to forestall your letter informing me that I&#x2019;m a monster by saying in advance that yes, I do at times wonder if I have fully developed empathy. But I also want to say that for those of us who occasionally feel excluded by the general wholesomeness and uncorrupted patriotism of the Olympics, the Tonya Harding/Nancy Kerrigan scandal offered a brief glimpse of understanding into what regular people, what <em>most</em> people, like about them.</p>
              
              
  					  
            
              <p class="paragraph">The story most of us know is that in 1994, Kerrigan, an Olympic favorite for figure-skating gold, was kneecapped after a practice by a man she didn&#x2019;t recognize. A thing people often don&#x2019;t know is that it was never quite proved that Harding was responsible. It was her ex-husband and bodyguard who hatched the plot. Harding herself claims that she didn&#x2019;t know about it until after the attack, and she was never convicted of anything other than conspiracy to hinder prosecution, for not immediately telling authorities what she knew.</p>
              
              
  					  
            
              <p class="paragraph">But it was a while before we learned all that. In the interim, we had a real American scandal on our hands, and I could finally understand how the Olympics might be appealing. Before that, I mostly avoided them. I&#x2019;m usually unable to watch people achieve dreams without overidentifying with them &#x2014; breaking out in full-body chills and tiny jabs of tear-duct activation over their yearslong journeys, only to find myself still with a too-high body mass index and legs of slightly different lengths, the two major factors that I believe halted my own athletic career. (The minor factor is that I don&#x2019;t enjoy physical exertion.) More important, the Olympics run counter to my bloody, red-meat tastes. They are too virtuous and too filled with smiling achievement; they are too fair. They regulate everything so severely &#x2014; uniforms, hairstyles &#x2014; that everything is distilled to a matter of mere <em>ability</em>. I require more, I don&#x2019;t know, character development.</p>
              
              
  					  
            
              <p class="paragraph">At first, Harding represented all that I disliked about the Olympics. In 1991, when she became the first American to complete a triple axel in competition, she couldn&#x2019;t hold in her joy: She made a whooping face and tightened her fists into little balls of achievement right there on the ice, and I teared up even though I didn&#x2019;t want to. Thankfully, she also contained the essential ingredients for &#x2019;90s-era tabloid scandal. She looked mean, with her narrow eyes and turned-up nose (a literal one, not a metaphorical one) and, despite being from Oregon, her fluffy Long Island bangs.</p>
              
              
  					  
            
              <p class="paragraph">And in her supposed greed and malevolence, she manifested the evil that lurks in the hearts of every second-placer, every understudy &#x2014; an evil that the perpetual first-placers don&#x2019;t even realize they share (but do, or will the moment their luck turns). More than anything, she wanted to win. I have long been drawn to extreme cases of American exceptionalism, which, by my definition, involves people being willing to carry out actual crimes to achieve their American happiness, like a good job or a house in the suburbs or a gold medal at the Olympics.</p>
              
              
  					  
            
              <p class="paragraph">It got even better: Kerrigan still competed, but achieved silver to Oksana Baiul&#x2019;s gold. Harding had a shoelace malfunction and came in eighth. Kerrigan could be heard on a live microphone being unkind about Baiul&#x2019;s victorious weeping. Later, she claimed death threats prevented her from attending the closing ceremony, though some speculated that she left early to appear at a parade at Disney World, because Disney was one of her sponsors. The humanity! This I could watch.</p>
              
              
  					  
            
              <p class="paragraph">Having a scandal this tawdry brought a democracy to the Olympics that hadn&#x2019;t previously been there. America is made up of all kinds; the Olympics, less so. And if you are someone with a taste for the ugly or a taste for scandal, the Olympics so often leave you with something akin to self-loathing. That year, people like me, with dark hearts and what my mother calls &#x201C;low taste&#x201D; &#x2014; we exist in droves, I&#x2019;m afraid &#x2014; briefly understood why the rest of you enjoy this so very much.</p>

              <p class="paragraph">JOHN CARLOS AND TOMMIE SMITH RAISE THEIR FISTS</p>
              
              
  					  
            
              <p class="paragraph">By Jacqueline Woodson</p>
              
              
  					  
            
              <p class="paragraph"><strong>My earliest memory</strong> of a thing called the Olympics comes from 1968, when I was 5 and just at the earliest edge of understanding a great many things. I knew, for instance, that there was a deep sadness surrounding the adults at our kitchen table, and that it had something to do with the assassinations of Martin Luther King Jr. and Robert Kennedy. I knew that the Black Power movement was a new anchor in our community, or at least that James Brown&#x2019;s &#x201C;Say It Loud &#x2014; I&#x2019;m Black and I&#x2019;m Proud&#x201D; seemed to play on repeat in our Brooklyn neighborhood. Teenage boys strutted by, their Afros like crowns with red, black and green hair picks protruding; aunts and uncles donned dashikis and quoted people I would later come to know as Huey Newton, Angela Davis and Bobby Seale.</p>
              
              
  					  
            
              <p class="paragraph">I knew that all these people &#x2014; and a man named Malcolm X and a woman named Shirley Chisholm &#x2014; had some connection to what I was beginning to understand as &#x201C;our people&#x201D; and &#x201C;our power.&#x201D; I knew that I was supposed to be proud to be black and that this pride was supposed to be a part of something larger and greater. I knew that my cornrows, as painful as they&#x2019;d been to style, were as much a part of that pride as the dashikis and Afros.</p>
              
              
  					  
            
              <p class="paragraph">Even as I took all of this in, the furry haze of being 5 kept me from making sense of it. And in the midst of this haze, two African-American men, Tommie Smith and John Carlos, having just won the gold and bronze medals in the men&#x2019;s 200-meter dash at the 1968 Olympics, climbed onto the medaling stands in Mexico City, lowered their heads and raised their black-gloved fists &#x2014; to which the world just about lost its mind.</p>
              
              
  					  
            
              <p class="paragraph">Those fists traveled from Mexico City to the corners of every black home in America. So much of the world seemed angry at the audacity of our two new heroes, but the people I loved cheered, slapped each other five, cut articles from the newspaper, crowded around black-and-white screens to watch the moment televised and retelevised. A word I did not know yet &#x2014; &#x201C;solidarity&#x201D; &#x2014; flowed through their conversations.</p>
              
              
  					  
            
              <p class="paragraph">Years later, I would join the Flashettes, a girls&#x2019; track team. We would compete against the Atoms; both teams sent Brooklyn girls to the Olympic trials and a few to the Games themselves. I would understand what it meant to &#x201C;trial&#x201D; and to &#x201C;medal.&#x201D; I would run the 200-meter dash in college. I would come to understand that the gesture Smith and Carlos made meant &#x201C;Black Power,&#x201D; yes, but also something greater. It was a homage to the rights of all human beings, paid through the eyes and fists of two African-American champions. But at 5 years old, what I knew was that two of the fastest men in the world had stood and spoken to the people I loved, the boys with their Afro picks, the relatives in dashikis, the grown-ups beaming in the blue light of black-and-white television. And they spoke to me, a child who would one day be the fastest girl on the block but for that moment had simply this: a hand I could curl into a fist and lift high in the air.</p>

              <p class="paragraph"><strong>There&#x2019;s this blurry,</strong> badly lit picture that my mom snapped in the nosebleed section of the Georgia Dome in the summer of 1996. It shows me, 15 years old and all limbs, twisted around in my seat, looking back at the camera. Behind me, an overexposed basketball court forms a blinding white background. I am beaming, a smile stretching from one round cheek to the other.</p>
              
              
  					  
            
              <p class="paragraph">We were there to watch the U.S. women&#x2019;s team in Olympic competition. This was an epochal moment for women&#x2019;s basketball: For the first time, the Olympic team was composed of the best postcollegiate basketball players, selected more than a year before the Games. The roster was stacked with players now considered legends: Sheryl Swoopes, Dawn Staley, Rebecca Lobo, Lisa Leslie, Jennifer Azzi. They played 52 games, around the world, in preparation for the Atlanta Olympics, and won all 52 of them. This was the team whose popularity helped lead to the American Basketball League and the W.N.B.A. &#x2014; which is celebrating its 20th anniversary this year.</p>
              
              
  					  
            
              <p class="paragraph">The day we attended, Team U.S.A. was still in the early rounds, so we saw them play Zaire, Australia or South Korea; I can&#x2019;t remember which, but it hardly matters. In the summer of 1996 I was tall, big-bodied, still trying to figure out how to move through a world that didn&#x2019;t accommodate six-foot-tall teenage girls very well. I had found just one place that did: a basketball court. I played center and forward on my eighth- and ninth-grade teams. I could block and rebound, sometimes without my feet leaving the floor. If I was on the post, I could use my size to make space and get the ball in the hoop. My body, finally, was made for something. People cheered me for it.</p>
              
              
  					  
            
              <p class="paragraph">And in that awkward body that I didn&#x2019;t yet know how to wear, I watched some of the best female athletes &#x2014; women whose bodies looked like mine &#x2014; play ball on the Olympic stage. I wasn&#x2019;t ever good enough to play basketball for much more than fun. But when I look at that photo, I remember how I imagined that the people around me in that stadium, watching those women play, might look over at me and think, &#x201C;She&#x2019;s probably a basketball player too.&#x201D;</p>

              <p class="paragraph">ELIZABETH MANLEY SKATES FOR SILVER</p>
              
              
  					  
            
              <p class="paragraph">By Michelle Dean</p>
              
              
  					  
            
              <p class="paragraph"><strong>On the wall</strong> of the rec-center skating rink where I spent a lot of time in my quiet Canadian childhood, there was a painting of Elizabeth Manley, who had trained there at some point. It was not a good painting; it doubled the snub of Manley&#x2019;s small nose. That didn&#x2019;t matter. This was not a work of art but a work of Canadian pride.</p>
              
              
  					  
            
              <p class="paragraph">If you remember the figure-skating competition at the 1988 Olympics in Calgary and you are not Canadian, it is undoubtedly because of Katarina Witt, the East German powerhouse who won gold. Witt had a knack for dramatic footwork and serious height on her jumps. She wore puffed sleeves and dark lipstick and thick eyeliner. &#x201C;She certainly is a beautiful, beautiful lady&#x201D; &#x2014; this was the sort of thing American sportscasters couldn&#x2019;t resist saying. Liz Manley, meanwhile, had strawberry-blonde hair that she stubbornly styled in a short mom cut; she tended to wear baby blue and hot pink. The American sportscasters&#x2019; notes on her were sure to mention that she once had a nervous breakdown and &#x201C;put on a tremendous amount of weight.&#x201D; This meant that she tipped the scales at more than 120 pounds when, as a teenager, she was sent off to Lake Placid by herself to train.</p>
              
              
  					  
            
              <p class="paragraph">Canadians muttered to one another about this. Complaining about the anti-Canadian bias in American coverage is an Olympic tradition for us. In the end, though, Manley defied the sportscasters. In the long program, aided by a middling Witt performance and a disastrous one from poor Debi Thomas of the American team, Manley gave the performance of her life. Her jumps took her higher than she&#x2019;d been accustomed to; every landing was precise, flawless. She won the silver medal and nearly knocked Witt out of the gold. It was a true upset &#x2014; a huge triumph for a person who hadn&#x2019;t been expected to win a thing. Canadians celebrated as though she topped the podium.</p>
              
              
  					  
            
              <p class="paragraph">Americans think this sort of thing is adorable. &#x201C;Silver &#x2014; a.k.a. &#x2018;Canadian gold,&#x2019;&#x2009;&#x201D; texted one American acquaintance when I tried to explain this to him. This is the joke about us that Americans alone seem to be amused by: that we are, in some essential way, a bit bovine &#x2014; soft-eyed and complacent, even in defeat.</p>
              
              
  					  
            
              <p class="paragraph">It seems impossible to explain this to Americans, but not really being expected to win is, typically, the Canadian national position. We are O.K. with this. The jury is still out on whether Justin Trudeau will do anything to alter this situation, though I personally doubt it. The soul of our country prizes solid competence, which is what makes Canada a very nice place to live much of the time. Excellence is an afterthought, a lovely dividend that is not entirely expected. This may mean that we get very few gold medals, but we will always have the particular sort of pride that comes with saying we did our best, nobody lost their head and everything was accomplished with a minimum of self-aggrandizement, megalomania or unrealistic expectations. This is a deeply underrated variety of satisfaction. More countries should try it.</p>

              <p class="paragraph">LOLO JONES MEETS THE NINTH HURDLE</p>
              
              
  					  
            
              <p class="paragraph">By Greg Howard</p>
              
              
  					  
            
              <p class="paragraph"><strong>On Aug. 19,</strong> 2008, in the 100-meter-hurdles final of the Beijing Olympics, Lolo Jones broke free for the last time. After a slow burst out of the blocks, she clawed her way back into the race. She looked perfect navigating the obstacle course, not jumping the hurdles so much as striding over them, her front heel barely clearing each bar as she skimmed across the track. By the sixth hurdle, she had the lead. By the eighth, she was all alone, free of the whole cacophony of pistoning bodies.</p>
              
              
  					  
            
              <p class="paragraph">But on the ninth, her front heel caught the hurdle. She stumbled through it, but the lost momentum left her flailing while the women around her sailed smoothly past. Jones crossed the finish line seventh and then collapsed, her legs buckling beneath the heartbreak.</p>
              
              
  					  
            
              <p class="paragraph">I watched Jones from my dorm room, where I was preparing for my final season as a collegiate soccer player. The game was, for me, a language all its own &#x2014; a system of manipulations of the ball with my feet, thighs, chest and head; a way of moving in tandem with 10 other men, navigating through opposing defenses with a glossary of loud whoops, barks and terse shouts. For as long as I could remember, I had expressed myself through soccer, and at 20, I had no sense of self without it.</p>
              
              
  					  
            
              <p class="paragraph">I knew that eighth-hurdle feeling, too, of breaking free. Thirty-four months before watching Jones, during my final high-school soccer game, I outpaced the other team&#x2019;s defense and surged toward the goal, and for a brief few seconds, everything around me was still, silent. Then the goalkeeper dove for the ball and missed, but took my left knee with him. I didn&#x2019;t run again for six months.</p>
              
              
  					  
            
              <p class="paragraph">I still harbored what felt to me like modest aspirations: to play professionally, somewhere. So I limped my way onto a college team and busied myself with constructing a redemption story. I fought forward until, eventually, I started negotiating down: If I couldn&#x2019;t go pro, I would be a college-team starter; if I couldn&#x2019;t start, I would score; if I couldn&#x2019;t score, I would at least play. By the end, I bargained down until all I wanted was to return, for one last moment, to that eerie calm, the feeling of striding clear of the surrounding chaos. But I never broke free again, either.</p>
              
              
  					  
            
              <p class="paragraph">I was lucky. I was never close enough to victory to reckon with whether I was actually good enough, and I had an excuse: Whenever someone asked about soccer, I could just point to the scars running along my knee and shrug. But for a brief moment in 2008, yards away from Olympic gold, Lolo Jones was close enough to reckon with the questions that haunt every athlete. Was she good enough? Did she trip, or did she choke?</p>
              
              
  					  
            
              <p class="paragraph">In 2012, she finished fourth in the 100-meter hurdles. Two years after that, she competed in the Sochi Winter Olympics, this time as a bobsledder. Her team finished 11th. It wasn&#x2019;t until Sochi that I realized Jones had been negotiating down, too: If she couldn&#x2019;t win an Olympic gold in hurdles, she would win an Olympic medal, period. This year, she tried to prepare for another shot at the hurdles but had to pull out of the Olympic trials in June with a hip injury. Jones says she&#x2019;ll be back in 2020. She&#x2019;s bargaining now, as I was. But her moment is past, and I doubt she&#x2019;ll ever break free again.</p>

              <p class="paragraph">By Daniel Duane</p>
              
              
  					  
            
              <p class="paragraph"><strong>For nearly 60</strong> years, my father told a story about the most famous water-polo game ever played: the U.S.S.R.-versus-Hungary semifinal at the 1956 Melbourne Olympics. One month before the game, the Soviet Union crushed the Hungarian Revolution. The Hungarian water-polo team salvaged some national pride by demolishing the Soviets, 4-0, and goading them into such a blind rage that a frustrated Russian sucker-punched Hungary&#x2019;s Ervin Zador. A news photograph of the bloodied Zador made international front pages, adding a moral victory to the athletic one. After the Games, Zador &#x2014; along with about half of the Hungarian team &#x2014; defected to the United States.</p>
              
              
  					  
            
              <p class="paragraph">&#x201C;You know, I played against Zador when I was at Cal,&#x201D; my father liked to say, thinking back to his time at U.C. Berkeley. &#x201C;He was an unbelievably dirty player. I always wanted to thank the Russian who punched that bastard.&#x201D;</p>
              
              
  					  
            
              <p class="paragraph">I first heard the story in 1984, when I was a skinny kid trying to join the popular crowd at Berkeley High School. That crowd revolved around water polo, the most magnificent game that almost nobody cares about. (It rivals football for extreme conditioning, sanctioned violence and technical beauty, but it makes a lousy spectator sport; too much happens underwater.) The team needed a new goalie, and I had long arms, so the popular boys conscripted me. I spent the summer treading water with folding chairs on my head and learning that the phrase &#x201C;my father played water polo at Cal&#x201D; carried a weight in California aquatics culture not unlike the one &#x201C;my father played quarterback at Clemson&#x201D; would carry in the South. My father&#x2019;s Zador story worked like an anecdote about a collegiate encounter with Peyton Manning.</p>
              
              
  					  
            
              <p class="paragraph">Recently, however, my father decided I should know more. &#x201C;I&#x2019;ve been thinking about that Zador business,&#x201D; he said. &#x201C;I never actually made varsity, so that must have been a J.V. match. And I remember I had a date that night with a beautiful synchronized swimmer who came to the game, and I was swimming the ball down pool when Zador started pressuring me. I tried to pass the ball to my goalie, but my goalie wasn&#x2019;t looking, so the ball went into the net.&#x201D;</p>
              
              
  					  
            
              <p class="paragraph">&#x201C;Wait,&#x201D; I said, &#x201C;you never made varsity?&#x201D;</p>
              
              
  					  
            
              <p class="paragraph">He laughed and blushed. &#x201C;I think the coach told me at the end of junior year that I was on varsity for the fall,&#x201D; he said. &#x201C;But I felt done, so I quit and kind of let myself think that, you know, in some technical sense, I <em>made varsity</em>.&#x201D;</p>
              
              
  					  
            
              <p class="paragraph">&#x201C;Oh, Pop.&#x201D; I shook my head. &#x201C;And you&#x2019;re telling me Zador ruffled your feathers so bad you scored an own goal in front of your swimmer girl? That&#x2019;s why you&#x2019;ve been badmouthing him all these years?&#x201D;</p>
              
              
  					  
            
              <p class="paragraph">My father chuckled with embarrassment. &#x201C;Exactly,&#x201D; he said. &#x201C;And I was so humiliated that I got completely drunk and, well, there was no second date with that synchronized swimmer.&#x201D;</p>
              
              
  					  
            
              <p class="paragraph">My brother-in-law, Mario, offered me a silver lining: &#x201C;Sounds like you ought to thank Zador for your existence.&#x201D;</p>
              
              
  					  
            
              <p class="paragraph">But a 2006 documentary called &#x201C;Freedom&#x2019;s Fury,&#x201D; about that famous game, nudged me toward a different interpretation. Zador was Hungary&#x2019;s enforcer and top-scoring player, arguably the most skilled and physically intimidating player of the era. My father&#x2019;s encounter with him is best understood by picturing an American J.V. soccer player trying to dribble past Argentina&#x2019;s Lionel Messi and finding himself kicked in the groin, dropped face-first in the mud and somehow guilty of a personal foul that gives Messi a penalty kick to win the game &#x2014; a humiliating taste of world-class play and a precious memory nonetheless.</p>

              <p class="paragraph">By Nitsuh Abebe</p>
              
              
  					  
            
              <p class="paragraph"><strong>One fun thing</strong> about being an Ethiopian-American named Abebe is that a lot of old strangers want to talk to you about Abebe Bikila. In 1960, Bikila competed in the Olympic Games in Rome &#x2014; the capital of the nation that had, during Bikila&#x2019;s own boyhood, invaded and occupied Ethiopia for half a decade, ultimately taking with it a great deal of antiquities and leaving behind mostly death and infrastructure and gelato. Bikila ran the marathon, over the streets of Rome, barefoot. (The shoes Adidas provided him didn&#x2019;t fit comfortably; besides, he had trained barefoot.) He won, setting a marathon world record and becoming the first black African to win a gold medal. I can remember my father acting out the tableau from his own boyhood: Abebe Bikila crossing the finish line.</p>
              
              
  					  
            
              <p class="paragraph">It was a classic Olympic moment: the unknown man from one of Africa&#x2019;s independent nations entering the grand old city of the occupier, determined and shoeless, striding into history. (Retellings always emphasize the bare feet, to the point of pretending that perhaps the entire nation of Ethiopia could somehow not <em>afford</em> a pair of shoes.) This is the sort of thing the Olympics&#x2019; world-stage myth is built on: the notion that on some arid stretch of some unassuming nation sweats a person with some gift of human potential that can, in this one setting, brush aside whatever larger inequalities &#x2014; military force, cultural hegemony, money &#x2014; would otherwise stand in the way of victory.</p>
              
              
  					  
            
              <p class="paragraph">Here is the thing, though: Does this really <em>happen</em> at the Olympics? Often? And when it does, what are the odds that you would ever witness it as part of American Olympics coverage, which generally just tracks our athletes through the many, many, dead-boring events in which they will almost certainly win medals? Is it too obvious to say that if the Olympics were really about individual human potential, you might expect to see more interesting medalists from, I don&#x2019;t know, Pakistan or Indonesia?</p>
              
              
  					  
            
              <p class="paragraph">It&#x2019;s hard, these days, for me to picture the Olympics as anything other than a massive and very expensive science experiment, in which a handful of overcompetitive first-world states with spare resources to invest in medal production filter their talented young athletes into research-driven training programs and qualifying competitions, optimizing as many facets as possible of their training, diet, gear, psychology, supplements and elaborate methods of cheating. This isn&#x2019;t a test of human potential or athletic drive; it&#x2019;s a test of corporate-organizational prowess, a way for entire nations to play with their citizenry the way kids play with favorite action figures. And this is before we reach the Winter Olympics, where even that challenge falls away and all that&#x2019;s left is a handful of nations awarding themselves medals for being good at bizarrely specialized feats that most humans on the planet wouldn&#x2019;t ever have reason to even contemplate trying, let alone building the elaborate tools and tracks and apparatuses involved.</p>
              
              
  					  
            
              <p class="paragraph">Once these uncharitable killjoy thoughts have entered your mind, there are moments when the individual stories of pluck and devotion and odds-overcoming that go into athletes&#x2019; Olympic biographies begin to seem almost sad, like imagining one gear in a cuckoo clock having dramatic emotions about its struggle to turn the next one. You start to wonder: Why leave anything to chance? Why not get it over with and choreograph the whole thing as art? Bring on the screenwriters; let them give us an Abebe Bikila for every week of coverage.</p>

              <p class="paragraph">LIONEL RICHIE OVERSEES the CLOSING CEREMONy</p>
              
              
  					  
            
              <p class="paragraph">By Wesley Morris</p>
              
              
  					  
            
              <p class="paragraph"><strong>The 1984 Olympics</strong> were the ones that much of the Eastern Bloc boycotted &#x2014; the Olympics with the asterisk. I was 8 and hadn&#x2019;t yet discovered what &#x201C;American&#x201D; meant, but these were also the Olympics that introduced me to a sense of nationality. Mean old Zola Budd, for instance, who might have tripped poor Mary Decker Slaney, came to epitomize the ruthless evil of apartheid-era South Africa. Even the host city, Los Angeles, represented for itself: The people responsible for its pageantry got with the program and put on a show. And with all due respect to the opening-ceremony dude who took off in a jet pack, and to Mary Lou Retton, whose perfect vault launched a zillion Wheaties boxes, nobody&#x2019;s show that year was better than Lionel Richie&#x2019;s.</p>
              
              
  					  
            
              <p class="paragraph">In 1984, Lionel Richie was a big deal: If you couldn&#x2019;t get Michael Jackson to pull the curtain down on your closing ceremony, Richie would more than do. His album &#x201C;Can&#x2019;t Slow Down&#x201D; was on its way to selling more than 20 million copies and snatching the Album of the Year Grammy. And so Richie helped conclude the 1984 Games with &#x201C;All Night Long,&#x201D; a hit full of pseudo-African mumbo jumbo and a demand to &#x201C;let the music play on, play on, play on.&#x201D; He sang live, eventually surrounded by dozens of breakdancers. I watched from my dad&#x2019;s house in New Jersey, on a little television that Richie made seem very big. Not even when he was a <em>thing</em> was Richie ever cool: That mustache and Jheri curl? What a dad!</p>
              
              
  					  
            
              <p class="paragraph">What a live entertainer too. There&#x2019;s nothing pyrotechnic about Richie&#x2019;s voice, but he was a star in an era when a singer was expected to be able to sing. So it was like a dream watching him belt while strutting around the floor of a darkened L.A. Coliseum, seemingly lit by only his immaculate white pants and the sparkle of sequins on his amazingly tailored jacket. The production got busier as the dancers pooled around him. Soon Richie was just a snarling voice in wide shots of pageantry.</p>
              
              
  					  
            
              <p class="paragraph">It was the first time I saw anybody take that kind of dancing seriously. Here was this city presenting a version of its streets to the world, saying, &#x201C;This is who we think we could be.&#x201D; Any kid who has ever fought with an adult about what good culture is seeks this kind of vindication. Breakdancing isn&#x2019;t dancing? Well, here, Mr. Adult, is your friend, the former Commodore, Lionel Richie, begging to differ. The production crew could barely keep up with the guys doing head spins and windmills, the ladies doing two-steps. And through it all, Richie looked and sounded time-of-his-life happy to have whipped up this kind of new American chaos. It was a fantasy of a Los Angeles whose multiculti exuberance he made you believe really would play on, play on, play on.</p>

              <p class="paragraph"><strong>There is something</strong> about the Olympics and time. It&#x2019;s not just that we obsessively measure, right down to the microsecond, the times of every athlete in every race. It&#x2019;s not just that the Olympic Games are a powerful public clock that marks off four-year intervals &#x2014; roughly 5 percent of an American life expectancy &#x2014; in all our lives. It&#x2019;s not even that the tournament connects us, ritually, to deep time: the ancient Greeks, archaic naked oil-wrestling, the birth of Western Civilization.</p>
              
              
  					  
            
              <p class="paragraph">What gives the Olympics its special, precise energy is the tension among all of these orders of time: Everything hinges on a crucial millisecond during the two weeks that we waited for four years (and several millenniums) to see. The Olympics are a global pageant of time swirls, a tiny window that opens, at regular intervals, onto eternity.</p>
              
              
  					  
            
              <p class="paragraph">The face staring out of that window is always the same: Bob Costas. He has presided over the Olympics for so long, nearly 30 years, that he may as well have broadcast the first ceremony from ancient Greece. Although Costas is not particularly athletic-seeming, he has outlasted all the athletes. In his mid-60s, he remains the same boyish, affable elf that he was in the beginning. He is blessed with the American ability to seem perpetually fresh out of the box.</p>
              
              
  					  
            
              <p class="paragraph">Costas is a master of all the classic broadcast-network moves. He can read schmaltzy clich&#xE9;s over soaring trumpets (&#x201C;they look to reach ... <em>new</em> heights&#x201D;) as if he actually believes them. He is so smooth and faultless that he sometimes seems like a sentient teleprompter.</p>
              
              
  					  
            
              <p class="paragraph">In 2014, when a wretched eye infection temporarily knocked Costas out of hosting the Winter Olympics, it felt like seeing George Washington catch a cold and start sneezing on Mount Rushmore. We didn&#x2019;t know he could do that, didn&#x2019;t know he had the flesh and glands and fluids. His replacements &#x2014; Matt Lauer, Meredith Vieira &#x2014; did fine; they are pros. But they didn&#x2019;t carry the same existential gravitas, the sense of having been flung out of the Big Bang and directly into the host&#x2019;s chair.</p>
              
              
  					  
            
              <p class="paragraph">In recent months, Costas has spoken of his eventual retirement, of NBC&#x2019;s succession plan, but it all seems entirely hypothetical, like when astrophysicists talk about the inevitable implosion of the sun: It will happen in a time beyond time, past the reach of mere eons and weeks and milliseconds and years.</p>
