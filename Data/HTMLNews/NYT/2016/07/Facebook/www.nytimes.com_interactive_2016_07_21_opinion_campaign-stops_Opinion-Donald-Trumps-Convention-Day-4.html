Trump With Less Trumpeting
</div>
<div class='listy_subhead'>
By Frank Bruni
</div>
<div class='listy_body'>
<p><span class="anchor" id="trump-with-less-trumpeting"></span> </p> <p>CLEVELAND — Donald Trump has said and done many offensive things during his presidential campaign, but the greatest insult was his overarching motive. With every boast about his poll numbers, every celebration of his victory margins and every sorting of the world into winners like him and losers like just about everybody else, he seemed to be on something other than a political quest or civic mission. </p> <p>It was pure ego trip. </p> <p>I suspect it still is. But what was most striking about his remarks on the final night of the Republican National Convention was the way in which they sought to refute that very notion. </p> <p>They were much, much, much too long, as if he were trying to prove his worthiness for the presidency with sheer oratorical stamina. They rambled. </p> <p>But they recognized that perhaps the tallest obstacle between him and the White House isn’t his lack of experience or even his recklessness but his epic and all-too-obvious narcissism. When Americans go to the polls, it’s not the final episode of the kind of reality show that he once starred in, nor is it the final minutes of the kind of beauty pageant that he once owned. They’re not bestowing a crown. They’re electing a leader, someone who can ideally soothe their anxieties and improve their lives. </p> <p>Is Trump finally and fully getting that? His speech suggested so. It wasn’t an adolescent frenzy of self-congratulation like last Saturday’s unhinged introduction of Mike Pence as his running mate. In its straightforward, unadorned sentences, “I” ceded plenty of space to “you” and “we.” </p> <p>It even went so far as to turn the tables, casting Hillary Clinton as the candidate on a gilded path of self-aggrandizement. </p> <p>“My opponent asks her supporters to recite a three-word loyalty pledge,” Trump said. “It reads: ‘I’m With Her.’ I choose to recite a different pledge. My pledge reads: ‘I’m with you, the American people.’ I am your voice.” </p> <p>“I am with you,” he repeated. “I will fight for you. And I will win for you.” Winning was still his obsession, but it was framed as an act of altruism. Thus the inveterate braggart became the humble servant, or at least tried to restyle himself that way. </p> <p>It’ll be fascinating to see if the makeover takes and a man who lost control of Cleveland can gain control of himself. </p> <p>Coming into <span class="aBn"><span class="aQJ">Thursday</span></span> night, the convention here had been an undisciplined disaster, its rhythm nonsensical, its lineup of speakers unimpressive and their praise for Trump as lean as their denunciations of Clinton were bloated. </p> <p>The fiercest blast of energy came from Ted Cruz’s flamboyant snub of Trump. And the second biggest story was the plagiarism in Melania Trump’s tribute to her husband. Day after day, disruptions and distractions eclipsed whatever the message was supposed to be. </p> <p>But the message <span class="aBn"><span class="aQJ">on Thursday</span></span> night was clear, and it was that Trump isn’t a preening playboy on his most extravagant lark. He’s the blue-collar billionaire — a phrase that his supporters and surrogates are using more and more frequently — who speaks a common man’s language and looks out for the little guy. </p> <p>“The people’s champion,” said his daughter Ivanka Trump, who introduced him — and who assured Americans that they don’t really understand him. She vouched for him as “colorblind and gender-neutral” and said that what he taught her and her siblings was that they “each had a responsibility to work not just for ourselves but for the betterment of the world.” </p> <p>Much of Trump’s speech was familiar and expected, underscoring a Nixonian strategy to win the White House by stoking Americans’ fears. He painted an almost unbearably dark portrait of a country reeling from lawlessness — he emphasized illegal immigration in particular — and a world stalked by terrorists. He placed some of the blame for that jihadist terror at his Democratic opponent’s feet. </p> <p>“This is the legacy of Hillary Clinton: death, destruction, terrorism and weakness,” he said. “But Hillary Clinton’s legacy does not have to be America’s legacy.” </p> <p>He invoked her emails and excoriated her ethics. </p> <p>But in other ways, his speech was a departure, for the convention as well as for him. Although prior nights focused on reassuring staunch conservatives that they could trust Trump, he in a few passages sought to reassure other Americans that he stood for them as well. </p> <p>He remembered the “49 wonderful Americans” who were shot dead in a gay nightclub in Orlando and pledged to protect the “L.G.B.T.Q. community,” laboring over the politically correct cluster of consonants. </p> <p>When the delegates in the convention hall applauded that, he digressed from his prepared remarks to acknowledge it. “I have to say, as a Republican, it is so nice to hear you cheering for what I just said,” Trump told them. </p> <p>This was less a general-election pivot than a general-election lunge. </p> <p>But his most remarkable course correction was away from a perverse fixation on the glory of Donald Trump. At the beginning of the speech, when he did indulge one of his customary brags about his vote count in the Republican primaries, he shared the credit, referring to what “we” accomplished, meaning him and his supporters, and putting asterisks around that pronoun. </p> <p>“I say ‘we’ because we are a team,” he said, later adding: “Every day I wake up determined to deliver a better life for the people all across this nation that have been ignored, neglected and abandoned.” </p> <p>“These are people who work hard but no longer have a voice,” he said. “I am your voice.” </p> <p><em>Your </em>voice. I’m with <em>you.</em> </p> <p>Trump may be a master salesman, but can he really sell that? Trump, whose buildings are billboards on which he can write his name in big, gold letters? Trump, whose entrepreneurial energy has gone into luxe resorts with luxe golf courses? Trump, who has profited from so many ventures that left others diminished? </p> <p>I’m doubtful. But I’m impressed that someone who used a debate to assure us of his prodigious manhood kept his vanity so zipped. </p> <p><em>Frank Bruni is an Op-Ed columnist for The Times.</em> </p>

Ivanka the Fabulous Fabulist
</div>
<div class='listy_subhead'>
By Maureen Dowd
</div>
<div class='listy_body'>
<span class="anchor" id="ivanka-the-fabulous-fabulist"></span> <p>Ivanka Trump glided onstage to the Beatles’ “Here Comes the Sun.” </p> <p>It was apt. </p> <p>She was sun-kissed, her blond hair perfectly sleek, blowing photogenically, no doubt from a fan in the podium. The fashion entrepreneur’s blush-pink sheath and stilettos looked Fifth Avenue chic. </p> <p>The 34-year-old ornament to the Trump brand was like a beautiful sunny morning in the midst of a dark, lashing hailstorm. </p> <p>She was glossy, both in how she looked and how she spoke. </p> <p>She glossed over all of her father’s ugly rhetoric and incitements, his erratic behavior and lack of any policy depth or even any policy, and offered a gauzy, idealized vision of a Bobby Kennedy-style figure as her father channeled Richard Nixon in ’68. </p> <p>She hailed her dad as a fighter against injustice, a boss who is “colorblind and gender neutral,” who hires people of all ethnicities and backgrounds. </p> <p>She glossed over the entire ideology of the G.O.P. and the regressive party platform for women and presented her father as a feminist who fights for women in the Trump organization and who would fight as president for child care, “affordable and accessible for all,” and for women’s rights, equal pay and maternity leave. </p> <p>“I will fight for this, too, right alongside him,” she said, serving, once more, as the classy conjurer of the Moderate, Sane Donald in place of the Dark, Ugly Donald. </p> <p>One impediment to joy, as Ivanka tried to channel Hillary: The Boston Globe’s Matt Viser reported last month that men in the Trump campaign earn about 35 percent more than the women in his campaign. </p> <p>Trump would never make the eat-your-peas pivot to professionalism, comity and civility, so Ivanka did it for him. </p> <p>She called her father “the people’s champion” and “the people’s nominee,” making him sound like Princess Diana, the people’s princess. </p> <p>She offered sweet anecdotes to personalize her father, but she was so sunny that her portrait of him was almost unrecognizable. More like a jolly Santa than a short-fingered vulgarian. </p> <p>She said she remembered him, when she was a child playing with Legos in the corner of his skyscraper office, tearing stories out of the newspaper about someone facing some injustice or hardship and writing a note in his black felt-tip pen to find the person and have them brought to Trump Tower, where he could get in their corner when they were down and give them a job or a break until they could feel that life is great again. </p> <p>She said her father had “empathy and generosity,” and threw in “kindness and compassion” for good measure. </p> <p>Hopes are often reposed in family members. Everyone hoped that Barbara Bush was secretly working to make H.W. Bush more liberal on choice issues. Everyone hoped that Laura Bush was secretly working on W. to get Donald Rumsfeld fired. </p> <p>But Ivanka Trump has a stupefyingly harder task. Everyone is hoping that with her calm and gracious air, she is secretly working to turn Donald Trump into a completely different being, to make him stop acting self-destructive and crazy and nasty. </p> <p>She offers herself as that bright promise. But, as much as she might try to steer her willful father, we know that it is not really possible to curb his impulsiveness and narcissism or to moderate and modernize his positions. He is too in thrall to the roar of the crowd, too old to develop impulse control. </p> <p>So it just turns her into a fabulous fabulist. </p> <p>She said her father advised her when she was growing up: “Ivanka, if you’re going to be thinking anyway, you might as well think big.” And what can be bigger thinking than making the most divisive, disliked candidate in modern history seem like noble Atticus Finch — though it would be hard to imagine Atticus saying, as Donald Trump once did of his own daughter, that he would like to date a full-grown Scout if she weren’t, in fact, his daughter. </p> <p>She said he taught his kids to have a moral compass – with a straight face. </p> <p>Ivanka has, at times, played the charming sidekick to Trump in his more unsavory business dealings. In 2006, she helped sell spots in a future Baja California condo complex that bore the Trump name. While the Trump organization earned $500,000 for their branding and sales efforts, all the people convinced by her and her father’s promises lost their money when the outside developer failed to build anything. She denied any fault, telling CBS News that her family had “lived up to our obligation under a license agreement.” </p> <p>In the absence of all the normal political allies a typical candidate has, Trump’s family takes on paramount importance as character witnesses. Melania tried to be one for her husband <span class="aBn"><span class="aQJ">Monday</span></span> night, saying how inclusive he would be, but the attempt got bollixed up in a speech shoplifting incident. </p> <p>Ivanka tried again <span class="aBn"><span class="aQJ">tonight</span></span>. And in return, her dad came onstage and cupped his hands around her hips and patted them. </p><em> Maureen Dowd is an Op-Ed columnist for The Times.</em>

Gays on Team Trump
</div>
<div class='listy_subhead'>
By Anna North
</div>
<div class='listy_body'>
<p><span class="anchor" id="gays-on-team-trump"></span> </p> <p>Joe Brookman, a father of four from Washington D.C., was hard to miss on the floor of the Quicken Loans Arena <span class="aBn"><span class="aQJ">on Thursday</span></span> night. He was wearing a jacket covered in silver sequins. He’d come to the convention as the guest of a delegate from Washington D.C. to raise awareness about L.G.B.T. issues. </p> <p>The 2016 Republican platform condemns the Supreme Court’s decision in Obergefell v. Hodges, which granted same-sex couples the freedom to marry. It also states that “traditional marriage and family, based on marriage between one man and one woman, is the foundation for a free society.” </p> <p>But Mr. Brookman said he’d heard a different message from speakers the previous night who talked about the G.O.P. as “a big-tent party.” </p> <p>Elsewhere on the floor, Barbara Paulus, a delegate from Kansas, said her ideal party platform would not mention L.G.B.T. issues, except to say “that everyone has the same rights as an American.” For Lisenne Dudderar, a delegate from Arkansas, the perfect platform would say nothing on the topic. </p> <p>Later in the evening, the crowd applauded when the venture capitalist Peter Thiel said he was “proud to be gay.” </p> <p>Mr. Brookman, a member of the Log Cabin Republicans, had found convention delegates, including those from conservative states, receptive to his message. He was hopeful that an inclusive spirit would prevail under a Donald Trump presidency. </p> <p>Mr. Trump “is historically very supportive of L.G.B.T. rights,” he said. “He doesn’t care as long as you perform.” </p> <p>Mr. Brookman wasn’t always on Team Trump. “I didn’t start there but I’m actually very, very excited to end there.” </p> <p>He was ending his convention trip in the last of five outfits he brought from home: <span class="aBn"><span class="aQJ">Sunday</span></span> had been starbursts, <span class="aBn"><span class="aQJ">Monday</span></span> through <span class="aBn"><span class="aQJ">Wednesday</span></span> were variations on a rose motif. “And <span class="aBn"><span class="aQJ">tonight</span></span>,” he said, “it’s fireworks.” </p> <p><em>Anna North is a member of the Editorial Board.</em> </p>

Thiel’s Baffling Support of Trump
</div>
<div class='listy_subhead'>
By Vikas Bajaj
</div>
<div class='listy_body'>
<p><span class="anchor" id="thiels-baffling-support-of-trump"></span> </p> <p>Silicon Valley executives often complain about the real and perceived weaknesses of the government so it was no surprise that Peter Thiel, a founder of PayPal and early investor in Facebook, used his time on the Republican Convention stage <span class="aBn"><span class="aQJ">Thursday</span></span> night to criticize, well, the government. But he had no evidence that the candidate he is supporting, Donald Trump, can fix the government. </p> <p>Mr. Thiel, whose <a href="http://www.wired.com/2015/05/silicon-valley-letting-go-techie-island-fantasies/" target="_blank" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?hl=en&amp;q=http://www.wired.com/2015/05/silicon-valley-letting-go-techie-island-fantasies/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1469241608318000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGK2OtBam-nujVK774YHhbRVER_-Q">disillusionment with the government</a> goes back a long way, bemoaned the fact that the American nuclear weapons program still uses floppy disks and that “our newest fighter jets can’t even fly in the rain” and lamented that government software doesn’t work at all “much of the time.” But fear not, he said, Mr. Trump will fix it all and would “lead us back toward that bright future,” referring to the cold war when Mr. Thiel’s father was studying engineering at Case Western University in the 1960s. </p> <p>What gives Mr. Thiel such confidence in Mr. Trump? </p> <p>He said he likes Mr. Trump because “he is a builder and it’s time to rebuild America,” that he wanted to end “stupid wars.” And he said Mr. Trump understands that fake culture wars are a distraction. </p> <p>That last statement was a reference to the debate about whether transgender people can use the bathroom that matches their gender identity. It should be noted that it is Republicans lawmakers are pushing anti-transgender policies. Mr. Thiel, by the way, also said that he was proud to be gay, which must have taken some courage given how hostile this year’s <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/19/opinion/the-most-extreme-republican-platform-in-memory.html" target="_blank" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?hl=en&amp;q=http://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/19/opinion/the-most-extreme-republican-platform-in-memory.html&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1469241608318000&amp;usg=AFQjCNEsZvMH-fl54QamDgEqDVYfBLFgIA">Republican platform</a> is to gays. </p> <p>He followed that up by saying he was a proud Republican and a proud American, to cheers from the crowd and chants of USA USA USA. </p> <p><em>Vikas Bajaj is a member of the Editorial Board.</em> </p>

The Loneliest Man in the Lone Star State
</div>
<div class='listy_subhead'>
By Maureen Dowd and Alex Thompson
</div>
<div class='listy_body'>
<p>Ted Cruz really is Canadian. </p> <p>Because if he were a true Texan, he would know, yes, when to hold ’em and when to fold ’em. </p> <p>We happened upon the El Paso branch of the Texas delegation at the Hyde Park Prime Steakhouse. The delegates, wearing matching white cowboy hats and red, white and blue shirts with a lone star, were still fit to be tied at Cruz’s withholding convention speech and truculent meeting with them this morning. </p> <p>It was a case of Andrew Marvell irritation: Had we but world enough and time, this coyness, sir, were no crime. </p> <p>Cruz thought his coy, smart-alecky refusal to endorse or even boost Donald Trump in his prime-time speech was a springboard to 2020. Instead, he’s riding a bronco called Trump. If he had wanted to stand on principle and not play patty-cake with Trump like Paul Ryan and Marco Rubio, many here felt, Cruz should have stayed home. </p> <p>“I’ve never seen someone commit hara-kiri on national television,” said Mark Dunham. “Mr. Cruz, whether he realizes it or not, he turned himself into Omarosa. It was political suicide. I cannot rationalize his thought process other than he’s taking it way too personally and making it more about himself than God and country.” </p> <p>Adolpho Telles, the owner of Rosa’s Cantina in El Paso, agreed: “I am so annoyed with him. He should have accepted what occurred and moved on with his life. You’ve got to support your candidate 100 percent.” </p> <p>The bright side, he said, was that the anger at Cruz had brought the delegates together and distracted them from the worries some have that they are not yet totally in love with their erratic, dictatorial Gotham mogul. </p> <p>Telles was not buying Cruz’s defense this morning to them that he was not “a servile puppy dog” who would tell Trump “thank you very much for maligning my wife and maligning my father.” </p> <p>Telles said he was thinking: “This is not about you or your wife. It’s about Trump. And it’s about America.” </p> <p><em>An earlier version of this article misspelled the first name of a member of Donald Trump’s staff. She is Omarosa Manigault, not Amarosa.</em></p>

Has Trump Subdued the Mainstream Media?
</div>
<div class='listy_subhead'>
By Virginia Heffernan
</div>
<div class='listy_body'>
<span class="anchor" id="has-trump-subdued-the-mainstream-media"></span> <p>Ivanka Trump peered at the central teleprompter glass. Earlier today, she and her father, Donald, stood at the podium in the Quicken Loans Arena in Cleveland, testing the tech for Mr. Trump’s speech <span class="aBn"><span class="aQJ">tonight</span></span> at the Republican National Convention. </p> <p>“The font is good for you, Dad?” Ms. Trump asked. “For me it would be great to have it a tiny bit bigger.” </p> <p>“Then you get fewer words,” replied Mr. Trump. The font was left as is. </p> <p>Mr. Trump then read aloud the words on the glass: “Four score and seven years ago …” Presumably he was reading teleprompter dummy copy. Unless he plans to inflict an Abe impersonation on what’s left of the party of Lincoln. </p> <p>CBS News captured this candid video of the Trumps discussing the legibility of the electronic cue cards. And then @CBSNews spun the video as something of a gotcha on Twitter. “Watch as @realDonaldTrump and @IvankaTrump tweak the teleprompter at the #RNCinCLE.” </p> <p>Mr. Trump has made much of his proficiency as an ad-libber, and he has repeatedly mocked the dependence of other politicians on teleprompters. But <span class="aBn"><span class="aQJ">tonight</span></span> — when he formally accepts the Republican nomination for president at the convention — he’s evidently not taking any chances. </p> <p>But it’s surprising that this mild video by CBS News could even pass as a Twitter gotcha. The companionable exchange among the engineers and the Trumps is far too benign to qualify for the usual Twitter scrum. But the CBS News video is about as spiky as media coverage has gotten this week, in spite of predictions that the convention coverage would be vertigo. </p> <p>Instead, the major television networks, which can cover conventions in their sleep, brought social media to heel this week. Partly that’s because the networks <em>partnered</em> with social media, exploiting the upstarts’ dependence on disciplined news organizations with prime arena real estate, good cameras and a trained sense of when and how to cut away. Thus networks all week have controlled both the spectacle and the spin, piping their video into Facebook and Twitter, and even into rambunctious newcomer services like Twitch. </p> <p>But the convention has also failed to explode in another way. In spite of nervousness over how to cover a fractious convention and anticipated protests, the television networks ended up fitting this year’s unconventional convention into their decades’ old template for event coverage. </p> <p>When dissent among Republican delegates was put down on Day 1, the networks did not themselves dissent or send cameras to follow the disaffected parties out of the room. Instead, they largely put the disruption behind them, and continued to cover Mr. Trump as if there were party consensus about his nomination. </p> <p>Similarly, when Ted Cruz pointedly snubbed Mr. Trump in his speech <span class="aBn"><span class="aQJ">on Wednesday</span></span>, the networks instantly gave airtime to those who booed him — and then cut to a distraction awkwardly staged by Mr. Trump to seize the floor from Mr. Cruz. These choices by the news media suggested that, like the campaign, they were determined to sideline his detractors and keep the nominee front and center. </p> <p>Yesterday, Mr. Trump underscored the point suggested by the media’s camerawork: “Other than a small group of people who have suffered massive and embarrassing losses, the party is very united. Great love in the arena!” </p> <p>All week off-camera Mr. Trump has been playing media critic, as usual, on Twitter. He tweeted regular praise of Fox News and denigrated CNN and others for biased coverage and low ratings. Mr. Trump’s posts suggest that he never takes his eye off the media, and that he’s prepared, whatever else he’s up to, to smack the wayward ones whenever they get out of line. </p> <p>Is it possible that, just as the mainstream media seems to have tamed social media for now, the Trump campaign has managed to subdue the mainstream media? </p> <em>Virginia Heffernan, a former television critic and internet columnist at The Times, is the author of “Magic and Loss: The Internet as Art.”</em>

Cruz’s Future, Cruz’s Honor
</div>
<div class='listy_subhead'>
By Ross Douthat
</div>
<div class='listy_body'>
<p><span class="anchor" id="cruzs-future-cruzs-honor"></span> </p><p><span>Before and after Ted Cruz’s remarkable non-endorsement of Donald Trump last night — more pointed in the delivery than the text, and then insanely underlined by Trump’s outraged aides and servitors — the conversation turned, as ever with the ambitious Cruz, to how this would affect his presidential ambitions in 2020 and beyond.</span> </p><p>No doubt Cruz believes that it will help him — that the party’s many anti-Trumpers will remember his refusal to abase himself, and that enough Trump voters will forgive him if he runs on populist and anti-establishment themes. </p><p>But there are good reasons to think otherwise, starting with the fact that Cruz couldn’t win this year’s nomination even though he ended up the last man standing against a candidate the party had every reason to reject. If his “vote your conscience” speech cements his standing with many conservatives and wins him strange new respect from anti-Trump moderates, it’s also turned his radio-talker supporters against him and added to his lengthy list of party enemies — which means that in future presidential cycles it might put a harder ceiling on his support. </p><p>Here the thing, though: Nobody has <em>any idea</em> what will happen between now and 2020, in the Republican Party, American politics or the world at large. (It’s only, what, three years since people were promoting Rand Paul as the future of a libertarianized G.O.P.?) If there’s anything this election has taught us, it’s the basic impossibility of gaming out what will make the most political sense in the near-but-misty future. </p><p>And throughout Trump’s rise, far too many Republican politicians have gotten lost in this mostly-futile gaming-out of options. From Paul Ryan’s temporizing — criticize but don’t oppose, withhold your endorsement and then offer it reluctantly — to Marco Rubio’s #NeverTrump, no, wait, #NeverHillary lurches, there’s been a futile quest for some perfect political balance that keeps every option open and every faction happy, that distances you from Trump in one breath while normalizing with him with the other. </p><p>Cruz made a version of this mistake early in the primary campaign, with his ever-so-calculated embrace of Trump. But last night he chose the better way. You don’t know what <span class="aBn"><span class="aQJ">tomorrow</span></span> holds — so do the right thing today. You don’t know what strategy will play well four years hence — so stand up for your own integrity, your cause’s principles and your family’s honor. The future is unwritten — but you can make sure that when the history of the present year is written, your place won’t be with those timid and temporizing souls who surrendered both their party and their dignity to Donald Trump. </p><p>That’s what Cruz earned himself last night: not a better chance at the presidency, but a profile in political courage that will be remembered no matter what happens to his political ambitions henceforth. And it’s yet another irony of this most ironic year that it would be the most overtly Machiavellian of Republican politicians who would keep his honor, and pass a test that so many politicians of more conspicuous high-mindedness have failed. </p><p><em>Ross Douthat is an Op-Ed columnist for The Times.</em><br> </p>

Of Wine and Avocados, Women for Trump Speak Up
</div>
<div class='listy_subhead'>
By Maureen Dowd
</div>
<div class='listy_body'>
<span class="anchor" id="wine-avocados-women"></span> <p>Much has been said about Donald Trump’s reputation as a connoisseur of women — mostly by him. </p> <p>So it is interesting to see which women — besides the glossy Bond girls in his family — are stepping up to the podium to give testimonials to the Beauty of Trump. </p> <p>Ordinarily at a Republican convention, you get a lot of pasty-faced white guys droning on about policies that would yank rights away from women. But G.O.P. officials jammed all the Teanderthal “Mad Men” stuff in the platform a week ago. </p> <p>The Trump convention is a blithely policy-free zone, “the ultimate reality show,” as Trump’s campaign chairman, Paul Manafort, called it. Some Washington think tanks even canceled their usual policy seminars. What was the point? </p> <p>In the absence of the usual suspects — G.O.P. stars and a few A-list celebrities from movies where things get blown up — a selection of random women have stepped into the void. </p> <p>Convention planners are hoping there has to be another way besides Ivanka to improve Trump’s abysmal favorability numbers with women and to provide some counterprogramming to the harsh calls for execution or imprisonment, or both, of the first woman to head a major party ticket. </p> <p>But delegates sometimes looked a little mystified by the parade of obscure women, some of whom offered no explanation of how or even if they knew Trump. </p> <p>Somehow, in this unorthodox gathering, an avocado farmer and former soap opera actress who won two awards from Soap Opera Digest for being Outstanding Villainess ended up in prime time, standing before a screen the exact color of guacamole in a Trump Tower taco bowl. </p> <p>“Many of you know me from one of your favorite soap operas ‘The Young and the Restless’ and ‘The Bold and the Beautiful,’” Kimberlin Brown said, adding that since she had only One Life to Live, she pursued other dreams. </p> <p>Kerry Woolard, the general manager of the Trump Winery, made Trump’s turnaround of the Virginia vineyard sound like Eisenhower at Omaha Beach: “Quickly and decisively,” she said, he went “to work replanting the vines.” </p> <p>We also enjoyed the stylings of Michelle Van Etten, a statuesque blonde with a disjointed speaking style and karate-chop hand motion that seemed to alarm some delegates. Balancing out Trump, called the “short-fingered vulgarian” by Spy magazine, Von Etten has unusually long fingers. </p> <p>She told the traumatic saga of going to her 20th high school reunion. She saw that her former classmates were driving BMWs and “looked like Barbie,” while she was 30 pounds overweight and driving a minivan. </p> <p>“I began to dream again,” she said, adding that she started a fashion business in Florida and “after two years, I was able to retire my husband” and he was able to home-school their kids. </p> <p>Natalie Gulbis, the 441st best female golfer in the world who was in the second season of “Celebrity Apprentice,” told the story of how she hit the links once with Trump and he helped her realize her dream of opening a Boys and Girls Club. </p> <div> <p>“These words previously fell on deaf albeit well-intentioned ears, but that day was different,” she told the crowd. “They finally fell on ears that cared enough to take action.” </p> <p>Trump’s caring ears must have burning. </p> </div>

On a Dare, Some Praise for Clinton and Trump

<div class='listy_body'>
<span class="anchor" id="on-a-dare-some-praise-for-clinton-and-trump"></span> <p><strong><em>Q:</em></strong> We have all heard the useless information. Would somebody please look at the positive qualities that each candidate brings to the table and give us the chance to make a decision based on that? What would a Clinton presidency mean and what would a Trump presidency mean? With a Republican-controlled Congress and with a Democrat-controlled Congress. What are the positives? – <a href="https://www.facebook.com/nytopinion/posts/1361352610546358?comment_id=1362189133796039">Lou Richards</a> </p> <p><strong><em>A:</em></strong> Let me tweak the question a bit and tell you three good things about each candidate. </p> <p>Donald Trump </p> <p>1) Seems to be a very affectionate father. </p> <p>2) Did a good job rebuilding that skating rink in Central Park back in the 1980s. </p> <p>3) Have I mentioned the children? O.K., sorry. He’s a much more pleasant person in private than he seems in public. </p> <p>Hillary Clinton </p> <p>1) Despite her fame, eagerly spends much of her time interacting with average people under less than glamorous conditions. </p> <p>2) Had a better health care plan than Barack Obama in 2008. </p> <p>3) Never folds under pressure. </p>

BitTorrent News Streams the R.N.C.
</div>
<div class='listy_subhead'>
By Andrew Rosenthal
</div>
<div class='listy_body'>
<p><span class="anchor" id="bittorrent-news-streams-the-rnc"></span> </p> <p>What on earth is BitTorrent News? </p> <p>At this point, it’s no surprise when an organization experiments with ways to use technology to advance the distribution of news. The New York Times is one of many doing so. </p> <p>BitTorrent — a company based, of course, in San Francisco — is using news to advance technology. </p> <p>Until fairly recently, BitTorrent didn’t have a news site. In fact, it wasn’t really a website at all. It’s a “protocol” — a bunch of software used to transfer files across the internet. </p> <p>BitTorrent’s technology, now about 12 years old, was a success among companies that distribute large amounts of data to large numbers of people at the same time, like Facebook or the online gaming company Blizzard. </p> <p>More notoriously, pirate websites use the technology to offer illegal downloads. Erik Schwartz, a vice president for the company, was quick to say that his company does not offer those services, but its software is open source. </p> <p>After a while, BitTorrent started to focus on video streaming, which is how Netflix delivers movies and TV shows to your computer, and found the available technology lacking. </p> <p>“During the 2014 World Cup, we’d be watching ESPN online and Twitter would explode with ‘GOAL!’ and then you’d watch little guys running around on a soccer field for four minutes until you saw the goal being scored,” Schwartz said. </p> <p>While the future of scripted video programming like “House of Cards” lies in the kind of on-demand streaming that Netflix offers, sports and news have bigger audiences and have to be offered live. So BitTorrent looked for a live event to test their technology, and along came the 2016 New Hampshire primary. </p> <p>BitTorrent rented some space in the Radisson Hotel in Manchester, N.H., and BitTorrent News was born. The company hired a news director and some young people with video and journalistic experience. </p> <p>Now it has a mini-studio here in Cleveland, next to The Times’s work space, with an on-camera staff and people behind the scenes, like Benjamin Ratner, 24, who said he edited his first video in seventh grade. </p> <p>BitTorrent has bigger ambitions, which do not seem to include Emmy Awards or Pulitzer Prizes. In May, it started a multichannel TV-like application, which is free, for now. In the future, it hopes to provide an alternative to broadcast and cable networks for things like football games or the World Cup. </p> <p>Meanwhile, the BitTorrent team is having fun covering political conventions. </p>

Trump Is Now a Reality TV Villain
</div>
<div class='listy_subhead'>
By Seth Grossman
</div>
<div class='listy_body'>
<p><span class="anchor" id="trump-reality-tv-villain"></span> </p> <p><span>When Donald J. Trump descended that escalator last June to open the current season of his political reality show, it was immediately clear to me that he was playing a new role. No longer a reality-TV host and judge, he became a contestant. He would compete himself. He could be fired.</span> </p> <p>I’m a veteran reality-TV producer. In my field, character is everything, and shows work best with a diversity of recognizable character types: the everyman, the alpha female, the clown, the wizard, the villain. Mr. Trump has always played an antihero in the mold of Simon Cowell on “American Idol”: a character with flaws, but someone we tune in to see. </p> <p>Now it’s the midseason finale. Mr. Trump is set to give the biggest speech of his career <span class="aBn"><span class="aQJ">tonight</span></span> at the Republican National Convention. As he’s shed the underdog status and become the Republican nominee for president, he has transformed again, into a different kind of reality TV character: the villain. </p> <p>Reality-TV villains differ from villains in other narrative forms in that they don’t necessarily have a unique agenda — they don’t want to kill James Bond or destroy Gotham. They want what all the other characters want: to win the competition, to remain on the island, to receive a rose, to be president. What sets them apart are six simple words: “I’m not here to make friends.” This could very well be Mr. Trump’s campaign motto. </p> <p>In my work, I’m accustomed to devising a coherent, entertaining narrative from raw footage, so I’m intimately familiar with the difference between reality TV and reality itself. Case in point: When Richard Hatch, winner of the first season of “Survivor,” arrived on the island, most of the contestants thought he’d be one of the first voted off. Arrogant, brash, often naked, he was an obvious villain, and villains lose. Mr. Hatch, however, formed strategic alliances and ended up winning that reality TV show. Soon afterward, in <em>reality</em> he was <a href="http://www.today.com/id/11023392/ns/today-today_entertainment/t/ex-survivor-hatch-found-guilty-tax-evasion/#.V5ExzJMrK-o" target="_blank" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?hl=en&amp;q=http://www.today.com/id/11023392/ns/today-today_entertainment/t/ex-survivor-hatch-found-guilty-tax-evasion/%23.V5ExzJMrK-o&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1469228006742000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGylirdGUEkJFZdkz5ox6niMM29Vw">found guilty</a> of tax evasion. </p> <p>Likewise, Mr. Trump won the Republican primary competition, his strategic alliance with Chris Christie paying dividends against a threatening Marco Rubio. The convention, however, is exposing the vast difference between the reality-TV star and the man who must lead his party and, perhaps, this country. </p> <p>It’s telling that on Fox News, the convention’s <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2016/07/20/media/republican-national-convention-ratings/" target="_blank" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?hl=en&amp;q=http://money.cnn.com/2016/07/20/media/republican-national-convention-ratings/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1469228006742000&amp;usg=AFQjCNG8_ppidtRSrR6vGU5VvYjzCE9Hdw">ratings have fallen</a> compared with 2012, but they’re up on CNN and MSNBC. For those who see Mr. Trump as a villain, the convention is must-see hate viewing. We’re watching to see the clown car crash. </p> <p>For Mr. Trump’s supporters, the experience in Cleveland must be extremely disappointing. Mr. Trump promised a dazzling showbiz convention packed with A-listers from the sports and entertainment world. For an audience raised on the production values of shows like “American Idol,” the convention, plagued with a glitchy Jumbotron and cringe-worthy Republican dancing in a half-empty arena, has a state-fair vibe. And while Mr. Trump has been immersed in the alternate universe of reality-TV stardom for years, surely he cannot consider the “Duck Dynasty” star Willie Robertson, the golfer turned apprentice Natalie Gulbis, or the ’80s trivia answer Scott Baio to be A-list. </p> <p>On most reality shows, a savvy producer can steer cast members back on track. The Trump show has one fatal flaw: Mr. Trump is producing it himself. And reality-TV villains, by their very nature, are bad at uniting a cast. If the Master Negotiator couldn’t negotiate an endorsement from Ted Cruz, how will he negotiate his promised concessions from America’s allies and enemies? </p> <p>Mr. Trump may yet turn the convention around. He’ll need a good surprise. Something fun and unexpected, like Arnold Schwarzenegger descending a zip-line to introduce him, or Sarah Palin snowmobiling in to save the day. In his big speech, he could humanize himself by opening up about vulnerabilities that he’s heretofore avoided — the death of his alcoholic brother, his struggles with bankruptcy — or maybe even his lifelong fight to overcome narcissistic personality disorder. </p> <p>But that’s not Mr. Trump’s character. If nothing else, this convention has given undecided voters a preview of a Trump presidency: divisive, ineffective and designed mainly for ratings. </p> <p><em>Seth Grossman is a filmmaker and reality television producer.</em><br> </p>

What would a Clinton presidency mean and what would a Trump presidency mean? With a Republican-controlled Congress and with a Democrat-controlled Congress. What are the positives? – Lou Richards </span> </p> <p><strong><em>A:</em></strong> For me, that’s a bit of a stumper: What’s the silver lining to a President Trump? But if pressed, I’d say that private sector management experience is a significant plus. One of the problems with presidents is that unless they’ve been mayors or governors, they often have little experience managing people or bureaucracies and getting things done. Trump’s business record isn’t great, but it’s something. He also has an intuitive understanding of television and communications that would stand him in good stead, and he’s not an ideologue — indeed, it’s not clear that he has any strongly held views at all, except narcissism. On the policy side, Governor Pence has pioneered a pre-kindergarten program in Indiana and Trump has said nice things about the importance of pre-k, so there’s some hope they would move on that at the federal level. </p> <p>As for Hillary Clinton, her weakness is politics and a penchant for secrecy and self-inflicted injuries, and her strength is policy — she’s smart as a whip and has a real passion that goes back decades for disadvantaged children, who constitute the single most neglected constituency in America today. Sit down with Clinton, and on this topic she’s a policy wonk able to talk in detail about policies that would help, including home visitation and pre-k. She understands that the key to addressing poverty is to help young children. She also cares deeply about addressing gender inequities around the world — human trafficking, child marriage, girls pulled out of school — which to me constitute some of the world’s great injustices. Moreover, although Republicans today despise Clinton and are debating whether it’s best to jail her or shoot her, Clinton had a good record in the Senate and at the State Department of working with Republicans to get things done. For me, the hope of a Hillary Clinton administration is that we might actually make progress in addressing some of the greatest inequities at home and abroad. </p>

Donald Trump’s Oprah Moment
</div>
<div class='listy_subhead'>
By Anna North
</div>
<div class='listy_body'>
<span class="anchor" id="trumps-oprah-moment"></span> <p><span>Cleveland — About halfway through his speech at the Republican convention on Wednesday night, Eric Trump mentioned a conversation between his father and Oprah Winfrey.</span> </p> <p>Ms. Winfrey “once famously asked my father if he envisioned running for the presidency of the United States,” the younger Mr. Trump said. “His answer? ‘Only if it got so bad that I had no choice.’” </p> <p>“Well, ladies and gentlemen,” he continued, “that day has come.” </p> <p>In that 1988 interview, Donald Trump told Ms. Winfrey he probably wouldn’t run for president. But, he said, “If it got so bad, I would never want to rule it out totally, because I really am tired of seeing what’s happening with this country.” </p> <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GZpMJeynBeg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""> </iframe> <p>For some Trump supporters, that interview was a defining moment. “What got me was when he did his interview with Oprah Winfrey 20 years ago,” said Lorena Syacsure at the <a href="http://www.cantonrep.com/news/20160718/trump-supporters-rally-to-back-his-message-in-cleveland" target="_blank">America First Unity Rally</a> for Mr. Trump in Cleveland. He would run only if the country needed it, she said, but “it’s not on the top of his list — he has more to lose running for president than he has to gain.” </p> <p>The Winfrey interview is now part of Trump lore, serving as evidence that Mr. Trump never sought high office, but is now ready to renounce his business career in service of the people. </p> <p>Of course, complicating this message is the fact that Mr. Trump has been <a href="http://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/2016-donald-trump-history-toying-presidential-run/" target="_blank">talking about running for president</a> for decades, announcing an exploratory committee <a href="http://www.cnn.com/ALLPOLITICS/stories/1999/10/08/trump.transcript/" target="_blank">in 1999</a>. </p> <p>“To whom much is given, much will be required,” Eric Trump said on Wednesday. “This is the very belief that compelled my father to make this great sacrifice, to run for the most powerful yet unforgiving office in the world.” </p> <p>Actually, it seems Donald Trump has been willing to make this great sacrifice for some time — it’s just that this year, he might actually get the chance. </p> <p><em>Anna North is a member of the editorial board of The Times.</em> </p>

What It Means for Trump to ‘Speak From the Heart’
</div>
<div class='listy_subhead'>
By Virginia Heffernan
</div>
<div class='listy_body'>
<p><span class="anchor" id="what-it-means-for-trump-to-speak-from-the-heart"></span> </p><p>Eloquently <a href="http://time.com/4416456/republican-convention-mike-pence-video-speech-transcript/" target="_blank">accepting the nomination </a>for vice president at the Republican National Convention on Wednesday night, Gov. Mike Pence described his running mate as “a man known for a large personality, a colorful style and lots of charisma.“ This characterization of Donald Trump threw into relief the campaign’s strenuous efforts this week to generate euphemisms for Mr. Trump’s shortcomings. </p><p>“He doesn’t tiptoe around the thousand new rules of political correctness,” Gov. Pence went on. “He’s his own man.” </p><p>Speakers all night had been coyly invoking Mr. Trump’s aggro provocations — and trying manfully to reframe them. Mr. Pence had begun to practice this art earlier in the week on “60 Minutes,” when he used a Trump family default description: “Trump speaks from the heart.” For months, Mr. Trump’s supporters have been leaning hard on those words to turn his vengefulness and vigilantism into a virtue. </p><p>A Kentucky state senator, Ralph Alvarado, put it this way in his convention speech: Donald Trump is “<a href="http://rpk.org/senator-ralph-alvarado-rnc-convention-speech/" target="_blank">brutally honest, perhaps to a fault</a>.” </p><p>Earlier in the day, in an interview with CNN, Mr. Trump’s daughter Ivanka had protested that her father is neither sexist nor racist. Instead, she said, “He is authentic.” She went on: “He’s bold. He’s unabashed.” </p><p>In this mode, Mr. Trump’s allies sounded curiously like someone else — a candidate for president who appeared eight years ago in Cleveland: Barack Obama. Speaking to a Jewish group, Senator Obama aimed to make acceptable the incendiary anti-American language of his pastor at the time, the Rev. Jeremiah A. Wright Jr. Mr. Wright, <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/Blotter/DemocraticDebate/story?id=4443788&amp;page=1" target="_blank">said Mr. Obama</a>, “is like an old uncle who says things I don’t always agree with.” He concluded: “Everyone has someone like that in their family.” (Mr. Obama later disavowed Mr. Wright, and left his church.) </p><p>Showing amused tolerance of bigotry as a foible of a colorful, charismatic, impolite, rough, direct, brutally honest, authentic, bold and unabashed — but ultimately endearing — old so-and-so seemed contrived when Mr. Obama tried it. And it seems contrived now. </p><p>But the sincerity excuse persists. </p><p>“I speak from here” — Donald Trump said in June, pointing to his head — ”and from the heart.” </p><p>On “60 Minutes” on Sunday, Mr. Trump appeared with Mr. Pence to discuss their partnership. The go-to phrase surfaced when Mr. Pence was asked why he had once objected to Mr. Trump’s proposed ban on foreign Muslims. After fumbling for a bit, Mr. Pence explained that Mr. Trump “doesn’t speak like a politician.” Then, as if cued like one of the hypnotized in “The Manchurian Candidate,” Mr. Pence said, “He speaks from the heart.” </p><p>Casting Mr. Trump’s incitements to xenophobia and violence as heartfelt evidently makes them slightly less terrifying. A through-line of the convention has been to set up a powerful antagonism between “political correctness,” the province of the hypocritical, intellectual and weak-willed, and “speaking from the heart,” as a province of … Donald Trump. </p><p>Mr. Trump’s children, maybe because they’re naturals to liken him to Mr. Obama’s benign “old uncle,” have especially seized on the power of “from the heart” to extenuate almost anything. Revving up to give his speech at the convention tonight, Mr. Trump’s son Eric turned the phrase on himself. The speech “certainly wasn’t something I was going to outsource,” he said, perhaps inadvertently slighting other Trumps — Donald Jr., Melania — who notably used speechwriters for their own addresses. He concluded: “It’s just too important to me. I’m going to speak from the heart tonight.” </p><p>The phrase sounds smarmy. It compromises the Republican Party’s usual claim of hardheadedness over and against the bleeding-heart emotionalism of the other party. </p><p>But it’s probably the only possible rhetorical move of the Trump campaign. It’s become impossible for Mr. Trump’s supporters to lend reason or logic to his vendettas, daft misogyny, thoroughgoing racism and bloodlust. Instead, they advertise it as lovable. </p><p><em>Virginia Heffernan, a former television critic and internet columnist at The Times, is the author of “Magic and Loss: The Internet as Art.”</em> </p><p><em>An earlier version of this article referred incorrectly to Mike Pence’s title. He is the governor of Indiana, not a senator. </em> </p>

Worst Convention Since …
</div>
<div class='listy_subhead'>
By David Leonhardt
</div>
<div class='listy_body'>
<p><span class="anchor" id="worst-convention-since"></span> </p><p>Screaming matches between delegates. Past nominees who refused to attend. Speakers who seem allergic to mentioning the nominee’s name – or policies. The runner-up refusing to endorse the winner. </p> <p>Plagiarism. Lies about plagiarism. Talk of Lucifer from the stage. Humanizing stories about the nominee relegated to obscure time slots. Multiple speakers calling for the jailing of the opposing nominee. A prominent delegate calling for that nominee’s execution by firing squad. </p> <p>It’s time to ask where the Republican National Convention of 2016 ranks on the list of modern history’s worst political conventions. </p> <p>By worst, I’m not making a moral judgment, though that wouldn’t be kind, either. I’m talking instead about effectiveness – judging the conventions as a dispassionate political professional would. </p> <p>Most conventions, it’s worth repeating, are a <a href="https://static01.nyt.com/interactive/2016/07/07/opinion/campaign-stops/donald-trumps-convention-day-1.html?list_item=why-conventions-still-matter" target="_blank" data-saferedirecturl="https://static01.nyt.com/interactive/2016/07/07/opinion/campaign-stops/donald-trumps-convention-day-1.html?list_item=why-conventions-still-matter">success</a>. A party presents its candidates in the best light, and the candidate tends to rise in the polls. Even many campaigns that we now remember for their problems – John McCain in 2008, Michael Dukakis in 1988, Jimmy Carter in 1980 – staged conventions that mostly worked. </p> <p>The list of failures is short. The 1992 Republican convention, in Houston, was notoriously problematic. President George H.W. Bush was an unpopular incumbent, seemingly out of touch with the country’s economic problems, and Republicans instead focused on social issues. In the gathering’s signature speech, Pat Buchanan dismissed Democrats as cross-dressers and <a href="http://www.americanrhetoric.com/speeches/patrickbuchanan1992rnc.htm" target="_blank" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?hl=en&amp;q=http://www.americanrhetoric.com/speeches/patrickbuchanan1992rnc.htm&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1469195333916000&amp;usg=AFQjCNF4xRVxD8mNyZFtZcEY4Ke7JUm0tg">declared</a>, “There is a religious war going on in this country.” </p> <p>Relative to many of this year’s speeches, though, Mr. Buchanan’s looks mild. And the full Houston convention was more successful than many people recall. Mr. Bush rose 6 points in the polls afterward, according to the political scientists Robert S. Erikson and Christopher Wlezien. It’s hard to put on a convention that doesn’t create a polling bounce. </p> <p>A second entry on the list is more recent: the Republicans, in Tampa, four years ago. A hurricane cut it short by a day. Clint Eastwood had a bizarre conversation with an empty chair. And Mitt Romney received no noticeable bump in the polls. </p> <p>But I think the two worst conventions to date were both Democratic ones – in the topsy-turvy years of 1968 and 1972. The Democrats, like the rest of the country, were riven by the Vietnam War in 1968, and a sense of conflict and violence dominated the Chicago gathering. Security guards shoved Dan Rather of CBS while he was on the air, and outside the convention hall a clash between protesters and the police turned into a riot. The Democratic nominee, Hubert Humphrey, dropped slightly in the polls after the convention. </p> <p><span class="aBn"><span class="aQJ">Four years later</span></span>, the Democrats went to Miami Beach for a convention that is less famous than the one in 1968 but arguably less effective. The party had adopted more inclusive nominating rules, to make the process more democratic, and the result was chaos. More than 70 different people were nominated for vice president. A few, like Archie Bunker, were <a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=7755888" target="_blank" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?hl=en&amp;q=http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId%3D7755888&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1469195333916000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHVrBizg5-KEAEgDS7uUgzco9Gdew">fictional</a>. By the time it ended, the presidential nominee, George McGovern, did not take the stage to give his speech <a href="http://www.politico.com/story/2008/08/flashback-the-1972-democratic-convention-012848" target="_blank" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?hl=en&amp;q=http://www.politico.com/story/2008/08/flashback-the-1972-democratic-convention-012848&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1469195333916000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGU4PdGD0jvluzbZTjvs-kTDOBx3w">until after <span class="aBn"><span class="aQJ">2 a.m.</span></span></a> </p> <p>Oh, and this may sound familiar: Some top Democrats were not at the convention, because of intraparty fights. Mr. McGovern fell a remarkable 10 points in the polls after it ended and ultimately lost in a landslide to Richard Nixon. </p> <p>The Republicans’ 2016 gathering is now part of this discussion. It has been full of anger, division, calls for violence and procedural incompetence. “If the point of a convention is to unify the party and reach out to broader electorate,” as the conservative writer Philip Klein <a href="https://twitter.com/philipaklein/status/755951594072633345" target="_blank" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?hl=en&amp;q=https://twitter.com/philipaklein/status/755951594072633345&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1469195333916000&amp;usg=AFQjCNEeMaC3m3tzmTBTlHTMWQ9uzBnrTQ">said</a>, “it’s been an unmitigated disaster so far.” </p> <p>His caveat – so far – is the reason we can’t yet make a final judgment. Donald Trump still has to deliver the convention’s most important speech, and the polls still have to offer the public judgment’s. Perhaps Mr. Trump will somehow find a way to appeal to disaffected voters who are perfectly happy to watch him anger the Republican establishment. </p> <p><span>After a year of political surprises, it’s difficult to make confident pronouncements about how voters will react to anything. But I’m willing to predict that the 2016 gathering will go down as one of the least impressive in a long, long time.</span> </p> <p><em>David Leonhardt, who will begin an Op-Ed column later this year, is writing a daily Opinion post during the conventions.</em><br> </p>
