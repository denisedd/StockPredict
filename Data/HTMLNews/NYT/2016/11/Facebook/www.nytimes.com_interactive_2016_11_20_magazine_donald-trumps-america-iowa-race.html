  <p><strong>On a cold, </strong>clear night in January 2008, when Iowa Democrats selected Barack Obama over a white woman and a white man in the state’s first-in-the-nation caucus, the moment felt transformative. If voters in this overwhelmingly white, rural state could cast their ballots for a black man as president, then perhaps it was possible for the entire nation to do what had never been done; perhaps America had turned far enough away from its racist past that skin color was no longer a barrier to the highest office of the land. In the months that followed, as Obama racked up primary victories, not just in the expected cities but also in largely white Rust Belt towns and farming communities, it seemed evidence for many Americans that the nation had finally become “post-racial.”<br></p><!--NYTDROP {"id":1, "pNum":1} --><p>Of course, that post-racial dream did not last long, and nothing epitomizes the naïveté of that belief more than the election last week of Donald J. Trump. As I watched my home state of Iowa join the red flood that overtook the electoral map last Tuesday, I asked myself the same questions that so many others did: What happened? Why had states that reliably backed Obama — states like Iowa, Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania — flipped Republican?</p><!--NYTDROP {"id":2, "pNum":2} --><p>I was struck by how quickly white pundits sought to tamp down assertions that race had anything to do with it. It was, it seemed to me, almost a relief to many white Americans that Trump’s victory encompassed so many of the heavily white places that voted for a black man just years before. It was an absolution that let them reassure themselves that Donald Trump’s raucous campaign hadn’t revealed an ugly racist rift after all, that in the end, the discontent that propelled the reality-TV star into the White House was one of class and economic anxiety, not racism.</p><!--NYTDROP {"id":3, "pNum":3} --><p>But this analysis reveals less about the electorate than it does about the consistent inability of many white Americans to think about and understand the complex and often contradictory workings of race in this country, and to discuss and elucidate race in a sophisticated, nuanced way.</p><!--NYTDROP {"id":4, "pNum":4} --><p>While we tend to talk about racism in absolute terms — you’re either racist or you’re not — racism and racial anxiety have always existed on a spectrum. For historians who have studied race in the United States, the change from blue to red in heavily white areas is not surprising. In fact, it was entirely predictable. “There are times when working-class whites, whether rural or urban, will join an interracial alliance to get the short-term gains they want,” Robin Kelley, a history professor at U.C.L.A., told me. “They don’t ever do it without kicking and screaming.”</p><figure id="graphic-100000004767702" class="graphic">

<p>To understand how all these heavily white Iowa counties went for Obama, we must look back to 2008. After eight years of Republican rule, with the economy in a tailspin, white people were suffering through the sort of disastrous unemployment rates that usually only black Americans face. It has been called the worst recession since <a href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/g/great_depression_1930s/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier" title="Recent and archival news about the Great Depression." class="meta-classifier">the Great Depression</a>. Obama’s message of hope, that Americans of all stripes were in this thing together, along with his promises to go after the banks and Wall Street types that had caused the disaster, struck a chord across political parties. And his savvy ground operation took this message to rural and suburban communities that Democrats had often written off as unwinnable.</p><!--NYTDROP {"id":6, "pNum":6} --><p>The Rev. Jesse Jackson, the first black man to run for president (and second black American, behind Shirley Chisholm), made similar inroads with rural white farmers during his 1984 and 1988 campaigns. This was simply because he reached out to them promising to push policies that would specifically help them, like ending foreclosures on family farms and forgiving their debt. He did not get a majority of this vote, but he got a surprisingly significant portion.</p><!--NYTDROP {"id":7, "pNum":7} --><p>Decades later, large numbers of rural and suburban white voters were willing to cast their lot with Obama and his multiracial coalition — not necessarily out of some sense of racial enlightenment or egalitarianism but because at the time, they saw it as being in their own best interest. Class and economic anxieties did not erase racial ones; they just in that moment transcended them.</p><!--NYTDROP {"id":8, "pNum":8} --><p><strong>Much has changed</strong> in the country since the desperate days of 2008, and while Obama carried more than half of Iowa’s 99 counties that year, last week Clinton only carried six. I talked to several white Iowans, many of them lifelong Democrats, who had voted for Obama at least once. They said they believed in unions and social programs to help the needy. They believed in the concept of racial equality, in the sense that all people should have the same opportunities. But in recent years, they had come to feel at odds with their party; it no longer reflected their own cultural norms. Where once they were the backbone of the party, now they were outsiders.</p><!--NYTDROP {"id":9, "pNum":9} --><p>Gretchen Douglas is a corrections officer from Marshalltown. The 53-year-old had been a Democrat her entire adult life and describes herself as a social liberal and fiscal conservative. She’s a supporter of unions and gay rights and abortion rights and said she doesn’t want to breathe dirty air. She proudly talked of her daughter’s success as a chemist, mentioning that not long ago the only options for women were teaching and nursing. She holds a degree in accounting and can tell you exactly the share of the <a href="http://topics.nytimes.com/topics/reference/timestopics/subjects/n/national_debt_us/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier" title="More articles about the national debt." class="meta-classifier">national debt</a> she and her husband carry.</p><!--NYTDROP {"id":10, "pNum":10} --><p>Even as the recession caused Iowa to shed hundreds of state jobs, Douglas managed to hold onto hers. But in 2012, for the first time in her life, she registered as a Republican, and last week she voted for Trump. Douglas told me she had switched parties because she felt Obama had been irresponsible with spending, causing the national debt to soar. She said Democrats were spending too much on social programs for people who did not need them.</p><!--NYTDROP {"id":11, "pNum":11} --><p>“I don’t want to throw Granny out in the snow, and I think the least of our brothers should be taken care of,” she said. “But I think that those who can work should.” Douglas said there was a time in her life where she was struggling, and so she applied for welfare for herself and her young children but was denied. She didn’t think that was fair, but she worked hard and turned her life around. But these days, she said, “I kind of think for some social programs there is no stigma.”</p><!--NYTDROP {"id":12, "pNum":12} --><p>Douglas never mentioned race, but polls including a recent one of Trump supporters have shown that white Americans’ support for entitlement programs declines if they think black people are benefiting. And the longer Douglas talked, the more she revealed other reasons she had voted for Trump.</p><!--NYTDROP {"id":13, "pNum":13} --><p>When Obama was elected, she hoped he would “bridge race relations, to help people in the middle of Iowa” see that black people “are decent hardworking people who want the same things that we want.” She said people in rural Iowa often don’t know many black people and unfairly stereotype them. But Obama really turned her off when after a vigilante killed a black teenager named Trayvon Martin, he said the boy could have been his son. She felt as if Obama was choosing a side in the racial divide, stirring up tensions. And then came the death of Michael Brown, shot by a policeman in Ferguson, Mo.</p><!--NYTDROP {"id":14, "pNum":14} --><p>“I’m not saying that the struggles of black Americans aren’t real,” Douglas told me, “but I feel like the Michael Brown incident was violence against the police officer.”</p><!--NYTDROP {"id":15, "pNum":15} --><p>The Black Lives Matter movement bothered her. Even as an Ivy League-educated, glamorous black couple lived in the White House, masses of black people were blocking highways and staging die-ins in malls, claiming that black people had it so hard. When she voiced her discomfort with that movement, she said, or pointed out that she disagreed with Obama’s policies, some of her more liberal friends on Facebook would call her racist. So, she shut her mouth — and simmered.</p><!--NYTDROP {"id":16, "pNum":16} --><p><strong>Trump clearly sensed </strong>the fragility of the coalition that Obama put together — that the president's support in heavily white areas was built not on racial egalitarianism but on a feeling of self-interest. Many white Americans were no longer feeling that belonging to this coalition benefited them. A recent study by sociologists from Harvard and Tufts found that white Americans believed that they experienced more discrimination than black Americans. Trump spoke openly to those Americans, articulating what many Iowans felt but could never say. It was liberating.</p><!--NYTDROP {"id":17, "pNum":17} --><p>“Trump was crass, and he was abrupt,” Douglas said. “But I felt like he was going to take care of the things that mattered for me, and honestly I was very worried about our country.”</p><!--NYTDROP {"id":18, "pNum":18} --><p>There has never been a moment in America in which black people’s gains have not been perceived by some white Americans as their loss. And history is littered with examples of how economic and racial anxieties can create a wedge with which to destroy interracial political and economic alliances. White supremacists overthrew the biracial fusion party in North Carolina in the late 1800s and, with the support of the white population in the state that had once supported the sharing of power, worked to disenfranchise black North Carolinians and usher in seven decades of Jim Crow. In more modern times, George Wallace was roundly trounced when he ran for governor of Alabama against a racist opponent. Wallace, who had promised “to treat a man fair, regardless of his color,” vowed to never be “out-niggered” again. The next election he rode a segregationist platform right into the governor’s mansion. Similarly, Richard Nixon ran for president the first time as a moderate and lost, but he later found his opening courting white opposition to civil rights with his Southern strategy. It is not incidental that John McCain and Mitt Romney mostly declined to stir up racial tensions in their campaigns against Obama and lost.</p><!--NYTDROP {"id":19, "pNum":19} --><p>When Trump inveighed against Mexican rapists and talked of barring Muslims from the country, the baldness of his rhetoric spoke to something deeply seated in the Iowans I talked to. Erin Wright, who worked for the state before quitting to finish a nursing degree, voted for Obama in 2008, and doesn’t remember if she voted at all in 2012; she cast her ballot for Trump last week. Like Douglas, she wasn’t struggling financially but was attracted to Trump’s promise to seal our southern borders and to bar Muslims from entering the country.</p><!--NYTDROP {"id":20, "pNum":20} --><p>“There’s a lot of illegal people here, who do take work,” she said. “If they want to become a citizen, that is super, they should become a citizen. But all the influx of people who come in, they get benefits, they get jobs, and they take them from people who can’t find anything else who have lived here their whole lives.”</p><!--NYTDROP {"id":21, "pNum":21} --><p>What’s missing from the American conversation on race is the fact that people don’t have to hate black people or Muslims or Latinos to be uncomfortable with them, to be suspicious of them, to fear their ascension as an upheaval of the natural order of things. A smart demagogue plays to those fears under the guise of economic anxieties. Things not as good as you hoped? These folks are the reason. Kelley, the historian, said white Americans have ignored race when it serves them and defaulted to it when it suits them. “We think of interest as an objective thing that floats above, but it is subjective,” he said. “Race always plays a role. It never disappears.”</p><!--NYTDROP {"id":22, "pNum":22} --><p>The miracle Obama worked in 2008 and 2012 was to stitch together, at least in part, the racial lines that have always fractured this country. What we saw last week was those lines being torn apart again.</p><!--NYTDROP {"id":23, "pNum":23} --><p><em>Nikole Hannah-Jones is a staff writer for the magazine.

  <p><strong>Ohio was once</strong> the home of the Old Guard, Main Street, county Chamber of Commerce Republican Party: stolid, sober, civil, fiscally conservative, socially enlightened. Dead serious in all matters. But 2016 was the year when people who were not used to being taken seriously had to be taken very seriously indeed, even in Ohio. This was true of Donald Trump, of course, but it was also true of the people who had fueled his campaign. There was Don Phillips, an elderly catering-hall owner that I met in the Dayton suburbs, a fixture of the local G.O.P., who fired off an angry letter to John A. Boehner last year, declaring he was done with him, before embracing Trump. Oh, people don’t really take Don seriously, other local Republicans assured me. And there was the Butler County sheriff, Rick Jones.</p>

  <p><strong>Every July, we</strong> load up the minivan in the driveway of our house in Portland, Me., and drive to the North Woods for a week. We pack games, snacks, a cooler full of soda and beer, a stray fishing rod. It’s a tradition, this drive up the pine-curtained country roads of our state, this week in the moody wilderness. Set loose from our little foodie enclave by the sea, we ogle the barns and junkyards, tag sales and signs advertising Maine’s prowess in the department of making whoopee pies, two discs of chocolate cake with cream in between. (In case you’re wondering, Maine does hold the world record for the biggest whoopee pie ever made, one weighing over 1,000 pounds.) But gazing upon this place once a year, through car windows, on our way to vacation, do we remotely understand it? Here is a rebel flag hung on a door. Here is a bumper sticker supporting gay marriage.<br></p>

After discovering that I was a soon-to-be-citizen of Donald Trump’s America in the bleary early hours of the day before, I had wanted immediately to speak with Hillsman, a man with a keen and idiosyncratic understanding of politics and one of the few people I knew with any experience living in the world in which America now found itself. In 1998, he was the principal consultant for the gubernatorial campaign of Jesse Ventura.</p>

  <p><strong>When I was</strong> a child in South Carolina, survival was never a question. My grandparents, only a generation removed from enslavement and having witnessed the cruelty of this country’s racism daily, from the Whites Only signs that plagued pools and restaurants to the way they were forced to walk through their Southern world — eyes downcast from white folks, “Yes, ma’am” and “No, sir” more rule than reverence — knew that this was just where they were at this moment. Nothing surprised them. Nothing was shocking. They had seen black men hanging from trees, images of Emmett Till’s brutal beating, German shepherds unleashed on children, 6-year-old Ruby Bridges being spat on by grown white men and women. In all my childhood, I never heard my grandparents say that anything shocked or surprised them. They knew what their country was capable of.</p>

Yet as reports poured in about the historic number of Latinos lining up to vote early in Miami, I felt 100 percent certain that the state would remain blue. After all, Cuban-American members of Congress like Carlos Curbelo and Ileana Ros-Lehtinen had refused to endorse Trump. In October, following the “Access Hollywood” scandal, Ros-Lehtinen called on Trump to withdraw from the campaign.

Why did my mother go there to volunteer?","byline":"By GREG HOWARD","byline_prefix":"By","authors":["Greg Howard"],"kicker":"Feature","body":"<p><strong>Early in the</strong> morning on Election Day, my parents woke up, got dressed and drove around the Capital Beltway from Maryland into Virginia, where my father dropped my mother off at a Hillary Clinton field office in Alexandria. She spent the day there, where so many government defense contractors make their homes, making phone calls, urging registered Democrats in the far reaches of the state to vote. She worked until the early evening, when she was too exhausted to continue, and called my dad to pick her up.</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":1, \"pNum\":1} --><p>My mother is beautiful. The woman I lay my eyes on now still feels like the same one who, 20 years ago, would pick me up and waltz around our family room as if we were at our own exclusive ball. I laugh at the life crackling in her voice every time she answers the phone with an overloud, singsong “Hey, Greg!” But she’s older now. She doesn’t dance as much and a long scar runs down her spine from surgery last year. I was surprised when I heard about her day in Virginia: She’s politically active and like 94 percent of black women this year, she voted for Clinton. But she has never before volunteered for a campaign. Daylong activities often leave her paying a price the following morning. When I asked her why she chose to volunteer in another state, her answer came easy and struck a familiar, maternal tone: “That’s where I felt I was needed.”</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":2, \"pNum\":2} --><p>My mom is retired now, but when I was growing up, she made her career in finance. She woke up early and dressed: high heels, sheer stockings, dark lipstick, sometimes pants, sometimes skirts, always blazers. I remember thinking she looked almost too perfect, like the TV version of a tough black businesswoman. Then she got me and my brother ready, and we would go off to school, and she would weave through rush-hour traffic to Washington. For a while, she caught the Amtrak from Maryland to New York City and back again, every day.</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":3, \"pNum\":3} --><p>She was brilliant, but that was never enough on its own. She drank coffee like water. She tried to hide it from us, but the stress of her career always threatened to bow her shoulders and often brought sudden tears to her eyes. She often worked deep into the night, her desk disappearing beneath thousands of pages of documents, her face shining blue in the glow of her computer screen. After decades in heels, her ankles began to give out. Eventually, her back did, too. Bolts of pain ran down her legs, leaving her immobile and in agony for days. She was a fighter, her co-workers and my dad always said, in awe. But she was a black woman in finance and had to fight for every dollar and promotion, often against so many skeptical and perverse white men. There was a bodily toll, a price many around her didn’t have to pay. A few years ago, she switched to flats and took a less stressful, lower-paying job at a black nonprofit group. But her career had already claimed its pound of flesh, and soon, she couldn’t even do that.</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":4, \"pNum\":4} --><p>There is a real, physical tax just for being a woman or person of color in this world. My mother volunteered because she has paid this tax, in the stress of having her value constantly questioned, the physical demands of not being taken seriously as an intellectual and a leader. My mother voted for Clinton on Oct. 27, the very first day she could, and two days after that, she spent her Saturday at home, calling registered Democrats in Nevada to make sure they did the same. There was an urgency to her political activity that I’d never seen. She liked Clinton and wanted to see a woman as president. But above all, she came of age during the civil rights era and was watching as the alt-right, the Klan and white masses mobilized around a candidate. She recognized danger. She’d already lived through the America to which Trump promised to return.</p><!--NYTREF {[\"region\":\"Embedded\", \"id\":\"100000004767611\", \"dropzone\":5, \"pNum\":5]} --><p>That danger is everywhere, but it’s palpable in the South. When he was a kid, my dad’s family moved from Lynchburg, Va., to Washington, where he grew up, just yards away from the Maryland border. When I was young, he would tell me about the times his parents would ask him and his brother to run to the country store for groceries, just on the other side of the border. Sometimes, they would run into white kids on their trip. The white kids would harass my dad and my uncle and spit on them. Sometimes, the white kids would chase them back across the border, promising violence all the while. This was the tax for entering Maryland.</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":6, \"pNum\":6} --><p>And yet he came to Maryland, eventually, and raised me there. I thought about his stories a lot when I was young. I took it upon myself to draw another border. Mine was the Virginia state line. Even now, Virginia occupies my mind as the gateway to “the South,” that ominous place where the white people vote red, the place where the potential physical tax gets a little steeper, the place my father’s family fled.</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":7, \"pNum\":7} --><p>But the Virginia border is just an imaginary line, demarcated by a sign on the side of the road. I’ve drawn scores of other lines around myself, too, lines that are intangible but no less firm for it. They police my actions, box me in and guide me along the least taxing path. Freedom is the erasure of those imaginary lines, the lessening of the tax that awaits on the other side.</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":8, \"pNum\":8} --><p>No one knows quite what Donald Trump will do as president. But what my parents so intimately understood is that for many of us, there is a real and physical tax extracted simply for things like straying too far from home, raising a family or pursuing a career — for taking part in American life. That tax promises to grow steeper in this new America.</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":9, \"pNum\":9} --><p>When I called home to talk to my parents after the election, I felt myself beginning to panic. I’d never before felt such fear for the taxes Trump’s America would extract from me and my loved ones — the low, dull dread that there were just too many lines to draw. My mom and dad let me talk myself out, then calmed me down. The world feels different to me now. For them, I suspect, it’s just more of the same.</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":10, \"pNum\":10} --><p><em>Greg Howard is a David Carr fellow for The New York Times.</em></p>","scoop_slug":"donald-trumps-america-virginia","promotional_media":100000004764691,"module_top":100000004764691,"modules_body":{"100000004767611":"LARGE"},"ad_frequency":"","ad_sizes":"","ad_adjacencies":"","ad_positions":""},"100000004764680":{"data_id":100000004764680,"print_headline":"Ohio","headline":"The New Sheriff in Town","summary":"A changing of the Republican guard in Ohio.","byline":"By ALEC MacGILLIS","byline_prefix":"By","authors":["Alec MacGillis"],"kicker":"Feature","body":"<p><strong>Ohio was once</strong> the home of the Old Guard, Main Street, county Chamber of Commerce Republican Party: stolid, sober, civil, fiscally conservative, socially enlightened. Dead serious in all matters. But 2016 was the year when people who were not used to being taken seriously had to be taken very seriously indeed, even in Ohio. This was true of Donald Trump, of course, but it was also true of the people who had fueled his campaign. There was Don Phillips, an elderly catering-hall owner that I met in the Dayton suburbs, a fixture of the local G.O.P., who fired off an angry letter to John A. Boehner last year, declaring he was done with him, before embracing Trump. Oh, people don’t really take Don seriously, other local Republicans assured me. And there was the Butler County sheriff, Rick Jones.</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":1, \"pNum\":1} --><p>Jones has long been something of a caricature. A tall, hulking man with a walrus mustache, Jones cultivates the image of a Wild West-style lawman, even if his territory between Cincinnati and Dayton is distinctly lacking in tumbleweed: 469 square miles of exurbs, farmland and frayed manufacturing towns (including Middletown, the setting of J.D. Vance’s best-selling memoir, “Hillbilly Elegy”). He has managed to conjure a border-country aura by casting himself as a crusader against undocumented immigrants, even if they are relatively scarce in Butler County, posting an “Illegal Aliens Here” sign outside the county jail, sending the Mexican government a $900,000 bill for the undocumented Mexicans he was holding there.</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":2, \"pNum\":2} --><p>Early this year, in January, I went to meet Jones at his office adjacent to the jail, a large room with a large desk and all manner of certificates and news clippings attesting to Jones’s accomplishments covering the walls. Right away, it was clear that something had changed for him. In local Republican circles, he had always been something of a fringe figure. He had threatened a primary challenge of John Boehner, who represented Butler County, but never followed through on it. And, unlike most elected Republicans in the state, he was backing Trump, not the state’s governor, John Kasich. Yet now, as I entered the office, I saw that Jones had another visitor: the campaign manager for Bill Beagle, a state senator who was running in the Republican primary to replace Boehner. Beagle was a mild-mannered, business-minded conservative, very much in the Boehner mold, and yet here his emissary was, seeking the endorsement of Jones.</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":3, \"pNum\":3} --><p>We opened with small talk about Baltimore, where I live, which prompted Jones to lay into the city’s chief prosecutor, Marilyn Mosby, who had charged six police officers in Freddie Gray’s death, and whom Jones confused with the city’s mayor, Stephanie Rawlings-Blake, also a black woman. “I believe she speak with forked tongue,” he said.</p><!--NYTREF {[\"region\":\"Embedded\", \"id\":\"100000004767644\", \"dropzone\":4, \"pNum\":4]} --><p>He then drifted into his favorite subject, immigration, as he recounted one of his visits to inspect the United States-Mexico border in Texas. “People can’t leave their ranches, because they come in and they killed the one rancher soon after we were there,” he said. “People have no idea. There’s no nothing, it’s just no fence at all. And the fence is only put up in certain areas, but then you’ll see big, giant holes cut in this fence.”</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":5, \"pNum\":5} --><p>He talked about the Mexican suppliers behind the thriving local heroin trade. He pointed to a neighborhood of humble bungalows behind the jail where, he said, Mexicans now lived among blacks and Appalachian whites. “When I go over here to this community, I see five satellite dishes on the top of the roof, and a van pulls up and takes them to a little workplace, and they work the hell out of them,” he said. “They get abused ... and can’t report it. It’s screwed up. Everything is screwed up.”</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":6, \"pNum\":6} --><p>The next time I saw Jones was two months later, at the annual dinner for the Butler County Republican Party, just before the state’s primary. By this point, Jones had endorsed Beagle and filmed an anti-illegal-immigrant ad for him. But Jones was still the odd man out at the party dinner, where Kasich supporters predominated. He told me proudly that he was going to officially introduce Trump the next day at an event just a mile away.</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":7, \"pNum\":7} --><p>On Nov. 8, Trump won Butler County with 62 percent, the same that the establishment man, Mitt Romney, received four years earlier. Jones was easily re-elected sheriff. He would still have to deal with John Kasich in Columbus. But he would have his man in Washington.</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":8, \"pNum\":8} --><p><em>Alec MacGillis covers government and politics for ProPublica.

We pack games, snacks, a cooler full of soda and beer, a stray fishing rod. It’s a tradition, this drive up the pine-curtained country roads of our state, this week in the moody wilderness. Set loose from our little foodie enclave by the sea, we ogle the barns and junkyards, tag sales and signs advertising Maine’s prowess in the department of making whoopee pies, two discs of chocolate cake with cream in between. (In case you’re wondering, Maine does hold the world record for the biggest whoopee pie ever made, one weighing over 1,000 pounds.) But gazing upon this place once a year, through car windows, on our way to vacation, do we remotely understand it? Here is a rebel flag hung on a door. Here is a bumper sticker supporting gay marriage.<br></p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":1, \"pNum\":1} --><p>What does it mean, or tell us, about <em>us</em>?</p><p>We pass through Skowhegan and Norridgewock, former factory and mill towns. Tradition also calls for a pizza stop in the little town of Madison, supposedly named for James Madison, after the Indians were wiped out here. Each year of the 18 we’ve come north, more shops on Madison’s main street molder and are shuttered. And yet we always return to one curiosity — a store that could have once been a beauty parlor or thrift shop in the town’s sawmill-and-quarry heyday. It looks as if the owners high-tailed it in a hurry — a foreclosure? a death? — junk strewn everywhere, vintage bonnet-style hair dryers in back. Amid the wreckage, through the grimy window, the strangest sight each summer: a forgotten wedding dress, glowing pearlescent on a hanger.</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":2, \"pNum\":3} --><p>This past week, Maine was the only state in the union to split its electoral votes between both major-party candidates. Having voted entirely Democrat in the last six elections, we proffered three electoral votes to Hillary Clinton and one to Donald Trump. In retrospect, four electoral votes hardly ended up being the difference, but in the heat of the coverage, as the astonishment of the evening unfolded, there was a moment when the NBC News political director, Chuck Todd, stood before his digital map of the country, breaking down the evenness of the race, declaring that it was entirely possible the whole thing might indeed boil down to Maine’s Second District, comprising 80 percent of the state’s land area, including the selfsame towns we pass through each summer. At the very least, that one emblematic electoral vote, one that Trump worked hard to win on repeat visits to the state, represented an ignition point for the sparks that soon flared through the Rust Belt.</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":3, \"pNum\":4} --><p>Two days after the election, I took myself on that drive again, looping north from the unreality of Portland (76 percent Clinton; 18.1 percent Trump), on an anti-vacation. Here again was Skowhegan (51.2 percent Trump; 41.9 percent Clinton), Norridgewock (57.4 percent Trump; 35.7 percent Clinton), and New Portland (52.9 percent Trump; 35.8 percent Clinton). Past doughnut shops and gun clubs, I drove through town after town that voted for Trump. (Even in Clinton, Me., Trump took 61.4 percent of the vote.) Because of a drought, many of the leaves still clung to the trees, in conflagrations of orange and red. The farm fields lay fallow. Winter surely comes our way, in serrations of an increasing wind, but no one knows when it will arrive. Sometimes the icy late-afternoon light of middle fall feels like deadest February. In a convenience store/restaurant, I watched a man buy two cans of SpaghettiOs, a quart of orange juice and one of Popov vodka. At a table near the cash register, a bunch of unbothered kids were drinking soda, doing homework together.</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":4, \"pNum\":5} --><p>We’re told that we think in binaries. We cling to them, especially when having to make a binary decision. At least according to brain science. In Maine, despite the iconoclastic streak of the state’s voting populace and its support of independent candidates, we tend to be of two minds, like our nation itself: urban versus rural, white collar versus blue collar, coast versus country, south versus north, new economy versus old, liberal versus conservative, etc. On the same Election Day that brought Pious Ali, a Ghana-born Muslim, to the City Council in Portland, the Lewiston-Auburn Metropolitan Chamber of Commerce announced a public “gun raffle” of a custom-built AR-15. Was this a manifestation of that rural white fear we’ve heard so much about, timed as a tacit threat? The chamber president later resigned, claiming “a colossal error in judgment.” But still, the bedrock concerns of his district — labor, immigration, guns — made its sideways assertion.</p><!--NYTREF {[\"region\":\"Embedded\", \"id\":\"100000004767469\", \"dropzone\":5, \"pNum\":6]} --><p>Maine, like America, is of two minds, then. Should we make it three? I’d venture to say, as it really turns out, and contrary to our theories, we remain many chaotic minds at once, a cacophony that sometimes resolves to symphony and then distortion again. Sometimes even inside the mind of one voter. Take a 36-year-old Congregationalist minister named Matthew McDonald, from Bangor. He told me his trigger issues were labor, immigration, and ... marriage equality. He’d been a Bernie supporter — “Brother Bernie” was how he referred to him — who somehow ended up with Trump. From Millinocket originally, he’d watched his father work as a union leader in a now-closed paper mill and thought the trade agreements — Nafta and the TPP — were anathema to blue-collar Democrats.</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":6, \"pNum\":7} --><p>As a minister, he claimed to have fought hard for marriage equality, marching, donating. He performed L.G.B.T. weddings, he said. While he agreed that Trump had a “rhetoric problem” and that some of what he said was “disgusting,” he said he’d taken Trump “seriously but not literally,” something other supporters had repeated. He still wasn’t sure who President Trump would be. But if his willingness to throw out Nafta and the TPP was an indication, he was worth the risk, for the possibility he represented.</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":7, \"pNum\":8} --><p>I was thinking about this as I drove from town to town, the same towns that voted for our governor, Paul LePage. Twice. Certainly, if any state could have, and should have, predicted a Trump victory, it might have been Maine. We’d seen the effect of LePage, a mini-Trump himself, firsthand. At one public meeting, he blamed “guys with the name D-Money, Smoothie, Shifty” for Maine’s heroin problem. He then added, “Incidentally, half the time they impregnate a young white girl before they leave.” The consequent pillorying of LePage by his political opponents had only solidified his base again, in fact fired them up — and inspired LePage himself, who grew more oppositional by the day, lashing out at his enemies and launching a continued broadside against the press. No doubt, he had benefited Trump, too. The rallies, at which LePage strode the stage like a rock star, turned out huge numbers and helped Trump carry towns and counties that George W. Bush couldn’t.</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":8, \"pNum\":9} --><p>But in the Second District, the consequence also weighed heavily on others. And the shock. I met with a group in Farmington, at a bar called the Dugout. Farmington, thanks to the university there, was one of the few inland towns that went for Clinton. One guy compared Trump to a con man, an old-fashioned snake-oil salesman. “He’s a hobo’s dream of what a rich person is,” he said. “Everything is gold, even the toilet.” Three women, in their 20s, sat drinking beer, and each reflected a different fear. One was engaged to a man in Ecuador and worried that he’d never be allowed to stay in the country. (“This is not the America I love and want to introduce my future husband to.”) One, who was black, said she had already encountered a new kind of more brazen racism: menacing looks, slammed doors. (“I’m just really scared.”) The last said that at the bar where she worked, everyone had voted for Trump, and she felt not only silenced there, but marginalized. (“Some of those guys — after a few drinks — they make it heavily uncomfortable for a woman to speak her mind. Especially now.”) She said her friends were getting IUDs while they could, uncertain where reproductive health was headed. It’s like a sci-fi movie, she said: “The Hunger Games.” All three women said they were waiting to wake up from the nightmare, but it wasn’t stopping.</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":9, \"pNum\":10} --><p>The truth is Trump himself created an unreality. Some might say brilliantly. He wasn’t so much an anti-politician as a celebrity running for the lead in another television pilot. He was multiple, not binary. He was confusing and confrontational, offensive and visceral. He was contradictory enough to offer something for every one of his would-be supporters. And, as it turned out, he moved some Americans as he delivered his speeches not through a teleprompter, but directly to those (mostly white men) before him. We got what we voted for then — or some of us did.</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":10, \"pNum\":11} --><p>I drove home late that night, passing back again through our pizza stop in the town of Madison, a place once famous for the lumber that went into its sawmills and the coffins that came out. I drove that gutted main street but didn’t even slow before the grimy shop window of yesterday to see if that wedding dress was still there. Everything it symbolizes is still here. The marriage that was or wasn’t. The need to sell what was once dear, some pearlescent dream, now left behind in an abandoned storefront. All that promise and heartbreak. Unclaimed, it hangs there in mind, like a ghost or harbinger. Which will it be? We are multifarious, ever-churning, at war with ourselves, and we must ask ourselves now: Which will it be?</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":11, \"pNum\":12} --><p><em>Michael Paterniti is a contributing writer for the magazine and a GQ correspondent.

After discovering that I was a soon-to-be-citizen of Donald Trump’s America in the bleary early hours of the day before, I had wanted immediately to speak with Hillsman, a man with a keen and idiosyncratic understanding of politics and one of the few people I knew with any experience living in the world in which America now found itself. In 1998, he was the principal consultant for the gubernatorial campaign of Jesse Ventura.</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":1, \"pNum\":1} --><p>The former professional wrestler ran for governor without much expectation of becoming one. He did it mostly because, after idly speculating about running on his talk-radio show, “it caught on like wildfire with many of the listeners,” he later wrote. “It got to where I felt I’d boxed myself into a corner — if I didn’t attempt to do this, I would lose my credibility.” His third-party campaign was regarded by the local media as a novelty act, and his decisive victory over his Republican and Democratic opponents came as a total shock to nearly everyone — not least Ventura himself. Hillsman had predicted a narrow loss and was planning to fly to Buenos Aires the next day. “I remember drafting the plan for the next morning on a legal pad that night,” he told me. “We hadn’t prepared anything.”</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":2, \"pNum\":2} --><p>Ventura’s upset was the first election I ever voted in, as a high-school senior in suburban Minneapolis, and it left me with an unshakable sense that the political order, any political order, was less stable than it might appear. Every Election Day since 1998 I have found myself, despite my more rational instincts, unable to really trust polls or projections or conventional wisdom, looking over my shoulder for some sort of looming black-swan event. They rarely arrive, of course — until one does.</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":3, \"pNum\":3} --><p>Ventura’s victory is the most obvious precedent for Trump’s, though the parallels are imperfect. Ventura’s was an oddly nonideological revolution: He had campaigned on a kind of empty-calorie populism, more affect than idea, and according to the exit polls, he drew almost equally from self-identified Democrats and Republicans (roughly a third of each, plus half of self-identified independents). He won voters of every income level except above $100,000 a year. He won by a wide margin the support of voters who felt their financial situation was going to get worse, but also the largest share of voters who thought their prospects were improving. It was a confounding election. Minnesota was by most measures a prosperous, well-employed, tranquil place, as it usually is. And yet a plurality of its voters were willing to hand the state over to a wild-card political novice who had few clear plans for what to do with it.</p><!--NYTREF {[\"region\":\"Embedded\", \"id\":\"100000004767727\", \"dropzone\":4, \"pNum\":4]} --><p>One of the weirder things about electoral politics is that life-or-death passion and why-not frivolity often produce the same teeth-rattling shocks to the system. There were probably Minnesotans who, in voting for Ventura, truly did want to blow up the two-party status quo. But there were others — I knew some of them — who were mostly just curious to see what would happen. This is a light kind of politics that bespeaks a degree of privilege; for a state with a thriving economy and a relatively affluent population, the potential downsides of rolling the dice on Ventura seemed manageable.</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":5, \"pNum\":5} --><p>The same conditions have long underwritten a local political culture of unusually adventurous idealism, sometimes with profound consequences. It was the Minnesota delegation at the 1948 Democratic National Convention that, led by a 37-year-old Hubert H. Humphrey, pushed a civil rights plank into the national party’s platform for the first time, setting off the tectonic reconfiguration of the parties that created today’s partisan landscape. At the time, Minnesota was 99.5 percent white; rural Minnesotans, especially, were only marginally more likely to encounter a black person in their daily lives than their grandparents in Norway and Sweden were. One reason civil rights was an uncontroversial cause among white Minnesotans, no doubt, was that it was so abstract. The state was consequential to civil rights in part because civil rights were of so little direct consequence to the vast majority of people who lived there.</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":6, \"pNum\":6} --><p>A dark inverse of this phenomenon played out across the country — and much of Minnesota, which Hillary Clinton won by a narrower margin than any Democratic presidential candidate since John F. Kennedy — on Nov. 8, when millions of Americans who have probably never met a Muslim voted for a candidate who has vowed to ban them from entering the country. Trump’s coalition included people who sincerely subscribe to one or more of the myriad forms of bigotry that his campaign tacitly sanctioned; the K.K.K. rally announced to celebrate his victory was proof enough of that. But Trump would not have won without the support of thousands of the same voters in northern Midwestern states that America’s first black president won in 2008 and 2012: states like Iowa and Wisconsin that, despite sharing Minnesota’s liberal-populist history and demographics, flipped from blue to red this year.</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":7, \"pNum\":7} --><p>It was the embracing of Obama by white, rural Iowans during the 2008 primaries that first suggested that his candidacy might actually have a chance. The Washington Post columnist Eugene Robinson wrote at the time that “the Iowa caucuses showed us the America we like to believe we live in, a country ready to embrace a man with brown skin as its leader.” Trump’s victory in that state eight years later suggests a more ambiguous lesson, about how distance expands the possibilities of politics, for better and for worse — how a voter for whom black enfranchisement and banning Syrian refugees are equally abstract is equally prone to support either one on Election Day. But of course the consequences of elections are not always so abstract.</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":8, \"pNum\":8} --><p>Bill Hillsman didn’t support Trump — though, he told me, “at the beginning I was sort of interested in working with him.” He saw the Trump campaign as a logical extension of Ventura’s accomplishment, only Trump “did it on such a grand scale. It was seat-of-the-pants brilliant.” I asked him if it concerned him at all to see the trajectory that had started with Ventura — who preached a gruff message of tolerance during his campaign — end in Twitter memes about Auschwitz ovens and dark intimations of political violence. “Nobody knows what he’s going to do,” Hillsman said. “He doesn’t owe the Republican Party anything. Maybe this is all a big con, and he’ll do what he feels like doing. It could be nothing like what the Republicans expected.”</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":9, \"pNum\":9} --><p><em>Charles Homans is the politics editor for the magazine.</em></p>","scoop_slug":"donald-trumps-america-minnesota-jesse-ventura","promotional_media":100000004767694,"module_top":100000004767694,"modules_body":{"100000004767727":"LARGE"},"ad_frequency":"","ad_sizes":"","ad_adjacencies":"","ad_positions":""},"100000004764683":{"data_id":100000004764683,"print_headline":"South Carolina","headline":"How Do I Comfort My Frightened Son After the Election?

My grandparents, only a generation removed from enslavement and having witnessed the cruelty of this country’s racism daily, from the Whites Only signs that plagued pools and restaurants to the way they were forced to walk through their Southern world — eyes downcast from white folks, “Yes, ma’am” and “No, sir” more rule than reverence — knew that this was just where they were at this moment. Nothing surprised them. Nothing was shocking. They had seen black men hanging from trees, images of Emmett Till’s brutal beating, German shepherds unleashed on children, 6-year-old Ruby Bridges being spat on by grown white men and women. In all my childhood, I never heard my grandparents say that anything shocked or surprised them. They knew what their country was capable of.</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":1, \"pNum\":1} --><p>Still, our nights, spent on the front porch, were as sweet as the tea my grandmother made and filled with stories of their everyday living. While so many of the stories are long forgotten, what stays with me is the way they could take a bitter moment, lace it with a turn of phrase or cluck of the tongue and excavate humor. More than once I heard my grandmother say, “I’m laughing to keep from crying.” As a child, I didn’t know what that meant. I do now. In this way, my grandparents moved through the South, through the civil rights movement, through the country’s violent resistance to change, the rage of white people, the many deaths of black people. And like so many from their generation, they didn’t live to see the changes they had fought so hard for.</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":2, \"pNum\":2} --><p>My son is 8 years old.

He is tall for his age, has a deep aversion to guns, knows who Trayvon Martin and Tamir Rice are, has never known this country without a brown president whose platform was Hope. For my son, enormous change, up to this point, has been theoretical. He has always lived in his house, always been circled by the same big sister, parents, bevy of aunts and uncles and cousins. Walking toward a greater good has been drummed into his marrow. And as the numbers came in on election night I watched him head to his room, his head down, his shoulders curving into his chest. I saw my son bending against the shattered promises of not only his country but also his own family.</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":3, \"pNum\":3} --><p>When I was a child, we never began a meal without prayer. We thanked God for the food, for each other. My grandparents always ended the prayer with “And most of all, thank you for giving us all another day.” I didn’t understand the need to be thankful for being able to wake up and walk — however we were walking — through the world. But now I do. So each evening, before starting our meal, we say what we’re grateful for and what kind act we witnessed, were a part of. Some days, my son can come up with no more than “I was nice to Toffee,” our dog, and “I’m grateful for mashed potatoes.” We’ll take it, because we know he’s growing to understand that one of the many rules of life is kindness. But on election night, as my son headed downstairs, he was slowly beginning to understand new truths: that the people who love you cannot always protect you, that unkindness can be a platform for the presidency. That we can fight and write and teach and learn and hug away tears and bandage scraped knees and bring glasses of water into bedrooms at midnight but that this country is bigger than the beliefs of the family that loves him.</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":4, \"pNum\":4} --><p>“This wasn’t supposed to happen,” my son said, and I knew it would soon be time for him to know the deeper truths of this country. It would soon be time to tell him about what I saw this year: the Confederate flags in my own childhood home of South Carolina and in Alabama, Delaware, Pennsylvania, Mississippi, Virginia, Georgia — even in his home state of New York. It would soon be time to tell him that this country’s earliest history is one of unkindness. That the blood of his ancestors was expendable, priced along with stocks of cotton and gold. I knew the time was coming now, in the heart of his devastation and fear, with each question he asked — Will he really build a wall? Is he going to send my friends away? — to tell him that we as a people had not been meant to survive and yet we survived anyway. “You come from people who have always made a way out of no way,” I said as I rubbed his back. “We’ll get through.” And maybe both of us fell asleep believing this.</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":5, \"pNum\":5} --><p><em>Jacqueline Woodson is the author of more than two dozen books for adults and young people.

Yet as reports poured in about the historic number of Latinos lining up to vote early in Miami, I felt 100 percent certain that the state would remain blue. After all, Cuban-American members of Congress like Carlos Curbelo and Ileana Ros-Lehtinen had refused to endorse Trump. In October, following the “Access Hollywood” scandal, Ros-Lehtinen called on Trump to withdraw from the campaign. When Hillary Clinton appeared at a Miami concert with Jennifer Lopez and Marc Anthony, a stadium-size crowd showed up.</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":1, \"pNum\":1} --><p>So when Florida turned red, I was stunned — especially after I saw the demographic breakdowns. Nearly one in three Latino voters in Florida cast their ballots for Trump. According to a CNN and Latino Decisions exit poll, his support among Cuban-American voters was even higher: 54 percent. “Definitely there was a hidden, secret Latino vote,” Jorge Ramos, the Univision news anchor, told me. “We’re seeing a new divide within the Hispanic community. The wall that Trump was talking about is clearly apparent now within the Hispanic community.”</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":2, \"pNum\":2} --><p>This pro-Trump vote didn’t feel quite as secret to Roberto Rodríguez Tejera. Every day, he told me, people called into to his South Florida Spanish-language talk-radio show, “Contacto Directo,” to express their support for Trump. Rural white voters, he explained, aren’t the only ones frightened by the specter of feminism, Muslim immigrants and L.G.B.T. rights. “For many Hispanic Americans, the cultural changes of the past 15 years have been very hard. Trump, for many, is a return to the mother’s womb.”</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":3, \"pNum\":3} --><p>While a clear majority of the state’s Latinos cast their votes for Clinton, plenty of others responded to Trump’s hostility toward undocumented immigrants. Every day “Contacto Directo” got versions of the same complaints from listeners: <em>I waited so many years to be allowed to enter the United States; why should others get amnesty? I finally have my work permit; I don’t want an undocumented person to take my job for less money.</em> “Maybe they’re even from the same country,” Rodríguez Tejera notes. Nationally, Pew Research Center reports that roughly a quarter of Hispanics favor building that big, beautiful wall.</p><!--NYTREF {[\"region\":\"Embedded\", \"id\":\"100000004767719\", \"dropzone\":4, \"pNum\":4]} --><p>According to Helen Marrow, a sociologist at Tufts University who specializes in Latino immigration to the rural South, people of similar ethnicity are the ones most likely to feel the negative impact of undocumented immigration. Mexican or Central Americans who cross the border without papers are more likely to take jobs from their compatriots than from non-Hispanic whites. And when “racialized nativism” rears its head, Latino citizens and legal residents tend to suffer its effects — provoking some to adopt a strategy of ethnic “distancing.”</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":5, \"pNum\":5} --><p>Some Florida Latinos who voted for Trump may have had other reasons entirely. Over the years, registered Latinos have told pollsters again and again that immigration is not their top concern. What they care about most are jobs, education, health care and terrorism. In Florida, Obama’s recent changes to America’s relations with Cuba — changes that Clinton pledged to uphold — may have proved particularly toxic. On Nov. 2, The Miami Herald even predicted that Trump might take the state, because Obama’s Cuba policies “have probably pushed many undecided Cuban-Americans in Florida to vote for Trump.”</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":6, \"pNum\":6} --><p>Trump had shrewdly taken advantage of this opening, promising to reinstate the embargo unless the Castro government guaranteed “religious and political freedom for the Cuban people and the freeing of political prisoners.” In October, the veterans of the 1961 Bay of Pigs invasion, which tried to overthrow the Castro regime, rewarded Trump by unanimously voting to give him their first presidential endorsement. One prominent Cuban-American in Florida told me that the Cuban vote for Trump wasn’t necessarily a pro-Trump or an anti-Clinton verdict. It may have simply been anti-Castro. Members of Congress who opposed Trump and also opposed Obama’s Cuban strategy, like Ros-Lehtinen and Rubio, were re-elected by comfortable margins.</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":7, \"pNum\":7} --><p>“What I think this makes clear is that the Cuban vote is even more important because it’s a swing vote,” the political consultant and pollster Fernand Amandi says. “It’s neither monolithically Republican or Democratic.” In his own family, eight relatives voted for Obama in 2012; this year, five of them voted for Trump. But the reason Amandi gave me for their switch sounds rather more familiar: These relatives regarded Trump as “a hand grenade to a political system that they saw as being ineffective and out of touch.”</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":8, \"pNum\":8} --><p><em>Marcela Valdes is a writer based in Maryland.

The town of 2,000, which is almost entirely white, is the starting point for a picturesque train ride into the Pocono Mountains. It has five churches and a median household income of about $77,000.</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":2, \"pNum\":2} --><p>Hillary Clinton’s father grew up about a dozen miles from here, in the county seat of Scranton. As she mentioned many times on the campaign trail, he owned a drape store. Frable’s father was a butcher in a grocery opened by her grandfather, an immigrant from Italy. Her father served as a medic in World War II, and then worked for the Amalgamated Meat Cutters union. He and Frable’s mother, a registered nurse, voted for Democrats for president, until they supported Ronald Reagan in 1980 and never looked back.</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":3, \"pNum\":3} --><p>If Frable’s parents were lost to Hillary Clinton’s party decades ago, she and her daughters represent a different kind of Hillary heartbreak. Frable has voted for several Democratic candidates for governor and other offices over the years, and this is the eastern edge of a region, stretching to Wisconsin, that seemed like fertile Clinton territory. She actually beat Trump in Lackawanna County but just barely, with under 50 percent of the vote, compared with Barack Obama’s 63 percent. Clinton also lost white women by three crucial points in Pennsylvania. The Frables help explain why. The three women are college-educated or college-bound, and they voted for Trump not because they feel left behind but to improve economic opportunity, as they see it.</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":4, \"pNum\":4} --><p>For this cohort, the concern isn’t necessarily their own finances. “My life wouldn’t change either way,” Frable said about the material difference between a Clinton and Trump presidency. “I don’t think my taxes will be better or worse with one or the other.” But she felt confident that her children will find better jobs after college with Trump in office, and she talked with longing about his promise to restore jobs, like one she remembers a friend of her father’s had, working in an auto factory in Detroit. “If we could have export agreements with, say, France or Germany, or let’s face it, Russia, they would take our quality goods and we could be great again,” Frable said.</p><!--NYTREF {[\"region\":\"Embedded\", \"id\":\"100000004767746\", \"dropzone\":5, \"pNum\":5]} --><p>All of this — along with other items on the Trump “wish list,” as Frable put it, like defeating ISIS and cracking down on border security — matters far more to her than anything Trump said about women or was accused of doing to them.

Frable also admires Ivanka Trump and felt she was one of the campaign’s “top three assets.” She sees Ivanka as a role model for Abigail in her own entrepreneurial interests. It’s not Hillary’s “Gloria Steinem feminism,” as Frable put it, that she values. It’s Ivanka’s sleek version of female success, which commentators have labeled “commodity feminism” — branding to sell products. “I’ve been paid the same as men, I’ve managed men,” Frable said. “I’ve not had any trouble working with men.” For Trump supporters that I talked to, college education didn’t seem to lead to support for the liberal women’s movement. Frable and her daughters oppose abortion as Christians.

Wade.</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":8, \"pNum\":8} --><p>Frable has close friends and clients who are ardent Hillary supporters, but she discounts the despairing social-media posts she has seen about women who didn’t support Clinton’s historic candidacy.

If voters in this overwhelmingly white, rural state could cast their ballots for a black man as president, then perhaps it was possible for the entire nation to do what had never been done; perhaps America had turned far enough away from its racist past that skin color was no longer a barrier to the highest office of the land. In the months that followed, as Obama racked up primary victories, not just in the expected cities but also in largely white Rust Belt towns and farming communities, it seemed evidence for many Americans that the nation had finally become “post-racial.”<br></p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":1, \"pNum\":1} --><p>Of course, that post-racial dream did not last long, and nothing epitomizes the naïveté of that belief more than the election last week of Donald J.

Why had states that reliably backed Obama — states like Iowa, Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania — flipped Republican?</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":2, \"pNum\":2} --><p>I was struck by how quickly white pundits sought to tamp down assertions that race had anything to do with it. It was, it seemed to me, almost a relief to many white Americans that Trump’s victory encompassed so many of the heavily white places that voted for a black man just years before. It was an absolution that let them reassure themselves that Donald Trump’s raucous campaign hadn’t revealed an ugly racist rift after all, that in the end, the discontent that propelled the reality-TV star into the White House was one of class and economic anxiety, not racism.</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":3, \"pNum\":3} --><p>But this analysis reveals less about the electorate than it does about the consistent inability of many white Americans to think about and understand the complex and often contradictory workings of race in this country, and to discuss and elucidate race in a sophisticated, nuanced way.</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":4, \"pNum\":4} --><p>While we tend to talk about racism in absolute terms — you’re either racist or you’re not — racism and racial anxiety have always existed on a spectrum. For historians who have studied race in the United States, the change from blue to red in heavily white areas is not surprising. In fact, it was entirely predictable. “There are times when working-class whites, whether rural or urban, will join an interracial alliance to get the short-term gains they want,” Robin Kelley, a history professor at U.C.L.A., told me. “They don’t ever do it without kicking and screaming.”</p><!--NYTREF {[\"region\":\"Embedded\", \"id\":\"100000004767702\", \"dropzone\":5, \"pNum\":5]} --><p>To understand how all these heavily white Iowa counties went for Obama, we must look back to 2008. After eight years of Republican rule, with the economy in a tailspin, white people were suffering through the sort of disastrous unemployment rates that usually only black Americans face. It has been called the worst recession since <a href=\"http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/g/great_depression_1930s/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier\" title=\"Recent and archival news about the Great Depression.\" class=\"meta-classifier\">the Great Depression</a>. Obama’s message of hope, that Americans of all stripes were in this thing together, along with his promises to go after the banks and Wall Street types that had caused the disaster, struck a chord across political parties.

Jesse Jackson, the first black man to run for president (and second black American, behind Shirley Chisholm), made similar inroads with rural white farmers during his 1984 and 1988 campaigns. This was simply because he reached out to them promising to push policies that would specifically help them, like ending foreclosures on family farms and forgiving their debt. He did not get a majority of this vote, but he got a surprisingly significant portion.</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":7, \"pNum\":7} --><p>Decades later, large numbers of rural and suburban white voters were willing to cast their lot with Obama and his multiracial coalition — not necessarily out of some sense of racial enlightenment or egalitarianism but because at the time, they saw it as being in their own best interest. Class and economic anxieties did not erase racial ones; they just in that moment transcended them.</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":8, \"pNum\":8} --><p><strong>Much has changed</strong> in the country since the desperate days of 2008, and while Obama carried more than half of Iowa’s 99 counties that year, last week Clinton only carried six. I talked to several white Iowans, many of them lifelong Democrats, who had voted for Obama at least once. They said they believed in unions and social programs to help the needy. They believed in the concept of racial equality, in the sense that all people should have the same opportunities. But in recent years, they had come to feel at odds with their party; it no longer reflected their own cultural norms.

But Obama really turned her off when after a vigilante killed a black teenager named Trayvon Martin, he said the boy could have been his son. She felt as if Obama was choosing a side in the racial divide, stirring up tensions. And then came the death of Michael Brown, shot by a policeman in Ferguson, Mo.</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":14, \"pNum\":14} --><p>“I’m not saying that the struggles of black Americans aren’t real,” Douglas told me, “but I feel like the Michael Brown incident was violence against the police officer.”</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":15, \"pNum\":15} --><p>The Black Lives Matter movement bothered her. Even as an Ivy League-educated, glamorous black couple lived in the White House, masses of black people were blocking highways and staging die-ins in malls, claiming that black people had it so hard. When she voiced her discomfort with that movement, she said, or pointed out that she disagreed with Obama’s policies, some of her more liberal friends on Facebook would call her racist. So, she shut her mouth — and simmered.</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":16, \"pNum\":16} --><p><strong>Trump clearly sensed </strong>the fragility of the coalition that Obama put together — that the president's support in heavily white areas was built not on racial egalitarianism but on a feeling of self-interest. Many white Americans were no longer feeling that belonging to this coalition benefited them. A recent study by sociologists from Harvard and Tufts found that white Americans believed that they experienced more discrimination than black Americans. Trump spoke openly to those Americans, articulating what many Iowans felt but could never say. It was liberating.</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":17, \"pNum\":17} --><p>“Trump was crass, and he was abrupt,” Douglas said. “But I felt like he was going to take care of the things that mattered for me, and honestly I was very worried about our country.”</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":18, \"pNum\":18} --><p>There has never been a moment in America in which black people’s gains have not been perceived by some white Americans as their loss. And history is littered with examples of how economic and racial anxieties can create a wedge with which to destroy interracial political and economic alliances. White supremacists overthrew the biracial fusion party in North Carolina in the late 1800s and, with the support of the white population in the state that had once supported the sharing of power, worked to disenfranchise black North Carolinians and usher in seven decades of Jim Crow. In more modern times, George Wallace was roundly trounced when he ran for governor of Alabama against a racist opponent. Wallace, who had promised “to treat a man fair, regardless of his color,” vowed to never be “out-niggered” again. The next election he rode a segregationist platform right into the governor’s mansion. Similarly, Richard Nixon ran for president the first time as a moderate and lost, but he later found his opening courting white opposition to civil rights with his Southern strategy. It is not incidental that John McCain and Mitt Romney mostly declined to stir up racial tensions in their campaigns against Obama and lost.</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":19, \"pNum\":19} --><p>When Trump inveighed against Mexican rapists and talked of barring Muslims from the country, the baldness of his rhetoric spoke to something deeply seated in the Iowans I talked to. Erin Wright, who worked for the state before quitting to finish a nursing degree, voted for Obama in 2008, and doesn’t remember if she voted at all in 2012; she cast her ballot for Trump last week. Like Douglas, she wasn’t struggling financially but was attracted to Trump’s promise to seal our southern borders and to bar Muslims from entering the country.</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":20, \"pNum\":20} --><p>“There’s a lot of illegal people here, who do take work,” she said. “If they want to become a citizen, that is super, they should become a citizen. But all the influx of people who come in, they get benefits, they get jobs, and they take them from people who can’t find anything else who have lived here their whole lives.”</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":21, \"pNum\":21} --><p>What’s missing from the American conversation on race is the fact that people don’t have to hate black people or Muslims or Latinos to be uncomfortable with them, to be suspicious of them, to fear their ascension as an upheaval of the natural order of things. A smart demagogue plays to those fears under the guise of economic anxieties. Things not as good as you hoped? These folks are the reason. Kelley, the historian, said white Americans have ignored race when it serves them and defaulted to it when it suits them. “We think of interest as an objective thing that floats above, but it is subjective,” he said. “Race always plays a role. It never disappears.”</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":22, \"pNum\":22} --><p>The miracle Obama worked in 2008 and 2012 was to stitch together, at least in part, the racial lines that have always fractured this country. What we saw last week was those lines being torn apart again.</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":23, \"pNum\":23} --><p><em>Nikole Hannah-Jones is a staff writer for the magazine.

They were looking for answers to a series of questions encapsulated in this week’s cover image, the title of Woody Guthrie’s famous song, “This Land Is Your Land,” with the words “his” and “our” highlighted within the phrase. It was a way of suggesting some of the uncertainties Americans woke up to on the morning of Nov. 9: Is this land his land? Is it our land? Is it yours? Is it mine? Rarely have the tensions among these pronouns been so pronounced. Our correspondents reported from various states of the union, some that played an important role in the outcome, some that were not closely fought, some whose own history might be used as a guide. The photographers, with one exception, shot all their pictures on Thursday, Nov. 10, as a new political reality was setting in. The writers took their soundings last week, too, though many have deep roots in the states they covered. They returned with a portrait of a country at odds with itself; as Michael Paterniti wrote about Maine, “We remain many chaotic minds at once, a cacophony that sometimes resolves to symphony and then distortion again.”</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":1, \"pNum\":1} --><p><em><strong>–JAKE SILVERSTEIN</strong></em></p>","scoop_slug":"reflections-from-donald-trumps-america","promotional_media":100000004767466,"module_top":100000004767482,"modules_body":{},"ad_frequency":"","ad_sizes":"","ad_adjacencies":"","ad_positions":""},"100000004767637":{"data_id":100000004767637,"print_headline":"New Hampshire","headline":"It All Started Here","summary":"In New Hampshire, where Trump fever took hold in the first primary and never let go.","byline":"By RUTH GRAHAM","byline_prefix":"By","authors":["Ruth Graham"],"kicker":"Feature","body":"<p><strong>‘I wonder what</strong> our boy Donald is gonna do,” a middle-aged man in a worn blue vest said to a friend the other day at Bradford Junction, a diner in central New Hampshire. “I just hope he doesn’t take it out on New Hampshire,” the other man replied. Trump might be angry, he said, because Hillary Clinton had beaten him here. But no, they decided, he wouldn’t carry a grudge.</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":1, \"pNum\":1} --><p>He shouldn’t, anyway. Trump’s 20-point victory in the nation’s first primary here in February was one of the first signs that his candidacy was no short-lived stunt. “New Hampshire, I want to thank you,” Trump told the enraptured audience in his victory speech. “You started it. Remember, you started it.” He lost to Ted Cruz in Iowa the week before, and New Hampshire’s cozy Republican establishment had shunned him. But voters here saw something special in Trump.</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":2, \"pNum\":2} --><p>In places like blue-collar Bradford (pop. 1,650), they still do. Trump frenzy gripped this part of New Hampshire for more than a year. Every day I drove past banners stretched between porch pillars, flags hung on swinging front gates, huge posters stuck in lawns and propped against trees and embellished with American flags. Out on Route 103, someone hand-painted a stylish glossy “TRUMP” on plywood months ago, surrounded by a dozen smaller standard-issue yard signs from the campaign. Clinton may have scraped together the most votes statewide, but the sustained enthusiasm and creativity of Trump’s fans here should have been a sign of things to come.</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":3, \"pNum\":3} --><p>At Bradford Junction, Mike Hurley took a seat at the bar. Hurley is 67, and he works just down the road at the Lumber Barn. “America needs to change,” he said. That’s why he voted for Trump, in both the primary and the general election. Kyla Hamel, a waitress, heard us talking and came over to show me a photo of her young son beaming in a Trump T-shirt and a “Make America Great Again” hat. “He can make a change,” she said. “What’s the harm in trying?”</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":4, \"pNum\":4} --><p>A better question is what, exactly, needs to change here. When I pressed the Trump supporters at Bradford Junction if they, personally, had felt pressures from immigration or a decline in manufacturing or anything else, they said no, not exactly. Hamel works full time, and her boyfriend (who voted for Obama, but for Trump this year) is a truck driver who considers himself financially secure. The man in the blue vest, who refused to tell me his name, is comfortably retired from his job as a design engineer. The unemployment rate in New Hampshire is 3 percent, and the college education rate is high.</p><!--NYTREF {[\"region\":\"Embedded\", \"id\":\"100000004767764\", \"dropzone\":5, \"pNum\":5]} --><p>But everyone has a sense that things are heading in the wrong direction, and that young people are a big part of the problem. The conversation drifted to the “‘out of control” welfare system. “They get everything handed to them,” Hamel said. “Food, insurance, housing, everything. And they drive better vehicles than I do.” She knows a couple, she said, in which the boyfriend quit his job to ensure their income remained low enough to qualify for food stamps. “This is this generation’s mind-set,” she said. “My biggest bill is food for my family. It’s a huge expense, but they think of it as ‘Well, we don’t pay for it.’ ” Hurley nodded along. College today isn’t like it used to be, he said. Students nowadays spend too much time “talking politics and everything else,” and they supported Clinton (and before her, Bernie Sanders) because they just wanted free tuition.</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":6, \"pNum\":6} --><p>By now, Hamel’s 78-year-old father, Ed Knight, had come out from the kitchen to talk. He has owned Bradford Junction for 28 years, and he voted for Trump in part because “he seems like a decent guy.” Among other things, he was annoyed by a story he had heard about Sasha Obama having a summer job that lasted only a week. The protesters who had come out in cities and on college campuses to lament Trump’s election? Probably homeless, or “the handout people.” The main problem was just how bad things had become. Not for Knight himself — he’s doing fine — but for lots of other older people.</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":7, \"pNum\":7} --><p>The population of New Hampshire is 94 percent white and aging. Plenty of rural residents will tell you they moved here to get away from the big city — Boston, often, or even Manchester or Concord. At Bradford Junction, the waitress will call you “hon,” and a platter of pancakes, eggs, bacon, sausage, ham and home fries costs $3.95. People here say they voted for change. But maybe what they really want is for nothing to change at all.</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":8, \"pNum\":8} --><p><em>Ruth Graham is a contributing writer at Slate.</em></p>","scoop_slug":"donald-trumps-america-new-hampshire","promotional_media":100000004767885,"module_top":100000004767885,"modules_body":{"100000004767764":"LARGE"},"ad_frequency":"","ad_sizes":"","ad_adjacencies":"","ad_positions":""}}; });

He was a Trump supporter. ‘I could see this country go back to its grass roots, even if it went all the way to revolution,’ he told me, ‘I’d be standing on that front line.’” Nov. 10, 2016</p>","credit":"Photograph by Alec Soth ","src":"https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/11/20/magazine/20electionphotos8/20electionphotos8-master180.jpg","src_pattern":"https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/11/20/magazine/20electionphotos8/20electionphotos8-{{size}}.jpg","src_widths":[{"size":495,"slug":"master495"},{"size":675,"slug":"master675"},{"size":768,"slug":"master768"},{"size":1050,"slug":"master1050"},{"size":1684,"slug":"superJumbo"}],"src_ratio":1.2166666666666666,"src_social":{"height":1024,"width":842,"url":"https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/11/20/magazine/20electionphotos8/20electionphotos8-jumbo.jpg"},"src_facebook":{"height":549,"width":1050,"url":"https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/11/20/magazine/20electionphotos8/20electionphotos8-facebookJumbo.jpg"},"src_twitter":{"height":899,"width":1600,"url":"https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/11/20/magazine/20electionphotos8/20electionphotos8-videoSixteenByNineJumbo1600.jpg"},"style":"lede"},"100000004769205":{"data_id":100000004769205,"data_type":"image","caption":"<strong>Texas</strong>\n<p>“Her name is Afiwa.
