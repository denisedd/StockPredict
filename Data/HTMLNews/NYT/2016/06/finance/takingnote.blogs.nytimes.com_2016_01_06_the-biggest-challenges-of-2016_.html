<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">At the end of 2015, we asked what you felt was the greatest challenge facing the United States in the coming year. Over a thousand readers responded, and while their answers varied widely, a few common themes emerged. Below are some of the issues readers brought up the most frequently:</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody"><strong>Climate change </strong></p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody"><a href="//takingnote.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/12/30/what-is-the-biggest-challenge-america-faces-in-2016/#permid=17079166">Stephen Woolpert</a>, Berkeley:</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">The climate crisis dwarfs all other issues. Climate change has put weather on steroids. The oceans are becoming acidified. The adverse consequences are already having a disparate impact on the poor. And it will only get worse. We need to use less energy, replace fossil fuels with renewable energy (like wind and solar) for our remaining energy needs, and adopt land use practices that stop deforestation and unsustainable agriculture. Even if we stopped all carbon pollution today, impacts would continue to increase for some time due to the time lag in our climate system. It is important that we both move to eliminate fossil fuels, and begin to prepare for the impacts we canât avoid through smarter planning and actions to improve the resilience of communities to stronger and more frequent storms, droughts, heat waves and sea level rise.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody"><a href="//takingnote.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/12/30/what-is-the-biggest-challenge-america-faces-in-2016/#permid=17090194">Wharton</a>, Chicago:</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">The biggest challenge faced by America in 2016 is that of moving our energy use away from fossil fuels in order to address climate change.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">There is overwhelming scientific consensus that the increase in atmospheric greenhouse gases due to use of fossil fuels is warming earthâs climate, and will result in sea level rise, loss of agricultural areas and increasingly severe weather events. The challenge is to create the political will to take aggressive action consistent with this knowledge by reducing our reliance on fossil fuels.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">The EPAâs Clean Power Plan, and recent Paris agreement are steps in the right direction, but arenât sufficient to put us on a safe path. We can achieve a greater reduction of carbon emissions by creating incentives which work throughout the economy to encourage conservation and a shift to low-carbon energy. Incentives such as a tax on fossil carbon can accomplish this without damaging the economy, if carbon-tax revenues are returned to households, for example as a dividend similar to a tax refund.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody"><a href="//takingnote.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/12/30/what-is-the-biggest-challenge-america-faces-in-2016/#permid=17081225">Douglas McLane</a>, Plymouth, N.H.:</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">As Bernie Sanders so simply said in the debate, âTerrorism canât bring down our civilization, but climate change can.â</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody"><strong>Money in politics</strong></p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody"><a href="//takingnote.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/12/30/what-is-the-biggest-challenge-america-faces-in-2016/#permid=17092046">Jefflz</a>, San Francisco:</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">The biggest problem the United States faces in 2016 is the restoration of a constitutional democracy run by the people and for the people. We are on a slippery slope where gerrymandering, voter suppression and above all, limitless dark money in elections, has placed our country in the hands of a powerful ruling oligarchy. If any of the G.O.P. candidates is elected in 2016, through subsequent appointments, the Supreme Court will become an even more powerful tool of corporations and the super-rich. America will definitely continue on an irreversible slide into corporate fascism.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody"><a href="//takingnote.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/12/30/what-is-the-biggest-challenge-america-faces-in-2016/#permid=17080576">Blue state</a>:</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">There are many important issues (guns, terrorism, climate change, labor, immigration, globalization, infrastructure, defense, investment, taxation, healthcare, education, research) but they are all at the mercy of campaign finance reform. Fix the fixing of elections by the wealthy and corporations, and we can fix anything.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody"><strong>Education</strong></p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody"><a href="//takingnote.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/12/30/what-is-the-biggest-challenge-america-faces-in-2016/#permid=17087913">DC Smith</a>, Pennsylvania:</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">The greatest challenge is to change our educational system so that it encourages and teaches critical thinking, the evaluation of claims and evidence, and the understanding of logical argument. American citizens could then understand the evidence for and consequences of global climate change, understand other cultures and their values, and understand how to evaluate candidatesâ and legislatorsâ claims and lies. We could then move beyond ignorance and hatred to empathy, compassion, and more active participation in ridding ourselves of injustice and inequality.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody"><a href="//takingnote.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/12/30/what-is-the-biggest-challenge-america-faces-in-2016/#permid=17095848">Adrian</a>, Cincinnati:</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Education reform â not just in 2016, but in every year. If weâre really serious about giving every child an opportunity in this country, then we will work to have quality education â good teachers, adequate resources, diverse classes â available to all communities. This should require creative solutions, maybe more charter schools, or integration policies between districts, and above all, a greater commitment to change. It is a tragedy that with every passing year, more and more kids go through the American school system with a semblance of an education and little opportunity to attain more.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody"><a href="//takingnote.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/12/30/what-is-the-biggest-challenge-america-faces-in-2016/#permid=17079040">Meredith</a>, Massachusetts:</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Americaâs biggest challenge is our shortfall in civic education. Its absence and the resulting dysfunction make us more vulnerable to every foreign and domestic threat. The whole country, from Senators to voters to candidates, needs remedial classes in basic governance. This lack of understanding leads to disappointment, a sense of betrayal, powerlessness and cynicism. Congress is certainly not modeling good government, but I suspect the uninformed electorate, lacking the information to direct its outrage, helps perpetuate the problem.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Some years ago the teaching of Civics (how-a-bill-becomes-a-law, the balance of powers, and the basics of the electoral process) as a required course was ended. It was supposed to be integrated into other classes, but in many cases was simply set aside. The right and duty of every citizen to know about our government, to engage is the civil process and to vote needs to be elevated again. Oh where are those 7th grade civics teachers of my youth?</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody"><strong>Polarization</strong></p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody"><a href="//takingnote.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/12/30/what-is-the-biggest-challenge-america-faces-in-2016/#permid=17091721">Matt W</a>, Yardley:</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Our own culture of divisiveness is our biggest challenge. Tragically, this self-inflicted problem prevents us from dealing effectively with any of our other challenges (climate change, race relations, income inequality, Middle East Policy, declining infrastructure, underfunded basic science, etc., etc, etc.).</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody"><a href="//takingnote.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/12/30/what-is-the-biggest-challenge-america-faces-in-2016/#permid=17091829">Nancy2431</a>, Boomer, N.C.:</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">The biggest threat to the United States is âa house divided against itself cannot stand.â The poisonous political state this country has seen develop over the past ten years or so has caused almost a standstill for economic and social growth. There are too many people with anti-attitudes about immigrants, social reforms, and economic disadvantages for the working class. People seem to be turning on each other instead of embracing what has made our country great over the centuries. We should be past the hate mongers, but weâre far from it. In fact, it seems to be getting worse.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody"><a href="//takingnote.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/12/30/what-is-the-biggest-challenge-america-faces-in-2016/#permid=17078417">Alec MacLeod</a>,Â Oakland:</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">The greatest challenge that U.S. society faces is the loss of capacity for meaningful national dialogue. As greater numbers of citizens lose their trust not just in institutions from government health agencies to grounded journalism, we seem to become more focused on truthiness than on a skeptical relationship with reliable data. If we cannot even agree on basic facts and reasonable scientific hypotheses (such as climate change), finding ways to take meaningful action becomes increasingly difficult.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">As someone who grew up in a tiny politically conservative agricultural community who now lives in a politically liberal urban area, I have friends on varying sides of these epistemological divides. I experience ever widening gaps as I navigate these relationships.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody"><strong>Inequality</strong></p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody"><a href="//takingnote.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/12/30/what-is-the-biggest-challenge-america-faces-in-2016/#permid=17081261">Sharmila Mukherjee</a>:</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">The widening disparity between the rich and the poor, with the shrinking of the middle class is a challenge that might just tear into the democratic fabric of America. Historically, America has rarely been threatened by the specter of inequality of this magnitude.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody"><a href="//takingnote.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/12/30/what-is-the-biggest-challenge-america-faces-in-2016/#permid=17080512">Donald Seekins</a>, Waipahu, Hawaii:</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">The biggest challenge facing the United States in 2016 is social and economic inequality and how to narrow the gap between rich and poor. The way American institutions are performing now (for example, the education system from kindergarten to university, the tax system, the impoverished public sector, our social and religious values) we will soon arrive at a caste system in which reform will be impossible and America will become a very different country.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody"><a href="//takingnote.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/12/30/what-is-the-biggest-challenge-america-faces-in-2016/#permid=17078996">Kingfish52</a>,Â Collbran, Colo.:</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">The biggest threat facing the United States in 2016 is the same one thatâs faced us for almost four decades: Class warfare by the wealthy on the working class. Bernie Sanders understands this, while none of the other candidates do.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">We are watching the elimination of our middle class without a shot fired. We are on a steady march towards another era of the Robber Barons where there will be just two classes: rich and poor, and with the majority of Americans having less money, who will provide the fuel for our consumer-driven economy? And what will happen to our tax revenues? And then how will we service our debt to creditors like China and others? Most empires fail within before they fail to external enemies, and unless we reverse this war on the working class by our oligarchy, our empire will fail too.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Though the concerns above came up frequently, they were far from the only ones readers mentioned. Below, a sampling of other readersâ thoughts on the year ahead:</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody"><a href="//takingnote.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/12/30/what-is-the-biggest-challenge-america-faces-in-2016/#permid=17082714">Joel</a>, Miami Beach:</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Reducing gun violence. About 90 Americans die every DAY from homicide, suicide, and accidents with guns. This dwarfs that of every other developed country. The proliferation of guns is a big reason for this (yes there are other factors too). Despite the fact that most Americans want sensible and enforceable gun laws, Congress refuses to act â because of the NRA and their ilk. This cannot be blamed on Citizens United, because it isnât the money â itâs the political will of a determined few against the apathy of the many. Until Americans stand up (at the ballot box, statehouse, and Congress), they will continue to be injured and killed by guns at theaters, schools, their own homes, and virtually anywhere. We must care enough about our fellow Americans to stop this national suicide.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody"><a href="//takingnote.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/12/30/what-is-the-biggest-challenge-america-faces-in-2016/#permid=17078561">MIMA</a>:</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">The biggest challenge America faces in 2016: getting people out to vote.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">We are faced with opportunities to make a difference in various aspects of making our votes count in 2016. The person who is elected to president will no doubt in their tenure have the responsibility to choose and appoint a Supreme Court Justice. There are many ramifications from this choice â womenâs reproductive rights, health care opportunities, just election rights, civil rights.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">People, such as in Wisconsin, have been shown that elections have consequences. Our state was lax in voting. We have been left with government leaders who have taken away jurisdiction over open records, voting, court actions, environmental issues, health care benefits, educational opportunities, workplace statues â many aspects of our every day living that used to be taken for granted. Perhaps through this turmoil, citizens will realize yes, their votes do make a difference â and even more, the lack of their votes makes a huge difference.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody"><a href="//takingnote.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/12/30/what-is-the-biggest-challenge-america-faces-in-2016/#permid=17083890">Rima Tutunji</a>,Â Annapolis, Md.:</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Racism, in all its aspects and manifestations. Implicit racism affects relationships and interactions among people and within communities. Although different ethnic groups experience the negative effects of racism in different degrees and intensities, whenever incidents occur that are horrific or even simply incompatible with what we consider to be commensurate with our American values, it plays a role in virtually every social conflict in the U.S. We need to confront racism openly, honestly and with as much integrity as we can muster. Maybe we can then deal with manifest discrimination.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody"><a href="//takingnote.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/12/30/what-is-the-biggest-challenge-america-faces-in-2016/#permid=17078823">William E. Dove</a>,Â Lake Martin, Ala.:</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">A federal national debt of $20 trillion with no meaningful plan of repayment is a national disgrace. Both parties are to blame. As interest rate rise, the cost of this debt will further squeeze the federal budget for years to come. Just ridiculous. We must cut current spending or raise taxes and embark on a meaningful plan of repayment.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody"><a href="//takingnote.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/12/30/what-is-the-biggest-challenge-america-faces-in-2016/#permid=17078494">CW13</a>,Â Blacksburg:</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Our biggest challenge will be resisting the urge to panic. Terrorists will inevitably strike somewhere, sometime, more than once. We will require calm and resolve, not politicians who seek advantage by scaring us to death, nor public officials who, good intentions aside, cannot display empathy. Never have Franklin Rooseveltâs words, âwe have nothing to fear but fear itself,â seemed wiser. We have, of course, much more to fear, but fear itself is likely to be the worst danger.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody"><a href="//takingnote.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/12/30/what-is-the-biggest-challenge-america-faces-in-2016/#permid=17082104">A. Stanton</a>, Dallas, Tex.:</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Overcoming the widespread ideas that rich people are the root of all evil and that more government is the answer to our problems would be at the top of my list.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody"><a href="//takingnote.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/12/30/what-is-the-biggest-challenge-america-faces-in-2016/#permid=17076645">Bigsister</a>, New York City:</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Right now the biggest challenge is to elect a president who can be trusted to lead this nation with competence â someone who is rational, sane, level-headed, open-minded â no cronyism, no ego trips.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody"><a href="//takingnote.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/12/30/what-is-the-biggest-challenge-america-faces-in-2016/#permid=17085353">Anne Russell</a>, Wilmington, N.C.:</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">The greatest challenge is designing a work/home environment in which both mothers and fathers may earn a living and take care of their children and domestic life as a family. The old 40-hour work week model, in which fathers brought home the bacon while dependent-spouse mothers fried it up in a pan, is passÃ©. Children need to be nurtured by both parents, and females as well as males need to earn our keep and use our talents and skills in the marketplace.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody"><a href="//takingnote.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/12/30/what-is-the-biggest-challenge-america-faces-in-2016/#permid=17076537">James J. Ritchie</a>, Sandy Hook, Conn.:</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">In my view the biggest challenge that we face is restoration of our faith in the American way of life. We need to restore our pride in America and our can do ways. We need to restore our confidence in our ability to lead. We need to embrace our emerging diversity as a strength. We need to confidently look to the future and our place in that future. We need to reject talk of fear and rejoice in our ability to confront the overcome the challenges that we will face in the days ahead. As a country we are too good, too strong, too wise to give in to defeatism and negativity. As a country we have been blessed; letâs use our blessing to return with strength and confidence to our place as a model for others to emulate.</p>
