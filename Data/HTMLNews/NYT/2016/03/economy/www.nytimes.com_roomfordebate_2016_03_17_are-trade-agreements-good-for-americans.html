          <p class="nytint-byline">Jeffrey J. Schott <span class="pubdate">  3:20 AM</span></p>

        <img alt="Jeffrey_schott-thumbstandard" class="nytint-mugshot" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/03/11/opinion/Jeffrey_Schott/Jeffrey_Schott-thumbStandard.jpg" />

        <p>Trade has become an increasingly important part of the United States economy. In the 1960s, exports and imports represented less than 10 percent of U.S. gross domestic product; today the share is closer to 30 percent. As a result, American  exporters sell more U.S. goods abroad than ever before — and imports give American  consumers more choices at lower prices. Americans have higher living standards because trade enables them to afford more goods.</p>

<p>Trade benefits consumers in other ways — many of the products that are produced in the United States are cheaper and better because they have imported components and raw materials, improving their quality and lowering their cost. Trade thus boosts the competitiveness of products made at home, which, in turn, allows American  producers to sell more abroad and employ more workers in the U.S.</p>

<p>For the United States, trade agreements open markets abroad without significant changes in current U.S. trade restrictions. That is because with few exceptions, U.S. trade barriers are already low and U.S. regulatory requirements protecting consumers, workers and the environment are high. Almost all our trading partners have higher barriers; trade negotiations are largely about how much and how fast they will change their practices, upgrade their regulatory standards toward U.S. norms and open their markets to new competition from the United States and other countries. From the U.S. perspective, the benefits are straightforward. We get more access abroad to sell our competitive farm products, manufactured items and services.</p>

<div class="w190 right module"><div class="entry"><blockquote>Yes, trade deals can displace some workers from their current jobs but on balance, trade pacts create better and higher paying jobs than the ones displaced.</blockquote></div></div>

<p>Why do other countries accept such "unbalanced" deals? Because trade pacts require them to undertake domestic policy reforms that they need to do in any event to boost productivity and growth in their economies. Often those countries find it easier to pursue necessary but politically contentious reforms as part of an international accord in which they receive other economic and political benefits. </p>

<p>Trade pacts reinforce U.S. political and strategic interests beyond the gains in commercial ties. Recall that the first U.S. free trade pact was in 1985 with Israel, and it is a cornerstone of the U.S.-Israel relationship.  The Trans-Pacific Partnership will similarly cement American ties with the Asia-Pacific region.  It reassures our allies that the United States is a reliable partner that remains engaged in a region facing North Korean adventurism.</p>

<p>To say that trade agreements are good for America doesn’t mean that they benefit all Americans.  Some firms can take advantage of the new opportunities and others suffer from increased competition.  Yes, trade deals can displace some workers from their current jobs, but they also create many new jobs in areas where America has a competitive advantage such as business services and high-tech industries. Compared to overall U.S. job creation and dislocation each month, affected largely by technological advances and changes in consumer demand, the impact due to trade agreements is exceedingly small, but positive because, on balance, trade pacts create better and higher paying jobs than the ones displaced. Workers in manufacturing firms that export generally earn wages 12 to 18 percent higher than their counterparts in firms that only serve the domestic market.</p>

<p>Of course, the net result is little solace for those suffering loss of job or income.  But the response should not be to make everyone less well off.  Instead, we should be doing more, like other advanced countries, to promote labor adjustment through programs that provide wage insurance, targeted job training and other transition support.  Our political leaders have given such programs short shrift and are now witnessing the political backlash against their inaction.</p>

<p>Let’s not forget that trade pacts create commercial opportunities but do not guarantee sales. American  firms and workers face tough competition at home and abroad.  Inadequate investment in educating American children and retraining and retooling  workers is a higher tax on U.S. competitiveness than tariffs and quotas hindering America’s  access to foreign markets.

          <h3 class="nytint-headline">They Increase Trade Deficits, Which Have Led to Job Loss</h3>

          <p class="nytint-byline">Robert E. Scott <span class="pubdate">  3:20 AM</span></p>

        <img alt="Robert_scott-thumbstandard" class="nytint-mugshot" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/03/11/opinion/Robert_Scott/Robert_Scott-thumbStandard.jpg" />

        <p>It’s no surprise that voters on the right and the left are uneasy with U.S. trade policy — and they have every right to be. For years, the United States has consistently run much larger trade deficits than other developed nations, and we have suffered more trade-related job loss as a result. While growing exports tend to support domestic employment, growing imports costs jobs and reduces domestic output. Thus, the size and growth of trade deficits is strongly correlated with trade-related job loss.</p>

<p>Over the last 20 years, trade and investment deals have increased U.S. trade deficits and cost Americans their jobs. The agreement allowing China into the World Trade Organization led to <a href="//www.epi.org/publication/china-trade-outsourcing-and-jobs/">trade deficits that eliminated 3.2 million jobs</a> between 2001 and 2013 alone. Meanwhile, the United States already faces a trade deficit with countries in the proposed Trans-Pacific Partnership that <a href="//www.epi.org/publication/trans-pacific-partnership-currency-manipulation-trade-and-jobs/">cost 2 million U.S. jobs in 2015</a> — a trade deficit which would surely get worse if the pact is enacted. But lost jobs are just the tip of the iceberg of trade’s broader effect on the economy.</p>

<div class="w190 right module"><div class="entry"><blockquote>The growth of trade with low-wage countries has particularly hurt workers without a college degree, who make up more than two-thirds of the U.S. labor force, or 100 million people.</blockquote></div></div>

<p>In his 2008 book, "<a href="//www.epi.org/publication/everybody_wins_except_for_most_of_us/">Everybody Wins, Except for Most of Us</a>," my colleague Josh Bivens shows that while the most privileged Americans have benefited from some cost-saving “efficiency gains” due to trade, increased global integration can harm most working Americans. Recently, <a href="//www.epi.org/publication/standard-models-benchmark-costs-globalization/">Bivens estimated</a> that the growth of trade with low-wage countries reduced the median wage for full-time workers without a college degree by about $1,800 per year in 2011.</p>

<p>Workers without a college degree make up more than two-thirds of the U.S. labor force, roughly 100 million people. Thus, the growth of globalization, as encouraged by more than 20 U.S. trade and investment deals, plus the proposed T.P.P., is responsible for transferring approximately $180 billion per year from low- and middle-income workers to those in the top third, and especially to those in the top 10, 1 and 0.1 percent of the population.</p>

<p>It didn’t have to be this way. Trade and investment deals like Nafta and T.P.P. are highly complex legal texts, written to favor multinational companies and large investors. A well-known economist once noted that a “free trade agreement” could be two pages long and simply say that all tariffs are eliminated between two or more countries. The T.P.P. has 30 chapters and thousands of pages of inscrutable legalese.  These rules expand copyright and patents raising the profits of drug makers, software companies and Hollywood. The T.P.P. will also <a href="//www.citizen.org/TPP">expose U.S. consumers</a> to unsafe imported food, empower large corporations to attack U.S. health and environmental standards, and roll back Wall Street reforms. </p>

<p>It is time for a reset in U.S. trade and international economic relations. We must put an end to unfair trade practices such as currency manipulation, which is the single largest cause of U.S. trade deficits and trade-related job losses. The United States needs to develop a results-based approach to trade negotiations that is designed to rebalance global trade and ensure that the benefits of trade are broadly shared, and not funneled to those with the most wealth and power in our society.

          <h3 class="nytint-headline">U.S. Trade Deficits Are Not the Cause of Unemployment</h3>

          <p class="nytint-byline">Jeffrey J. Schott <span class="pubdate">  3:20 AM</span></p>

        <img alt="Jeffrey_schott-thumbstandard" class="nytint-mugshot" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/03/11/opinion/Jeffrey_Schott/Jeffrey_Schott-thumbStandard.jpg" />

        <p>Rob’s comments on job losses are not supported by the actual data.  Over the last year, total U.S. private sector, non-farm employment went up by 2.6 million jobs, and the unemployment rate fell from 5.5 percent to 4.9 percent -- a level most economists consider to be near full employment.  Yet Rob suggests that U.S. trade with the 11 other countries in the Trans-Pacific Partnership cost us 2 million jobs in this period!</p>

<p>He maintains that the trade agreement that allowed China to enter the World Trade Organization at the end of 2001 cost 3.2 million jobs over the following 12-year period.  But China’s accession to the W.T.O. did not change U.S. trade policies or remove any barriers to Chinese exports to the United States.  Indeed, the W.T.O. accord allowed U.S. authorities to continue to single out China with special rules that make it easier to apply <a href="//www.nytimes.com/2012/05/18/business/energy-environment/us-slaps-tariffs-on-chinese-solar-panels.html">antidumping duties</a> against Chinese imports.  This pact did nothing to ease the ability of China to ship goods to the United States.  The only thing the U.S. did was to continue the longstanding provision of normal trade treatment under U.S. tariff rules (not including antidumping cases) on a permanent basis instead of subject to virtually automatic regular renewals.</p>

<p>The basic fallacy in Rob’s analysis is the assumption that trade deficits increase overall U.S. unemployment.  Over the last 25 years, we have implemented a large array of trade agreements.  During that period, the U.S. trade deficit has fluctuated generally in line with U.S. economic performance.  The deficit grows when times are good and shrinks when the economy slows.</p>

<div class="w190 right module"><div class="entry"><blockquote>Stresses in the U.S. labor market is a combination of technological advances and under-investment; the impact of trade agreements is relatively minor but positive.</blockquote></div></div>

<p>Rob also mischaracterizes the consumer and environmental protections in the T.P.P.  Contrary to his contention, the T.P.P. strengthens the rights of governments to regulate in the public interest and thus sharply constrains the ability of corporations to use investor-state dispute procedures to challenge national consumer and environmental regulations.  Readers can find a more informed analysis of the investor-state issue in my organization's <a href="//www.piie.com/publications/briefings/piieb16-1.pdf">new assessment</a> of the T.P.P.</p>

<p>Finally, his comments that less educated U.S. workers suffer in the modern economy is nothing new; <a href="//bookstore.piie.com/book-store/109.html">studies documented the problem</a> long ago.  But in most industrial sectors, trade plays a very minor role.  My colleague, Gary Hufbauer and I documented the impact on U.S. wages from Nafta in our comprehensive analysis of that pact, <a href="//bookstore.piie.com/book-store/332.html">Nafta Revisited: Achievements and Challenges</a>.  For other U.S. trade pacts, many of the reductions in U.S. trade barriers that would affect less competitive U.S. industries are phased in slowly over time.  In the most recent pacts signed during the last decade, the most import-sensitive reforms have not yet been implemented.  So how are they “costing” U.S. jobs?</p>

<p>The simple answer is that Rob cites real problems but misdiagnoses the causes.  As I said earlier, the source of many stresses in the U.S. labor market is a combination of technological advances and under-investment in U.S. human and physical infrastructure; the impact of trade agreements is relatively minor but positive.

          <h3 class="nytint-headline">Offshore Production Has Really Hurt U.S. Manufacturing</h3>

          <p class="nytint-byline">Robert E. Scott <span class="pubdate">  3:20 AM</span></p>

        <img alt="Robert_scott-thumbstandard" class="nytint-mugshot" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/03/11/opinion/Robert_Scott/Robert_Scott-thumbStandard.jpg" />

        <p>Jeff claims that “the impact due to trade agreements is exceedingly small, but positive because, on balance, trade pacts create better and higher paying jobs than the ones displaced.” But he is wrong on both counts. Trade deals have both cost jobs and pushed workers into lower paying ones.</p>

<p>Claims about job creation have been used to justify trade and investment deals to Congress and the public ever since Nafta. Jeff and his co-author Gary Hufbauer <a href="https://books.google.com/books/p/inst-intl-economics?q=jobs+created&btnG=Search+Book&hl=en_US&vid=ISBN9780881321999&ie=ISO-8859-1&oe=ISO-8859-1#v=snippet&q=jobs%20created&f=false">claimed in 1993</a> that the agreement with Mexico would “create about 170,000 net new U.S. jobs" by 1995. President Bill Clinton used this research <a href="//articles.philly.com/1993-09-19/news/25987801_1_global-trade-nafta-american-jobs">to claim in 1993</a> that Nafta would “create 200,000 American jobs within the first two years" and "a million jobs in the first five years.” Presidents Clinton and George W. Bush made similar claims for the Central American Free Trade Agreement, and for China’s entry into the World Trade Organization. President Obama <a href="//content.usatoday.com/communities/theoval/post/2010/12/obama-south-korea-free-trade-deal-will-create-us-jobs/1#.VugKPOIrJpi">claimed</a> that the U.S. Korea Free Trade agreement “would support 70,000 U.S. jobs.” Unfortunately, these claims have not panned out. </p>

<p>My studies of the impacts of Nafta, China trade and other trade deals employ the same methodology used by Jeff and Hufbauer in their original, 1993, pre-Nafta projection, but I looked at the actual changes in trade deficits following these deals rather than forecasts. An all-but-identical methodology has been used in <a href="https://www.newyorkfed.org/research/current_issues/ci11-8.html">trade and jobs studies done by the staff for the Federal Reserve Bank of New York</a>, and in a <a href="//www.brookings.edu/~/media/Projects/BPEA/Fall-2004/2004b_bpea_baily.PDF">study of trade and offshoring by two scholars with the Brookings Institution</a>, among many others. Growing trade deficits with Mexico <a href="//www.epi.org/publication/heading_south_u-s-mexico_trade_and_job_displacement_after_nafta1/">eliminated nearly 700,000 U.S. jobs</a> between 1993, the year before Nafta took effect, and 2010. And major trade deals since Nafta have been followed by rising trade deficits that cost even more jobs, as I argued earlier.</p>

<p>Trade and investment deals have also made it easier for firms to offshore production, which has decimated American manufacturing production in the last 20 years. More than <a href="//www.census.gov/ces/dataproducts/bds/data.html">80,000 manufacturing plants were lost</a> between 1998 and 2013 alone, which contributed to the  <a href="//www.bls.gov/ces/">5.3 million manufacturing jobs</a> the United States lost between April 1998 and February 2016. (Yes, the Great Recession in 2008-2009 was responsible for part of these losses, but we are still far below 1998 employment levels in manufacturing today largely because of stubborn trade deficits.)</p>

<p>The vast majority of traded goods are manufactured commodities. And <a href="//www.epi.org/publication/lagging-recovery-of-construction-and-manufacturing-sectors-is-one-more-reason-wage-growth-is-suffering-for-most-workers/">manufacturing jobs pay much better</a> than other jobs, especially those created since the last recession.  As a result, more than 60 percent, or over 400,000, of the nearly 700,000 jobs lost because of the U.S. trade deficit with Mexico were in manufacturing. Likewise, of the 3.2 million jobs lost due to the growth of our trade deficit with China, more the 75 percent, or 2.4 million jobs, were in the manufacturing sector. Thus, the impact of free trade and investment deals have not been in any way positive for manufacturing, nor for the vast majority of other U.S. workers.  </p>

<p>Jeff also claims that the jobs created by trade deals are “better and higher paying than the ones displaced.” And these trade deals do create some jobs — the job loss figures cited above are all net estimates, the difference between jobs created by exports and jobs lost to imports. But while some export jobs may pay well, <a href="//www.epi.org/publication/trading-manufacturing-advantage-china-trade/">research has also found</a> with respect to China trade, for example, that average weekly wages in jobs displaced in importing industries paid 17 percent more than the jobs supported by exports to China. This is true because the United States exports large amounts of low-wage agricultural commodities to China, and we import enormous quantities of electronics, where average wages are much higher.</p>

<div class="w190 right module"><div class="entry"><blockquote>The majority of U.S. trade deficits and manufacturing job losses are because of currency manipulation by China and others; a first step to better trade would be to eliminate these manipulations.</blockquote></div></div>

<p>Of more importance to displaced workers is the fact that wages in both import competing and exporting industries were much higher than in nontraded goods industries. In 2011, the average worker displaced by China trade <a href="//www.epi.org/publication/trading-manufacturing-advantage-china-trade/">suffered a loss of $13,505 per year</a>, even when re-employed in a nontraded industry.  And as I showed earlier, job and wage losses in manufacturing have had a huge depressing effect on most workers' wages, which were reduced by $1,800 per week per year for noncollege educated workers, (and I repeat, these workers make up two thirds of the labor force).</p>

<p>The majority of our trade deficits and manufacturing job losses are because of currency manipulation by China and about 20 other countries, including Japan, Malaysia, Singapore and Vietnam in the proposed Trans-Pacific Partnership. These policies act like a subsidy of 30 to 40 percent on all of their exports to the United States, and a tax on all of our exports to those countries, and to all other countries where we compete with their exports (essentially, the rest of the world).  </p>

<p>The elimination of currency manipulation could create <a href="//www.epi.org/publication/stop-currency-manipulation-and-create-millions-of-jobs/">between 2.3 and 5.8 million U.S. jobs</a> in the next 3 to 5 years, and increase U.S. gross domestic product by $288 billion to $720 billion (between 2 percent and 4.9 percent).  About 40 percent of the jobs gained would be in manufacturing, creating between 900,000 and 2.3 million U.S. manufacturing jobs. This win-win-win proposition would also increase tax revenue and reduce safety net expenditures, decreasing federal budget deficits by between $107 billion and $206 billion per year.  </p>

<p>Trade and investment deals are not just about reducing trade barriers.  They reflect <a href="//www.epi.org/publication/failure-by-design/">choices that affect the shape of the economy</a>. We could design and negotiate trade agreements that harmonize social protections and raise the living standards of working people in every partner countries, instead of negotiating trade deals that encourage multinationals to outsource production to low-wage locations that are willing to offer the most policy concessions. This dynamic does our poorer trading partners no favors at all.  </p>

<p>Not long ago it didn&#8217;t seem that globalization would be a major issue in the presidential campaign. But now,  from the right and left, Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders have gained followers with their <a href="//www.nytimes.com/2016/03/10/us/politics/after-michigan-loss-hillary-clinton-retools-message-on-jobs-and-trade.html">attacks on free trade agreements</a> that they say have cost <a href="//www.nytimes.com/2016/03/16/business/economy/on-trade-angry-voters-have-a-point.html">working-class Americans</a> good paying jobs. Promoters of agreements like <a href="//www.nytimes.com/topic/subject/north-american-free-trade-agreement">Nafta</a> promised that they would lead to broader economic development that would more than make up for American jobs that were shifted overseas. But do these pacts help or hurt average Americans?</p>
