<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody"><strong>&#8220;Breaking Pillars: Undervaluing English in Modern Education&#8221;<br />
Tom Malmgren, age 15 </strong></p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">In November of 2009, President Obama launched the âEducate to Innovateâ campaign, an initiative meant to elevate American students from the âmiddle to the top of the packâ on an international level. Since then, âEducate to Innovateâ has raised a billion dollars for U.S. education. Notably absent from the deal, however, are English programs. In fact, a recent wave of neglect, disinterest and doubt seems ready to sweep English from its central position in high schools and universities. Why?</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">In American schools today, STEM learning &#8212; science, technology, engineering, and math &#8212; is often given priority over everything else. The U.S. is scrambling to compete with foreign education systems, namely Chinaâs (which excels in STEM). But America is now producing three times the amount of university graduates majoring in STEM fields than there are jobs in those fields &#8212; clearly the promotion of STEM subjects over others has gone too far.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Students have also come to regard English as an unimportant subject. I frequently hear other students remark: âItâs only English class,â when they hand in a perfunctory essay or a slapped-together poem. But can students be blamed for their lack of interest? College English professors complain that freshmen who enter their courses have pitiful grammar skills, and donât understand proper sentence structure. They attribute this to increasingly inadequate high school English programs. Iâm lucky to be in a class where I can learn to write a formal essay.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Meanwhile, the number of English majors nationwide is declining at a precipitous rate, giving many universities cause to reexamine the necessity of their English departments.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Which raises the question: If young people are uninterested in English as a subject, and the government is going to lend its attention to STEM subjects, why spend time and money on increasingly superfluous English programs?</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Hereâs why! In almost every profession, and certainly in every intellectual one, clear, concise, correct communication is key to success. No matter how brilliant a physicist, mathematician, engineer or biologist may be, he or she will find it impossible to share ideas without a firm grasp of the English language.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Furthermore, there are, and always will be, endless questions pertaining to humanity, nature and all the intricacies of our lives that can never be answered in scientific terms. There is no other medium more devoted to these questions than literature. In literature, people are able to address and ponder massive, vital ideas. For the sake of literature, English has to remain an invulnerable part of education.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Educators, students, those who care about American society &#8212; letâs revitalize our English departments nationwide. If we lose them, we lose not only our ability to communicate effectively, but our best means of exploring what makes us human.</p>

<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody"><strong>&#8220;Concussion Hysteria&#8221;<br />
Aidan Donnelly, age 17</strong></p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Concussions are undoubtedly a serious issue in contact sports and the safety protocol regarding concussions should and is being improved. However, today when a coach, teammate or parent asks if youâve had concussions, itâs like admitting you have the plague. After expressing their pity for your perilous condition, many people question your decision to play contact sports and whether you understand the âlong term effects.â Suddenly, youâre not only crippled but are uneducated about your terrible affliction and deserve a lecture on your decision to participate in the sports you love.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Ironically, the concussed community is extremely knowledgeable on the effects of concussions and exactly what has happened to our brain. Weâve heard speeches from the doctors, parents and concerned relatives, and even our beloved ESPN has reported tirelessly on the negative effects of concussions. The last thing we need or want is another speech about why we should take our injuries seriously, as if weâve ignored the information that has been constantly presented to us.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">The constant reiteration and possible dramatization of concussionsâ damage has caused the vilification of contact sports, particularly football. A New York Times article titled âYouth Tackle Program Is Being Eliminated in a Football Hotbedâ by Ben Kelson covers how the town of Marshall, Texas, traditionally a town full of football talent, has disbanded its Pee Wee football program because of concern for the lasting effects of head trauma.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Despite the overwhelming concern from parents and communities about concussions in contact sports, some scientists are preaching a message of calmness when discussing the current concussion issue. A STAT article titled âThe Sky Is not Falling : Congress Looks at the Science of Concussionsâ by Dylan Scott, highlights Dr. David Cifuâs comments during a congressional panel meant to review the dangers of concussions. Dr. Cifu stated, ââThe sky is not fallingâ. Later adding, âThe advances weâve made in treatment are significant. I would suggest that itâs never been safer to have a concussion.â Throughout the panel, Dr. Cifu claimed that people where overreacting to concussions and prematurely pulling athletes from sports.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Dr. Cifu gives me hope that people can begin to look at concussions rationally. Rather than fearing concussions, people should be well educated on them and aware of how well concussions are dealt with medically. The process of reducing concussions and their effects is still maturing but is making rapid progress. By taking a serious but fearless approach, we can balance our societyâs love of contact sports with the safety and longevity of our athletes.</p>

<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody"><strong>&#8220;Cuban Embargo: Should It Stay Or Go?&#8221;<br />
Caroline Fatemi, age 17 </strong></p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">In 1960, a brand-new car cost $2,600, literacy tests were required to vote throughout the South, homosexuality was considered a mental illness, and the United States imposed a trade embargo on Cuba. Only one of those antiquated aspects of 1960 remains, and the time has come to update this dÃ©modÃ© policy.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">President Obamaâs Cuba policy, which would eliminate the embargo, would improve relations between the two countries, relieve the suffering of the Cuban people, and promote our economic interests.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">The original purpose of the embargo was to retaliate against Cuba for nationalizing U.S.-owned properties and trading with the Soviet Union. The embargo, we believed, would force Cuba to change its regime and improve the conditions of its people. That didnât happen.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">âDecades of U.S. isolation of Cuba have failed to accomplish our objective of empowering Cubans to build an open and democratic country,â President Obama has said (Charting). Indeed, the people who have been harmed the most are the average Cubans, most of whom live in poverty. Meanwhile, American companies are prohibited from expanding into a new nearby market.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">We are long overdue for a fresh approach that will serve U.S. economic interests as well as uphold American values through support for better treatment of the Cuban people.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">As a 17-year-old high school junior, it makes no sense to me that Americans canât easily travel to, or do business with, a country thatâs 90 miles away because of actions it took more than 50 years ago. We should shape our future in ways that help both countries, rather than remain imprisoned by the past.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Thankfully, the two countries are working to re-establish diplomatic relations. The American embassy in Havana reopened since its closing in 1961, and President Obama just concluded the first trip to Cuba by an American president since 1928. While he was there, he pressed President RaÃºl Castro on human rights for the Cuban people and discussed trade and travel reforms, among other topics. The two countries even played their first baseball game since the year I was born, in 1999. In fact, in March the Obama administration legalized the direct signing of Cuban players onto U.S. teams, along with other jobs (Strauss).</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Critics say lifting the embargo will reward the Castro regime rather than the Cuban people. We have had 50 years of this policy; it hasnât worked. The best way to bring about change in Cuba is to deal directly with its leaders. By working with the worldâs greatest democracy, the Cuban leaders can only bring about beneficial reforms for their people.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">I hope that in the future the Cuban embargo will seem as outdated as literacy tests do today.</p>

<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody"><strong>&#8220;Death to the Death Penalty&#8221;<br />
Sejal Jhawer, age 16 </strong></p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">The death penalty: one of Americaâs most barbaric practices. Within the last forty years, over one hundred leading nations have moved to abolish capital punishment in stride with their progressive policies â yet America lags behind in this trend. Despite the eighth amendmentâs prohibition of âcruel and unusual punishment,â the federal government has not abolished the death penalty. In 31 states, executions are considered neither âcruelâ nor âunusual,â surviving in varying degrees of practice. While some contemplate the specifications under which to apply the death penalty, the fact remains that capital punishment is inhumane and unconstitutional. The United States must abolish this medieval practice in favor of sentencing convicts to life without parole.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">All humans have a fundamental right to life. This principle is enshrined in our nationâs governing laws, which prohibit individuals from taking othersâ lives. Murder in the American justice system is the vilest offenseâso why does our government bear exception to this rule? As often satirized by anti-death penalty advocates: âOur current system kills people who kill people because killing people is wrong.â The American justice system acknowledges that the infliction of death is an atrocity of the highest reprehensibility; so why is it neither âcruelâ nor âunusualâ when perpetrated by the government?</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">The death penalty in the United States is also arbitrary and discriminatory. Out of the tens of thousands of cases eligible for death sentencing, only a select few receive this distinction based on arbitrary qualifications. Studies demonstrate that death sentencing varies based on regional, racial and economic factors. For example, Texas alone accounts for 536 of the 1431 nation-wide executions that have occurred since 1976 (Death Penalty Information). Additionally, juries are more likely to convict criminals of minority races such as African-Americans or Hispanics, or convict those with subpar legal representation as a result of economic disadvantage â an extremely subjective, non-standardized component of a process quite literally determining life or death.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Contrary to popular belief, research comparing the United States versus Europe (where most governments have abolished capital punishment) indicates that the death penalty does not deter crime. Furthermore, victimsâ families demonstrate no increased satisfaction resulting from perpetratorsâ deaths. By dragging on for years, conviction processes actually force families to remain invested in trials without any sense of closure or ability to move on.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Life sentencing is the best alternative to the death penalty. By avoiding death altogether, it omits the possibility of committing a grievous mistake in the sentencing process and violating human rights. Because it is also economically cheaper, the funds saved from this option could be redirected to providing emotional support for victimsâ families. Ultimately, Americans must choose between preserving an antiquated tradition and protecting human rights.</p>

<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody"><strong>&#8220;Good Before God (or Any of His Religions)&#8221;<br />
Jason Barr, age 16 </strong></p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Ever since my introduction to the world of Scouting, I have been 99 percent on board. Through the program I have met people, gotten opportunities, and learned lessons that I would have otherwise never been exposed to. Their ideals and moral code are mostly wonderful. Just one little thing bothers me: âDo my duty to God and my country.â God was never a part of my life before I learned this line. Why does he have to be now? Why does Scouting, and society in general, tag âreverentâ on to the end of their moral code? This is counterintuitive: Humans donât need religion to be moral.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">In fact, recent research suggests that on a psychological level ânicenessâ goes beyond religion and even humanity. According to The New York Times article âGood Without God?â, other mammals such as chimpanzees have been seen to act in kind ways benefiting society. The article describes instances such as younger monkeys bringing water to an older arthritic monkey, and primates refusing to take rewards greater than are offered to their cohorts. Chimps arenât the only ones: Dogs and mammals in general have been shown to act in ways that benefit their communities as a whole. Prospect Magazine has quoted British psychologist Margaret Knight explaining how humans, like all mammals, âare naturally social beings.â Thus, life is more positive and fulfilling for all if members of a community act in a friendly and cooperative manner.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">I can hear you now: âSo what if animals are ânice,â that doesnât make them moral.â Okay, true. âNiceâ is not synonymous with âmoral.â However, morality is derived almost directly from simple ideas of goodness. The Scout Law, a sort of definition of the ideal Scoutâs personality, is based off of simple, one word traits: âfriendly,â âhelpful,â âcourteous.â These traits arenât divine commands from deities or inspired writings of prophets: Theyâre traits any old Joe would use to describe a neighbor or friend. Morals do not stem from the divine, they come from more basic things, such as a need for a society to be happy. If morals are indeed a basic lubricant of society, then existing without religion isnât existing without morals.</p>

<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody"><strong>&#8220;Indigenous: Unheard, But Loud&#8221;<br />
Marco Alvarez, age 16 </strong></p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">When I was young, I was raised with television and movies giving me an image of Native Americans, showing me that they always wore feathers, wore only loin cloths, couldn&#8217;t comprehend English, and were barbaric savages. I am a Lipan Apache. I guess I donât fit the âIndianâ mold.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Growing up, I have always watched sports, especially football. When I was very young, I remember watching a Washington Redskins game for the first time. That day will forever be engraved in my mind. I saw people with red paint smothered over their whole face, wielding tomahawks, and wearing fake headdresses. This is the modern âblack face,â the modern blind racism. And there needs to be an end to this.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">A problem that has silently plagued America for quite some time is the mistreatment of Native Americans. Native Americans are constantly mocked by media and shunned by the government. Written in the American Declaration of Independence, indigenous people are referred as âmerciless Indian Savages.â Teen suicide and infant mortality are rampant problems throughout the reservations. According to The New York Times, native youth have the highest suicide rate of any United States ethnic group and natives suffer from infant mortality 60 percent higher than Caucasians. According to the Center on Juvenile and Criminal Justice, indigenous people are more likely than any other racial groups in the United States to be killed by police. One case is the killing of John T. Williams of the Nuu-chah-nulth tribe. John was a mentally ill 50 year old man, deaf in one ear, who carved wood for a living. John was shot four times by a police officer within seconds of dropping a knife and a piece of cedar he was carving. He died; the folding knife was found closed on the ground.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">We have the power to unravel these dilemmas and to truly fix them. The main root of these problems is the lack of knowledge and recognition. The casual American most likely wouldn&#8217;t know that the name âRedskinâ is a term for native bounty gained. The casual American most likely wouldn&#8217;t know that native people are calling for help from the ruins of the reservations. The casual American most likely wouldn&#8217;t know that natives are second and third class citizens in their own lands. We have the power to solve this, but we haven&#8217;t taken big enough steps yet. Nothing has ever started without someone acting upon it. If we could resolve these predicaments, we could make peace with the tribes and government. Natives are constantly calling for help, but are continuously overlooked. Indigenous people protest their spirits out onto the road, but they are quickly consumed by the hum of American traffic.</p>

<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody"><strong>&#8220;It&#8217;s Time for America to Start Feeling the Love for Ultimate Frisbee&#8221;<br />
Alex Kucich, age 17 </strong></p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">There is something misleadingly whimsical about the word âfrisbee.â It brings to mind the flowing hair of golden retrievers and leaping hippies, not serious athletics. However, it is time Americans realized that frisbee has become something far more formidable and new. Yes, Ultimate Frisbee has recently burgeoned into a fiercely competitive, physically demanding and increasingly popular sport. âDiscâ has an official governing body, international championships and potential inclusion in future Olympic Games. Itâs time for Americans to break out the bandanas and start feeling the love for Ultimate Frisbee.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">There was, admittedly, a time when Frisbee was not a legitimate sport. The first Wham-O Frisbees of the 1950s were, at the time, mere toys. Tossed at casual get-togethers and college campuses, Frisbees garnered little serious attention outside the canine community. This image has stuck. Many Americans view Frisbee as nothing more than a laid-back pastime &#8212; one primarily reserved for Starbucks baristas.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Behind the scenes, however, a Frisbee Renaissance had begun. In 1968, a group of New Jersey high schoolers invented Ultimate Frisbee, a sport combining the strategy of football, the athleticism of soccer, and the whirlwind pace of basketball with the unique loftiness of the Wham-O Frisbee. Two teams of seven (usually men and women) compete to connect passes for as many âtouchdownsâ as possible. Layouts, soaring grabs, exotic throws (âthe scooberâ is my personal favorite), and screaming hipsters only add to the appeal. Indeed, the game has grown by leaps and bounds. Between 2004 and 2011 alone, USA Ultimate (Americaâs national Ultimate Frisbee organization) memberships grew from 10,000 to 16,000 players. âDiscâ has also grown internationally, now played in forty-two countries worldwide. Frisbee is truly the ultimate new sport.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Why, then, is Disc dissed? The answer lies in the nature of the game itself. Ultimate &#8212; a self-consciously pure sport &#8212; has only one piece of equipment, no referees, no advertising agencies, no glittery stadiums, and no commercial interests to distract players from the joy of the game. It is a sport that relies on sportsmanship and integrity instead of jock attitude and fancy gear. This gives Ultimate Disc its hippie-anti-capitalist reputation, but also leaves the game unfortunately under-appreciated. No fancy gear means no big-money interest, so no media attention &#8212; thus Ultimate Frisbee flies under the radar of most Americans.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">The ultimate question facing Disc enthusiasts is how to legitimize the game without corrupting it. Because corporate interest would undermine its counterculture core, Ultimate must rise to eminence through its players. Ultimate Frisbee is already soaring in popularity on college campuses and public parks across the globe. It is high time the American public caught on.</p>

<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody"><strong>&#8220;Military Men: Victims of the System&#8221;<br />
Maya Ewart, age 16 </strong></p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">In recent years, media and legislation on U.S. military sexual assault has broadened its borders and addressed a long overlooked group of victims: men. As ugly as sexual victimization of female soldiers is, the stigma around male sexual assault leaves people speechless. The idea that men can be dominated sexually by other men is uncomfortable to hear and difficult to process, mainly because the public is under the impression that these acts of violation are sexually driven crimes. The truth, which may be even more disturbing, is that male sexual assault is generated by an unnatural military culture of dominance and detachment.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Greg Jeloudov has a Russian accent. Upon Jeloudov joining the military, his fellow soldiers decided to educate him about who really controlled America by gang raping him. His isolating attribute was used as a reason to violate him along with his recentness to the military. Usual victims of military male sexual assault tend to be similar to Jeloudov: low ranking, of outsider status, or presumed gay. These groups of men are viewed as submissive and weak, making them easier prey. Most male sexual attackers are straight men. They are not interested in the sexual aspect of the assault. The focus is on asserting dominance. To win wars soldiers must be stronger than their enemies. Soldiers violate other soldiers to feel powerful, to feel like winners.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Servicemembers are trained to view enemies as objects, not people. If the men they shoot at are thought of as targets, emotions are less likely to complicate pulling the trigger. Useful on the battlefield, this perception is toxic in a servicemember&#8217;s daily life. Aggression and violence towards fellow soldiers can be justified because of a soldierâs detachment. By dehumanizing their victims, attackers remove the psychological damage of assault from their mind. Assailants are not the only ones who continue to foster the culture generating male military sexual assault. Many military officers are not keen to report sexual assaults because they tarnish the militaryâs reputation along with their jobs. Choosing not to pass on reports is much easier if officers do not personalize. Such a decision would be harder to make when seen as failing to protect a victim. Instead officers practice self preservation, another valuable combat skill that does not necessarily transfer well outside of a warzone.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Sexual assault of men in the military cannot be shortsighted as an issue that can be generalized across all sexual assault or pawned off as a consequence of a manâs natural sex drive. The issue at hand is strictly military. In order to stop the brutal violence on male servicemembers, the military must reflect within itself and the culture it has generated.</p>

<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody"><strong>&#8220;One-for-One Business Models: Do the Benefits of Philanthropic Companies Like TOMS Outweigh the Harm?&#8221;<br />
Lisa S., age 15</strong></p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Youâve probably heard of them. You might even own a pair yourself. I, too, own a pair of Toms. For me, part of its initial appeal was the one-for-one slogan the company employs; for every pair sold, a pair is donated to children in need. Why not look good while doing good too? The shoes enable you to feel as though youâre contributing positively to others without truly applying much effort.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">The shoes might not actually âdo goodâ after all. The company may be downright detrimental to the communities it claims to help. For one, Toms undermines local businesses, as they simply cannot compete with the free shoes. Studies have shown that large-scale foreign donations can have extremely harsh effects on local employment. A 2008 study found that clothing donations to Africa resulted in a 50 percent decline in the regionâs apparel employment.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Additionally, Laura Seay, a professor at Morehouse College, contends that by donating shoes, Toms is &#8220;just treating one symptom of a much deeper problem, and treating symptoms is not a cure.&#8221; Poverty is the root cause of shoelessness. The people who receive footwear do have access to cheap shoes but not the money to purchase them, and Toms is not doing much to address this problem at all. The business itself actually needs impoverished children to thrive. The use of a poor, needy child in its image is a crucial aspect of the companyâs marketing.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">The shoes are not sturdy either. They last three months on average, but this time can be stretched to seven or eight months if cared for properly. Shoe drops occur about every two years; this, in conjunction with the very limited life expectancy of the shoes, is clearly not enough to sustain the children, especially those who live in rockier regions.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Toms has made steps in the right direction. It has launched an eyewear line that contributes to an increase in medical employees who provide support for people in need of improved vision. This allows them to become employable and break the cycle of poverty. Additionally, Toms has begun to manufacture shoes locally in places such as Haiti and Ethiopia, which opens up job opportunities for people living in the area. Due to the small numbers of people they benefit, these decisions donât solve everything. However, they begin to address some of the criticism Toms has received over the years.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">A pair of Toms is expensive, costing a hefty 55 dollars for canvas slip-ons. Overall, despite Tomsâ efforts, these 50 plus dollars would be much better off being donated to a charity that can work to make actual progress concerning poverty, in areas such as infrastructure, education or health.</p>

<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody"><strong>&#8220;Roots of the Problem: Overlooked&#8221;<br />
Fiona Lobon, age 16 </strong></p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">President Muhammadu Buhari of Nigeria has done wonders to help defeat Boko Haram, but much more still needs to be done. President Buhariâs military has captured many of Boko Haramâs strongholds and they have been able to stop much of the open fighting, so Boko Haram is resorting more to raids and suicide bombings (using mostly women). The President has said the government needs to target the root of the problem, yet they arenât.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">One of Boko Haramâs most useful âassetsâ are women. Womenâs vulnerability, lack of education, and absence of protection makes them easy targets, and it makes it easier for them to be manipulated. Womenâs susceptibility is one of the roots of Nigeriaâs difficulty in fighting Boko Haram. The military is âvexedâ about why female suicide bombers participate in these attacks, such as the one on the Dikwa refugee camp, which killed 58 people. Itâs because women arenât educated, protected or treated in ways that would help them to be targeted less.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">There have been recent reforms but, âAccess to education is still low, especially in the northern parts of the country where withdrawal of girls for the purposes of marriage or for caregiving is still practicedâ. Women canât be expected to fight this evil if they arenât taught about it; they can only live in constant fear. Education is the answer to many worldwide problems, this one without exception. Starting early, girls need to learn about Boko Haram and how they can resist their tactics. They need to learn about whatâs happening to their fellow Nigerian women so that history doesnât repeat itself.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">An unfortunate yet true fact is that, &#8220;Section 55[12] of the Penal Code applicable in Northern Nigeria, permits wife battery as chastisement as long as grievous harm is not inflicted.&#8221; Not only are some women not being protected, but also their husbands are beating them. If the government wants to end Boko Haram, they have to gain the full confidence and trust of Nigerian women. The women canât give them this when there are laws that persecute and harm them and when new laws to protect them are vetoed. (The National Assembly failed to pass the &#8220;Abolition Of All Forms Of Discrimination Against Women In Nigeria And Other Related Matters Bill.&#8221;) To them it seems as if the government may sometimes be another enemy, not a trustworthy ally. If the leadership can give women more say by giving them seats in the government or by passing laws in favor of their rights, they will be on track to gaining their trust and to eventually being able to defeat Boko Haram as a united country.</p>

Emily Goldman, age 16 </strong></p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">How many clothes do you actually wear in your closet? Did you ever stop to think where these clothes are going to go when they no longer fit your style. The desire of buying fast fashion may seem tempting, but the reality is as first world countries fill their closets with cheap trends, we continue to fill our landfills and our planet with harmful pollutants.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Every day consumers are bombarded with hypnotic advertisements, whether in a commercial or on social media. Social shopping is a main reason for wastefulness in the fashion industry because of how fast trends come and go. When your favorite celebrity is wearing the newest jumper on the market and you just have to get your paws on a knock-off version, it can be hard to resist the urge to buy. To add on, now it is easier than ever to purchase a quick impulse buy. As of the first quarter of 2015, one third of online fashion purchases have been made on mobile devices. Kate Davidson Hudson, co-founder and chief executive of Editorialist states, âBut now, everybody sees whatâs on the runways on social media and on blogs, and everybodyâs a critic, and shoppers want it as soon as they see it,â she said. Americans need to be smarter about their purchases and recognize that every garment contributes to landfills for up to a staggering 80 years for that rubber soled shoe that was so last season.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Not only are clothes filling up our landfills, but the production process is also contributing to a series of unhealthy practices for our planet. Cotton alone consumes 10 percent of the world&#8217;s agricultural chemicals and 25 percent of the world&#8217;s pesticides. Annually, in the United States, the fashion industry contributes to around 25 billion pounds of textile waste, this is about 82 pounds per person.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Companies like Leviâs and American Eagle have taken action into changing the way the clothing industry works by endorsing recycling campaigns. These new contributions are helpful, but it is not enough. Americans need to become more consumer conscious and think before buying that cute get-up because sooner than later it will be in a landfill. I am not saying to stop shopping, I am saying that we should become aware of the chain reaction that our purchases contribute to, so we can become a less wasteful society as a whole.</p>

<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody"><strong>&#8220;Standardized Testing: Is it a Scam?&#8221;<br />
Nandini Rana, age 13, and Amy Enyenihi, age 14 </strong></p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Which of the following statements is true?<br />
(A) Standardized tests are a good use of valuable time.<br />
(B) Standardized testing is a quick and accurate measure of a childâs intelligence.<br />
(C) Standardized testing is in no way harmful to a studentâs mental health.<br />
(D) None of the above.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">The correct answer is D.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">All around the United States, students of different learning capabilities and capacities are pressured into taking the same or similar tests to evaluate their worth in this calculating society. It is believed that these tests are helpful to teachers and can collect reliable information about a studentâs ability to learn. On the contrary, standardized tests are detrimental to oneâs mental health and waste priceless hours that could be used as instructional time. Therefore, they are hurting students rather than helping them on their educational path.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">When looking at long term effects, these stressful tests can increase the chance of a child developing anxiety issues both inside and outside of a classroom setting. A great amount of pressure is placed on these students to perform well and accurately represent not only themselves, but their schools and teachers as well. An article from The Washington Post mentions specific situations and reports, âTeachers are reporting children throwing up, losing control of their bowels, and increased commitments for psychiatric and anxiety issues [due to the pressure of standardized tests].â</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Another concern regarding this issue is that it cuts into valuable instructional time. Hours upon hours are wasted conducting these useless examinations, not to mention the countless days of preparation. In our limited experiences, teachers have confessed that a specific topic was being taught only because it would make an appearance on a standardized test and not for academic gain.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Many would argue that standardized tests are a useful tool and can help students prepare for further education. However an article from The New York Times states, âThe report found that more test time does not pay off in improved learning as measured by student performance on the rigorous, federally backed math and reading exam known as the National Assessment of Educational Progress,â and proves the testsâ worthlessness.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">To conclude, getting rid of standardized tests would take a great load of pressure off of future generations and allow for a better academic experience. Students would be able to learn in an environment where they are more comfortable with their capabilities and will not be constantly compared with their peers.</p>

<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody"><strong>&#8220;The Cost of the Cup is More Than You Know&#8221;<br />
Thomas Jacobs, age 15 </strong></p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Right now, the 2022 Qatar World Cup is set to be one of the most costly World Cups ever. However, this is not just in monetary terms, but also in human lives. The human cost is not coming from the Qatari people themselves, but from the migrant workers who have flocked to the country. Most of these laborers have immigrated from South Asia, specifically Bangladesh, India, Nepal, and Pakistan. In fact, from 2010 to 2014, about 1,200 migrant workers died on the job preparing for this major event. According to projections, this number will increase to 4,000 deaths by the start of the World Cup. This human cost is simply unacceptable. While a few workplace accidents are tragic and perhaps inevitable, this number should not be so high. This speaks to the dreadfully unsafe conditions in which the migrant workers work and live. Many workers live in shacks without air conditioning that are housing twice as many people as they were constructed to house. Moreover, the workers have almost no facilities to wash or clean themselves. These workers should not have to live in such dehumanizing conditions.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">The tasks the migrant workers perform are incredibly dangerous as well. The workers are constructing the hotels and stadiums necessary for hosting the Cup. These jobs can be dangerous if the working conditions are not as safe as they could and should be. For example, one worker died after being run over by a road roller. Many also perish due to dehydration from extreme heat and lack of access to water. In addition to these unsafe conditions, many workers are working extraordinarily long hours. Several female migrant workers interviewed by Mirror said that they work for 16 hours as waitresses, then are taken across town in a van at double capacity to work cleaning jobs. By forcing them to work for so long, the workers are being violated as employees and as people.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">On top of dangerous working conditions, they often do not receive as much pay as promised. Many workers sign contracts for the job, then are forced to sign less favorable contracts once the job starts. One group of waitresses was promised $400 a month, but instead only makes $275 a month. The employers of these migrant workers are disrespecting their employeesâ rights by violating the contracts that both of them signed. In conclusion, the Qatari migrant workers are being cruelly mistreated by their employers and the system that they live in. 2022 is a long way off. Before then, the thousands working to make the Cup possible deserve to have their labor and their human rights respected. Drastic change is needed, before any more unnecessary deaths occur.</p>

<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody"><strong>&#8220;The Question Up For Debate: Is Feminism Really For Everyone?&#8221;<br />
Nico Mayer, age 14 </strong></p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">The public needs a broader representation of feminism than what mainstream media has provided. Women like Patricia Arquette and Emma Watson have been spotlighted for speaking out on womenâs issues, however, rarely do women who donât share their white, upper-class experience receive the attention that is needed to manifest the true goal of feminism.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Intersectionality acknowledges that feminism is not one-size-fits-all, that each aspect of a womanâs identity (what âsectionsâ she fits into) contribute to her experience. For example, race, ethnicity, religion, economic status, ability, and sexual orientation are all contributors to the privilege a person might or might not have. According to the ideas of KimberlÃ© Crenshaw, a black woman who introduced the intersectional theory, â&#8230;the intersectional experience is greater than the sum of racism and sexism, any analysis that does not take intersectionality into account cannot sufficiently address the particular manner in which Black women are subordinated.â</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">One example of typical âone-size-fits-allâ feminism or âwhite feminismâ is the way the wage gap is discussed. The most common number heard in this discussion is that women make 78 cents to every white manâs dollar. However, this number is only true for white women. In reality, the wage gap for women and all people of color is even greater. For African-American women that number lowers to 64 cents, and for Latina women 54 cents.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">According to Jarune Uwujaren and Jamie Utt for the website Everyday Feminism, âbetween 25 percent and 50 percent of women experience gender-based violence (sexual violence, intimate partner violence, street harassment or stalking) in their lifetime.â However, as further explained by Uwujaren and Utt, using an intersectional lens reveals the whole story.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Similar to using 78 cents to represent the wage gap, limiting statistics about gender-based violence without considering other factors besides gender disguises important trends in the data to which we as a society need to pay attention. For instance, although all women are at risk, bisexual women are far more likely to experience sexual violence. Understanding the difference in frequency and risk will help us better protect and find more justice for women.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Some may object to an intersectional approach because it preserves differences. Some feel that intersectionality divides women &#8212; comments like âwhy do you have to bring up race?â and âdoesnât this pit women against each other?â are examples of this position. However, acknowledging real differences doesnât create them. Instead, the recent popularization of intersectional feminism has offered a way for all women to be there for each other and to find strength through their own differences.</p>

<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody"><strong>&#8220;The Real Solution&#8221;<br />
Kevin Morales, age 17 </strong></p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">The fifteenth of March of the year 2016 was the day my father finally set foot on American soil for the first time in eleven years. It has been eleven years since America had told him he had to go, leaving behind his wife and three children. Last Tuesday, on a cloudy evening, my sister and I traveled to John F. Kennedy International Airport to pick up the man America has kept from us for so long. He never asked for this trouble; he just wanted one child to be born in New York so that one child would one day pull the family out of generations of poverty. What had to be done was done, and six months later I was born.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">The current immigration system is broken, as it has been for many years, and denies many who want to become law-abiding the opportunity to do so. Deportation of the undocumented separates families and causes the loss of the prime workers of our economy, who are sent back to the places they wish to not be in anymore. Although many Americans have qualms about illegal immigration, there are about 12 million immigrants like my father who need immigration reform now.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">The idea to make the perilous journey across the border just seems sensible in those who need to leave their country immediately. The Council of Foreign Relations reports that many of the undocumented come from countries ravaged by poverty and violence, such as Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador. All of those coming into the country need to preserve their livelihood, but have to live under the accusation from Americans stating that âimmigrants steal our jobs.â In truth, as reported by The New York Times, immigrants enhance our economy. Therefore, America owes them for the taxes they pay with every purchase they make and the earned benefits they do not receive due to their status.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">In addition, Congress needs to improve legal immigration, by accelerating visas for immigrants who are sponsored by family members. CNN reports the testimony of a woman who waited more than 13 years after being sponsored by the rest of her family, already living in the US, to finally be considered to come into the country.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Ironically, the resources that politicians suggest we can use to deport every illegal immigrant are the very resources that immigrants made possible for America to have. Families and children should not risk being deported and separated from each other. Congress should immediately pass immigration reform that reflects American family values. I lost my father for nearly my entire childhood and thankfully I have found him again. I hope other families will not have a similar experience.</p>

<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody"><strong>&#8220;This Is Not A Game&#8221;<br />
Ben C., age 16 </strong></p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Until I lost several months of my life, I had not wanted to believe that video game addiction was real. It took me two months at a wilderness camp to recover and now a lifetime in which Iâll have to carefully consider my media usage. Gaming dominated every hour of my life. Even when my teachers, parents and friends actively tried to intervene, I couldnât stop. I used exciting adventures and action-filled shooters to escape from a dull-by-contrast world. I was absolutely hooked.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Gaming addiction is being increasingly recognized by medical professionals as a âprocess addictionâ akin to gambling. Scans of the pleasure centers of brains of game addicts âlight upâ in the same ways as of those addicted to cocaine or heroin. Video games are designed to be â by the gaming industry â a very active experience that draws in and immerses a player in a world they are reluctant to leave.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">China has government-sponsored camps to treat young addicts. It recognizes and understands this problem. America does not. Here, gaming addiction gets scant media coverage, if any. This is a serious mistake with such a large population at risk. 81 percent of U.S. households own a gaming device. In an Iowa State University study of gamers, nine percent showed signs of gaming addiction, indicating that three million young people are at risk.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Society has mechanisms to help those who cannot help themselves. Families stage interventions, legislators ban sales of drugs, and doctors provide emergency services without regard to insurance. Those who need outside intervention and support deserve the same assistance as a burn victim who canât bandage themselves. The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders does not list compulsive gaming as a clinical disorder, suggesting that it might be caused by unrelated disorders like depression or ADHD and saying it âneeds further studyâ. Completely ridiculous. As I know all too well, gaming addiction dominates a personâs life, provides an escape, and causes withdrawal just like a ârealâ addiction. It must be treated like one, too. To start, the American Psychiatric Association should add gaming addiction into the DSM as a clinical disorder. In addition, the government should both sponsor campaigns that educate the general public and add video game addiction to the topics covered by health and human development courses in high schools. Based on my experience, the best kinds of treatment facilities are those that place kids in an environment where they have the opportunity for self-reflection and healing, sans devices.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">If this problem remains unrecognized, we may soon have a âlost generationâ of teenagers and adults whose entire lives are consumed by video game and media addiction.</p>

<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody"><strong>&#8220;Through the Cell Phone Camera Lens&#8221;<br />
Lauren N., age 16 </strong></p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">I walked into the obscure, dimly lit room at the hipster affiliated âThink Tank Galleryâ in Downtown Los Angeles. I was amazed by the fascinating concepts and social statements made through different mediums. My eyes darted around the room, internalizing all of the work, and figuring out which piece to analyze next. The group of women I was with, however, seemed to look at the art through different lenses: the camera lenses on their cell phones.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">The gallery was like a scene from a dystopian horror film, plagued by cell phones, opened Snapchats and Instagram photos. Instead of walking freely through the gallery, I had to stop every five feet so that I didnât get in someoneâs picture. It was like dodging bullets in some high speed action adventure. Everywhere I turned, there was another camera out, snapping a photo for social media.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Ironically, the gallery was called âThink Tank,â possibly because the creators wanted to provoke ideas from the viewer. Instead, there was only the absence of thought in that big, cellphone littered room. People didnât think for themselves, they just followed the social media buzz and hoped for a âfollow back.â Kyle McMahon, a positivity activist and blogger, also observes this overuse of technology: âWe aren&#8217;t experiencing life. We&#8217;re losing moments with every tap&#8230; We may be physically present with our friendsâ¦ but we&#8217;re texting someone elseâ¦,â he says.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">I suggested to a friend that she put her phone away, and she retorted by saying, âWhen Iâm older, I want to remember this!â Yes, itâs important to document our lives and take photos so that we can reminisce, but when taking photos for the memories becomes taking photos for speculation or attention on social media, we need to draw a line. When did taking pictures for the memories become taking pictures for the likes, retweets or followers? When did a photo that says âWeâre having a great time!â turn into one that says, âEveryone look at me because Iâm out and youâre not!â?</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Caroline Tell, an editorial consultant, offers a possible solution for the overuse of cellphones in our technological culture: â&#8230;Maybe the best way to curb cell phone overuse is by preying on peopleâs social insecurities. In some circles, being inaccessible is a status symbol.â Maybe we need to glorify cellphone abstinence to create an environment where putting our phones down is celebrated. An easier approach to the problem is by just putting our phones down. Turning them off. We donât need some drastic, radical change to lessen the use of technology. The solution is easy, and it starts by pressing a simple button.</p>

<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody"><strong>âVoluntourismâ and the End of Altruistic Teens<br />
Emma McMorran, age 17 </strong></p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">In a world where just six percent of applicants are admitted to Harvard University, high school students are looking for any edge to add to their resumes. Between September 2012 and September 2013, over 16 million teens between the ages of 16 and 19 volunteered within the United States alone. Today, thousands of teens are trading in the uniforms of their local hospitals for intrepid trips abroad.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Teens take these âvoluntourismâ trips in the name of philanthropy, while their ulterior motive of a college acceptance letter lurks behind the curtain of goodwill.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">âThe problem with voluntourism is that it treats receiving communities as passive objects of the visiting Westernerâs quest for saviordom,â explains Rafia Zakaria, a writer for the Pakistan English-language newspaper Dawn. However, some programs do provide proper training and educational opportunities for their teenage volunteers; participants must understand the countryâs history and how to care for the people theyâre trying to help.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">How much are teenagers even helping these developing nations? Pippa Biddle, an outspoken critic of voluntourism, goes so far as to say that unskilled volunteers are often âdetrimentalâ to the people they think theyâre aiding. Biddle went to Tanzania in the late 2000âs as part of a school trip; she and her classmates attempted to build a library, but these private-school students were so bad at basic construction that their work had to be redone each night.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">I am not claiming that all charitable teens are taking advantage of the less fortunate; a lot of teenagers go on these trips expecting to make drastic improvements in foreign communities. But what could they accomplish in a week? Who can end poverty in a few days? Sometimes these teenagers can actually make a difference, and thatâs great! But was it worth the $4,000 to spend a week in Kenya?</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">As a high school junior, I witness classmates signing up for voluntourism trips in part for altruistic reasons but mainly to pick up story-telling fodder for their Common Application. Itâs time that teenagers recycle the brochures and delete the emails of voluntourism companies. Parents, stop opening your wallets to fund voluntourism vacations. Teenagers, stop looking to the unfortunate as opportunities for personal gain. Teens, if you are determined to go, research the specific program and country to understand if the program is taking care of a real community need. Please continue to volunteer (and this means me, too) only if you are coming from a place of genuine generosity; if youâre just looking to improve a college application, then get an SAT tutor instead.</p>

<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody"><strong>&#8220;We Need Music in Our Schools&#8221;<br />
Gabe M., age 13</strong></p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">I love music. I love listening to music, I love playing music, and I love writing music. Sadly, ever since fifth grade, I have had to get all my music playing and writing outside of school: My school doesnât provide any music training after fourth grade. My school and all other schools without music programs should try their best to add music education to the curriculum for all ages, not just elementary school students.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Research shows that music education boosts studentsâ academic success. One study found that when schools with different music programs were compared, on average, the schools with superior music programs score 20 percent higher on standardized English tests and 22 percent higher on standardized math tests, regardless of socioeconomic status. Another study showed that when one group of children were given piano training, âthe group scored 27 percent higher on proportional math and fractions testsâ then the group that did not have piano training (Rauscher et al.). This is because music is full of math. Even when students arenât consciously thinking about the math behind the music, theyâre constantly exercising mathematical thinking while playing music, from logarithmic scales on a guitar fretboard to fraction multiplication in a drumming polyrhythm. Take it from Pythagoras: âThere is geometry in the humming of the strings, there is music in the spacing of the spheres.â An analysis of U.S. Department of Education data found that âStudents who report consistent high levels of involvement in instrumental music over the middle and high school years show significantly higher levels of mathematics proficiency by grade 12.â (Catterall, Chapleau, and Iwanaga).</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">But musicâs benefits extend beyond school; teens busy playing music are less likely to get involved with drugs or gang violence. Teens also learn good work habits from practicing an instrument and collaboration from playing in ensembles. In the words of Lois Hetland and Ellen Winner of Project Zero according to The New York Times, âStudents who study the arts seriously are taught to see better, to envision, to persist, to be playful and learn from mistakes, to make critical judgments and justify such judgments.â Lastly, music is an enormous part of our culture. Music training is crucial to growth of adolescents.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Despite these advantages, increasing funding for music (or any program) in a public school is easier said than done. However, I do believe that parents, teachers, school administrators and voters should do their best to put music in our schools. As Plato once said, &#8220;I would teach children music, physics and philosophy; but most importantly music, for the patterns in music and all the arts are the keys to learning.&#8221;</p>

<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody"><strong>&#8220;Working but Hungry&#8221;<br />
Layne F., age 13 </strong></p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Barbie Izquierdo was raising two kids as a single unemployed mom on food stamps in inner city Philadelphia. In the food documentary &#8220;A Place at the Table,&#8221; she explains what itâs like to be stuck in the cycle of poverty. âMy dream is to go to college, but I canât tell my kids youâll eat in two years.â The difficulty of feeding her family kept her from going to college. Eventually, Barbie got a job, but that didnât mean things were better for her family. By exceeding the the maximum income for food stamps she was no longer eligible for government assistance. Barbie was working full time, and still couldnât afford three meals a day for her children.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Barbie is one of millions of Americans who struggle to feed their families while working full time. In a recent report by The New York Times, Patricia Cohen explained, when workers arenât paid enough, they are forced to rely on public assistance programs. But what happens to those who donât qualify public assistance programs and still canât afford food? Despite the limited choices that SNAP provides, it ensures families something to eat. However, a family of three canât exceed an income of $2,177 a month to qualify for SNAP. Exceeding this amount by even a dollar makes someone ineligible, and many of these families go hungry.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Food is often the first thing to be cut from the budgets of families living week to week. Housing and health care costs are often non-negotiable, so food is the only expendable item. Millions of working Americans are forced to make these cuts every day. In their 2015 Annual Statement New York City Coalition Against Hunger stated that, âOf the adults between the ages of 15 and 65 in the state, who were food insecure, 47% were working.â Over 1.3 million food insecure New Yorkers arenât homeless, they are living in tiny apartments, skipping meals and overlooked by government programs.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Hunger is not a distant problem. It is a reality that many of our neighbors face daily. The working poor are overlooked by the government due to minimum wages that donât cover the cost of living and programs that donât expand to all those who need them. The government must consider the needs of the working poor and help families break the cycle of poverty. SNAP and other programs must be expanded to the working poor. In our country that is able to send rovers to Mars and explore the depths of the ocean, we must also be able to ensure that nobody goes hungry.</p>
