We got many submissions, from every borough, on subjects from housing to hurricanes, schools to stop-and-frisk. After narrowing the list down, we posed one question to all the candidates, then had them choose a second question at random.</span>

                                                            My fair tolling plan, which would reduce congestion, which I believe is choking many neighborhoods. By imposing tolls in bridges that have a lot of mass transit options, you would keep a lot of trucks off the street. Because what&#x2019;s happening now
                                                            is many trucks are looking to use bridges that don&#x2019;t have any tolls on them. My plan would add tolls to certain bridges and reduce tolls to other bridges, and that would reduce traffic
                                                            congestion, especially truck traffic, which is choking many neighborhoods.

                                                            I have trouble separating that from my larger program because I think if we&#x2019;re doing things like creating affordable housing or addressing policing issues, for the people involved, that is the highest impact there could be on their quality of life.
                                                            So I think you&#x2019;re talking about something that reaches everyone, at least some. Well, I would pick up then in the same place. I think the expansion of bike lanes more deeply into the outer
                                                            boroughs is an example. I think there&#x2019;s a lot of areas that still need them and would benefit. The same with bike share. Obviously bike share is nascent, but it&#x2019;s started closer
                                                            in Manhattan and the areas closer in. I think if you&#x2019;re talking about a more holistic impact it would be to really make it five borough in both cases. Make bike lane expansion and bike
                                                            share expansion truly holistic in the city.

                                                            I think that when you live in an urban setting, the one treasure that you sort of appreciate and value is open space, quality, calming space, whether it&#x2019;s for the tranquility that it provides you as an individual, for the activity that it provides
                                                            your children and your family, for the potential for sports activities and physical activity. That green space in every neighborhood within a short distance from where you live, I think is one.
                                                        </p>
                                                        <p>
                                                            And then the other, and I&#x2019;m going to just add another, because I think it&#x2019;s an important quality of life concern for me and I see it on a daily basis. If we&#x2019;re going to make New York City a really quality livable city, we&#x2019;re
                                                            going to have to make our mass transit more aesthetically pleasing and a better experience. There&#x2019;s got to be much more ability to influence that experience in New York City because so
                                                            much of our work force and our daily activity relies on the quality of that experience. So I would give attention, whether it&#x2019;s political pressure as a chief executive or gaining some
                                                            additional control of the mass transit system.

                                                            A new idea? The one that I&#x2019;m basically hung up on is making sure our streets are not given back to the hoodlums, which is not a new idea. That&#x2019;s my No. 1 pet idea that I believe that people have to be able to walk around and feel safe, to
                                                            be able to walk around at night and feel safe, to be able to go out at night and feel safe, to be able to park their cars or take the subway and feel safe.

                                                            I believe that stop-and-frisk is going to go away sooner than later. Twenty-first century technology. You&#x2019;re on 96th and Broadway, let&#x2019;s say. And there&#x2019;s a crime on 98th Street and Columbus Avenue, and the computer knows where the
                                                            crime is, the computer knows where the cop is, he could get to the scene of the crime within two minutes or less. That is going to help keep New York safer. I really feel that. I don&#x2019;t
                                                            know why nobody else has thought about it. That would be my recommendation.

                                                            One simple idea that I think could improve life in New York City is having the city at the end of each one of its subway lines in the Bronx and in Brooklyn and in Queens create park and ride. The number of people who come into the City of New York that
                                                            burden our traffic problems could be significantly reduced if we just simply built parking garages and encourage more people coming into the city to use our subway system. If you go to the top
                                                            of the Bronx or if you go out to Queens at the end of each one of our lines, we don&#x2019;t have park and ride facilities. It is I think the most common sense approach that we can do to start
                                                            eliminating some of our traffic congestion problems in the city, encouraging more people to take our subways and mass transit.

                                                            now will pay a little bit more. And everybody else below that threshold will get a reduction in their New York City income tax bill.

                                                            You can more easily get in touch with us in government and track everything government is doing for you and everything you need from government. So My City Hall will be that.

I think it is important that we tie health and mental health components into our schools. I think that would
                                                            help to create healthier communities. As opposed to just looking at things like vision and hearing and testing for that, looking at things like diabetes and high blood pressure would allow us
                                                            to address coronary disease and a number of other things early on. And I think that is one of the things that I would really like to do.

That is a challenge that not only affects those that are not getting health care, but all the
                                                            rest of us because of the drag on the economy that it creates, because of the inability of small businesses to hire, because of the high cost, because of the tax burden that we carry for covering
                                                            the uninsured. It is big, but it is straightforward. Every New Yorker should have access to quality health care that doesn&#x2019;t bankrupt them. I&#x2019;m going to try and make that a reality

Poverty causes developmental issues. The first three years of a child&#x2019;s life are pivotal and we&#x2019;re
                                                            not addressing it. I want to set up pediatric wellness centers in low-income communities where parents, doctors and teachers work together so when kids come into our schools at 4, 5 years old,
                                                            they&#x2019;re not so far behind that they never catch up. And that would go a long way toward addressing some of the root causes of our failing schools. Early intervention, birth to 3, I want
                                                            to set up pediatric wellness centers in those communities so we can start working with parents and children early on. That would pay dividends.

Right now I have called for a moratorium until we&#x2019;ve come up with a plan that truly involves parents in schools early enough. I think that rather than requiring charters to find
                                                            space outside the schools, I would say it would be my preference that charters find space outside schools. It would be my preference that when they find space in a school and they have the resources

                                                            through what the impacts would be, some co-locations would be deemed workable, others would be rejected and that would really reset the whole equation. When the plans were no longer sort of my
                                                            way or the highway, the D.O.E. has spoken, but actually were adjusted according to the needs within the building and parental concerns, then I think that you could have some healthy and productive
                                                            co-locations. Ideally, outside schools, but it&#x2019;s not impossible to do it right with a co-location into a public school.

                                                            We rely on property tax for a significant amount of our revenue. And we have made New York City a tax-friendly city for homeowners. It is lopsided toward them, and I say that as a homeowner. Many people who left the city discovered that their tax burden
                                                            was so big that they wanted to return. I have family in Rockland that pay anywhere between $18,000 and $25,000 a year in property tax. They could live on City Island like I do and pay $6,000
                                                            to $7000 a year. So we&#x2019;ve encouraged homeownership and that&#x2019;s a good thing.
                                                        </p>
                                                        <p>
                                                            I think where we have failed is in a number of areas. One, our co-op and condo tax. We&#x2019;ve had to apply this abatement to bring back some equity or fairness to the taxes, but it&#x2019;s not structural. We go back and re-approve an abatement that
                                                            we give co-op and condo owners. So one, we need to create parity, equity and fairness there. If you own a co-op or a condo, that&#x2019;s your home and we should be friendly to that. I think
                                                            that we need to stop what I consider a pretty insidious practice or smoke and mirrors game of reassessing the value of commercial property in New York City on an annual basis and not calling
                                                            it a tax. It has become a disincentive for investment in certain sectors. So you have a business, you rent space in an office building, the office building owner gets reassessed that year. The
                                                            assessment goes up. And then that landlord is required to either pass on the costs or eat the costs. The landlord will pass on the costs and, of course, that adds to the cost of doing business,
                                                            becomes a disincentive for job growth. People start looking at, well what are my options here, do I have to be in New York City? Might I be in a suburb of New York City. Might I take my business
                                                            to Newark or somewhere else? So I think we have to stop that practice, call it a tax and be transparent about it. We can&#x2019;t continue to backfill the budget gaps with that property class.

Decision-making by polling is the absence of profiles in courage. Leaders should
                                                            be determined based on their convictions and their views. John Kennedy&#x2019;s book &#x201C;Profiles in Courage&#x201D; needs to be read by everyone running for office. Or anybody who wants
                                                            to be a leader. You have to have convictions and then go forward. Decision-making based on polls is not the way to run a government.

The fact of the matter is that the cost of allowing
                                                            libraries to open 7 days a week is in the tens of millions of dollars, a drop in the bucket in the realm of the city&#x2019;s $70 billion annual budget, and is always subject to this ridiculous

                                                            I agree that housing is one of the most enormous problems we have right now in the city. And what we need to do, what I&#x2019;m going to do when I&#x2019;m mayor, is fight to get the city control over its rent laws again, so we can protect rent-stabilized
                                                            tenants, keep those units. I want to build 40,000 new middle-income housing units over the next 10 years, keep the production of housing the mayor has planned and expand for lower-income units
                                                            as well. I want to make sure we take the 100,000 distressed housing units out there in the city, make them livable, hold the slumlords or the banks accountable, get that money back for New Yorkers.
                                                            I also want to create for homeless folks a real program where they can get rent subsidies to get out of the shelters. I wish that there was one easy answer. There isn&#x2019;t. It&#x2019;s a
                                                            puzzle and we&#x2019;re going to have to keep aggressively putting the pieces in it, so we&#x2019;re adding more housing at different income levels across the city. I&#x2019;m also looking at
                                                            the idea of a property tax cap to preserve affordable housing in neighborhoods where it&#x2019;s a little economically challenging to build new affordable housing.

                                                            I think as we look at the rise of homelessness, and I think now we probably have over 50,000 people who are homeless in the City of New York. The things that have not been done that we saw that worked before: Things like legal services that prevented
                                                            homelessness, looking at vouchers and creating priority for homeless families and Section 8 vouchers. Things like putting the money that we have that&#x2019;s been sitting on the side for the
                                                            Housing Authority back in renovation, making sure that we renovate and bring those units online. All of that could go into reducing homelessness. I think that we&#x2019;ve gone away from that.
                                                            That helped to keep homelessness down in earlier years of this administration. We need to go back and do some of that also. And then part of it is we have to build additional housing. I&#x2019;ve
                                                            spoken about that earlier, the need to construct new housing and as we look at affordable housing particularly for poor families. I think whether it&#x2019;s 80-20 (People receive tax breaks
                                                            to be able to build. They have to provide 20 percent of the units that are affordable.) or 70-30, I think the opportunity to create more affordable units will drive homelessness down. And last
                                                            but not least, if we don&#x2019;t tie social services in to families who have become homeless, once they find apartments, we need to maintain the services to them. That will keep them in apartments
                                                            and keep them from coming back into the homeless population again.

                                                            We have a structural challenge that goes well beyond infrastructure. The housing itself is falling apart. Public housing has fallen into terrible neglect because of neglect by the federal government. And we have a problem that the present rise in property
                                                            values is making it impossible to build affordability. Incentives that we&#x2019;ve had simply don&#x2019;t keep up. One thing that we have to be careful not to do, though, is to have a zoning
                                                            policy that is so far-leaning toward housing that we carve out any ability to have reasonable middle-class jobs. Right now if you want to have a back office space for your big business and you

The 60 percent now makes about as much profit as the 80 percent used to and does give you room to do middle-class housing. But we are a growing city, and in the mayor&#x2019;s
