                <p><span>T</span>he faster pace of life and business in the digital age sets expectations among customers and business partners. <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/01/technology/impatient-web-users-flee-slow-loading-sites.html" target="_blank">Research</a> shows people visit a website less often if it is slower than a competitor’s by just 250 milliseconds — or a quarter of a second. Whether a customer is seeking information or completing a transaction, efficiency matters. In fact, one <a href="http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/customer-service-wait-times-could-be-costing-americans-more-than-100-billion-a-year-new-survey-finds-267196691.html" target="_blank">study</a> finds that 35 percent of consumers stopped doing business with companies that provide poor service. </p>
                <p>As other sources of friction are removed, hand-signed documents that must be faxed, scanned and emailed, or returned by mail have emerged as a major culprit costing organizations precious time and, in turn, customers and revenue. The U.S. government alone <a href="http://www.reginfo.gov/public/do/PRAReport?operation=11" target="_blank">reports</a> a total of 11.4 billion hours are spent each year collecting information from about 10,000 official forms. In addition, governments and businesses face the cost in time and money to store, track and redo records if they’re lost in the shuffle.</p>
                <p><em>Quite simply, paper is no longer the way to do business when every second counts.</em></p>

                <p>Speed is a major benefit of moving from paper-based to digital transactions. Paper documents requiring ink signatures must be mailed back and forth — taking days, weeks or even months longer to complete than digital processes accomplishing the same task in seconds.</p>

                        <p>The Nevada Department of Transportation (NDOT) has gone digital for the execution of contracts related to road construction and repair projects. Teresa Schlaffer, a business process analyst at NDOT, says that contracts executed digitally get completed weeks faster than those approved using paper. After conducting a pilot in which NDOT tested five digital contracting processes, the organization is now moving documents through 200+ digital processes — each of which may require up to 60 different approvals and digital signatures. As a result, the department has reduced the number of days required to execute a road-repair contract from 28 to just four.</p>

                            <p>In September 2014, a flash flood washed out almost 50 miles of Interstate 15, a major artery linking Nevada with Utah. The road had to be reconstructed as quickly as possible to get cars and trucks through. Fortunately, NDOT had already begun using paperless transactions for road repair contracts. </p>

As a cornerstone of the world economy, speed and security matter both when executing trades and communicating that information to the world. The NYSE licenses data to 900 market data vendors and 270,000 professional subscribers. The licenses, which previously took up to a week to process using paper documents, are now granted in less than 24 hours using DocuSign. The digital process, which has built in bank-grade encryption and multi-factor authentication for digital signatures, passed stringent requirements for security and enforceability at the NYSE. "The feedback," says Peggy Sullivan, director for market data administration at NYSE, "has been outstanding."</p>

                        <p>Dr. BJ Rimel, a gynecologic oncologist at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles, had a problem. She and her colleagues couldn’t find enough participants for cancer research studies. That changed in 2013, when they did away with paper consent forms. Instead of having to fill out paperwork in the doctor’s office, interested participants could sign up online to be contacted about research opportunities. The result, says Rimel, is more applications and much greater participation in research that can save lives. “We were able to close some studies that had been open for years without being able to find the right people,” she says. “We were able to find participants very quickly online to complete our research faster and accelerate new treatments.”</p>

                <h3>Join the Digital Document Revolution</h3>
                <p>In an age when speed of access, service and execution make all the difference between success and failure for organizations of every size and stripe, and efficiency is being pursued at every level, digital transactions are emerging as the new standard for creating a truly frictionless economy. Transactions that require paper documents and ink signatures to be mailed back and forth, scanned or faxed simply can’t compete with more efficient and secure digital transactions.</p>
