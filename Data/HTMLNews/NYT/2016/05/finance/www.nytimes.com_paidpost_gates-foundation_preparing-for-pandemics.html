If a similar outbreak were to happen today, the death toll could reach 360 million, despite the availability of vaccines as well as <a href="http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/12/1/pdfs/05-0979.pdf" target="_blank">modern antiviral and antibacterial drugs</a>.

Migration and urban expansion are bringing people into closer proximity to each other and animals, particularly in developing countries, increasing the likelihood of viruses spreading. And from Zika to Ebola, MERS to H1N1, more diseases are appearing about which we have little or no knowledge.</p> <figure class="inner-image left-inner-image"> <picture> <source media="(min-width: 540px)" srcset="//paidpost-assets.nyt.com/paidpost/gates-foundation/preparing-for-pandemics/images/spanish-flu-ambulance-desktop.jpg"></source> <source media="(max-width: 539px)" srcset="//paidpost-assets.nyt.com/paidpost/gates-foundation/preparing-for-pandemics/images/spanish-flu-ambulance-mobile.jpg"></source> <img src="//paidpost-assets.nyt.com/paidpost/gates-foundation/preparing-for-pandemics/images/spanish-flu-ambulance-desktop.jpg"> </picture> <figcaption><span class="caption-intro">MEMBERS OF THE </span>Red Cross Motor Corps, wearing masks to prevent further spread of the Spanish flu, carry a patient on a stretcher into an ambulance in 1918. <span class="image-credit"></span></figcaption> </figure> <p>New vaccines and treatments must be found, along with ways to speed up the research and development process. Additional tools are needed, too. Systems must be built that can quickly identify and contain outbreaks. These range from stronger primary health care networks to coordination tools such as emergency operations centers (EOCs), hubs where governments and their partner organizations can gather to review data and formulate strategies.</p><p>Of course, financing is vital: An independent international commission recently concluded that at least <a href="http://nam.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Neglected-Dimension-of-Global-Security.pdf" target="_blank">$4.5 billion</a> a year is needed to protect against pandemics. </p><p>“There’s a shared vulnerability globally to these threats — and in that regard we have a collective responsibility in being prepared,” says Tim Evans, senior director of health, nutrition and population at the World Bank Group.</p> <h2>Ramping Up R & D</h2> <p>When experts talk about the public health response to pandemics, they cite several concerns: the continuing threat of an influenza pandemic, threats from existing diseases that mutate, and threats from diseases not yet encountered. All demand more investment in the research and development of diagnostics, vaccines and treatments.</p><p>Not to be underestimated is tackling known threats. “More research is needed in order to understand the immune system and come up with a universal flu vaccine that would leave us prepared for any influenza virus,” says Art Reingold, head of epidemiology at the University of California, Berkeley’s School of Public Health. “We don’t have that now, and a lot more biomedical research will be needed.”</p><p>In addition, much promise lies in developing vaccine systems based on messenger RNA (mRNA) — mRNAs are carriers of genetic information and blueprints of proteins.

While diseases can spread in a matter of weeks, regulatory practices can take years to revise. </p><p>This must change, says Jeremy Farrar, director of the London-based Wellcome Trust, one of the world’s largest medical charities. “We have to look at the regulatory pathway for drugs and vaccines and work out ways to streamline those so they are as efficient as possible without putting patients at risk,” he says.</p><p>Some progress is being made, with the development by the World Health Organization (WHO) of the <a href="http://www.who.int/csr/research-and-development/en/" target="_blank">R&D Blueprint</a>. This initiative aims to close the gap between when an international public health emergency is declared and the development of diagnostics, vaccines and drugs that can save lives and contain disease outbreaks. </p><p>The WHO is also exploring what financial models might stimulate investment, says Sylvie Briand, the organization’s director of pandemic and epidemic diseases. “The current business model is driven by the market,” she says. “And for some pathogens, there is no market currently.

So whether building resilience against disease, fighting an emerging crisis, better understanding the links between human and animal health, or coping with the aftermath, tackling pandemics demands an approach that involves government, civil society and business. Most of all, a successful approach must facilitate the sharing of both resources and information.</p><p>An important part of this is a 2005 agreement coordinated by the WHO in which 196 countries have agreed to collaborate on preventing and responding to public health crises. Through the <a href="http://www.who.int/ihr/en/" target="_blank">International Health Regulations (IHR)</a>, the WHO informs countries of public health risks and works with local partners so that all parties are in a better position to detect, report and respond. </p><p>Disease monitoring and tracking systems are also critical tools. One system, <a href="http://www.promedmail.org/aboutus/" target="_blank">ProMED </a>(the Program for Monitoring Emerging Diseases) provides an online platform on which outbreaks of emerging infectious diseases and toxins can be reported.</p> </section> <section class="graphic accordion-graphic"> <h2>Pandemic Lessons</h2> <div class="JKAccordionView"> <div class="accordion"> <div class="accordion-track"> <dl class="accordion-item"> <dt class="accordion-title"> <span class="glyph">&nbsp;</span> <span class="label"><strong>Spanish Flu</strong></span> <span class="icon"><img src="//paidpost-assets.nyt.com/paidpost/gates-foundation/preparing-for-pandemics/images/icons/icon-spanish-flu.svg"></span> </dt> <dd class="accordion-content-wrapper"> <div class="accordion-content"> <picture class="accordion-image"> <source media="(min-width: 540px)" srcset="//paidpost-assets.nyt.com/paidpost/gates-foundation/preparing-for-pandemics/images/accordion/1-spanish-flu-desktop.jpg"></source> <source media="(max-width: 539px)" srcset="//paidpost-assets.nyt.com/paidpost/gates-foundation/preparing-for-pandemics/images/accordion/1-spanish-flu-mobile.jpg"></source> <img src="//paidpost-assets.nyt.com/paidpost/gates-foundation/preparing-for-pandemics/images/accordion/1-spanish-flu-desktop.jpg"> </picture> <div class="accordion-text"> <p>With governments still reeling from World War I, there was no coordinated response to the pandemic that claimed as many as 100 million lives.

During the Ebola crisis, for example, ArcelorMittal, which has extensive mining operations in Liberia, established a series of regular conference calls.

When the Ebola virus appeared in Lagos, the Nigerian government called the Abuja polio EOC asking for a team to be sent to the city.

Accelerated regulatory approvals could, for example, be applied to non-emergencies, speeding the time it takes to bring lifesaving diagnostics, vaccines and medicines to the public.</p><p>A similar principle applies to primary care. “Having a strong universally accessible health system that’s prepared to manage whatever comes across the door is not only good for infectious threats,” says Evans. “It’s great for childhood immunization, antenatal care and the safe delivery of children.” </p><p>So while new science, financing mechanisms, flexible regulations and collaborative platforms provide the support needed to prevent or limit the next crisis, these tools have a beneficial side effect — improving the health and well-being of everyone. “In this interconnected world, it’s important that everybody invests in health,” says WHO’s Briand. “It protects many other investments as well.”</p> </section> <section class="references-container"> <a name="ref" style="margin-top:-160px;
