<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">How thoroughly has <a href="//topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/x/xi_jinping/index.html">Xi Jinping</a> rewritten the rules of Chinese politics? Since he became Communist Party leader in November 2012 and the country&#8217;s president in March 2013, he has pursued an energetic agenda at home and abroad. But experts disagree on just how powerful, and transformative, Mr. Xi is. Some argue that, despite boastful propaganda, he remains largely subservient to the same constraints and interests as his predecessor, <a href="//topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/h/hu_jintao/index.html">Hu Jintao</a>.</p>

<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Christopher K. Johnson of the Washington-based Center for Strategic and International Studies, however, is among those who argue that Mr. Xi is distinctly more powerful than his recent predecessors and is recasting the rules of Chinese politics. In an <a href="https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/china/2015-07-24/chinas-un-separation-powers">article</a> for Foreign Affairs, he and his colleague Scott Kennedy argue that Mr. Xi has vigorously reasserted the role of the Communist Party. Here, Mr. Johnson explains his views:</p>
<div class="q left">Q.</div>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody"><strong>In many ways Chinese politics is deeply secretive these days, even more than in the past. Given that, how well informed can we be about how the Communist Party works?</strong></p>
<div class="a left">A.</div>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Xi Jinpingâs changes to the system have made that job more difficult for everyone â even people who are very close to him. It strikes me that nobody knows entirely whatâs on the mind of Xi Jinping. I think he likes it that way. <span id="more-34479"></span></p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">This is a Maoist element of his personality. He likes keeping everyone off balance. You see it in the way he gives a new policy speech practically once a week, and keeps everyone guessing and running to keep up. So itâs certainly more difficult to find out what exactly is going on on the policy side.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">In terms of who has power, the opacity makes it really difficult to figure out, for example, how influential the other Standing Committee members are. Other than <a href="//sinosphere.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/04/10/exploring-the-fun-side-of-chinas-war-on-corruption/">Wang Qishan</a> [secretary of the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection], with his obvious antigraft portfolio, itâs really difficult to figure out how influential those folks are.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">But we shouldnât make the task too difficult when sometimes itâs right there in your face. There are definitely some observable facts that suggest Xi Jinping is quite powerful.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">The first is that heâs managed to do things his predecessors tried to do and couldnât â in the establishment of the National Security Commission, in the form of a serious anticorruption campaign in the military, in the creation of the Central Leading Group on Comprehensively Deepening Reform. All these things I donât think could have been done by just anyone. I donât subscribe to the theory that this was all just a big consensus that they had within the elite ranks of the party.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Thereâs also his ability to reshape significant elements of foreign policy and significant elements of domestic policy. Those are key indicators, especially so early in his tenure, that this guy has a fair amount of power.</p>
<div class="q left">Q.</div>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody"><strong>The overarching point of your paper is that not only has Mr. Xiâs individual power grown relative to his predecessors, but that the party is back and more powerful. What are the markers?</strong></p>
<div class="a left">A.</div>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">You can see him re-emphasizing the partyâs role in numerous ways, whether itâs a renewed emphasis on party committees in ministerial and even nongovernmental organizations â the establishment of these new leading groups that are assuming an overarching, coordinating role that often in the past was handled by different bodies. The Leading Group on Comprehensively Deepening Reform has in some ways supplanted the State Council in terms of how economic policy is managed.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Weâre also seeing signs that, for example, the partyâs Central Leading Group on Financial and Economic Affairs is providing much more direct policy oversight. Not really implementation, because at the end of the day the ministries are still tasked with implementation, but giving more direction. In the past, its role was effectively pulling together the central economic work conferences twice a year, and playing a significant role in managing the drafting committee for the Five-Year Plan. Other than that, not a whole lot. Now, under Liu Heâs tutelage as general office director of the leading group, theyâve grown the staff substantially. And this time itâs clear that theyâre playing a more hands-on role in drafting the 13th Five-Year Plan than they did in drafting the 12th Five-Year Plan.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">We also see the party itself coming out more publicly, holding news conferences and publishing the activities of the leading groups, at least in summary form. Thatâs as much about telegraphing to everyone in the system where power resides as about the desire to share the information publicly.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Finally, Xi seems to have summarily rejected <a href="//topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/d/deng_xiaoping/index.html">Deng Xiaoping</a>âs reformist call in the 1980s to separate party and government functions as a check on party power. That was a running battle within the party for the ensuing three decades, but Xi has unambiguously ruled in the partyâs favor.</p>
<div class="q left">Q.</div>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody"><strong>That still leaves the question of why. If you want to reinvigorate the state machine, there could be ways of doing that by reinvigorating arrangements that were already in place. But this sounds like you see something different, which is reinvigorating the partyâs particular status.</strong></p>
<div class="a left">A.</div>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">This is very much at the core of who Xi Jinping is and what makes him tick. It very much speaks to his view of himself as something of an instrument of history, even as the savior of the party.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Heâs been put in charge at a very difficult time in the partyâs development. Weâve seen a very strong effort in the ideological and propaganda sphere since he came into power to telegraph the breaking of the history of the regime into three 30-year periods: Mao, then Deng and everybody else, and then Xi Jinping onwards. He sees himself as wearing that mantle and wanting to put the party on the right trajectory.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Thereâs also the broader issue that he feels there needs to be more discipline in the system and in the broader society, and he sees the party as the leading agent to project and enforce that discipline.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">The other thing is heâs a traditional Chinese leader. A lot of observers became convinced during the Hu Jintao era that the internal party democracy and other things they were doing were signs that they were moving toward greater institutionalization. It now appears those were largely parlor tricks by a weak leader to do the best he could with the hand heâd been dealt. Now that a traditional leader has come back to the helm, with the power to execute, theyâve reverted very much back to form.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">This is another characteristic of Xi Jinping. I donât think thereâs a lot of Communism necessarily in his thinking, but thereâs a lot of Leninism, especially with regard to the Leninist structure of the party and how to think of control over the key levers of power.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">If you look at the various tiger cases that have been exposed so far for corruption, you had some very important power centers within the Communist Party system that were not responding to central control â the security services under <a href="//www.nytimes.com/2015/06/12/world/asia/zhou-yongkang-former-security-chief-in-china-gets-life-sentence-for-corruption.html">Zhou Yongkang</a>, the General Office under <a href="//www.nytimes.com/2014/12/23/world/asia/china-opens-inquiry-into-ling-jihua-aide-to-hu-jintao.html">Ling Jihua</a> and certainly the military under <a href="//www.nytimes.com/2015/03/03/world/china-names-14-generals-suspected-of-corruption.html">Xu Caihou-Guo Boxiong</a>. These investigations revealed that there was a lot going on and that the party center did not have control over the key levers of power.</p>
<div class="q left">Q.</div>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody"><strong>What are the implications for how China is run? This is the worldâs second-biggest economy, an increasingly complicated economy and society that still has to be run through the government and State Council. If so much power resides in the party, is that a recipe for dysfunction, or can it work in ways that Westerners might underestimate?</strong></p>
<div class="a left">A.</div>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">To some degree, itâs both. You see the confusion and dysfunction in several ways. One is the confusion in the bureaucracy as to what exactly they should be doing. In the Hu Jintao era, you could pull down the organization chart of the State Council and that was kind of how power flowed. You could go to your ministerial or regulatory overseer within the State Council and have a pretty good sense that the answers you got from them were some reflection of reality and the general direction of policy.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Now thatâs much less true. Iâve certainly seen that myself and hear a lot of stories about it from others, including people who go to the State Council types â the people who are overseeing a particular portfolio â and theyâll tell you something and it will be completely wrong weeks later. You find that they were just not in the loop.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">But it can play out in a different way, as in the recent <a href="//www.nytimes.com/2015/07/28/business/international/chinese-stocks-plummet-in-shanghai-and-shenzhen.html">stock market turbulence</a>. This was probably an example of the system working as Xi Jinping and company would like it to.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">What we saw was this hodgepodge of overreaction responses from the State Council side, very uncoordinated and sloppy. But then the leading group probably intervened â the financial and economic leading group or, more probably, the reform leading group â and slammed heads together. Because then you had, virtually in one day, the Finance Ministry, the Peopleâs Bank of China and even the Insurance Regulatory Commission come out in support of the stabilization measures. It was very clear that somebody in the system had put their thumb on the scale and that must have been Xi.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">So thatâs an example where it looks like that invisible machine was working and had the appropriate effect as far as theyâre concerned. The markets did stabilize after that reassurance, although thatâs a story line that&#8217;s still being written.</p>
<div class="q left">Q.</div>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody"><strong>It sounds like you think the political system and this particular leader are in a pretty robust position for now. Which is contrary to how some observers see it who argue that Xi has quite a brittle hold on power, as does the party.</strong></p>
<div class="a left">A.</div>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">I would distinguish between the partyâs brittleness and Xi Jinpingâs. I can see no empirical evidence to justify the notion that Xi Jinping is somehow not powerful. Iâd need to see a lot more circumscribing of his activity than I see now to convince me of that.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">If someone has him under his thumb within the Standing Committee or among the party elders, show me who it is. I canât see it. My own view is that Xi Jinping is an inconvenient truth for analyses that had suggested that greater institutionalization was leading to a fragmented authoritarianism and the formation of powerful vested interests that constrained the top leader&#8217;s authority.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">I do think that the economy is his biggest Achillesâ heel. If Xi Jinping screws up in a major way, either domestically or in a foreign debacle, the blood would be in the water fairly quickly. But heâs very aware of that, so you see him make tactical adjustments when necessary, most obviously with Japan. The problem for Xi Jinping is when you declare yourself the overseer of everything, itâs hard not to look hypocritical if you want to blame someone else.</p>
<div class="q left">Q.</div>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody"><strong>So a more powerful party under a more powerful leader. What are the other areas of vulnerability? You mentioned the economy.</strong></p>
<div class="a left">A.</div>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Another risk is that the ideology push gets too overbearing for a society that clearly is moving in a different direction. There could be some sort of a backlash at some point.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Another is that they fail to understand the shifting ground in U.S.-China relations, and that the summit [in Washington in September] goes poorly and the relationship becomes much more contentious. In talking to Chinese officials, I have been struck by their failure to understand the effect of things like the <a href="//www.nytimes.com/2015/07/10/us/office-of-personnel-management-hackers-got-data-of-millions.html">Office of Personnel Management hack</a>, and the <a href="//www.nytimes.com/aponline/2015/06/15/world/asia/ap-as-china-south-china-sea.html">island building</a> [in the South China Sea], how those things resonate for average Americans.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">My sense is that this is going to be a messy process for China, especially between now and 2020, when the transformational agenda put forward by Xi is supposed to have achieved &#8220;substantial progress.&#8221; There are going to be fits and starts, and the potential for serious internal wrangling and discord. These are hard things that theyâre trying to do, and you have made-men within that system who are going to lose power, lose authority, lose money if the reforms go through.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Thatâs different from when Deng Xiaoping launched his reforms. They were coming out of the Cultural Revolution, and really had nothing to lose. Thatâs not the way it is now. Lots of people have things to lose.</p>
