<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody"><em>This interview, the sixth in a series on political topics, discusses philosophical issues concerning economic policy. My interviewee is <a href="//philosophy.wisc.edu/hausman/">Daniel Hausman</a>, professor of philosophy at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. He is the author of âPreference, Value, Choice and Welfare.â â Gary Gutting</em></p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody"><strong>Gary Gutting.</strong>: It would seem that in situations like the current Greek crisis, we should be able to rely on economics to tell us which policies are most likely to work. But does the discipline have sufficient predictive power to play an important role in our debates about public policy?</p>
<div class="w190 right module">
<div class="entry">
<blockquote>Economists do not practice pure science. They evaluate policies almost exclusively by examining how well they satisfy peopleâs preferences.</p></blockquote>
</div>
</div>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody"><strong>Daniel Hausman</strong>: Speaking of predictive power can be misleading. Scientists (and I include economists) are not fortunetellers. Their theories only allow them to predict what will happen if initial conditions are satisfied. Elementary physics enables us to predict how long it will take an object to fall to the ground, provided that gravity is the only force acting on the object. Predicting how long it will take a leaf falling from a tree to reach the ground or where it will land is a much harder problem.<br />
<div class="w190 right"><figure class="media photo promo" itemprop="" itemscope="" itemid="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/07/15/opinion/15stoneWeb/15stoneWeb-thumbWide.jpg" itemtype="//schema.org/ImageObject" role="group"><span class="visually-hidden">Photo</span><div class="image"><img itemprop="url" itemid="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/07/15/opinion/15stoneWeb/15stoneWeb-thumbWide.jpg" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/07/15/opinion/15stoneWeb/15stoneWeb-thumbWide.jpg" id="100000003799535" width="190" height="126" alt="Daniel Hausman"   /><meta itemprop="height" content="126"><meta itemprop="width" content="190"></div><figcaption class="caption" itemprop="description"><span class="caption-text">Daniel Hausman</span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder"><span class="visually-hidden">Credit</span> Robert Streiffer</span></figcaption></figure></div></p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">The problems that we want economists to help us solve are more like predicting how leaves will fall on a windy day than predicting how objects will fall in a vacuum. Economic phenomena are affected by a very large number of causal factors of many different kinds. The Greek economic crisis is extraordinarily complex, and it has as many political causes as economic ones. Standard economic theory provides useful tools, but it focuses on a very limited range of causal factors â mainly the choices of millions of consumers, investors and firms â which it simplifies and assumes to be governed entirely by self-interested pursuit of goods or financial gain. When one recognizes all the other factors that affect economic outcomes, from government policies to the whims of nature, it is easy to see that economists cannot predict the economic future with any precision.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">In John Stuart Millâs view, which I believe is basically correct, economics is a separate and inexact science. It is separate from the other social sciences, because it focuses on only a small number of the causal factors that influence social phenomena. It is inexact because the phenomena with which it deals are influenced by many other causes than the few it focuses on.<br />
<span id="more-157642"></span></p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody"><strong>G.G.</strong>: But then what is the practical value of an inexact science?</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody"><strong>D. H.</strong>: Mill gives the example of the science of tides. Although the conclusions deducible from Newtonian mechanics, given the positions of the sun and moon, do not predict the nuances of tidal behavior in a particular harbor, they capture the most important causes. Similarly, economic theory identifies the most important causes of economic phenomena. The analytical tools of economics thereby help people avoid jumping to fallacious conclusions.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody"><strong>G.G.</strong>: Could you give an example of how this might work in economics?</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody"><strong>D.H.</strong>: For a much simpler illustration than the case of Greece, consider current debates about whether to raise the minimum wage. This is not just an economic question, because the minimum wage may have all sorts of effects. (It might, for example, shore up families and improve the lives of children.) One might believe, naÃ¯vely, that the economic effect would be simply to raise the wages of those who are currently earning the minimum wages. But basic economic theory maintains that to protect their profits in the face of a higher minimum wage, firms will reorganize their production so as to employ fewer unskilled workers, whose labor is now more expensive. The logic is impeccable, but the conclusion depends on many assumptions that may not be true. It may not be easy for firms to find substitutes for unskilled labor, and with higher wages, unskilled workers may be more productive. Economic theory helps to identify the relevant factors and to set the terms of intelligent debate.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody"><strong>G.G.</strong>: O.K., but then the debate becomes about whether employers can find adequate substitutes for unskilled labor and whether, with higher wages, unskilled workers will be sufficiently more productive. If economists can&#8217;t offer us reliable answers to such questions, how, practically speaking, are we better off? More generally, aren&#8217;t the main economic questions in public policy debates ones that economists either can&#8217;t answer or else disagree about?</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody"><strong>D.H.</strong> Since the effects of the minimum wage will vary across industries and as the economy evolves, it is hard to settle these questions definitively. Even when there are definite answers, there is an additional reason economists may not speak with one voice. Unlike geneticists or philosophers, many economists are political and financial advisers, spokesmen, and even media figures, who owe their livelihoods to serving the interests of their employers rather than to the excellence of their research.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Economic conclusions are also immediately relevant to political ideologies. Although probably no more ideologically biased than anyone else, economists, unlike neurologists or paleontologists, deal with matters that bear heavily on political ideologies and nitty-gritty economic interests.</p>
<div class="w190 right module">
<div class="entry">
<blockquote>Economic knowledge is no cure for bias and shortsightedness. It does not benefit us if we make bad use of it.</p></blockquote>
</div>
</div>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody"><strong>G.G.</strong>: Can we regard the findings of economics as purely scientific conclusions? Or do they also involve value judgments?</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody"><strong>D.H.:</strong> Many economists would maintain that their role in policy is, like engineers, merely to specify how to achieve the objectives at which politicians aim. Sometimes this is an apt description of the contribution they make, but most economists also take for granted that public policies should enhance peopleâs well-being. So economists assess policies mainly in terms of their welfare consequences. Since economists regard peopleâs preferences as motivating their choices as well as indicating what is good for them, they evaluate policies almost exclusively by examining how well they satisfy peopleâs preferences.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Most economists would concede that other values, such as freedom, rights and justice should also influence public policies, but they regard their policy expertise as largely limited to the assessment of the welfare consequences of legislation and regulations.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody"><strong>G.G.</strong>: What help, then, are economists in debates about public policy?</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody"><strong>D.H.</strong>: They tell us which are the right questions to ask if we seek to satisfy preferences. Knowing what to ask is enlightening even when it is hard to find the answers. Although helpful in these ways, economic knowledge is no cure for bias and shortsightedness. Knowledge does not benefit us if we make bad use of it.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody"><strong>G.G.</strong>: Can you cite some positive contributions of economists to public policy?</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody"><strong>D.H.</strong>: Economists have chalked up some huge successes. Ben Bernankeâs grasp of macroeconomics arguably prevented a second Great Depression after the 2008 global crisis. Despite the strong private interests that may favor tariffs against particular imports, economists have taught the public that tariffs are generally destructive. Economists have shown governments how to use markets to limit pollution with much greater efficiency than by means of direct regulation. Without the nitty-gritty calculations of economists, legislatures would not be able to estimate the effects of tax rates on government revenue.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Although itâs much more controversial, I believe that the criticisms of austerity, particularly in the context of Europe, are exceptionally important â although the evidence consists, regrettably, in large part of the devastation austerity has caused.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody"><strong>G.G.:</strong> How are those of us who are not experts able to judge when controversies like those concerning austerity reflect the biases of economists â toward, say, liberal or conservative views?</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody"><strong>D.H.</strong>: In my view, the question is not whether economists are biased, but whether their biases lead them to defend false conclusions. How are most people â who are not experts â to judge? In the case of successful mature sciences, such as physics or biology, the sensible course is to rely on the consensus among experts (as opposed to some website that tells you what youâd like to believe). It is much harder to know what to believe about economics, because its success is controversial, because there is often no consensus among economists, and because economic and political interests and ideologies motivate people to distort and deny what economists have established.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">First-rate journalism helps, but journalists have their own limitations; and some make matters worse by presenting as credible all sides of an issue, regardless of how unsupported some positions may be. Given how easy it is to make specious arguments for economic conclusions, it very difficult for most people to judge which economic conclusions are correct and whom to trust. Our political leaders are unfortunately in no better position.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody"><strong>G.G.</strong>: I&#8217;ve found convincing Paul Krugman&#8217;s arguments that austerity hasn&#8217;t worked to solve Greece&#8217;s economic problems and that the best path is to forgive some of their debt and to put more emphasis on stimulating their economy. Since there is no consensus among top-level economists about Krugman&#8217;s views, should I withhold judgment on his recommendations? That would make it seem that, when there&#8217;s a sharp division within the community of economists, we might just as well flip a coin to decide what to do. Are there still ways of making a rational decision when the experts disagree on key points?</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody"><strong>D. H.</strong>: Thatâs a really hard question. Krugman has made the case for stimulus masterfully, and there is now overwhelming agreement among economists that the stimulus in the United States after the 2008 crisis reduced unemployment. But at the time, other Nobel laureates, such as Robert Lucas, were arguing vigorously against stimulus. While I would guess that today most economists, including a number who are not sympathetic toward the Greek government, would favor much more expansionary fiscal policy in the European Union, there is nothing like unanimity. And that leaves those who are not experts themselves in a very difficult spot.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Despite this problem, neither individuals nor governments are about to judge policies by flipping coins, if for no other reason than that the theoretical disagreements among economists in this case, as in many others, align with political disagreements. Liberal economists who support programs that aim to promote the interests of the less well-off are more strongly in favor of stimulus, while conservative economists with more confidence in markets (and a more complacent view of the social benefits provided by the financial industry) support austerity as a way of increasing business confidence.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Believing that an economist shares oneâs politics is obviously no proof that his views are correct. Yet people are bound to follow the lead of economists who favor their objectives. If people realize that it is hard for them to judge what policy is the right one, and they support a policy of stimulus or austerity mainly because they believe that its proponents are on their political side, then they should not be very confident of their economic views, and they should pay special attention to contrary arguments. (Here I sound like an impractical philosopher.)</p>

<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody"><strong>G.G.</strong>: Some readers might suspect youâre missing the real problem in debates on economics in the United States. They would argue that Republicans are in the grip of demonstrably false economic claims â what Krugman calls âzombie-ideasââ about, for example, the value of tax cuts, the dangers of deficits and the folly of government regulation, and that these ideas do not reflect serious economic thinkingÂ but are just expressions of blind ideology or blatant self-interest that allow for no meaningful discussion. Whatâs your view?</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody"><strong>D.H.</strong>: As a philosopher of economics, I have the benefit of knowing some economics and also of having reflected on the formidable difficulties of establishing or refuting economic theories. Thereâs no way to look at what happens in the economy and conclude with confidence that some economic theory is true or false. So, on the one hand, I think that Krugman is overly certain of the value of Keynesian models. Their worth is consistent with the evidence, but not fully established. Yet Krugman is also refreshingly frank about the mistakes he has made. On the other hand, it is virtually an article of faith among Republicans that large tax cuts will provide incentives that will put the economy on a faster growth path. Their economic logic is fine. Other things being equal, lower income taxes encourage investment and work. But economic theory does not say how large the effect is, and large tax cuts in the past have had little effect on the trend of economic growth.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Moreover, states with higher taxes do not grow more slowly than states with lower taxes. Gov. Sam Brownback of Kansas billed his major tax cuts as an experiment designed to show that cutting taxes would spur economic growth. Yet the failure of that experiment has no effect on those committed to the dogma that lower taxes will greatly increase growth. I am not saying that this belief has been decisively refuted; there are many possible explanations for the fact that the expected growth never materialized. But confidence in tax cuts as an elixir for sustained economic growth has no scientific justification.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Serious political discussion is always a challenge, but itâs wrong to blame economists for the current polarization.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody"><strong>G.G.</strong>: It seems clear that we donât have a science of economics that will in general provide reliable predictions about the consequences of particular policies. Can we at least expect economists to unite in rejecting political proposals that have no scientific support?</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody"><strong>D.H.</strong>: Reputable academic economists are united in rejecting the genuinely unfounded economic claims that politicians make. There may not be complete unanimity, because some economists are ideologues without scientific scruples. Furthermore, as the example of climate change shows, powerful interests can make an overwhelming scientific consensus appear to the public to be a matter of scientific controversy.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody"><strong>G.G</strong>.: How, in conclusion, would you sum up the prospects for using economics as a scientific basis for our discussions of public policy?</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody"><strong>D.H.</strong>: I am worried about the possibility that powerful interests can undermine the authority of science in general, and I am deeply distressed at the jejune relativism that encourages members of sects to maintain in effect, âwe have our own truth.â Given how intensely economics bears on peopleâs interests, economists face more serious threats to their integrity than organic chemists or astronomers. In addition, as we discussed at the beginning, the questions that economists are called upon to address are very difficult to answer. So we cannot look to economists to solve our policy problems. They address only some of the relevant factors, and they often disagree.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">There are cognitive limits to what can be learned about such a complicated system as a modern market economy, and there are practical and political limits to our ability to make use of what can be learned. Within these limits, economics can be of use. I fear this is faint praise.</p>
