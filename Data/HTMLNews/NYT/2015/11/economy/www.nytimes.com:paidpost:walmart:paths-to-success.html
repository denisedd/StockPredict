<p class="desktop-only" style="font-weight: 200; font-size: 1.15em; line-height: 1.45em;">It would be hard to overstate the value of “engaged” employees. Workers at all levels who are interested and invested in their work, supported by their managers, and emotionally committed to their employers can have a tremendous impact on not only their organization’s success but also the U.S. economy.<br><br></p>
<p class="mobile-only">It would be hard to overstate the value of “engaged” employees. Workers at all levels who are interested and invested in their work, supported by their managers, and emotionally committed to their employers can have a tremendous impact on not only their organization’s success but also the U.S. economy.</p>
<p>According to a 2013 study by Gallup, when organizations successfully engage their customers and employees, they experience a 240% boost across key business outcomes compared with organizations that don’t. These include increased productivity, workers who feel empowered to do what is right for customers and customers who, in turn, spend more time with the brand.</p>
<p>“Engaged employees are more attentive and vigilant,” Jim Harter Ph.D., chief scientist of workplace management and wellbeing at Gallup Research, explained in an interview with “Harvard Business Review.” “They look out for the needs of their coworkers and the overall enterprise, because they personally ‘own’ the result of their work and that of the organization.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yet Gallup also reported that currently only 30 percent of the approximately 100 million Americans with full-time jobs report being engaged and inspired at work. That means 70 percent of U.S. workers are either “not engaged” (50 percent), which is to say they’re just kind of going through the motions, or “actively disengaged” (20 percent), meaning deeply unhappy. The annual cost of workplace disenchantment to the U.S. economy is $450 billion to $550 billion. It is assessed in things like increased likelihood of employee theft, negatively influenced co-workers, reduction in productivity, absenteeism and lost customers.</p>
<p>The good news is that company initiatives to build worker engagement can reap major dividends. <a href="http://www.mckinsey.com/insights/organization/motivating_people_getting_beyond_money" target="_blank">McKinsey &amp; Company</a> has found these kinds of programs may be even more effective at boosting employee motivation than financial incentives, like cash bonuses, increased base pay, and stock options. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Smart employers are increasingly making it a strategic priority to engage employees and Walmart is among them.</p>

<p>To ensure that every employee can find a clear path to advance, as these employees have, the retail company has launched a new program, called Pathways. It includes a series of YouTube-like videos that provide everything from job training to basic business and math skills to guidance on résumé writing and interviewing. Employees, or “associates,” as Walmart refers to them, then work with their supervisors to implement what they have learned. When new hires complete the program, typically in about six months, they become eligible for pay raises and performance bonuses.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Melissa Kersey, Walmart’s senior vice president of human resources, says the program grew out of a “deep dive” into what associates and applicants around the country said they wanted most. “The number-one thing they asked for,” she says, “was training and development to get to the next level.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Our future is dependent upon our associates,” Kersey says, “so we’ve got to invest in them.”</p>

<p>When Donnie Dean began working as a cashier at a Walmart supercenter in Conway, Arkansas, six years ago, he was 18 and had just left his hometown, Pine Bluff, Arkansas, to attend the University of Central Arkansas. He hoped the job would help him pay for school and support his family. He never imagined it would open so many doors.</p>
<p>While attending school full-time, Dean moved steadily up the ranks, making it a point to learn and do everything he could in the store. When the need arose, he even jumped in to mix paint or decorate cakes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Those cakes were failures,” Dean, now 24, admits with a rueful laugh, “but I tried!”&nbsp;</p>
<p>Everything else about Dean’s time in the store, though, was a success. At 19, he took on his first supervisory role, and by the time he completed his B.B.A. in management information systems, in 2014, Dean was the store’s operations manager, with more than 80 people reporting to him.&nbsp;</p>
<figure class="media-image right-fl fade-on-view"><img id="undefined" src="//paidpost-assets.nyt.com/paidpost/walmart/paths-to-success/images/Side-Option7-DONNIE.jpg" alt="" data-alignment="right-fl"><figcaption class="caption"><span class="caption-text"></span><span class="credit"> James Gibbard for T Brand Studio</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>“I gained a lot of leadership knowledge from that job,” he says, looking back, “more than any leadership class I took.”</p>
<p>After graduation, Dean was selected to work at Walmart’s home office in Bentonville, Arkansas, as part of a new company STEM initiative, placing employees with degrees in science, technology, engineering and math in technology positions. He has since been promoted to senior systems administrator in the information-security division.</p>
<p>He credits his achievements to his mom’s unwavering support and the “awesome managers” who’ve mentored him, as well as his own willingness to work hard, take risks, keep learning and be part of a team.</p>
<p>These days, Dean is trying to learn everything he can in his new role. And after that? “The sky’s the limit,” he says. “I feel like this is not the end. It’s just the beginning of something even better than what it was before.”</p>

<section class="content">
<p>Not long after Tanya Berner, then a 19-year-old college student, was hired as a temporary part-time cashier at a Walmart in Aurora, Colorado, in 2003, one of the store’s co-managers presented her with an unexpected opportunity: A department manager was on leave. Would she like to take over temporarily?</p>
<p>“I said, ‘Well, I haven’t been here very long,’” Berner, now 31, recalls, “and he said, ‘Tanya, you can go as far as you want with the company. There are unreachable limits.’” That co-manager’s words, Berner says, have “just stuck with me.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>Berner took the temporary job, which led to a permanent one and then to a series of promotions and eventually to the role she recently assumed: store manager of a Walmart in Sterling, Colorado. Her new job marks the achievement of a long-held goal.</p>
<figure class="media-image left-fl fade-on-view"><img id="undefined" src="//paidpost-assets.nyt.com/paidpost/walmart/paths-to-success/images/quote-tanya-berner.jpg" alt="" data-alignment="left-fl" style="border-bottom: 0px;"><figcaption class="caption"><span class="caption-text"></span><span class="credit"> </span></figcaption></figure>
<p>“When that co-manager said ‘you can go as high as you want,’ I set my sights on becoming store manager. I wanted my name at the top of a receipt,” she says. “That’s a very big honor to have within the company.” Now, as store manager, her name is printed atop – and stands behind -- every transaction at her store.</p>
<p>Berner, who is still pursuing her college degree on a part-time basis, knows she couldn’t have reached her goal without the help of her mentors and co-workers within Walmart, whom she calls “family.” She says she hopes to rise further in order to extend her ability to have a positive impact on the people with whom she works and on Walmart’s customers.</p>
<p>“We have the ability, based on the leadership we display in the facility, to affect our customers’ opinion and trust in the company as a whole,” she says. “That’s my overall goal: to make sure Walmart carries a good name —<span style="font-size: 1rem; line-height: 1.4375rem;">&nbsp;because they’ve sure done good for me, and I want to share that.”</span></p>

<section class="content">
<p>Carlos Gomez calls his decision to take his first job with Walmart, as a department manager at a store in Cerritos, California, in 1993, a “no-brainer.” The company offered him not only a significantly higher hourly rate than he’d made after three and a half years working for a competitor, but also better hours and a clearer role.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As a young man, 19 years old, a regular Monday through Friday, 7 a.m. to 4 p.m. schedule, with nights and weekends off to spend with family and friends, seemed like a dream —<span style="font-size: 1rem; line-height: 1.4375rem;">&nbsp;an especially sweet one, in that it allowed his mother to take a break from the factory job she’d long worked to support the family.</span></p>
<p>What Gomez, a high school graduate who never attended college, didn’t predict was how far that dream would take him. Today, after multiple promotions and more than 21 years at the company, Gomez, now 40, is a market manager overseeing nine stores in the Los Angeles/Orange County, California, area that collectively serve around 300,000 customers weekly, 2,500-2,800 employees, and, he estimates, around $50 million in inventory.&nbsp;</p>
<figure class="media-image right-fl fade-on-view"><img src="//paidpost-assets.nyt.com/paidpost/walmart/paths-to-success/images/Side-Option5-Carlos.jpg" alt="" data-alignment="right-fl" style="border-bottom: 0px;"><figcaption class="caption"><span class="caption-text"></span><span class="credit"> </span></figcaption></figure>
<p>He finds the responsibility to be challenging and exciting. “It’s like running your own business, and that requires pretty much a little of everything,” he says. “But that’s the thrill of it all.”</p>
<p>Another thing Gomez was surprised to discover, after joining Walmart, is how closely its values align with those his parents had instilled in him. “Hard work was something I was raised with,” he says. “They brought me up to have honesty and integrity” and to treat people with respect.</p>
<p>Although he has worked hard to get where he is today and to help others advance, Gomez marvels at the opportunities and support he has been given along the way.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“There are still days I scratch my head and think ‘how did I get here?’” he says. “I’m very humbled by what I do.”<br><br></p>
