<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">What are the most important aspects in choosing a restaurant for breakfast, lunch or dinner: cost, speed, taste, heathful menu options, location or something else?</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Do you ever think about a restaurant&#8217;s image &#8212; or your own &#8212; in making your decision? Is it cool to eat at certain places and not others?</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody"><span id="more-155845"></span></p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">In <a href="//www.nytimes.com/2015/03/08/business/mcdonalds-seeks-its-fast-food-soul.html">&#8220;McDonaldâs Seeks Its Fast-Food Soul,&#8221;</a> Stephanie Strom writes:</p>
<blockquote><p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">McDonaldâs is having an identity crisis.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">For years, it has lurched from showcasing new items â salads! Egg White Delight McMuffins! sliced apples! â to mining nostalgia for its basic Big Macs and fries. Its core customers still line up at the drive-through window for cheap, quick cups of coffee and hash browns. But the company is also trying to appeal to more finicky eaters who have moved onto upstart competitors like Smashburger and Chipotle, which market their quality ingredients and food customization.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Can McDonaldâs be both fast and bespoke? Cheap and high-quality?</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Steve Easterbrook seems to think so. Mr. Easterbrook took over as the chief executive of McDonaldâs on March 1, and last week he was in Las Vegas, where the company presented franchisees and suppliers with a new vision of McDonaldâs. That âdestination,â as it was called, was McDonaldâs as âa modern, progressive burger and breakfast restaurantâ where âcustomization and made to orderâ are essential and where executives âalign our food story around the consumerâs definition of quality and value.â</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">&#8230; Once, McDonaldâs was a place where every American ate now and then. But the fast-food market has splintered, like many other parts of the economy, into the haves and the have-nots. Upscale fast-casual restaurants like Smashburger and Chipotle attract customers who will pay $5.99 for the Classic Smash burger (âhandcraftedâ and âseared and seasoned to orderâ) or $6.65 for a steak burrito (âorganic and local produce where practicalâ). The menu might be full of calories, but it comes with a halo of quality. The McDonaldâs core customer, on the other hand, is still looking for a break: A $3.99 Big Mac, served fast. In fact, roughly two-thirds of its customers order at a drive-through counter.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">&#8230; Mr. Klein is among the few consumers whoâve had a chance to try McDonaldâs latest turnaround effort â a Create Your Own tablet that allows people to custom-build their sandwiches from a menu of meats, toppings and buns. The burger he got, he said, could compete with the more succulent ones at, say, Elevation Burger.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">But it also was about $1.50 more than a Big Mac and required him to wait at a table to be served. The new burgers can be ordered only inside restaurants, and because theyâre made from raw patties, not the precooked ones used in the standard burger, they take seven or eight minutes to prepare, an eternity for the typical McDonaldâs customer. âWhen something like two-thirds of the business is drive-through,â Mr. Klein said, âthis is not the solution.â</p>

			<p>I really do not eat too much at McDonaldâs or any other fast food restaurant. McDonaldâs is famous to be cheap and fast restaurant. It could be good if they change their menu, but I think that when we go to a fast food restaurant it have to be fast, we do not want to spend more than ten minutes there, waiting for a food, so I agree that they can change the menu, but not with things that will take more than ten minutes to be prepared. I go to fast food restaurant when I am so hungry and I cannot wait to eat, I just want to order, take my food, and eat fast.</p>

			<p>People all over the world like to eat fast food because they donât have time, or because its chip. For that reason I think McDonaldâs restaurants and many other fast foods restaurants are popular. Personally I like to eat at McDonald restaurant not so often, but when I donât have time. The article says that McDonaldâs  is having a  âidentify crisisâ witch I believe could be, but not at all because they have huge variedly of food and ,so they have so many customers in entire word, so the other restaurants like Smash burger and Chipotle,  I think are not competitive yet. Create my own table concept I think it could be wonderful, but I donât have time for that and I think there is many people like me who donât have time for that and I think create own table could be for weekends, or when there is free time. So in my opinion it should be disadvantages because people donât have time to spend so much time in a restaurant. If I have the opportunity to create a new restaurant it must be not only fast food, but healthy at all, and the location must be where people from different part of the word are, because they will make my restaurant famous like McDonald.</p>

			<p>I think that time is money, and today the competition for the fast food restaurants is hard. McDonaldâs a famous and important fast food restaurant in the world, but now they have more rivals like Chipotle. McDonaldâs need to change the menu because if they innovate, they can compete in the economy of the fast food restaurant, but if they change the menu for food that delay more ten minutes the people are going to other restaurant because the time is money.</p>

			<p>Actually very rarely I eat McDonaldâs or any other fast food restaurant when I got so many things to do and I donât have time to cook. Although the food is not health at all, I try to figure out what king of food is low in calories. I think 50% agree that McDonaldâs is identifying as a crisis because there are more fast food restaurants that provide better product. For example Taco Bell where almost all the food has salad. It is a good idea to create our own tablet to build whatever sandwiches we would like, but the disadvantage is how long we have to wait for it.<br />
If I could create a new restaurant chain first I will focus in healthy food but at the same time delicious that I can catch the attention or curiosity of people. According with the price we can make like a buffet where we can classify the food with calories, fats, carbohydrates, sodium, etc.</p>

			<p>Most of the people every day looking for something cheap, fast, and that are what âMacDonaldâsâ give it. I usually go to McDonaldâs when I am hunger and no have time to going to the restaurant and waiting for the food and I am going to MacDonald because is cheap and fast. Macdonaldâs have a lot competition like chipotle, Wendyâs and Smash burger  they are fast food restaurants too but we canât  compare with MacDonaldâs because sometimes they are a little bit expensive with their menu otherwise MacDonald give us a variety menu with cheap price. Macdonald has a bad reputation because many costumers now are asking if they are giving us a quality ingredients and food customization.</p>

			<p>I donât really eat at McDonaldâs or other fast food restaurants. I believe that sometimes you have no other option than go to those fast food restaurants but in my case it happens on summer. I agree with what the article says, that McDonaldâs I shaving crisis because there is more competition and restaurants that sells the same type of food but more healthy. The disadvantages are that, when people get into the habit of eating that kind of food more than three times per week it is when eats starts to cause disease and actually people star getting obese.</p>

			<p>Well, I go to the restaurant two or three days per week, I prefer other restaurant accept McDonaldâs. In my area McDonaldâs are not available, so that I have to go to another restaurant. Yes I agree that it is identify crisis of McDonaldâs. McDonaldâs food is not very hygienic; itâs very gunk food so that you have to take medication sometime. On the other hand, McDonaldâs foods are always ready to eat so that people can easily get fast to eat that food. If people want to save money and time they must go to the McDonaldâs for eat food.</p>

			<p>Personal I donât have a favorite Restaurants, I prefer to eat at home because all those food have chemical. That kind of food can make you sick through the time. Those Restaurants such as McDonald, Burger King Etc. they donât have the hygiene necessary to avoid that a person gets sick. You can see the worker talking over the food, they went to the bad room and they donât wash their hand. Those restaurants could be a risk for your health. But I can deny that the restaurants are very important for people that they donât like to cook or they donât have time to eat at home, but Iâm   sure they will have health problem with the time, I recommend you, if you can eat at home do it. The restaurants are very expenses and can make you sick easy.</p>

			<p>I thing is a good idea that McDonaldâs has new customization of food. No matter if we have to spend more time waiting for the order as soon as it is healthy. Also i believe that McDonaldâs is using a good strategy to maintain the customers.</p>

			<p>Well in my case I try to stay as far as I can from McDonaldâs restaurants or other fast food restaurants, first because the food is not healthy enough, and second because I have two kids, that I donât want then to get custom to eat that type of food. However I took them some times, and I try to order as healthy as I can ex, French fries whit not salt and chick en nuggets but not hamburgers because I donât know what Cain of meet they are using. I always cook at home so we can be far from those restaurants. If I open a restaurant I will be carefully whit the kind of food I will served because there is a lot of overweight in this country, and fast food restaurants as McDonald, chipotle, Wendyâs are contributing with many customers that are not healthy so for this reasons I should include a healthy Manu for customer for very low prices of curse. I understand that McDonald will not compete whit some restaurant because of the price but it will be the customer action, thy one something healthy and a title be expensive Or something sheap and risky for your health, that can cause heart or obesity problems. In my case I chose the healthy one not matter how much it cost, health is first than any fast food restaurant.</p>

			<p>I particularly , sometimes I spend a lot of time without eating McDonald, but often have the need to eat McDonald&#8217;s every week. I usually buy this food, when I want to eat something really fast as when I have to do something important. When I am driving to another state as rural place where the restaurants are not very common, often there are not many options for eating, and the only place that you can find is a McDonald. I think McDonald as a restaurant always have their customers because because sometimes the fast food is really convenient, we always see a McDonald  restaurant everywhere we go. But without all this in my opinion itâs a great advantage if they improve the menu with healthy food for those customers who for whatever reason cannot eat food with grease or many calories, or as the article mentions, they could make a menu where the customer decides what kind of ingredients to add to their meal. As in Subway where the customers decides what to add to their sandwiches.</p>

			<p>Personality I ate McDonald or other fast food restaurants because I like to taste different kinds the food, also I try to do it because it is fast and easy to prepared. Even though some people said McDonald is bad for health but not at all.  I think it is bad if people eat every day not sometimes. The article says that McDonald hasâ crisis identify âand I think it is not true because McDonald has around the word many restaurants, even McDonald has competition with other restaurants but still it is the most popular. If I have the opportunity to create my own restaurant I think my restaurant must be healthy and accessible for all people.</p>

			<p>I read an article, âWhat Are Your Favorite Restaurants?â by Shannon Doyne. I go to McDonaldâs a few times, and I go to other fast food restaurants like pizza store many times. But I donât like to go McDonaldâs because I donât like to eat Mc. I hear as a fast food restaurant McDonalds is the best and also cheap, high quality. McDonalds called a modern, progressive burger and burger breakfast restaurant. Its Advantages are cheap, we donât have to take any tension to make breakfast, and tasty. Its disadvantages are made with calorie, unhygienic. So, I think, for our good health we have to remove those items which is not good for us.</p>

			<p>We know human depend of food to survive. If we donât eat our body cannot function very well, because it needs a lot of nutrition to work. Sometimes we are very busy and we donât have time to cook or bring food at the place where we are, or at work, but we chose to eat at a good restaurant. I said good restaurant, because they have different kind of restaurant some are good I mean the respect the rule a restaurant should have. Some maybe very bad, because they donât care about the health of the people the just see the money not our life that the reason before we seat inside of a restaurant to eat we should make sure they really respect the rule a restaurant should follow, because some food can send us to the hospital where we will spend a lot money for our health that the reason my favorite restaurants it the one who follow all the rule they have to respect about the health of people.</p>

			<p>Macdonaldâs always seems to offer good quality food whenever one turns on the tv and see this image about the big mac, French fries, salads, or sandwiches. However it does not draw my attention going to this restaurant, because I prefer stay at home and cook my own food. Plus there is something else that I donât like about macdonaldâs and other restaurants similarly to this one: When they are always competing to each other by putting their prices up and down to gain customers. Probably, it might be convenient for other people who only have a few minutes for lunch and creating their own concept is the same thing as having a regular item. It just does not make sense to me changing the topics on an item because is usually coming from the same restaurant. I just find this a good place to linger over my coffee whenever I meet a friend.</p>

			<p>I do not have my favorite restaurant in New York City, but I like to go eating in different kinds of restaurants around the city or sometimes out the area. It is depends what sort of plate I Like to, for example  as I am from South America I love eat a good  barbecue or stick , so I go at the Argentina restaurant , actually  they do not  have the best meat, just  because  I am accustomed of tasting, for me the best. Also I love pasta such as lasagna, capelleti, meatball with linguine, fettuccini with three chesses etc. etc., so I go at any restaurant where I could find these, may be Italian Restaurant. Since I came to New York City, I have tried Caribbean food, wow!! Delicious I have tried Colombian food which the basics of preparation are beans, pork , vegetables, chicken, rise. In fact is a combination of meats and others plates which it make me and others one enjoy theses plates. Similar food are from Dominican  Republican , dishes with rise, accompanying chicken soup, beef soup (sancocho) and the extraordinary typical food âtostonesâ I love it.<br />
Actually there many restaurants  offer up healthy and delicious food in all categories, salads, meats, desserts, seafood, pastas, and fast food of course. However there are names or companies such as MacDonald, Burger Kings, Dunking Donna, Applebeeâs, Subway, are some. Honestly these places are not  my favorites but sometimes I like to eat at any of them, because it is not expensive, they have many varieties and faster to get, considering they are everywhere and very popular, even some of them are in âidentify crisisâ now. Finally I love to go  to Little Italy  eating  pizza most  likely my favorite place not restaurant.</p>

			<p>Reading this article, âWhat Are Your Favorite Restaurants?â by Shannon Doyne, he states that the most appearance about restaurant where we eat every day at any time. The value, quickness, flavor and healthy food that they serve for the customer, are the most important things to take the right decision where they will go. I didnât eat McDonaldâs in my whole life, because I donât like any meat and fat food. Even though sometime I like to order pizza with less cheese, but most I like to order Mr. Wonton Chinese Restaurant. I love their Shrimp Fried Rice. McDonaldâs is a popular name in fast-food worlds. Itâs popular because of their cheap prize and also their less time to waste making foods. I think if they add some interesting and new item in their list with less fat, which will be more popular. We know that, people donât like the same menu that they eat every day. We always want something new to add our menu list. In the last paragraphs, they said that, people can make their own menu, but I think that can take more time and make trouble. People also have to be concern that, if you want something delicious, you have to wait minimum fifteen minute. Fast-food or restaurant peoples are not magic man  who will take two minute and give you delicious food!</p>

			<p>I often eat in many different fast foods, but I prefer to eat in McDonald because it is always a pleasure for me to sit in McDonald and enjoy their delicious food. I have a lot of experiences in McDonald because I worked in it a few months ago. Yes I agree that McDonald is having an identify crisis because sometimes McDonald cannot hire people because they are saying they do not make too much money</p>

			<p>Every day people are more conscious about what they eat. I think at this point people are not just looking for something cheap, fast, and delicious. They also are looking for something health with less fat and delicious too. I used to go to McDonald many years ago before I became in vegetarian, but now I know much more about food and how fast food was not good for me. Today I see fast food restaurant different than before, now there are many fast food restaurant which are not necessary unhealthy such as other. For example I work in a fast food restaurant of Lebanese food, where this concept is following the healthy way. I always see McDonald as a restaurant which is not healthy and have all limited menu.<br />
    Restaurant as Chipotle as other fast food restaurant has brought a concept of healthy and organic food. This has made people to open their mind and see other possibility to eat delicious food and healthier than others. Even though McDonald is still having a lot customer at this time, but I thinks is good that they try to introduce new a new concept of food, to make competition with the other companies that are growing up very fast even when they are more expensive. If I could create a fast food restaurant my concept would be a vegetarian fast restaurant. This restaurant will have all the imitations of meat, in that way people who are not vegetarian would like to try this kind of food. The concept of decoration it going to be young, with bright colors, and many picture hanging at the walls. This picture is going to educated people about what vegetarianism is; how my restaurant makes the food, the importance of protect animals, and the importance of healthy food. </p>
<p>   My restaurant is going to server three option, bowl, salads, roll, and burger.<br />
This option are  going to have vegetables, bread, all the imitation of meat.</p>

			<p>It&#8217;s always a pleasure for me to learn about Learning Network. Each time I read it I know more what&#8217;s going on in the nature we lived. However I don&#8217; eat at any restaurant, because of my health. I cannot judge others fast food too, I know some people used to eat at restaurant it&#8217;s because they don&#8217;t have much time to cook a home, some because they loves eats at restaurant, but me i don&#8217;t</p>

I am agreeing because McDonaldâs food good and food cost chip also other restaurant food cost is high. This is the deferent McDonaldâs restaurant lot of customer they build their sandwiches and they make good business.</p>

			<p>My Favorite Restaurant:<br />
Sometimes I eat at MC Donald&#8217;s or others fast food restaurants .Yes I agree with the article that MC Donald is having an &#8220;Identity Crisis&#8221;. Because is trying to stay as a fast food with less prices to pay for their food comparing them to fancy sitting waiting to be service and others kind of restaurants. It&#8217;s a good idea if it can works for the fast food own tablet concept. The advantages the restaurants may have more customers, but the services may be too slow that may cost disadvantages. If I could create a new restaurant chain the concept is &#8220;Healthy Foodâ, no matter how long it takes to service the customer will make time to come and wait to be service not in hurry rash with chunk food.</p>

			<p>In my case, I do not usually visit fast food restaurants. When that happens is just because I donât have enough time and also I have no options, no more than eat something faster and thatâs it. I think fast food restaurants have to be changing their menu all the time, that is because there are some other restaurants that are in competition. On other hand, fast food restaurants make the life easy for everybody, especially in NY City where everything is going so fast. Sometimes people donât have time to get to their homes and have some lunch or even their donât have enough time to spend going to any restaurant, so they decide to eat something quickly.</p>

			<p>I often eat at McDonald&#8217;s once every two weeks. Because McDonald&#8217;s is one of the most popular fast food restaurants, I don&#8217;t believe there is an &#8220;identity crisis&#8221; because people go there all the time and eat for the simple fact that it is fast and cheap. That goes for any other fast food restaurant. Just because Mcdonald&#8217;s have competition doesn&#8217;t mean they&#8217;re not making money everyday. The Create Your Own tablet is a good idea for those who get tired of eating the Big Macs and other famous burgers from the menu, although when you are hungry and are expecting something quick to be made from the menu, you might just want to keep things simple and order from there. If I could create a new restaurant chain, there would be a healthy choice along with choices that aren&#8217;t so healthy. I would also want it to be located in different places just like McDonald&#8217;s.</p>
