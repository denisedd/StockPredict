SOT Anna&#39;s Monday Teacher POST LECTURE - 5:40 So the students--they&#39;re married, they&#39;re not married, they&#39;re twenty, they&#39;re thirty, I&#39;ve had students in their sixties. Job change, careers, you know, divorces, all kinds of things happen. 20;30  Anna&#39;s Monday Teacher: And it&#39;s just a different path, it&#39;s just a different path


Scene:
Joryell&#39;s classmates practice for lab	CHAPTER 1: 
	VO - WE ALL FEEL IT. THE MIDDLE CLASS IS SHRINKING. JOBS IN ONCE-STABLE FIELDS LIKE MANUFACTURING, TRANSPORTATION AND CLERICAL WORK ARE DISSAPEARING. AND THEY&#39;RE NOT COMING BACK. 


SOT - SCENE - lab - &#39;wait what do we do here? What do we do?&#39;

SO HOW DO WE SUCCEED IN THE NEW ECONOMY. 

THIS IS JORY-ELL MILLER. HER FRIENDS CALL HER JOJO. SHE AND HER CLASSMATES THINK THEY&#39;VE FOUND THE ANSWER. THEY&#39;RE WORKING ON CAREER DO-OVERS AND THEY&#39;RE ALL BETTING ON HEALTHCARE. 


JO-JO IS AT THE TAIL END OF A TWO YEAR PROGRAM AT BROOKDALE COMMUNITY COLLEGE IN LINCROFT NEW JERSEY. IN TWO YEARS, STUDENTS HERE GO THROUGH A LOT OF LAB WORK, HOSPITAL TRAINING AND TEST PREP. IT&#39;S A RIGOROUS PROGRAM. THERE ARE 24 STUDENTS IN JOJO&#39;S CLASS. 4 DIDN&#39;T MAKE IT PAST THE FIRST YEAR. 

JOJO SOT - They flunk out or - it&#39;s not for everybody, you  have to want it. It&#39;s not something you&#39;re going to walk through easily.

Scenes - Joryell&#39;s practical, Joryell hanging at school, joryell going home and hanging with her family....	

CHAPTER 2 - 

Jojo sot - WAIT FOR ME!

JORYELL&#39;S TRYING OUT HER PRACTICAL....

JORYELL IN CLASS...

JORYELL LEAVES TO GO HOME

JORYELL AT HOME - SHE AND HER HUSBAND HAVE A FUNNY BANTER BACK AND FORTH
Joryell walking home to her car....

Joryell at home joking with her family.....	
Sot - Teacher &quot;Someone asked me  before the exam - they were confused by this....you had to answer all of the question....&quot;

SOT - Joryell poses a question in class &#39;the respiratory therapist should recommend which of the following&#39; 

JOJO&#39;s Classmate - &quot;I&#39;d actually never heard of respiratory therapy until I looked it up in the program manual for Brookdale. It&#39;s like Okay - what&#39;s this? We&#39;re like the batmen of the health care system. The respiratory therapist sometimes gets lost in the mix...However, when things hit the fan, when someone stops breathing, when they go into cardiac arrest, we&#39;re one of the first people there.&quot;

VO - JOJO ALREADY HAS A BACHELOR&#39;S DEGREE IN FILM. BUT WHEN THE RECESSION HIT, SHE AND HER FAMILY MOVED HERE TO NEW JERSEY. THAT DIPLOMA DIDN&#39;T HELP MUCH WHEN SHE WAS LOOKING FOR A WELL-PAYING JOB.

Jo jo sot - I said okay - we&#39;re getting older and it&#39;s not happening the same for me - and I&#39;m going to go back into a field that&#39;s really growing that I can be helpful in.

VO - OVER THE NEXT SEVEN YEARS, THE LABOR DEPARTMENT SAYS THEY&#39;LL BE 5 MILLION MORE HEALTH CARE JOBS THAN THERE ARE TODAY - THAT&#39;S 5 MILLION MORE THERAPISTS, TECHNICIANS, NURSES. BY THE WAY, THERE ARE TWICE AS MANY REGISTERED NURSES IN THE US THAN THERE WERE JUST 30 YEARS AGO. AND ALMOST 4 OUT OF 5 NURSES EARN ENOUGH MONEY ON THEIR OWN, EVEN WITHOUT A SPOUSE&#39;S PAYCHECK, TO PUT THEIR FAMILIES IN THE AMERICAN MIDDLE. 

Josh - &quot;We make just as much money as nurses if not more. It&#39;s a stable career. There&#39;s always going to be sick people from old people with COPD to people with Asthma. There&#39;s always going to be people we can help.

MIT: 1;40 &quot; I think every body&#39;s well aware, we have a growth of sort of professional, technical, managerial jobs.

DAVID AUTOR (OTTER) IS AN ECONOMIST AT MIT. HE SAYS THE JOBS THAT ARE GROWING ARE THE ONES THAT REQUIRE SKILLS YOU IMPROVE OVER THE  LONG RUN. YOU MAY NOTICE, THEY&#39;RE ALSO HARDER TO OUTSOURCE.


MIT - And those jobs in general require high levels of education, and they require a lot of cognitive flexibility and interpersonal skills, so they don&#39;t simply follow scripted procedures. They require, kind of, creativity, intuition, hypothesis formation, new ideas, but also 03:00 expertise. You can&#39;t just show up, you have to have a specific skill set. 

Joryell at home.....her husband is

SOT - JORYELL sit down interview: My husband is so supportive. // 20;36 - he is really proud of me. He&#39;s a good inspiration - a motivator. When I get a little down - or a little stressed out because it can be a lot - especially this last semester...He&#39;s very supportive and understanding. 

20;58 - he doesn&#39;t complain. When I get down - he&#39;s like - &#39;we&#39;re almost done&#39; (crying....)

CHAPTER  3 -

Quick cuts of ANNA throughout her day...

In Class With her daughter, Anna with her doula patient...
MORNING LECTURE...
Anna&#39;s Monday Lecture... Anna&#39;s Monday lecture: 
Teacher - 1;15;07 - speak in language they can understand - Don&#39;t ask a little kid for a urine speciman - say can you go in the bathroom and pee in this cup? He&#39;s as happy as a clam - yes I can!

ANNA&quot;s LAB
Anna is in her practical 

VO - THIS IS ANNA MARINA ACKERSON. SHE&#39;S KIND OF GOT A LOT GOING ON. SHE&#39;S A MOM, AND A WIFE, AND SHE&#39;S A DOULA. THEY&#39;RE HEALTH COACHES FOR WOMEN GIVING BIRTH. AND NOW SHE&#39;S A NURSING STUDENT. 

SOT - ANNA - I was a property manager. I still kind of am...but I was just thinking - am I happy with what I&#39;m doing? No. Am I making a difference, no. Am I miserable? Yes. I don&#39;t want to be miserable. I want to do something that I like...

Sot - Classroom Professor - Talk to a kid so he&#39;ll understand. Don&#39;t ask him for a urine specimen...say - &#39;can you pee in the cup?!&#39; 

VO - ANNA&#39;S GOT A COLLEGE DEGREE, TOO. BUT WHEN SHE HAD HER DAUGHTER, SHE REALIZED SHE LOVED THE IDEA OF BECOMING A MIDWIFE. THE ECONOMY MIGHT AGREE. MIDWIVES ARE NURSES WITH ADVANCED DEGREES WHO YOU&#39;LL SEE MORE AND MORE IN DELIVERY ROOMS. 

FOR THAT, SHE&#39;LL NEED A LOT MORE SCHOOLING AFTER BROOKDALE, SAME GOES FOR MOST OF HER CLASSMATES. 


Anna&#39;s group lab - SOT - &quot;You&#39;ve got to learn to trust your instinct. 
&#39;Always trust the mother&#39;s instinct&#39;
Right - because if you see something that&#39;s not quite right, you have to say something&#39;

QUESTION - SO TELL ME ABOUT YOUR SEMESTER....

Anna - SOT - This semester&#39;s been really hard for me. I lost my brother at the end of September, so that was really really difficult. So that really, you know, I just kind of--normally I&#39;m very proactive about studying and everything like that and it was just really really hard for me. 

And it&#39;s also like a realization that everybody&#39;s got their own thing like that going on. 

Another one of my classmates, her husband got diagnosed with cancer. Another one of my classmates, her husband passed away. 

I got actually that criticism early on from someone who, I guess was a friend, but in passing. And, you know, she was like, oh you take on this many clients and you&#39;re maarried and you do this and you do that, like something&#39;s gotta give. It&#39;s always that mentality.
I&#39;m not saying you can have it all, sort of thing, but you can do everything.. To a lot of people who probably never expected that of me, there&#39;s something honourable in that, I think.

Scenes - 	CHAPTER 4 - EVERYONE&#39;S GOT TO DO IT....

JOJO her practical....	


SOT - JOJO&#39;S PRACTICAL - A2: Okay. So. Hi Jojo, what I want you to do, you have a patient who&#39;s just been put on the ventilator, // you see that your patient&#39;s saturation is extremely low. What changes would you make on the ventilator to help your patient to, ah-- 02:3to oxygenate them?

MIT - DAVID AUTOR - SOT - The US led the world in terms of sending people to college in most of the 20th century. ///We&#39;re now 14th in the world....so there are many many countries that have surpassed the US in getting people, you know, post-secondary skill sets. And I think that&#39;s unfortunate, 09:30 not just for the country as a whole, but for individuals who are, you know, don&#39;t have access to the type of employment and earnings opportunities that they would

// So although we have certainly raised education levels over time, arguably we still have too few highly- educated workers and too many less-educated workers for the labor market that we face now. 

SOT - Joryell - I&#39;m going to go on and get my masters after this. I love school. I think I&#39;m addicted to school.
32;39 -I see more and more older people going back to school. There was a woman in my class who was in her seventies - so that&#39;s just inspiration to me


SOT _ Great job JoJo - you actually did learn something this semester!!">

SOT Anna&#39;s Monday Teacher POST LECTURE - 5:40 So the students--they&#39;re married, they&#39;re not married, they&#39;re twenty, they&#39;re thirty, I&#39;ve had students in their sixties. Job change, careers, you know, divorces, all kinds of things happen. 20;30  Anna&#39;s Monday Teacher: And it&#39;s just a different path, it&#39;s just a different path


Scene:
Joryell&#39;s classmates practice for lab	CHAPTER 1: 
	VO - WE ALL FEEL IT. THE MIDDLE CLASS IS SHRINKING. JOBS IN ONCE-STABLE FIELDS LIKE MANUFACTURING, TRANSPORTATION AND CLERICAL WORK ARE DISSAPEARING. AND THEY&#39;RE NOT COMING BACK. 


SOT - SCENE - lab - &#39;wait what do we do here? What do we do?&#39;

SO HOW DO WE SUCCEED IN THE NEW ECONOMY. 

THIS IS JORY-ELL MILLER. HER FRIENDS CALL HER JOJO. SHE AND HER CLASSMATES THINK THEY&#39;VE FOUND THE ANSWER. THEY&#39;RE WORKING ON CAREER DO-OVERS AND THEY&#39;RE ALL BETTING ON HEALTHCARE. 


JO-JO IS AT THE TAIL END OF A TWO YEAR PROGRAM AT BROOKDALE COMMUNITY COLLEGE IN LINCROFT NEW JERSEY. IN TWO YEARS, STUDENTS HERE GO THROUGH A LOT OF LAB WORK, HOSPITAL TRAINING AND TEST PREP. IT&#39;S A RIGOROUS PROGRAM. THERE ARE 24 STUDENTS IN JOJO&#39;S CLASS. 4 DIDN&#39;T MAKE IT PAST THE FIRST YEAR. 

JOJO SOT - They flunk out or - it&#39;s not for everybody, you  have to want it. It&#39;s not something you&#39;re going to walk through easily.

Scenes - Joryell&#39;s practical, Joryell hanging at school, joryell going home and hanging with her family....	

CHAPTER 2 - 

Jojo sot - WAIT FOR ME!

JORYELL&#39;S TRYING OUT HER PRACTICAL....

JORYELL IN CLASS...

JORYELL LEAVES TO GO HOME

JORYELL AT HOME - SHE AND HER HUSBAND HAVE A FUNNY BANTER BACK AND FORTH
Joryell walking home to her car....

Joryell at home joking with her family.....	
Sot - Teacher &quot;Someone asked me  before the exam - they were confused by this....you had to answer all of the question....&quot;

SOT - Joryell poses a question in class &#39;the respiratory therapist should recommend which of the following&#39; 

JOJO&#39;s Classmate - &quot;I&#39;d actually never heard of respiratory therapy until I looked it up in the program manual for Brookdale. It&#39;s like Okay - what&#39;s this? We&#39;re like the batmen of the health care system. The respiratory therapist sometimes gets lost in the mix...However, when things hit the fan, when someone stops breathing, when they go into cardiac arrest, we&#39;re one of the first people there.&quot;

VO - JOJO ALREADY HAS A BACHELOR&#39;S DEGREE IN FILM. BUT WHEN THE RECESSION HIT, SHE AND HER FAMILY MOVED HERE TO NEW JERSEY. THAT DIPLOMA DIDN&#39;T HELP MUCH WHEN SHE WAS LOOKING FOR A WELL-PAYING JOB.

Jo jo sot - I said okay - we&#39;re getting older and it&#39;s not happening the same for me - and I&#39;m going to go back into a field that&#39;s really growing that I can be helpful in.

VO - OVER THE NEXT SEVEN YEARS, THE LABOR DEPARTMENT SAYS THEY&#39;LL BE 5 MILLION MORE HEALTH CARE JOBS THAN THERE ARE TODAY - THAT&#39;S 5 MILLION MORE THERAPISTS, TECHNICIANS, NURSES. BY THE WAY, THERE ARE TWICE AS MANY REGISTERED NURSES IN THE US THAN THERE WERE JUST 30 YEARS AGO. AND ALMOST 4 OUT OF 5 NURSES EARN ENOUGH MONEY ON THEIR OWN, EVEN WITHOUT A SPOUSE&#39;S PAYCHECK, TO PUT THEIR FAMILIES IN THE AMERICAN MIDDLE. 

Josh - &quot;We make just as much money as nurses if not more. It&#39;s a stable career. There&#39;s always going to be sick people from old people with COPD to people with Asthma. There&#39;s always going to be people we can help.

MIT: 1;40 &quot; I think every body&#39;s well aware, we have a growth of sort of professional, technical, managerial jobs.

DAVID AUTOR (OTTER) IS AN ECONOMIST AT MIT. HE SAYS THE JOBS THAT ARE GROWING ARE THE ONES THAT REQUIRE SKILLS YOU IMPROVE OVER THE  LONG RUN. YOU MAY NOTICE, THEY&#39;RE ALSO HARDER TO OUTSOURCE.


MIT - And those jobs in general require high levels of education, and they require a lot of cognitive flexibility and interpersonal skills, so they don&#39;t simply follow scripted procedures. They require, kind of, creativity, intuition, hypothesis formation, new ideas, but also 03:00 expertise. You can&#39;t just show up, you have to have a specific skill set. 

Joryell at home.....her husband is

SOT - JORYELL sit down interview: My husband is so supportive. // 20;36 - he is really proud of me. He&#39;s a good inspiration - a motivator. When I get a little down - or a little stressed out because it can be a lot - especially this last semester...He&#39;s very supportive and understanding. 

20;58 - he doesn&#39;t complain. When I get down - he&#39;s like - &#39;we&#39;re almost done&#39; (crying....)

CHAPTER  3 -

Quick cuts of ANNA throughout her day...

In Class With her daughter, Anna with her doula patient...
MORNING LECTURE...
Anna&#39;s Monday Lecture... Anna&#39;s Monday lecture: 
Teacher - 1;15;07 - speak in language they can understand - Don&#39;t ask a little kid for a urine speciman - say can you go in the bathroom and pee in this cup? He&#39;s as happy as a clam - yes I can!

ANNA&quot;s LAB
Anna is in her practical 

VO - THIS IS ANNA MARINA ACKERSON. SHE&#39;S KIND OF GOT A LOT GOING ON. SHE&#39;S A MOM, AND A WIFE, AND SHE&#39;S A DOULA. THEY&#39;RE HEALTH COACHES FOR WOMEN GIVING BIRTH. AND NOW SHE&#39;S A NURSING STUDENT. 

SOT - ANNA - I was a property manager. I still kind of am...but I was just thinking - am I happy with what I&#39;m doing? No. Am I making a difference, no. Am I miserable? Yes. I don&#39;t want to be miserable. I want to do something that I like...

Sot - Classroom Professor - Talk to a kid so he&#39;ll understand. Don&#39;t ask him for a urine specimen...say - &#39;can you pee in the cup?!&#39; 

VO - ANNA&#39;S GOT A COLLEGE DEGREE, TOO. BUT WHEN SHE HAD HER DAUGHTER, SHE REALIZED SHE LOVED THE IDEA OF BECOMING A MIDWIFE. THE ECONOMY MIGHT AGREE. MIDWIVES ARE NURSES WITH ADVANCED DEGREES WHO YOU&#39;LL SEE MORE AND MORE IN DELIVERY ROOMS. 

FOR THAT, SHE&#39;LL NEED A LOT MORE SCHOOLING AFTER BROOKDALE, SAME GOES FOR MOST OF HER CLASSMATES. 


Anna&#39;s group lab - SOT - &quot;You&#39;ve got to learn to trust your instinct. 
&#39;Always trust the mother&#39;s instinct&#39;
Right - because if you see something that&#39;s not quite right, you have to say something&#39;

QUESTION - SO TELL ME ABOUT YOUR SEMESTER....

Anna - SOT - This semester&#39;s been really hard for me. I lost my brother at the end of September, so that was really really difficult. So that really, you know, I just kind of--normally I&#39;m very proactive about studying and everything like that and it was just really really hard for me. 

And it&#39;s also like a realization that everybody&#39;s got their own thing like that going on. 

Another one of my classmates, her husband got diagnosed with cancer. Another one of my classmates, her husband passed away. 

I got actually that criticism early on from someone who, I guess was a friend, but in passing. And, you know, she was like, oh you take on this many clients and you&#39;re maarried and you do this and you do that, like something&#39;s gotta give. It&#39;s always that mentality.
I&#39;m not saying you can have it all, sort of thing, but you can do everything.. To a lot of people who probably never expected that of me, there&#39;s something honourable in that, I think.

Scenes - 	CHAPTER 4 - EVERYONE&#39;S GOT TO DO IT....

JOJO her practical....	


SOT - JOJO&#39;S PRACTICAL - A2: Okay. So. Hi Jojo, what I want you to do, you have a patient who&#39;s just been put on the ventilator, // you see that your patient&#39;s saturation is extremely low. What changes would you make on the ventilator to help your patient to, ah-- 02:3to oxygenate them?

MIT - DAVID AUTOR - SOT - The US led the world in terms of sending people to college in most of the 20th century. ///We&#39;re now 14th in the world....so there are many many countries that have surpassed the US in getting people, you know, post-secondary skill sets. And I think that&#39;s unfortunate, 09:30 not just for the country as a whole, but for individuals who are, you know, don&#39;t have access to the type of employment and earnings opportunities that they would

// So although we have certainly raised education levels over time, arguably we still have too few highly- educated workers and too many less-educated workers for the labor market that we face now. 

SOT - Joryell - I&#39;m going to go on and get my masters after this. I love school. I think I&#39;m addicted to school.
32;39 -I see more and more older people going back to school. There was a woman in my class who was in her seventies - so that&#39;s just inspiration to me


SOT _ Great job JoJo - you actually did learn something this semester!!">
