</p></div>
<div class="updated-entry-content">
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">It was a night of slickly choreographed speechmaking, but not for Senator Ted Cruz of Texas.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Following the State of the Union, while Senator Joni Ernst was giving the official Republican rebuttal, Mr. Cruz stood inside the Capitol and gave his own response. Standing in an echoing hallway in front a statue of Stephen Austin, Mr. Cruz railed against the president.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">âItâs time to move beyond President Obama,â Mr. Cruz said, speaking into what appeared to be a cellphone video camera that was lacking light.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Apparently, the first take was not good enough for Mr. Cruz, who is well known for being verbose. A minute into the three-minute speech, Mr. Cruz winced and said, âEh, let me start over again.â</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Mr. Cruzâs team was ultimately unhappy with his performance, too. The video is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZr5lQ4li-g&#038;feature=youtu.be">no longer available on YouTube</a>.</p>

<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Ms. Ernst also invoked her grandparents, saying âThey had very little to call their own except the sweat on their brow and the dirt on their hands. But they worked, they sacrificed, and they dreamed big dreams for their children and grandchildren.â</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">The Republican senator did weigh in on policy matters too, arguing that the Keystone XL pipeline needed to move forward, that the Affordable Care Act must be repealed and that Mr. Obama needs to do more to work with Republicans.</p>

<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Can President Obama take credit for low gasoline prices? It certainly sounded as if he wanted to. </p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Mr. Obama highlighted the fact that the United States is now the worldâs largest oil and gas producer and that gasoline prices have dropped. âThanks to lower gas prices and higher fuel standards, the typical family this year should save $750 at the pump,â he said.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">But the boom in domestic oil and gas production has little to do with the policies of this administration. That has come thanks to technology breakthroughs in hydraulic fracturing, made largely by the private sector â and most of the new oil and gas has been drilled on private land. The glut of new United States fossil fuel, combined with a slowdown in global consumption and the fact that the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries has not cut production â as it often does during price drops â are the chief drivers of lower gasoline prices.</p>

<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">However, Mr. Obama can take credit for one piece of the energy savings picture. In his first term, he muscled through aggressive new Environmental Protection Agency rules designed to force auto manufacturers to make cars with much higher fuel economy. As those new highly efficient cars fill the market, consumers will need to purchase less and less gasoline to drive the same distance â thus leading to a different kind of savings.</p>

</p></div>
<div class="updated-entry-content">
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">When President Obama talked about extending the Internetâs reach to âevery community,â what he was really talking about was <a href="//www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/docs/community-based_broadband_report_by_executive_office_of_the_president.pdf">increasing competition among Internet providers</a>.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">As anyone who has shopped for Internet and cable service knows, most people have no choice to buy it from any company besides Comcast, Time Warner, AT&#038;T or Verizon. The result of the lack of competition is that <a href="//www.nytimes.com/2014/10/31/upshot/why-the-us-has-fallen-behind-in-internet-speed-and-affordability.html">most Americans have both slower and more expensive Internet service</a> than people in many other countries. </p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Yet there are <a href="//www.newamerica.org/oti/the-cost-of-connectivity-2014/">a few American cities that tie for speed </a>with the biggest cities abroad. </p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">In each, the high-speed Internet provider is not one of the big cable or phone companies, but a city-run network or start-up service. These are the kinds of community broadband networks that President Obama was talking about. I explain how they would increase competition <a href="//www.nytimes.com/2015/01/21/upshot/obama-calls-for-more-internet-service-options-for-consumers.html">in a post for The Upshot</a>.</p>

<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">President Obama spoke about the need for child care, sick days and maternity leave.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">&#8220;Today, we&#8217;re the only advanced country on earth that doesn&#8217;t guarantee paid sick leave or paid maternity leave to our workers,&#8221; he said.</p>

</p></div>
<div class="updated-entry-content">
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Over the past year, Republican candidates have repeatedly avoided questions about climate change by responding, âIâm not a scientistâ â with the unspoken implication that they thus canât make climate policy. In his address, Mr. Obama delivered a sharp retort to that argument.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody"> âWell, Iâm not a scientist, either,â he said. âBut you know what â I know a lot of really good scientists at NASA, and NOAA, and at our major universities. The best scientists in the world are all telling us that our activities are changing the climate, and if we do not act forcefully, weâll continue to see rising oceans, longer, hotter heat waves, dangerous droughts and floods, and massive disruptions that can trigger greater migration, conflict and hunger around the globe. The Pentagon says that climate change poses immediate risks to our national security. We should act like it.â</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">As expected, he offered a full-throated defense of his controversial climate change regulations. This summer, the Environmental Protection Agency is expected to finalize a set of rules to slash carbon pollution from coal-fired power plants. That move has met with fierce opposition from Republicans and coal-state Democrats â but internationally, Mr. Obama hopes that it will give the United States credibility in forging a global climate accord in December.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody"> âI am determined to make sure American leadership drives international action,â he said.</p>

<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">But the causes of that welcome trend remain complex and controversial, and may not be a result of the president&#8217;s policies. </p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">While there are some indications that the Affordable Care Act may be helping urge <a href="//www.nytimes.com/interactive/2014/10/27/us/is-the-affordable-care-act-working.html?hp&#038;action=click&#038;pgtype=Homepage&#038;module=photo-spot-region&#038;region=top-news&#038;WT.nav=top-news#spending">that trend along at the margins</a>, it probably shouldn&#8217;t get too much of the credit. Most health economists credit the lingering effects of the Great Recession for a portion of the trend. As more people sign up for health insurance and start using the system for the first time, health spending is <a href="//content.healthaffairs.org/content/33/10/1841">expected to tick back up</a>.  </p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">The other factors explaining the slowdown are a source of great debate: Some seems to be a result of <a href="//www.nytimes.com/2014/12/04/upshot/good-news-inside-the-health-spending-numbers.html?abt=0002&#038;abg=1">changes in they way health care is being delivered</a> that produce less waste and higher quality care.</p>

<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Foreign policy and national security issues took a back seat to economic matters in this yearâs speech.     </p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">President Obama hailed his deal with President RaÃºl Castro of Cuba to restore full diplomatic relations between the countries for the first time in more than half a century. âWhen what youâre doing doesnât work for 50 years, itâs time to try something new,â Mr. Obama said. </p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Not only will it be easier for Americans to travel to Cuba, but also to send money. American telecommunications providers, financial institutions and agricultural companies will be given more opportunities to do business in Cuba.

<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">One of the Americans most directly affected by the diplomatic rapprochement is Alan P.

<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">President Obama addressed Iran in his speech, saying that &#8220;for the first time in a decade, weâve halted the progress of its nuclear program and reduced its stockpile of nuclear material.&#8221; </p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">But he also expressed a bit of skepticism that a final nuclear deal would be struck and warned that new sanctions proposed by a Republican-controlled Congress would âall but guarantee that diplomacy fails.â </p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">&#8220;It doesnât make sense,â he said. </p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">But to most Republicans and some Democrats it makes plenty of sense; they argue that it is sanctions, and the increasingly high price Iran has paid for retaining its nuclear program, that have driven the Iranian government to the bargaining table. The Obama White House, they say, has always opposed more sanctions, then embraced them later.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">But for Mr. Obama, the next few months are the endgame of a diplomatic mission he began days after taking office in 2009. And he argues he is not about to let Congress mess it up, solely so they can take a popular vote against the Iranian regime. </p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">&#8220;The American people expect us to only go to war as a last resort,&#8221; he said, an unspoken reference to the war of choice in Iraq. &#8220;And I intend to stay true to that wisdom.&#8221;</p>

</p></div>
<div class="updated-entry-content">
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">President Obama made reference to the Keystone XL pipeline in his speech â but only to suggest that, as many energy policy experts have said over the past few months, the projectâs political importance far outweighs its substantive impact. </p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">The Senate on Tuesday kicked off a weekslong debate over the Keystone pipeline â but the billâs fate is already certain, as Mr. Obama has pledged to veto it.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">âTwenty-first century businesses need 21st century infrastructure â modern ports, stronger bridges, faster trains and the fastest Internet.  Democrats and Republicans used to agree on this. So letâs set our sights higher than a single oil pipeline,â Mr. Obama said. âLetâs pass a bipartisan infrastructure plan that could create more than 30 times as many jobs per year, and make this country stronger for decades to come.â</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">However, he made no mention of the policy that most economists say is necessary to pay for new road and bridge construction â an increase in the gasoline tax. In both politics and substance, that far outweighs Keystone. <div class="w480"><figure class="media photo promo" itemprop="" itemscope="" itemid="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/01/20/us/politics/20firstdraft-obama-hands/20firstdraft-obama-hands-blog480.jpg" itemtype="//schema.org/ImageObject" role="group"><span class="visually-hidden">Photo</span><div class="image"><img itemprop="url" itemid="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/01/20/us/politics/20firstdraft-obama-hands/20firstdraft-obama-hands-blog480.jpg" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/01/20/us/politics/20firstdraft-obama-hands/20firstdraft-obama-hands-blog480.jpg" id="100000003462010" width="480" height="320" alt=""   /><meta itemprop="height" content="320"><meta itemprop="width" content="480"></div><figcaption class="caption" itemprop="description"><span class="caption-text"></span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder"><span class="visually-hidden">Credit</span> Stephen Crowley/The New York Times</span></figcaption></figure></div></p>

<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">If any further evidence were needed of how much the reaction lacks spontaneity, look no further than email inboxes across Washington, where recorded video responses to the president&#8217;s speech were arriving ahead of the 9 p.m. start time.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Senator Jim Inhofe, Republican of Oklahoma, recorded one. &#8220;By reining in President Obama&#8217;s over-regulation and by rebuilding a strong national security, we can survive the Obama administration,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">So did Senator Lamar Alexander, Republican of Tennessee, who said in his video that the speech was filled with &#8220;things Congress wouldn&#8217;t ever do.&#8221;</p>

<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">And early into the President Obamaâs speech, Republicans remained notably silent â when the president talked about the roughly 10 million people who âfinally gained the security of health coverage,â and then moments later, when he extolled the âfastest economic growth in over a decade, our deficits cut by two-thirds, a stock market that has doubled, and health care inflation at its lowest rate in 50 years.â</p>

<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">What is interesting is his framing of why the deal may be in the best interest of the United States.

<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">âAs we speak, China wants to write the rules for the worldâs fastest-growing region,â he said, according to the prepared text. âThat would put our workers and businesses at a disadvantage.

<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Those are the bipartisan watchwords in President Obama&#8217;s State of the Union address. In his speech, he returned repeatedly to the cause of funding infrastructure improvements, even evoking the Keystone XL oil pipeline in one of his pleas.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">&#8220;Letâs set our sights higher than a single oil pipeline. Letâs pass a bipartisan infrastructure plan that could create more than 30 times as many jobs per year, and make this country stronger for decades to come,&#8221; he said in his prepared remarks.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">The president&#8217;s overture to Republicans on taxes came well into the speech. But he did speak his opponents&#8217; language.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">&#8220;Letâs close loopholes so we stop rewarding companies that keep profits abroad, and reward those that invest in America,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">The president even nodded to small businesses, which Republicans fear would be left out of an overhaul of the corporate tax code, since most of them pay taxes through the personal income tax code.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">&#8220;Letâs simplify the system and let a small-business owner file based on her actual bank statement, instead of the number of accountants she can afford,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Mr. Obama also asked for so-called fast-track trade authority, an issue that appeals to Republicans more than Democrats.</p>

<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">President Obama said Tuesday that âour unemployment rate is now lower than it was before the financial crisis.â </p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">That is true if the crisis is dated to the fall of 2008. The unemployment rate reached 6.1 percent in August 2008, on its way to peaking at 10 percent, and it has since fallen all the way to 5.6 percent.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">But by many accounts the financial crisis began as early as the summer of 2007, when the unemployment rate was just 4.6 percent. And when Bear Stearns failed in March 2008, the unemployment rate still stood at only 5.1 percent.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">The reality is that the economy still has not recovered completely from the crisis. Unemployment remains considerably higher than the norm of about 5 percent in the years before the Great Recession. And the decline of the unemployment rate overstates the progress of the recovery because it ignores people who have stopped looking for work, or who are only able to find part-time jobs.</p>

<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">&#8220;Tonight, I call on this Congress to show the world that we are united in this mission by passing a resolution to authorize the use of force against ISIL,&#8221; Mr. Obama will say, according to excerpts released by the White House. </p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Mr. Obama has been drawing criticism from both parties, who argued that he had to be more transparent about his strategy, and Republican leaders asked the president to explicitly ask for a vote, suggesting that they would give him the authorization.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">The White House has been rethinking the tone that the president struck on Sept. 10, when in an address to the nation he made it sound as if the battle against the extremists would become the dominant foreign policy objective of his last years in office. Many of his aides thought that was a mistake &#8212; that it would tie the president&#8217;s standing to the success or failure of an air campaign to degrade the Islamic State, perhaps creating pressure to send in ground forces. </p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">On Tuesday, Mr. Obama will repeat his assurance that the United States will not get &#8220;dragged into another ground war in the Middle East.&#8221; Instead, he will laud the coalition of forces &#8212; in words that sound much like President George W. Bush&#8217;s State of the Union addresses a decade ago &#8212; and argue that &#8220;this effort will take time. It will require focus. But we will succeed.&#8221;</p>

<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">President Obama and the Republican-controlled 114th Congress enter the State of the Union pageant as irreconcilable combatants. But for all the fighting over free community college, tax increases on the rich and veto threats over Republican priorities, both sides have carefully walled off two potentially legacy-making areas of agreement: trade and tax reform.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Mr. Obama&#8217;s broad proposal to raise capital gains taxes, limit mega-retirement accounts, tax big banks and cut taxes for the poor and middle class carefully steers clear of the meat of the corporate tax code, which both the president and congressional leaders hope to reshape and simplify.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Likewise, for all their bluster, Republicans still appear ready to grant Mr. Obama authority to complete to major trade deals: the Trans-Pacific Partnership with nations along the Pacific Rim and the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership with Europe.</p>

Letâs sell more of what we make and grow in America over there so we can boost manufacturing, wages, and jobs right here, at home.

<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">As President Obama enters the last two years of his second term, heâll push action on climate change as one of his signature achievements. As he has in past State of the Union addresses, Mr. Obama is likely to speak of the urgent threat of climate change, particularly rising sea levels, as a problem that is happening here and now. And Mr. Obama is likely to highlight the fact that this is one of the issues on which he can create policy through executive action and regulations.  </p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">He will try to build support for three Environmental Protection Agency policies set to come out midsummer, including finalized regulations on emissions from new and existing coal-fired power plants. He also wants to build support for his efforts to forge a global climate change accord in Paris in December. </p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">And to put a face to the policy, Michelle Obama will host in her box Nicole Hernandez Hammer, a sea-level researcher in South Florida who works to mobilize the Latino community to demand action on climate change. Ms. Hammer represents a triple threat for advocates of climate change action, who are hoping to harness support in particular from Latinos and voters in presidential swing states. </p>

<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">It has been five years since President Obama used his State of the Union address to <a href="//www.nytimes.com/2010/01/29/us/politics/29scotus.html">rebuke the Supreme Court</a> for its Citizens United decision. Six members of the court were in the audience, and some did not enjoy the experience.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr. objected to Mr. Obamaâs characterization of the decision, mouthing that it was ânot true.â  He has not been back since.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. called the event an uncomfortable <a href="//www.c-spanvideo.org/program/292439-1">&#8220;political pep rally.â</a></p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">âThe image of having the members of one branch of government standing up, literally surrounding the Supreme Court, cheering and hollering while the court, according to the requirements of protocol, has to sit there expressionless, I think, is very troubling,â <a href="//www.c-spanvideo.org/program/292439-1">he told a law school audience</a> in 2010.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">But Chief Justice Roberts has kept attending. He will probably be joined this year by Justices Anthony M. Kennedy, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Stephen G. Breyer, Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Other justices are long shots. Justice Antonin Scalia has called the event <a href="//abovethelaw.com/2010/11/justice-scalia-at-the-federalist-society-fete/">âa juvenile spectacle.â</a>  Justice Clarence Thomas has said he could not abide <a href="//www.nytimes.com/2010/02/04/us/politics/04scotus.html">âthe catcalls, the whooping and hollering and under-the-breath comments.â</a> </p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Mr. Obama may want to tread lightly this year.  His health care law survived its last encounter with the Supreme Court by the narrowest of margins in 2012, and the court is set to hear a fresh and potent challenge to the administrationâs interpretation of the law on March 4.</p>

<div class="updated-entry-content">
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">This was supposed to be the year when President Obama could finally say in the State of the Union speech that he had ended two wars during his tenure. Except one battleground &#8212; Afghanistan &#8212; remains, with close to 10,000 American troops staying in the country to advise and assist the the Afghan military. </p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">And the other battleground &#8212; Iraq &#8212; heated up again in 2014 with the advance of the Islamic State, drawing some 3,000 American troops back to the country they left in 2011.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">It will be interesting to see how Mr. Obama, who is well aware that the American public&#8217;s tolerance for military adventurism overseas remains low, describes the state of play in Afghanistan and Iraq. </p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">And how will the president describe the fight in Syria? He&#8217;s probably not going to call again for President Bashar al-Assad to resign; those days seem to be gone now that the Islamic State appears to have replaced Mr. Assad as America&#8217;s public enemy No. 1 in Syria. </p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Finally, Mr. Obama has made a lot of headway in the past three months to empty the military prison at GuantÃ¡namo Bay, transferring 33 detainees and bringing the prison population there to 122 from 680 in 2003. Republican senators, including Senator John McCain, responded last week by proposing legislation that would stop those transfers. Tuesday night&#8217;s address gives Mr. Obama the perfect platform to launch a counteroffensive.</p>

<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody"><em>A worker polished stanchions in Statuary Hall before the State of the Union address.</em></p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">The middle class. </p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Thatâs a brief preview of what you can expect to hear from President Obamaâs State of the Union address. Mr. Obama no longer is trying to persuade Congress to pass ambitious bills; he has come to learn that goal isnât realistic in todayâs polarized country. He is no longer trying to convince Americans that the financial crisis is over and that the economy is improving; Americans<a href="//www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2015/01/19/poll_satisfaction_in_economy_up_security__race_relations_down_125303.html"> increasingly agree</a> with him on that score.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">He is instead acknowledging the single largest force in politics today â and implicitly admitting that he has not succeeded in reversing it: The American middle class <a href="//www.nytimes.com/2014/04/23/upshot/the-american-middle-class-is-no-longer-the-worlds-richest.html">is not receiving</a> many of the fruits of the economyâs growth. White House officials see three main potential benefits from focusing on the middle class, and I <a href="//www.nytimes.com/2015/01/21/upshot/all-about-the-middle-class-obamas-goal-for-the-speech.html">examine them in a longer post</a> for <a href="//www.nytimes.com/upshot/">The Upshot</a>.</p>

</p></div>
<div class="updated-entry-content">
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Though the president&#8217;s State of the Union guests usually get the most attention, members of Congress also get tickets that they can distribute. Senator Mark Kirk, Republican of Illinois, gave one of his to Jackson Cunningham, a 12-year-old whom Mr. Kirk calls âmy personal hero.â</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">In February 2011, Jackson, then 8, suffered a stroke while playing in his backyard. He had half of his skull removed during surgery. But he was determined to rejoin his classmates and lead a normal life. When asked by a doctor what he wanted out of rehab, Jackson responded, &#8220;I want it all back.&#8221;</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">He shared that attitude with Mr. Kirk while the senator was recovering from a stroke he suffered in 2012.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">It was Jackson who heard of Mr. Kirkâs stroke and sent him a letter after a suggestion from his grandmother. The 9-year-old boy offered some advice to a sitting United States senator: âDo not give up on yourself. All the hard work is worth it.&#8221; </p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">The letter spawned a quick friendship â Mr. Kirk and Jackson exchanged many letters, some of which were released last year by Mr. Kirkâs office.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">In that first letter, Jackson told Mr. Kirk that President Obama once visited his hospital, the Rehabilitation Institute of Chicago. His said his father saw the president get out of the car from his hospital window. </p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Today, Mr. Kirk is bringing Jackson to see President Obama himself.</p>

<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Looking for real-life anecdotes to make the case for the proposals in his State of the Union address, President Obama turned to his own mailbox.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Eight of the guests who will sit in the House chamber as <a href="//www.nytimes.com/2015/01/20/us/politics/ex-cuba-captive-and-astronaut-will-be-among-guests-at-state-of-the-union-speech.html">guests of the White House during Tuesday&#8217;s prime-time speech</a> wrote letters that made their way to Mr. Obamaâs desk, making them living, breathing examples of the policies he will discuss.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">There is Rebekah Erler, a 36-year-old working mother who wrote to the president last March about the financial challenges she was facing while raising her young family. Ms. Erler, who introduced the president when he visited her hometown, Minneapolis, last June, has a story tailor-made for Mr. Obamaâs new economic initiatives, including proposals to make community college free and to provide larger tax credits for child care and education and a new credit for families with two working spouses.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Ana Zamora of Dallas, another letter-writer, is a so-called Dreamer â brought to the United States illegally as a child by her parents â allowed to stay in the country and work through Mr. Obamaâs 2012 executive action. Ms. Zamoraâs parents, who have other children born in the United States, will be eligible for the presidentâs more recent unilateral move in November to extend such benefits to the parents of American citizens.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Not all of the letter-writing guests wrote directly to the president. Malik Bryant, 13, meant his letter for Santa Claus, whom he asked to bring him âsafetyâ as his holiday gift. But a nonprofit organization redirected the letter to the White House, where the president saw and responded to it. </p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">The <a href="//www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/03/30/AR2010033004260.html">president receives 10 letters each day</a> in his briefing materials, hand-selected by his staff from the tens of thousands that come to the White House daily on paper and by email and fax.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">The eight letter-writers are among <a href="//www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2015/01/19/white-house-announces-guests-first-ladys-box-state-union-address">22 guests the White House has announced will sit with Michelle Obama in her box</a> during the speech. Others include Alan P. Gross, the American released last month after five years of captivity in Cuba, and Scott Kelly, an astronaut scheduled to leave soon for a year aboard the International Space Station.</p>
