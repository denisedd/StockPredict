<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Happy 2015, our fifth year of Fixes.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">When we began writing the column in late 2010 we hoped to show that serious reporting about responses to social problems could both provide useful insights for society <em>and</em> engage readers. We aimed to distinguish Fixes â an example of what we call solutions journalism â from uncritical âgood newsâ reporting by examining approaches to social problems that show results and focusing on the specifics of how they work and what we can learn from them.</p>
<div class="w190 right module">
<div class="entry">
<blockquote>The news offers countless opportunities to highlight the ways people are tackling major problems.</p></blockquote>
</div>
</div>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Just before the holidays, I took a look at the major stories of 2014 as compiled by various news organizations. Rather than writing a retrospective column, as Iâve done the past few years, I wanted to look ahead with the question: How could a solutions journalism angle complement news coverage in 2015?</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Reviewing the news of the year is not a happy job. The top stories are typically about death and destruction. In 2014, they included the Ebola crisis, Russian invasion of Ukraine, Israeli bombardment of Gaza, beheadings by ISIS, the shooting down or disappearance of two Malaysian airlines flights, the grand jury decisions in Ferguson, Mo., and Staten Island and ensuing outrage, and the suicide of Robin Williams. There was, of course, much coverage about the Winter Olympics and the World Cup.<br />
<span id="more-155443"></span></p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">But it was in the day-to-day news â the stories that form the heartbeat of journalism, like coverage of politics and elections, the health system, immigration, education, the economy, the environment as well as social issues like race, inequity and poverty â that I could envision countless opportunities to highlight the ways people are tackling major problems.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">The coverage about the deaths of Michael Brown and Eric Garner went deep into questions about racial profiling by the police and the pervasiveness of structural or even <a href="//www.nytimes.com/2015/01/04/upshot/the-measuring-sticks-of-racial-bias-.html?_r=1&amp;abt=0002&amp;abg=0">unconscious</a> racism. But it struck me that while journalism has a robust framework for describing problems and their urgency, it needs to strengthen its muscles for exploring questions like: Who is doing better and how?</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">For example, how are police departments around the country grappling with the problems that surfaced in Ferguson and New York City? Who is making headway reducing racial bias and the use of excessive force in policing, and how are they doing it? (I came across only a few stories that touched on these questions â about police departments doing innovative work in <a href="//www.psmag.com/navigation/politics-and-law/the-end-of-gangs-los-angeles-southern-california-epidemic-crime-95498/">Los Angeles</a> and <a href="//www.contracostatimes.com/news/ci_26482775/use-deadly-force-by-police-disappears-richmond-streets">Richmond</a>, Calif. How many others are trying out similar tactics?)</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Journalists need better tools to find these stories systematically. Because the problems scream, but the solutions whisper, we often overlook them. Weâre not good at letting society know when we are winning against problems; we are hamstrung by our techniques and our very sense of purpose. If winning means there is never another police killing of an unarmed black man, then it may also mean that the story goes away at its finest moment.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">But it doesnât have to. In our experience writing this column, we have found that it is almost always worthwhile to ask the question, Whoâs doing it better?</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Consider the immigration crisis in the United States. The news coverage focuses on the battle in Washington and the politics around tougher policing of the border. But immigration is at heart a local story that will continue to unfold in countless ways in the year ahead. Which cities or communities are doing a <a href="//opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/02/19/immigrants-welcome-here/">better job building or improving relations</a> between new immigrants and their receiving communities? What are they doing and what can be learned from them?</p>

<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Consider the way high schools handle dropouts, a <a href="//www.americaspromise.org/dropout-crisis-facts">national crisis</a>. There is no single response, but a distribution of responses. At the bottom are schools that are simply ignoring the problem or making matters worse through substandard teaching or disciplinary practices that effectively push kids out of school. In the middle are schools that are trying to intervene, but without much thought or effort to track results. At the top are schools or programs that are responding effectively and can <a href="//evidencebasedprograms.org/1366-2/check-and-connect">demonstrate evidence of success</a>.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">The classic journalistic instinct is to focus on the worst actors â and investigate and expose them. But to the extent that anybody knows how to solve the problem, the knowledge is going to be in the schools doing best: the positive deviants, the schools we rarely cover, except perhaps as seasonal fare during the holidays. The question is not just: What are these schools achieving? But also: How are they doing it? Itâs an important distinction. Every cub reporter has been taught to ask the 5 Wâs â who, what, when, where and why. But itâs the overlooked H â the how â that can unearth the information society needs to do better.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Most issues in justice, education, health care, employment and the environment have a wide distribution of responses. There are large variations in the results achieved by community colleges, after-school and job training programs, programs to reduce recidivism, hospitals and clinics, and of course government initiatives. Which community colleges are doing better getting first-generation students to graduate? Which job programs are doing better retraining men who are among the long-term unemployed? Which companies are managing to reduce their carbon footprint while maintaining or increasing profitability?</p>

<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">The key is not to ask questions like: âDoes Head Start work?â or âDoes foreign aid work?&#8221; or âIs the Affordable Care Act succeeding?â but to focus on opportunities for learning. The answers are almost always âsometimes.â The real insights come from the differences: discovering when they work and when they donât, and why.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Thereâs a bigger question that lies behind all these other questions: Why do we believe that when people cause or exacerbate problems itâs newsworthy, but when people respond thoughtfully to problems itâs not? Thereâs no rule book that I am aware of that says journalism should focus primarily on bad stuff.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">And there are costs in doing so. For a recent <a href="//www.nytimes.com/2014/12/25/opinion/nicholas-kristof-scrooges-of-the-world-begone.html">column</a> written just before Christmas, Nicholas Kristof traveled to Haiti, where he reported on signs of improvement five years after the massive earthquake. Haiti is rarely covered in the United States news when it is not experiencing a catastrophe. Kristof acknowledged how unusual it is for journalists to focus on where things are getting better. âBad news is news, and good news isnât,â he wrote. âBut a relentless focus on bad news unfortunately leads people to conclude that places from Haiti to Congo are hopeless.â And this, he added, <em>reduces</em> prospects for improvement in very real ways: by deterring tourism, investment and philanthropy.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">To be sure, journalism is not meant to be an <em>obstacle</em> to progress; itâs meant to describe the world accurately and circulate real-time information to help societies understand themselves and improve. But the news can influence human behavior in unintended ways. âThe way in which the world is imagined determines at any particular moment what men will do,â wrote Walter Lippmann in Public Opinion, in 1922.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">It turns out, this isnât just an armchair observation. Research now supports that our behavior is <a href="//socialnorms.org/category/literature/">strongly influenced by what we imagine other people are doing</a> â and it works in both directions, positive or negative. This is called â<a href="//socialnorms.org/category/literature/">social norming</a>.â</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">For example, binge drinking is a problem on many college campuses. It is influenced by the belief among students that their peers drink considerably more than they actually do. As Tina Rosenberg has <a href="//opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/03/27/the-destructive-influence-of-imaginary-peers/">reported</a>, when colleges make the effort to simply inform students that their peers drink less than they believe, the students adjust their drinking downward to conform to the norm. Social norms have been shown to influence many forms of behavior â they can lead people to smoke less or vote more â or engage in widespread <a href="//research.smu.edu.sg/cet/news/smuresearch/2014/08/05/good-vs-greed-balancing-social-norms-and-financial-rewards">unethical business practices</a>, as was case in the demise of the accounting giant <a href="//www.nytimes.com/2003/02/23/business/book-value-a-culture-turned-against-itself-at-andersen.html">Arthur Andersen</a>.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Think about the implications of social norming for journalism. Much of the news spotlights and exaggerates behavior that we hope to curtail: violence, greed, incompetence, corruption, racism. Reporters continually run the risks of inadvertently legitimizing negative behaviors by making them appear more pervasive â and therefore more normal â than they actually are.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">When we first started this column, we wondered how long we could sustain it. How many stories were there out there that were right for Fixes? As we discovered, there are far more than we imagined. It turns out that thoughtful problem solving is, well, pretty normal: people like to take up important challenges and try new and creative approaches. The world we see is full of people making headway, in small and large ways, against all sorts of problems.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Itâs vital that people hear about their work. To fix society, we need to be aware of more than its suffering; we need to know its possibilities.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">âHope,â Maimonides wrote, âis a belief in the plausibility of the possible as opposed to the necessity of the probable.â</p>
