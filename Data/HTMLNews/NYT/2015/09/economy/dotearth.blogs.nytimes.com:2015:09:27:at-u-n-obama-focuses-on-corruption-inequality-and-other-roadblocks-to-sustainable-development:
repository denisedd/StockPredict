<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody"><webonly><span id="t20h10s" class="update">Updated, 8:10 p.m. | </span></webonly> President Obama today joined the parade of leaders addressing a United Nations sessionÂ hailingÂ <a href="//www.nytimes.com/2015/09/26/world/africa/un-adopts-ambitious-global-goals-after-years-of-negotiations.html">the adoption of 17 Sustainable Development Goals for 2030</a>, which range from extremely lofty (&#8220;end <a title="Goal 1 page (UN website)" href="//www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/poverty/">poverty</a> in all its forms everywhere&#8221;) to doable but difficult (&#8220;sustainably manage forests, combat desertification, halt and reverse land degradation, halt <a title="Goal 15 page (UN website)" href="//www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/biodiversity/">biodiversity</a> loss&#8221;). Explore <a href="//www.nytimes.com/2015/09/26/world/breakdown-of-un-sustainable-development-goals.html">all of the goals here</a>.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Here&#8217;s <a href="//www.nytimes.com/2015/09/28/world/americas/obama-tackles-poverty-and-sexism-in-un-speech.html?ref=world">The Times&#8217;s news story</a> on the speech and the White House <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2015/09/27/fact-sheet-us-global-development-policy-and-agenda-2030">backgrounder on the administration&#8217;s development agenda is here</a>.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">The president started with the usual preamble, citing successes and new challenges and repeatedly endorsing the 17 goals. Then, saying he&#8217;s become &#8220;more likely to speak my mind&#8221; after seven years in office, he bluntly listed impediments seen in all too many countries: bad governance, corruption, inequality (particularly for women). You can read some excerpts from Obama&#8217;s remarks below.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">But I also encourage you to read the Op-Ed article by Bono, the U2 lead singer and development campaigner, and Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook, who stress that spreading information access and connectivity to all can greatly improve chances of meeting these targets:</p>
<blockquote><p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">
All the global goals must be scored â but the goal of connectivity for everyone everywhere will surely hurry this game-thatâs-not-a-game to its successful conclusion.</p></blockquote>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">I couldn&#8217;t agree more. Of course, as I&#8217;ve stressed, online communication portals can be used for good or ill. As an example, explore <a href="//www.nytimes.com/interactive/2015/05/21/world/middleeast/how-isis-expands.html">how ISIS has cultivated Western supporters and recruits</a> using online tools. </p>

<blockquote><p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">&#8230;We reaffirm that supporting development is not charity, but is instead one of the smartest investments we can make in our own future. After all, it is a lack of development &#8212; when people have no education, and no jobs, and no hope, a feeling that their basic human dignity is being violated &#8212; that helps fuel so much of the tensions and conflict and instability in our world.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">And I profoundly believe that many of the conflicts, the refugee crises, the military interventions over the years might have been avoided if nations had truly invested in the lives of their people, and if the wealthiest nations on Earth were better partners in working with those that are trying to lift themselves up.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">As one of the founders of the United Nations, Ralph Bunche once said, âPeace is no mere matter of men fighting or not fighting. Peace, to have meaningâ¦must be translated into bread or rice, shelter, health, and education.â</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Iâm here to say that in this work, the United States will continue to be your partner. Five years ago, I pledged here that America would remain the global leader in development, and the United States government, in fact, remains the single largest donor of development assistance, including in global health. In times of crisis &#8212; from Ebola to Syria &#8212; we are the largest provider of humanitarian aid. In times of disaster and crisis, the world can count on the friendship and generosity of the American people.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">The question before us, though, as an international community, is how do we meet these new goals that weâve set today? How can we do our work better? How can we stretch our resources and our funding more effectively? How can donor countries be smarter, and how can recipient countries do more with what they receive? We have to learn from the past &#8212; to see where we succeeded so that we can duplicate that success, and to understand where weâve fallen short and correct those shortcomings&#8230;.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">This next chapter of development cannot just be about what governments spend, it has to harness the unprecedented resources of our interconnected world. In just a few short years &#8212; in the areas of health, and food security, and energy &#8212; my administration has committed and helped mobilize more than $100 billion to promote development and save lives. More than $100 billion. And guided by the new consensus we reached in Addis, I&#8217;m calling on others to join us. More governments, more institutions, more businesses, more philanthropies, more NGOs, more faith communities, more citizens &#8212; we all need to step up with the will and the resources and the coordination to achieve our goals. This must be the work of the world.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">At the same time, this next chapter of development must focus not simply on the dollars we spend, but on the results that we achieve. And this demands new technologies and approaches, accountability, data, behavioral science &#8212; understanding that thereâs lessons that we have learned, best practices on how people actually live so that we can dramatically improve outcomes. It means breaking cycles of dependence by helping people become more self-sufficient &#8212; not just giving people fish, but teaching them how to fish. That&#8217;s the purpose of development.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Rather than just sending food during famine &#8212; although we have to do that to avert starvation &#8212; we also have to bring new techniques and new seeds and new technologies to more farmers so they can boost their yields and increase their incomes, feed more people and lift countless millions out of poverty. Rather than just respond to outbreaks like Ebola &#8212; although we have to do that, and we have &#8212; letâs also strengthen public health systems and advance global health security to prevent epidemics in the first place&#8230;.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">The progress of recent years gives us hope. We know what works. We know how to do this. But perhaps because this is now my seventh year of addressing the General Assembly, I tend to be more blunt. Along with the gray hair, I&#8217;m becoming more likely to speak my mind. (Laughter.) So indulge me when I say that we will never achieve our goals if we do not squarely confront several insidious threats to the dignity and well-being of people around the world. No matter how much hard work is done by development agencies, no matter how large the donations and commitments that are made by donor countries, if we don&#8217;t take care of some other elements of development, we will not meet the goals that we&#8217;ve set.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Number one, development is threatened by bad governance. Today, we affirm what we know to be true from decades of experience &#8212; development and economic growth that is truly sustainable and inclusive depends on governments and institutions that care about their people, that are accountable, that respect human rights and deliver justice for everybody and not just some.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">So, in the face of corruption that siphons billions away from schools and hospitals and infrastructure into foreign bank accounts, governments have to embrace transparency and open government and rule of law. And combating illicit finance must be a global effort because it is part of our development effort. And citizens and civil society groups must be free to organize and speak their mind and work for progress, because that&#8217;s how countries develop; that&#8217;s how countries succeed.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Development is also threatened by inequality. And this is a political debate that we have in this country, so I just want to be clear, this is not something from which the United States is immune to. Every country has to grapple with this issue. The wealthiest and most powerful in our societies oftentimes like to keep things as they are, and they often have disproportionate political influences. When poor children are more likely to get sick and die than children in wealthier neighborhoods just across town; when rural families are more likely to go without clean water; when ethnic and religious minorities, or people with disabilities, or people of different sexual orientations are discriminated against or canât access education and opportunity &#8212; that holds all of us back. And so, in all of our countries, we have to invest in the interventions that allow us to reach more people &#8212; because no one should be left behind just because of where they live or what they look like.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Development is threatened by old attitudes, especially those that deny rights and opportunity to women. In too many places, girls are less likely to be in school than boys. Globally, women are less likely to have a job than men and are more likely to live in poverty. I&#8217;ve said this before and I will keep repeating it &#8212; one of the best indicators of whether a country will succeed is how it treats its women. (Applause.) When women have an education, when women have a job, their children are more likely to get an education, their families are healthier and more prosperous. Their communities and countries do better, as well. So every nation &#8212; all of our nations &#8212; must invest in the education and health and skills of our women and girls.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">And I have to say I do not have patience for the excuse of, well, we have our own ways of doing things. (Applause.) We understand that there is a long tradition in every society of discriminating against women. But that&#8217;s not an excuse for taking a new path in order to make sure that everyone in a society has opportunity.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Development is threatened if we do not recognize the incredible dynamism and opportunity of todayâs Africa. Hundreds of millions of Africans still struggle in the face of grinding poverty and deadly diseases, daily assaults on their lives and dignity. But I visited Africa recently, and what I saw gave me hope and I know should give you hope, because that continent has made impressive gains in health and education. It is one of the fastest-growing regions of the world, with a rising middle class.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">And during my travels, Africans &#8212; especially young Africans &#8212; tell me they donât just want aid, they want trade. They want businesses. They want investment. So I call on the world to join us as we mobilize billions of dollars in new trade and investment and development in Africa &#8212; and that includes Power Africa, our initiative to bring electricity and greater opportunity to more than 60 million African homes and businesses. If we get Africa fulfilling its full potential, that will help the entire global economy. Everyone here will be helped. It&#8217;s not a zero-sum game. We are invested in their success. (Applause.)</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Development is threatened by war. This should be a simple proposition, but it bears repeating. It is no coincidence that half of the people living in extreme poverty around the world live in places afflicted by chronic violence and conflict. Today, some 60 million men, women and children have been forced from their homes, many by conflicts in the Middle East and in Africa. These are humanitarian crises and refugees that we cannot ignore, and we have to deliver the urgent aid that is needed right now. And those countries that can must do more to accommodate refugees, recognizing that those children are just like ours. But our efforts must be matched by the hard work of diplomacy and reconciliation to end conflicts that so often tear societies apart.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">And as I said earlier, war and conflict is more likely to arise where we have bad governance, and we have high inequality, and we have discrimination against minority groups and ethnic groups, and we have low educational levels. So these things are all related.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">And finally, development is threatened by climate change. And I want to thank the Secretary General for the extraordinary leadership and work that heâs done on this issue. (Applause.)</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">All of our countries will be affected by a changing climate. But the worldâs poorest people will bear the heaviest burden &#8212; from rising seas and more intense droughts, shortages of water and food. We will be seeing climate change refugees. As His Holiness Pope Francis has rightly implored the world, this is a moral calling.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">In just two months, the world has an opportunity to unite around a strong global agreement. I saw President Hollande walk in a few moments ago &#8212; we are going to be converging in Paris. With his leadership, and the leadership of every world leader, we need to establish the tools and financing to help developing nations embrace clean energy, adapt to climate change, and ensure that thereâs not a false choice between economic development and the best practices that can save our planet. We can do the same at the same time. And the communities and lives of billions of people depend on the work that we do. (Applause.)</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Future generations of young people watching today and tomorrow will judge us by the choices we make in the months and years ahead. And one of those young people is Eva Tolage. Eva lives in a village in Tanzania. Sheâs 15 years old, and she wrote me a letter. Some of you know I get 10 letters a day, mostly from inside the United States, but sometimes international letters. I get 40,000 a day, but I read 10. (Laughter.)</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">And so Eva told me about her parents &#8212; farmers who struggle to provide for their seven children. And this young 15-year-old girl &#8212; a girl the age of my daughters &#8212; she dreams of going to college, but with little food to eat, she explained how it&#8217;s hard for her sometimes to concentrate in school. She explained that her house doesnât have electricity, so it&#8217;s hard for her to study at night.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">It&#8217;s not because her parents don&#8217;t love her and don&#8217;t have ambitions for her. Her father works incredibly hard in the fields to pay for her education. But they just need a little help. âI wonât let him down,â Eva said. âIâll do whatever it takes,â she said in her letter. And then, knowing that we would be gathered at this summit to help lift up families like hers, she asked me a question that could be asked of all of our nations &#8212; âWhat will you commit to doingâ¦?â What will you do?</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">And there are billions of boys and girls just like Eva. Theyâre just like our children. They have as much talent and as much hope for the future. And theyâre willing to work hard, and their parents love them just as much as we love ours. And just by the accident of birth, it&#8217;s so much more difficult for them to achieve their dreams as it is for our children. But in the eyes of God, they are the same children. Theyâre just as important.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">And for Eva, and all those just trying to survive another day in conditions that many of us can barely imagine, it can sometimes seem as if the world is blind to their struggles and their dreams. And so today, I say to Eva and hundreds of millions &#8212; billions &#8212; like her: We see you. We hear you. I&#8217;ve read your letter. And we commit ourselves &#8212; as nations, as one world &#8212; to the urgent work that must be done. To standing with families like Evaâs as they work and strive for a better life. To ending the injustice of extreme poverty. To upholding the inherent dignity of every human being. Whatever it takes. We canât let them down. And with your help, we won&#8217;t.</p></blockquote>

He won a <a href="//dotearth.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/09/15/four-years-163-posts-and-a-nice-award/">National Academies Communication Award</a> for Dot Earth in 2011 and Time Magazine named him <a href="//techland.time.com/2013/08/05/the-25-best-bloggers-2013-edition/slide/andrew-revkin-dot-earth/">one of the web's 25 top bloggers</a>Â in 2013.</p>
<p class="summary">In December 2016, Revkin ended the blog and left PaceÂ to return to full-time journalism as senior reporter on climate and related issues for the public-interest newsroom <a href="https://www.propublica.org/about/andrew-revkin-to-join-propublica-as-senior-reporter-on-climate-change" target="_blank">ProPublica</a>.</p>
<p>Click here for a <a href="https://static01.nyt.com/packages/html/science/20071024_DOTEARTH_FEATURE/index.html">narrated slide show</a> on the roots of Revkin's journalistic journey.</p>
