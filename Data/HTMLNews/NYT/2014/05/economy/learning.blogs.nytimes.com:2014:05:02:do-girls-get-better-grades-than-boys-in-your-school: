<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">By the time they enter kindergarten, girls are already performing better according to many social and behavioral measures than boys. By eighth grade, they are getting better grades. By college, they are graduating in higher numbers. Do you see any evidence of this national trend around you?   </p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Do girls get better grades than boys in your school?</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody"><span id="more-145334"></span><br />
In <a href="//www.nytimes.com/2014/04/29/upshot/a-link-between-fidgety-boys-and-a-sputtering-economy.html">&#8220;A Link Between Fidgety Boys and a Sputtering Economy,&#8221;</a> David Leonhardt writes:</p>
<blockquote><p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">
The behavior gap between rich and poor children, starting at very early ages, is now a well-known piece of social science. Entering kindergarten, high-income children not only know more words and can read better than poorer children but they also have longer attention spans, better-controlled tempers and more sensitivity to other children.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">All of which makes the comparisons between boys and girls in the same categories fairly striking: The gap in behavioral skills between young girls and boys is even bigger than the gap between rich and poor.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">By kindergarten, girls are substantially more attentive, better behaved, more sensitive, more persistent, more flexible and more independent than boys, according to a new paper from Third Way, a Washington research group. The gap grows over the course of elementary school and feeds into academic gaps between the sexes. By eighth grade, 48 percent of girls receive a mix of Aâs and Bâs or better. Only 31 percent of boys do. &#8230;</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Girls enter school with a lead on boys, and schools then fail to close the gaps. Instead, they increase. The behavioral advantage that girls have over boys in kindergarten, based on teachersâ assessments of their students, are even larger in fifth grade.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">By then, the average girl is at the 60th percentile of an index of social and behavioral skills, while the average boy is at only the 40th percentile, according to Claudia Buchmann of Ohio State and Thomas DiPrete of Columbia, the authors of the new paper. That gap of 20 percentage points is larger than the 14-point gap between poor and not poor children or the 15-point gap between white and black children.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">These behavior measures are subjective, of course, based on the views of teachers across the country in very different classrooms. Yet itâs clear that the measures reflect something real, because the behavior differences later translate into academic differences. By high school, even advanced math and science classes now have more girls than boys. At college graduation ceremonies around the country this spring, women in caps and gowns will easily outnumber men..

			<p>I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s about the gender it&#8217;s about the skills each kid was taught as they were young. When recieving good grades girls are very excited however, for boys they get a good grade then other boys that have a bad grade make fun of them because they&#8217;re smart when really they&#8217;re usually just jealous. Girls and boys both have strengths and weakness in subjects, depends on how well they were taught and how good there brains function. As a nation there&#8217;s no much we can do to help boys to do better in school besides letting them play video games for shorter time and helping them or letting them stay after school for help. Boys would rather focus on video games then homework therefore they begin to fail classes while girls don&#8217;t. Well anyways I think both girls and boys have there strengths and weaknesses in school.</p>

			<p>If you pay attention in class then you shouldn&#8217;t have a problem; if you don&#8217;t pay attention then I feel sorry for you but gender does not have anything to do with what grade you make at school.</p>

			<p>For the majority of the times I think that girls scores are better than boys scores.  I think that girls have the better attention span and do not get distracted as easy and that it is easier for a girl to stay focused because boys are distracted by every little thing.</p>

			<p>This is absolutely ridiculously. My younger brother brings home A&#8217;s and makes it seem like it is an everyday thing- though it is. He balances school work, nap time, activity time, family time and video time in one day. He does a great job. When I was his age I was not as good as he is. I was a B average student. I don&#8217;t think girls do better with grades, the thought of it sounds naive to me. We all have the same functioning brains.</p>

			<p>&#8220;longer attention spans, better-controlled tempers and more sensitivity to other children.&#8221;<br />
I disagree with quote because i have personal experience with children who are financially better off than most, and they are the most spoiled, bad mannered, out of control, children i have ever meet. children that are living below their means have a better personality and a less self deserved attitude than children who have more financial stability</p>

			<p>I don&#8217;t think that gender has much to do with grades because boys and girls both can do really well in school. It just depends on the individual and how disciplined and focused they are in school. If you do all of the homework and study for tests, chances are you&#8217;ll do well in school. If you slack off and don&#8217;t put in any effort then you wont succeed. Whether your male or female doesn&#8217;t really effect if your capable of doing homework or not.</p>

			<p>Through out  my school experience I have seen what Gonchar states. I have three younger siblings, I have seen this behavior difference my self in my own home. My brother has so much energy he still gets his work done but it takes time, my sister is quicker than my brother. I believe it is the mind set of the boy and the way he was raised. I have noticed threw out my schools days the boys that where disciplined correctly they did not act up while in class. The peers around do take a toll on any individual peer. Boys tend to have much more energy whether they are in school are not. Much discipline is needed to handle hard headed boys, than girls.</p>

			<p>The difference between girls and boys here is that the function in completely different ways. I do not believe for one second that girls are any smarter than boys. What I believe the reason is for girls to do better in school is because they are motivated by the desire to look good. A girls wants to look good in front of her peers; she wants to be thought of as smart, so she works harder for it. Boys, on the other hand, do not care if people think they are smart. A boy has no constant motivation to help him work harder in school. I feel that if we gave boys some other type of incentive for schooling that all or a majority of them would want then they would do fairly well.</p>

			<p>This article holds some truth to it. Every graduation I have attended included more girls than boys. At each one of them there were more valedictorian girls than boys. This could have been the case because more girls attended these schools than boys did. From what I have noticed, girls are more motivated and they work harder than guys. Nevertheless, this is not always the case. Someone&#8217;s learning can depend on many factors including motivation, skills, perseverance, and a good support system.</p>

			<p>This article sheds light on a topic that many do not understand. First, it is not saying that all girls receive better grade but simply that studies have shown, on average, to perform better in school, hence gaining better grades. Second, the issue of poor children versus rich children  may have a certain effect. A student from a rich background might do better in school due to a higher exposure to hard work and longer education background. Now I am not saying children from a poorer background do not have a full education but instead choose a different life path. Third, gender maybe important in the beginning years of school but as the years drag on both boys and girls excel the same. Depending on the subject of the class the girls might be lower particle than the boys, hence saying that girls do not always get better grades than boys. Concerning the percentiles might have something to do with the everlasting gender roles. It was always said that girls were to tend for the family and the boys were to go out and do the work. When it comes to the skills and behavioral percentiles it could possible show the nature of the female role.</p>

			<p>I agree completely. throughout all my schooling experiences I have found that girls preform better for a number of reasons. one of the largest factors I see is the fact that boys often care less, or care about other things more. btw the font should be changed because 40th and 60th look like 4oth and 6oth and it can be confusing.</p>

			<p>In my experience, I&#8217;ve noticed that more than half of the people who are getting on honors lists, National Honors Association nominations, and higher grades tend to be girls.  Many of my male friends could care less about their education.  I&#8217;m not going to completely agree with the information said, like that huge of a gap between, but what i can agree on is that there is a larger amount of girls do better academically.  I can even look at my little brothers&#8217; school where they have ceremonies that give awards for substantial accomplishments, and there seem to be fewer and fewer boys going up to receive anything.  I honestly think that it&#8217;s because of the &#8220;let boys be boys&#8221; mentality and also that a young man has to be good at some kind of physical sport in order to be socially accepted in the school system.  If that myth is broken than maybe the gap can be shortened.</p>

			<p>According to my experiences, I believe that girls generally have high grades. From kindergarten to high school, I have seen many examples supporting this idea. Scientifically, I can relate this to how female brains work more different than male brains. It has proven that females think differently than males. Therefore, the point of the article is correct and logical.</p>
<p>Only in higher level of education, good grades bring high status and respect. Through kindergarten to high school, good grades do not really matter. Because childs and teenagers will have their personal developments through kindergarten to high school, good grades do not have any affect on high status and respect.</p>

			<p>First off I&#8217;m 19.</p>
<p>Boys and Girls are different. They thrive better doing different things.<br />
I know when I was in elementary school I would have loved more activity, more inter-action and less sitting and passively listening to an adult drone on about something that at the time didn&#8217;t relate to me in the least. I would ask seemingly-endless questions with the teacher and conversations that sometimes ended up as debates, IN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL, in order to satisfy my grave to learn the subject matter.</p>
<p>I think most, if not all, kids prefer interaction, prefer socially driven activities to better understand any and all subjects. The staffs and policy makers of schools (NOT THE TEACHERS) are generally not diligent enough to implement such interactive lessons in their lessons. The whole Idea of &#8220;lesson plans&#8221;, stringent rigid structural learning, aka lecturing about subjects in a one way passive listening environment, is the most asinine type of policy I have ever heard of. It reduces teacher flexibility, destroys any latent ability in an instructors ability to be versatile with their lessons, and it&#8217;s annoying to have to pretend to listen to the teacher explain why we aren&#8217;t learning some topic instead of TEACHING US.</p>
<p>the only reason I disliked school, was because of the way and environment in which it was presented. I loved and still do love learning. It can be the most satisfying experience for me, but I hate school and modern education with a passion.<br />
Many successful experiments have been conducted by creative individuals to test the responses of young adults and teenagers response to video game themed learning environments.</p>
<p> School can be fun, and it will be a fun place that students look forward to going to by the time I am in a place to make the proper policies and further the proper ideas to make schools more interactive and social places for learners of all ages.</p>
<p>If one thing is going to advance our, must I say it, declining nation it is going to be a total reform of the current public schooling system.</p>

			<p>As a 19-year-old Turkish university student, I have always studied in classrooms where girls are in majority. As far as I remember, even in the first grade they were more than boys. I think altough this claim is subjective a little bit, there are many examples proving it. I can talk about my situations. When I was in primary school, the teacher always loved and praised girls. However girls really were more skilled than boys. While we were slipshod and naughty, they were tidy and well-behaved.<br />
But of course there were some succesfull male classmates of mine. Those who got high grades were popular and lovely according to the teachers. Even they did something wrong, teachers always could tolerate them. I think because positive discrimination will never end in minds of teachers, grades of boys always will be low. After graduation, it will be clear who is better!!</p>

			<p>Guys like girls, so they&#8217;re a big motivation for them. I think that if a guy is a jock and is required to get good grades in order to stay on the team, then they will maintain excellent grades for the most part. If getting good grades will classify them as a nerd in girls&#8217; eyes, then they won&#8217;t really bother. So in those high performing schools where everyone is smart, a lot of guys will make an effort to do well because everyone is pretty smart as it is. With girls, there&#8217;s no real discrimination will girls getting good grades. If you&#8217;re pretty, you&#8217;re pretty. No one cares how much you read. It&#8217;s different with guys. Guys have a lot of pressure to be perceived as cool.</p>

			<p>I do not think that there is a difference of grades based on sex. It just depends on how hard people work at it. I also think that the persons parents have a huge impact on the grades that the kids make.</p>

			<p>Personally I think that this article is biased toward girls.  However, boys tend to be distracted easier.  Girls do get distracted but it seems that they don&#8217;t get distracted as easily and that can help with better grades.  So in my opinion girls do get better grades.</p>
