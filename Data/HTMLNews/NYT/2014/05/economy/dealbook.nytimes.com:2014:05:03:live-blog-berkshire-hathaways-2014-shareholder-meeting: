</p></div>
<div class="updated-entry-content">
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Throughout the day, Mr. Buffett has praised 3G Capital, the investment firm with whom he partnered to buy H. J. Heinz last year. And after prodding from noted Berkshire aficionado Whitney Tilson, the Oracle of Omaha explains why.</p>
<blockquote><p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">&#8220;They&#8217;re very smart, they&#8217;re very focused. They&#8217;re very determined. They&#8217;re never satisfied. And as I said earlier, when you make a deal with them, you make a deal with them.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Mr. Munger says, &#8220;You can&#8217;t skirt the fact that they&#8217;re very skilled at removing unnecessary costs. &#8230; It&#8217;s a necessary service to civilization, and should be done with some mercy really, some sensitivity.&#8221;</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">For those interested in learning more, Mr. Tilson and Mr. Buffett tout &#8220;Dream Big,&#8221; a book about the 3G founders.

<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">It&#8217;s all queries from shareholders for the rest of the meeting. </p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">And a question about the differences between the education systems in the United States and Asia leads to a droll, vintage Berkshire meeting moment.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">First, Mr. Munger declares:</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet tw-hide-thread"><p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Munger: &#8220;I think America made a big mistake when it allowed a lot of its public schools to go to hell.&#8221; #brk2014</p>

<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Then Mr. Buffett wades in. &#8220;I get a little worried about Charlie. I probably shouldn&#8217;t say this&#8221; &#8212; a trace of an impish smile crossing his face &#8212; &#8220;but I&#8217;m worried about Charlie.&#8221;</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Why? It&#8217;s Mr. Munger&#8217;s hearing. Mr. Buffett recalls talking to a doctor about his business partner&#8217;s hearing. To test the extent of any potential hearing damage, Mr. Buffett says from across the room, &#8220;Charlie, what do you think about buying General Motors [stock] at $35?&#8221;</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Nothing.</p>

<div class="updated-entry-content">
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Mr. Buffett has been very clear that Berkshire is hunting after big deals. It isn&#8217;t alone, but the universe of its competitors is relatively restrained at the moment.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">He says that private equity firms, so dominant seven years ago, have largely been buying smaller companies and sometimes trading their holdings between each other.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">&#8220;We don&#8217;t feel envious when we see what they&#8217;re doing, in the least,&#8221; Mr. Buffett says. &#8220;It&#8217;s not going to be the future of Berkshire.&#8221;</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">That said, the company may still pursue smaller deals from time to time. They won&#8217;t be the core of Berkshire&#8217;s acquisition strategy, but doing one kind of transaction doesn&#8217;t preclude the other.</p>

<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Mr. Buffett says that activism broadly has done well. And any success on Wall Street inevitably draws in more money, making activists like Mr. Ackman even more powerful.</p>

<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Mr. Buffett says first that he was a sports team owner at one point, owning a stake in a minor league team. That said, he&#8217;s not going to buy a sports team anytime soon. Not in his wheelhouse.</p>

<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Mr. Buffett then chimes in and says, thanks to his experience at Salomon Brothers, he favors prosecuting individuals over entire corporations.

<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">It&#8217;s not as if Berkshire would perform better if a competitor were urging it on. But all the same, the lack of a true rival put Mr. Buffett in a pensive mood.</p>

<div class="updated-entry-content">
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Here&#8217;s a question about conglomerates. Does it make business sense to put together a slew of disparate businesses, as Berkshire has done?</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Mr. Buffett quickly responds that what he has done over the years is different from what the Gulf &#038; Western type companies from the 1980s did. The point of owning a See&#8217;s and a Marmon is that the earnings of each can support other businesses in the Berkshire portfolio, cascading their earnings power.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Making that work requires discipline, however. And many conglomerates in the 1980s tended  just to buy a lot of properties using stock, using financial engineering to keep going. </p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">&#8220;If you&#8217;re issuing stock continually, one way or another you probably have a chain-letter model going,&#8221; Mr. Buffett says.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">By contrast, Berkshire uses cash, a far more disciplined way of ensuring that the acquisitions work. Not everyone can do it, he says, but done properly, it&#8217;s a good business model.</p>

<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Mr. Sorkin passes along a shareholder question: Since Berkshire now discloses the salaries for only its top three officers â Mr. Buffett, Mr. Munger and the chief financial officer, Marc D. Hamburg â would he be willing to disclose the top earners in the company&#8217;s operating subsidiaries?</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">That would include Mr. Nicely of Geico and Mr. Jain of the reinsurance businesses.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Mr. Buffett, saying he is in a sporting mood, says he is following the rules laid out by the Securities &#038; Exchange Commission and uses the example of Comcast to argue that disclosing such information wouldn&#8217;t necessarily help shareholders. It probably wouldn&#8217;t curb salaries because it would create a spirit of competition among executives at rival companies.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">&#8220;There&#8217;s no C.E.O. that looks at other proxy statements and thinks, &#8216;I should get paid less,&#8217; &#8221; Mr. Buffett says.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">That said, he plans to write in his next letter to investors how much he thinks Berkshire&#8217;s next chief should be paid.</p>

<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Ms. Quick of CNBC asks what will be next for Mr. Munger, the longtime lieutenant to Mr. Buffett?</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">The Oracle of Omaha uses the question to praise his longstanding partnership with Mr. Munger, the Berkshire vice chairman, relating how Mr. Munger has been an invaluable asset in building the company into the colossus it is today.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">That kind of partnership is an important feature of the Berkshire structure, and one that he thinks his eventual successor will use as well, he said.</p>

<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Ever ready with a quip, the billionaire says that Mr. Munger is his canary in a coal mine. &#8220;Charlie turned 90, and he&#8217;s doing marvelously in middle age,&#8221; he jokes.</p>

<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Why not put the money into Berkshire shares?</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Mr. Buffett says that the amount of money he will leave behind is already pretty enormous. The point is not to accumulate even more wealth; he quips that there are already a few too many extra zeroes in those amounts.</p>

<div class="updated-entry-content">
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Andrew Sorkin of DealBook asks a question. A shareholder noted that Mr. Buffett&#8217;s son, Howard, sits on the board of Coke and did not vote against the controversial executive compensation plan. </p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Since Howard Buffett is going to take over as nonexecutive chairman of Berkshire some day, how can shareholders be assured that he will be a good steward of the company his father has built?</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Mr. Buffett offers a lengthy discourse on corporate governance, using the example of a compensation committee that spends time putting together its recommendations. &#8220;It&#8217;s almost unheard of to question them,&#8221; Mr. Buffett says, clearing his throat. </p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">The billionaire says that the social dynamics of boards are important to understand. Boards tend not to look for &#8220;Dobermans,&#8221; he says. &#8220;They look for cocker spaniels.&#8221; And independent directors aren&#8217;t necessarily independent, since they make as much as several hundred thousand dollars a year and work less than one week a year.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">But the Berkshire chief really doesn&#8217;t answer the question, essentially punting on whether boards should forcefully hold their companies accountable. His answer dwells much on the importance of preserving comity within the boardroom, rather than questioning unwise decisions.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">In fact, Mr. Buffett allows, he has voted at several companies for compensation plans with which he didn&#8217;t necessarily agree.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">All he has to offer is his faith that Howard Buffett and others will continue to do the right thing. &#8220;My son, Howard, and my other two children would have the dedication and do have the dedication&#8221; to preserve Berkshire&#8217;s culture, Mr. Buffett says.</p>

<div class="updated-entry-content">
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">A shareholder asks about the disruption that any corporate acquisition can create. Employees can fear that they would lose their jobs, for example. How does Berkshire assuage such fears?</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Mr. Buffett says his company tries to be as fair and upfront as possible. He says Berkshire tries to hold onto businesses as long as it can and that it will deal with employees fairly.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">It&#8217;s hard to make promises, but nevertheless Mr. Buffett says that he ensures that managers will continue to run their businesses. And the conglomerate has had a pretty good track record of holding onto its companies, letting go of only a few properties, like the original textile mill that gave Berkshire its name.</p>

<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">An analyst asks about Berkshire&#8217;s intrinsic value, and whether Mr. Buffett would consider ways to bolster the company&#8217;s stock price to come closer to reaching that level.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">That might include a stock buyback or spinning off one of Berkshire&#8217;s units in an initial public offering of stock.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Mr. Buffett waves off such suggestions. Berkshire has no interest in breaking off pieces of itself, he says. Moreover, he says, intrinsic value is a fluctuating number that changes often.</p>

<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Why did the Berkshire chief, whose company is a large shareholder, not speak out against a plan he privately thought was unseemly? (Indeed, according to <a href="//stream.wsj.com/story/markets/SS-2-5/SS-2-520877/">The Wall Street Journal</a>, he expressed his thoughts on the matter behind the scenes to Coke&#8217;s chief executive, Muhtar Kent.)</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Mr. Buffett explains that, yes, he had conversations with Mr. Kent, including one here in Omaha, where he said he thought the plan &#8220;excessive.&#8221; </p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">&#8220;It was the most effective way of communicating for Berkshire,&#8221; the Berkshire chief says.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">&#8220;We had no desire to go to war with Coca-Cola, and we did not want to endorse calculations that were wildly inaccurate,&#8221; he adds, saying that he did not want to team up with an activist investor he does not know well.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">In general, picking a fight rarely seems like the way to get a company to change something, Mr. Buffett says: &#8220;I don&#8217;t think going to war is a very good idea in most cases.&#8221;</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">He adds that we&#8217;ll see what happens with the executive compensation plan.</p>

<div class="updated-entry-content">
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Mr. Buffett is discussing Berkshire&#8217;s first-quarter earnings, noting that net income is down. </p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">He warns shareholders not to pay attention to individual quarters or even years, sounding very much like Wall Street firms that note that shorter time periods are lumpy and don&#8217;t show the true value being built.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">He also discusses a longtime investor bugbear, the lack of a dividend for Berkshire shares. Mr. Buffett notes that in the most recent shareholder vote, 97 percent of Class A shares were voted against instituting such a payout.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">&#8220;Now, you may think that I stuffed the ballot box,&#8221; the Berkshire chief said, alluding to his 20 percent stake. &#8220;I did.&#8221;</p>

</p></div>
<div class="updated-entry-content">
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Around 7 a.m. Central Time is when one of the biggest draws of the Berkshire annual meeting opens: the exhibition hall dedicated to the company&#8217;s portfolio holdings.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Every year, shareholders mill about to examine the various company booths, like Sees candy, Justin Brands and the industrial conglomerate Marmon. Visitors can pose with the Geico gecko or the pig from the insurer&#8217;s seemingly omnipresent ads. </p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">And new this year is H. J. Heinz, which Berkshire bought last year alongside the investment firm 3G Capital.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">(Edit: Want to see how crowded it gets? Here&#8217;s a taste.</p>

<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">As this is a celebration of capitalism, nearly everything is for sale. Scores of shareholders â and this reporter â walked around munching on Dairy Queen Dilly bars, even before the rest of Omaha had had breakfast.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Heinz is running a contest to see whether ketchup bottles featuring Mr. Buffett ($2) could outsell ones graced by Mr. Munger (a cut-rate $1.50). </p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Some of the seemingly most popular items this year are <a href="https://instagram.com/p/ninlwdMo2i/">Buffett-and-Munger rubber ducks</a> from the Oriental Trading Company, decked out in Mexican garb in honor of Cinco de Mayo and going for $5 a pair.</p>

</p></div>
<div class="updated-entry-content">
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">After the usual Berkshire pageantries, Mr. Buffett and his partner, Charles Munger, will take the stage to field hours of questions from shareholders, the news media (including DealBook&#8217;s own Andrew Ross Sorkin) and analysts.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">The 83-year-old Mr. Buffett is likely to again field questions about who will succeed him, with old and new names again being floated in the media. In the former camp: Ajit Jain, the head of Berkshire&#8217;s formidable reinsurance operations, and Matthew K. Rose, who ran Burlington Northern Santa Fe until last December, when <a href="//www.reuters.com/article/2013/12/11/bnsf-ceo-idUSL1N0JQ24220131211">he was promoted to executive chairman</a> of the railroad.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">In the latter camp is Greg Abel, the head of Berkshire Hathaway&#8217;s energy arm and the subject of <a href="//www.businessweek.com/articles/2014-05-01/could-greg-abel-replace-warren-buffett-at-berkshire-hathaway">a Bloomberg BusinessWeek profile</a> this week.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Mr. Buffett will also most likely face queries on any number of other topics. Among the most interesting may be his actions behind the scenes in getting Coca-Cola to reconsider a proposed executive compensation plan that has received criticism from shareholders.</p>
