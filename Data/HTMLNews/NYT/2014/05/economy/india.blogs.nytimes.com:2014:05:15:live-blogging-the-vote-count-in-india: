<div class="updated-entry-content">
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">The B.J.P.-led National Democratic Alliance has won 269 seats as of 9:22 p.m. on Friday.  It is heading toward a number well above the 272 seats needed for a majority, and Narendra Modi, with a mighty mandate, is poised to become the next prime minister of India.  A diverse electorate from 28 states, seven territories and a multitude of faiths, voted in what is largely seen a referendum on the rule of the Congress party, which was decimated in this election.  As an ending thought, we turn to the historian Ramachandra Guha, who spoke to Ellen Barry of The New York Times, in a <a href="//www.nytimes.com/2014/05/17/world/asia/india-elections.html?hp">story</a> that will update throughout the night here in India.  </p>

<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">On Friday, the benchmark stock indexes erased much of their earlier gains. The Sensex closed at 24,121.74 points, up 0.9 percent, after hitting a record high of 25,375.63 midmorning. The 50-share Nifty benchmark closed at 7,203.00, up 1.1 percent, after peaking at 7,563.50 midmorning. Analysts said that the markets were off their highs because investors cashed in their surging stocks and that Indiaâs stock markets were expected to continue on a bull run.</p>

I never thought I would see this. But now Modi will be accountable to all of India. In Gujarat, there is no opposition. No one challenged him. Modi made big promises in this campaign and I do not think he will deliver because he has to respond to all of India. I  also disappointed with the Congress party.

<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">&#8220;A few days before the election, one of my employers showed me Modiji on the television and told me to give him my vote,&#8221; she said, using the suffix that is an honorific in Hindi. &#8220;She told me that Modiji will bring down vegetable prices, fuel prices, all the prices.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">&#8220;Then, just after that, the lotus people came to my area,&#8221; she said, referring to the symbol of the B.J.P. by which many, especially those like Ms. Devi who canât read, identify the party. &#8220;They were playing drums and making lots of noise &#8212; vroom vroom, bang bang, fireworks and that sort of thing &#8212; and they were also saying the same thing about prices.

<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">She said that when the campaigners entered the slum she lives in, they held their nose when approaching the broken-down shacks, surrounded by open gutters and human waste. &#8220;They said, &#8216;How can you live here?

</div>
<div class="updated-entry-content">
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">The B.J.P.âs lead in Uttar Pradesh has exceeded most expectations â it is leading or winning in 71 out of 80 constituencies, according to an Election Commission update as of 4:50 p.m. In the last elections in 2009, the B.J.P. won only 10 seats. </p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">The state witnessed religious clashes last year in which more than 40 people, both Hindus and Muslims, were killed and thousands were displaced, most of them Muslims. Many analysts said the B.J.P. would be able to galvanize the Hindu vote in the state after the riots. Hindu voter loyalties in the state have traditionally been fractured along caste lines.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">In this election, several parties, including the B.J.P., fielded candidates who had been accused of inciting violence during the riots. The three B.J.P. candidates in the state all had charges filed against them, and those three are all likely to emerge victorious.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">In the Muzaffarnagar constituency, parts of which were affected by the riots, the two candidates &#8212; one from the B.J.P. and the other from the Bahujan Samaj Party, had been named in initial police reports. </p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">By late afternoon, Sanjeev Baliyan of the B.J.P. had taken a hefty lead over Kadir Rana of the Bahujan Samaj Party, or B.S.P., a regional party headed by the Dalit leader Mayawati, who goes by one name. Her party, which has traditionally attracted Dalits, was not leading any constituencies in the state.  </p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">The other two B.J.P. candidates were also leading by considerable margins in their respective constituencies.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Manish Shukla, a spokesman for the party in Uttar Pradesh, said the people of in the state were voting for development and were punishing the other parties for corruption, high inflation and general lawlessness in the state. </p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">&#8220;People have also realized that caste and religion no longer play a role,&#8221; he said. He blamed the other parties for trying to capitalize on the violence for electoral gains but said voters had seen through the ploy.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Neerja Chowdhury, a political analyst, credited <a href="//india.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/04/08/comments-by-modis-top-aide-reveal-religions-role-in-party-strategy/">Amit Shah</a>, Mr. Modiâs right-hand man in the state, for the party&#8217;s success there. Mr. Shah was reported to have made statements at a gathering near Muzaffarnagar to Hindu farmers <a href="//india.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/04/08/comments-by-modis-top-aide-reveal-religions-role-in-party-strategy/">invoking the need for ârevenge.â</a></p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">&#8220;The B.J.P went for the kill in Uttar Pradesh,â she said. &#8220;The poor showing of the B.S.P. shows that a good chunk of Dalits, or lower-caste Hindus, have gone to the B.J.P.&#8221;</p>

<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Rajeeva Laxman Karandikar, a statistician who contributed to the CNN-IBN/Lokniti exit poll, which predicted that the B.J.P.-led coalition, National Democratic Alliance, would win 275 seats in this election, gave an overview of the national trends. </p>
<blockquote><p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">It is a comprehensive victory for Mr. Modi. It is now clear that the B.J.P. alone is within striking distance of the halfway mark, even as Election Commission trends showed that the B.J.P. was leading in 277 seats out of 534 as of 12:36 p.m. With their existing partners they are way past that mark.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">For Congress it has been a complete rout. Only in Kerala they are ahead of everyone else, everywhere else they are behind. They will need a big introspection about how to build back from there.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">A.A.P. is only getting seats in Punjab; in Delhi they are getting nothing. There are two things &#8212; their original support base moved away from them because they did not approve of the way A.A.P. conducted itself by giving up its government. They were generally being in an agitational mode only and not in a delivery mode. They got carried away.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Nationwide there is a pro-Modi mood. In the end A.A.P. ended up damaging Congress rather than B.J.P.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">They would still have to contend with the regional players in the Rajya Sabha [the upper house of Parliament] even if they go alone at the center. The cooperation of regional parties is a must.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">The most surprising trend has come from Assam where the B.J.P. has done rather well. We failed to catch a big ground-level movement, the more or less dissemination of the Left from Bengal. The B.J.P. might get more seats in Bengal than the CPI (M) [Communist Party of India (Marxist)].</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">We have still wait for final numbers, but it is way above what we expected for the B.J.P.</p>

<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">As early election results strongly point to a resounding victory for the Bharatiya Janata Party and Mr. Modi, analysts say that trade and commerce could come to the forefront of Indiaâs foreign relations, particularly with the United States. From Akshay Mathur, head of research at Gateway House, a foreign policy think tank based in Mumbai:</p>
<blockquote><p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Narendra Modi has publicly said that his foreign policy consists of a focus on neighbors diplomatically, and for everyone else outside the neighborhood, a focus on strategic and commercial relationships. So clearly there is an indication that his relationship with the United States and Europe will be decided on a more commercial basis. One of the immediate actions may be that he will beef up our commercial counselors and economic diplomacy with the United States and put that front and center.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">The United States still has a bipartisan resolution signed by about 51 congressmen and senators against Mr. Modi. So it is clear that there is a contingency in the United States that is hesitant to accept him as a leader given his past, but it is a small constituency. But given that President Obama was the first foreign leader to congratulate India on its elections and express his willingness to work with the new government, some of that will get ironed out.</p>

<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Ellen Barry of The New York Times <a href="//www.nytimes.com/2014/05/17/world/asia/india-elections.html">wrote</a> that a wave of new voters are coming out for the B.J.P. in India, voters too young to be affected by previous blots on the party&#8217;s reputation.</p>
<blockquote><p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">But Mr. Modi seemed to benefit from changes in the electorate. Nearly 100 million new voters were registered ahead of this vote, including a vast influx of young people, and turnout broke all previous records, hitting 66.4 percent.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Compared with their elders, these young voters were unmoved by the decade-old history of the Gujarat riots, which had prompted many Western governments, including the United States, to impose visa bans on Mr. Modi. They also proved far less emotionally bound to the Nehru-Gandhi dynasty, which has served as the backbone of the Congress party since India won its independence, surviving the wrenching assassinations of two of its members.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Shekhar Gupta, editor of The Indian Express, a daily newspaper, called them âpost-ideological Indians.â</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">âThese people are born after Indira Gandhiâs assassination,â he said. âFor a lot of them, the 2002 riots are not even a faint blur. What is imprinted on their memory is five years of nongovernance, and a massive loss of white-collar jobs. Once you have gotten used to 7 percent growth, to go down to 4.5 is a real recession.â</p>

</div>
<div class="updated-entry-content">
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">One thing to watch in the election results is whether a coalition will need to seek more parties in order to form a government. In Indiaâs democratic history, the lower house of Parliament, or Lok Sabha, has dissolved four times when a temperamental coalition partner withdrew.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Incidentally, this has never happened to the Indian National Congress party, which leads the current government and is widely expected to be trounced Friday.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Hereâs a chronological look at some of the tumultuous parliamentary elections in the recent past and what they mean for Fridayâs results:</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">1990: Chaos prevailed when a coalition of opposition parties formed the government and lost the support of the Bharatiya Janata Party after just a year. <a href="//www.nytimes.com/1990/11/10/world/rival-of-singh-becomes-india-premier.html" title="Chandra Shekhar becomes prime minister">V.P. Singh was succeeded as prime minister by Chandra Shekhar</a>, who was in power for only six months before he lost the support of Congress, and fresh elections were held.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">1996: After the <a href="//www.nytimes.com/1992/12/08/world/at-least-200-killed-in-india-as-muslim-hindu-riots-rage.html" title="New York Times article about riots in India after the destruction of the mosque in Ayodhya">nationwide violence precipitated by the destruction in 1992 of an ancient mosque in Ayodhya in Uttar Pradesh</a>, the Bharatiya Janata Party, led by Atal Bihari Vajpayee, had become a political pariah. With 161 seats, it was the single largest party, but it was not able to attract any major coalition partner. After 13 days of failed efforts, Mr. Vajpayee resigned as prime minister, making his term the shortest in Indiaâs history.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Congress supported a Third Front leader, <a href="//www.nytimes.com/1997/04/12/world/india-coalition-too-unwieldy-to-rule.html" title="H.D. Deve Gowda resigns">H.D. Deve Gowda, who resigned after 11 months</a>. After one more attempt by a third party to rule the country, fresh elections were held.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">1998: Mr. Vajpayeeâs party once again won a majority, but again <a href="//www.nytimes.com/1999/04/27/world/india-dissolves-parliament-calls-3d-election-in-3-years.html" title="India dissolves Parliament">lost its coalition after 13 months</a>. This time it was because Jayalalithaa Jayaram, the chief minister of Tamil Nadu, withdrew as a coalition partner by inviting Sonia Gandhi, the Congress party matriarch, to tea. The B.J.P. scrambled, but in the end lost the government by a single vote.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">1999: Fresh elections were held. This time, the B.J.P. not only won but retained its majority, and Mr. Vajpayee completed his term in 2004.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">What does all this have to do with the count on Friday? If Congress is indeed headed for a crushing defeat as exit polls and analysts widely predict, it is important to remember that non-Congress parties have historically had difficulty keeping the peace with temperamental coalition partners. If the B.J.P. is headed for a majority, the margins will be key. If the B.J.P. and its allies retain close to 272 seats on their own, a stable government is likely. But if itâs much less, coalition partners will be crucial to a governmentâs longevity.</p>

<div class="updated-entry-content">
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">The Indian stock markets will open soon. While the Indian markets have been soaring to record highs on the anticipation of a change in leadership, analysts warn that the optimism might be overestimating the impact of a new government on Indiaâs struggling economy. </p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Leif Lybecker Eskesen, chief economist for India and Southeast Asia at HSBC Global Research in Singapore, said in a phone interview:</p>
<blockquote><p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Itâs important not to over-estimate how much impact the elections will have on the Indian economy in the short term. Essentially what has slowed down growth in India are structural factors and the lack of progress on the implementation of economic reforms. A new government, even one with a strong mandate, cannot instigate immediate change on either front. </p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Itâs going to take a while before you can line up structural reform and economic reform and get them through the political machinery, and implement them and they begin to have an effect on growth. The economy will not see much of a recovery in the current fiscal year. I think itâs going to by the next fiscal year that we begin to see the impact of the changes made post election.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Itâs also important not to underestimate the impact of the elections from the medium-term perspective, say three years down the road, if a new government gets sufficient progress on structural and economic reforms over the next one to two years.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">It is important for a new government to demonstrate that it has the political willingness to move forward with economic reforms. In the first couple of months of the new government it would be key for the new leadership to make progress on some key economic reforms that have been lingering for a while, such as implementing the goods and services tax, liberalizing foreign direct investment into the economy and taking the Land Acquisition Bill through. </p>

</div>
<div class="updated-entry-content">
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">As the Election Commission counts the votes for 543 parliamentary constituencies, India Ink readers would do well to remember that anything could happen.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Exit polls released Monday have predicted a solid victory for a Bharatiya Janata Party-led alliance, but exit polls have been spectacularly wrong before. Any party or coalition of parties must gain 272 seats in the Lok Sabha, or lower house of Parliament, to achieve a majority and form a government.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Here are the possible scenarios for the next government:</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">1) The B.J.P. and its current allies â three major parties and about two dozen smaller parties â may cross the majority mark on their own. In that case, the president of India will invite the leader of B.J.P.âs parliamentary party to <a href="//lawmin.nic.in/olwing/coi/coi-english/Const.Pock%202Pg.Rom8Fsss%289%29.pdf">form the government</a>.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">2) The B.J.P. and its allies may fall short of a majority but still emerge as the single largest coalition. Around the 240-seat mark, it would become necessary for the coalition to corral <a href="//www.nytimes.com/interactive/2014/04/13/world/100000002821483.mobile.html">powerful regional players</a>. In this case, the president would invite the leader of the coalition to form the government. The coalition would have to prove on the floor of the Lok Sabha that it has a majority by the presidentâs deadline.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">The B.J.P. would then meet with smaller parties and strong regional leaders to get their support, which would likely include some deal-making, especially regarding cabinet positions. Jayalalithaa Jayaramâs party in Tamil Nadu and Mamata Banerjeeâs in West Bengal are considered two important but mercurial players in this scenario.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">3) If the B.J.P. and its allies fall significantly short of a majority and fail to come up with enough additional partners on the floor of the Lok Sabha, the president would ask the Indian National Congress-led government to continue while he starts a dialogue with other big parties.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">An alternative coalition could be formed by the Congress party or by a so-called <a href="//india.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/02/25/new-coalition-takes-on-indias-two-biggest-parties/">Third Front</a>, a group of parties that doesnât include the two main national players. Any coalition would be asked prove it has a majority on the floor of the Lok Sabha.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">4) If the alternative coalition also fails to get a majority, the president will continue to try to resolve the deadlock with party leaders. If no consensus emerges, the Lok Sabha will be dissolved, and fresh elections will be called. But this is the most unlikely outcome, as the Lok Sabha has never been dissolved immediately after elections in Indiaâs independent history.</p>
