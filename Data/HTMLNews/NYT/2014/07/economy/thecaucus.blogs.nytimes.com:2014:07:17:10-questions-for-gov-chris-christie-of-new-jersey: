<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Chris Christie has returned to the national spotlight in recent weeks, attending the National Governors Association meeting in Nashville, a media and technology gathering in Idaho, and making <a href="//www.nytimes.com/2014/07/16/us/politics/christie-to-test-presidential-hopes-in-iowa-trip.html">a campaign trip to Iowa</a>. Mr. Christie, a New Jersey Republican and potential presidential candidate in 2016 who is recovering from political wounds caused by a lane-closure scandal, sat down with John Harwood of The Times and CNBC on Wednesday at CNBC&#8217;s Delivering Alpha conference in New York to discuss his party, his state&#8217;s pension shortfall, the bridge-closure controversy and his presidential prospects. What follows is a condensed, edited transcript of the conversation.</p>
<div class="q left">Q.</div>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody"> Pew Research Center did a study of voters of both parties. On the Republican side, you have a split between the business Republicans, the people in this room, and your populist Tea Party Republicans. These guys have the money, the populists have more votes. Populists say international trade is bad for the country. Business Republicans say it&#8217;s good. Populists say don&#8217;t think about cutting Social Security. Immigration â populists say it&#8217;s bad. Homosexuality, the populist wing says it&#8217;s not O.K. People in this room, business Republicans, say it&#8217;s O.K. How do you knit those together?</p>
<div class="a left">A.</div>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody"> Carefully.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody"><span id="more-248728"></span></p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">There&#8217;s always divides inside any vibrant, political movement, and so the way is just be yourself, here&#8217;s what I believe in. And try to convince people that if what they are look for is a candidate they agree with 100 percent of the time, what they need to do is go home and look in the mirror. They&#8217;re it. You are the only person you agree with 100 percent of the time on these issues. So don&#8217;t try to be that. If you try to be that, they are going to perceive you as a phony, because you are.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">So don&#8217;t look at someone&#8217;s eyes and say oh, I know what you are thinking. I could feel it and I just want to tell her exactly what she wants to hear, and then pray to God she forgets what I said when I do the opposite. Just own up to it, own up to what your positions are, say what they are.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">If that&#8217;s not good enough to win, you wouldn&#8217;t want to govern under those circumstances, because you have to keep remembering who you pretended to be yesterday. I don&#8217;t think that&#8217;s the way to govern, it&#8217;s complicated enough as it is, without trying to figure that out too.</p>
<div class="q left">Q.</div>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody"> We can make an economy produce high stock values, high corporate profits, do very well for the people who are best off in the country, the most educated. But what do you do to raise the living standards of average people in this country? What&#8217;s the right approach for that?</p>
<div class="a left">A.</div>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody"> There are certain principles that help to create a vibrant economy, and I think things we are not doing at the moment. First off, we have a wretched tax system in this country, federally, individual, corporate level and at the state-based level in lots of states, including my own; dis-incentivizes entrepreneurial job creation and which make us less competitive with the rest of the world. So the fact is, we need to get around the table and redo this tax system, which I think is one of the real wet blankets on our economy.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Secondly, you need to go through regulatory reform. In New Jersey, we have eliminated a third of regulations that existed and put into place by Governor Corzine. I could tell you I hear from businesses what a relief that&#8217;s been for them and how much easier it is to conduct business and our water is cleaner and our air is cleaner and there&#8217;s nothing awful happening over in New Jersey, because we decided to do regulation in a common sense way. We need to look at that federally as well, if you want a vibrant growing economy in that direction.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Third is about improving our educational systems. The fact is that we have now gone from 20th to 30th in math. We have now gone from 10th to 20th in reading, amongst the industrialized nations. If you think we can continue that trend and still be the smartest most competitive, most cutting edge economy in the world, then you&#8217;re wrong.<br />
We have an educational system in this country now that puts the adults before the children. The fact is, there are ineffective teachers all across this country, protected by the tenure system that is the essence of anticompetitiveness.</p>
<div class="q left">Q.</div>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody"> What you hear from Republicans in Washington is government needs to do less, spend less, we need to borrow less, get out of the way. From Democrats you say we need, as Hillary Clinton said recently, the building blocks of a 21st-century economy: more infrastructure, more science, more education and work force training. Where are you on that?</p>
<div class="a left">A.</div>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody"> Democrats believe the government are the people who could be doing those things that Mrs. Clinton mentioned and Republicans believe the private sector is better to do that. That&#8217;s the fundamental core disagreement. Now having run a government for five years, I agree with my party even more than I did before.<br />
I think we need less government being intrusive in our lives in every way it is. Now, there are absolute fundamental roles for government, which is protecting the health, safety and welfare of its citizens. So I believe in a strong and vigorous national defense, I believe that government has an appropriate role in regulating different activities that go on in the country, but I think what&#8217;s happened is there&#8217;s a divide between the two parties, where who can do most of that best.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">I for certain believe it&#8217;s wrong to say government needs to spend more money on education. In my state, we spend $17,700 per pupil on average on K-to-12 education. We do not have a spending problem in education in New Jersey. We have a quality problem in many parts of our state.  Infrastructure is uniquely a governmental role. Well, where&#8217;s the money coming from exactly? We do need at some point to say there&#8217;s a bottom to this. But do I think that infrastructure is something the government needs to invest in and needs to partner with folks on? Absolutely I do.</p>
<div class="q left">Q.</div>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody"> What responsibility do you have as governor, that job creation has been slower and unemployment higher in New Jersey?</p>
<div class="a left">A.</div>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody"> Some. Listen, you are the guy in charge, so you have some responsibility for it. but I haven&#8217;t been able to put a lot of policies I wanted to put in effect, the tax policy in particular, because I have a Democratic legislature who has passed, in this context, of what we are talking about, four income tax increases in the last five years. And I have vetoed all of them.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">I&#8217;m the guy at the gate, trying to keep the barbarians away from increasing taxes more. Just a week and a half ago, I vetoed another increase, significant proposed corporate business tax increase, because they have to continue to feed the beast of their patrons in the public sector union.</p>
<div class="q left">Q.</div>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody"> Let me ask about other things the Obama administration has done. They get criticism on their left, but also some from the Tea Party right who say the Obama administration bailed out Wall Street, people who did things wrong and they haven&#8217;t prosecuted people, people want to go to jail for some of the stuff that&#8217;s happened. Do you agree with that?</p>
<div class="a left">A.</div>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody"> I spent seven years as the prosecutor in New Jersey; I understand these are lot more nuanced than that. I don&#8217;t know everything the prosecutors know about what their investigations uncovered, and I&#8217;m not going to be one of those guys to sit here and be a Monday morning quarterback on that stuff. I know how complicated it is. I did it seven years. So it&#8217;s the easiest thing to dump on them. I&#8217;m not going to do that.</p>
<div class="q left">Q.</div>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody"> One of the things that we started to hear a lot in your party, especially from the populist party, is critiques of crony capitalism, the system; like some on the left say is rigged, and people have inside dealings with Washington. And what&#8217;s come to stand as the emblem of that, there was an issue in Virginia, the question of the export, import bank, which Eric Cantor supported, and the populist wing and the Republican Party said that is crony capitalism. It&#8217;s helping Boeing, other big companies make deals. They can make the deals themselves. Do you agree with them?</p>
<div class="a left">A.</div>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody"> I think those issues are much more complicated than a lot of people want to take me out to be. The fact is that the government, I think, does have a role in trying to make our country as competitive as we can be, with the folks around the world.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">We have to decide how we want it to be and what basis we want it to be. I don&#8217;t disagree with folks who say there are times when that goes overboard and that&#8217;s where the Congress is supposed to be vigilant. And if they believe that&#8217;s the case, then they need to step in and do something about it. And if the people don&#8217;t like what Congress is doing, they kick people out.</p>
<div class="q left">Q.</div>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody"> You&#8217;ve said you&#8217;re not going to make the contribution to the pension system. Doesn&#8217;t that suggest that the achievement which you have been hailing as a major step forward has actually been unraveled and is not an achievement because you don&#8217;t have a funded pension program?</p>
<div class="a left">A.</div>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody"> No. First of all, what I&#8217;m doing is making the pension payments that we can afford to make and the pension payment that takes care of all of the current employees. All current employees who are making an increased pension payment themselves, we&#8217;re making the payment for all of them. What I can&#8217;t afford to do this year because of declining revenues is pay for the sins of my predecessors.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">New Jersey is already the second highest tax state in America. I have to make a balanced judgment between the benefit of making an increased pension payment versus the harm that will be done by taking our top income tax rate to 10.75 percent.</p>
<div class="q left">Q.</div>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody"> You have a reputation, appearance of being straight-talking, problem-solver, but we can also listen to you say the Legislature is the one who messed up Tesla, the state economists overestimated revenues, past governors created the pension problem. It sound as if like you are passing off responsibility to others, having run in 2009 and saying hey, you sit in the big chair, it&#8217;s on you.</p>
<div class="a left">A.</div>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody"> It is on me. You may not like it, but the truth is I didn&#8217;t sign the law that prevented Tesla from doing it. A previous governor did. The truth is I didn&#8217;t dig the hole in the pension system, that I made more payments to the pension system, $2.9 billion, than any other governor in New Jersey history. In fact, in the 15 years before I got here, they made about 20 percent of that amount in terms of payments. That&#8217;s a fact. That&#8217;s not ducking responsibility, because I&#8217;m the one now trying to solve it. That&#8217;s taking responsibility. But I don&#8217;t have an obligation to suck things in that I didn&#8217;t do.</p>
<div class="q left">Q.</div>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody"> One dumb thing that everybody â the whole world knows about that happened on your watch was the bridge closure. I was talking to an aide to one of the most powerful Republicans in Washington. He said here&#8217;s what I want to know. When you are a senior aide to an important politician like that, you develop a sense of what&#8217;s O.K. with them and what isn&#8217;t. And most staffers do not go rogue and do things they know their boss would disapprove of. He said the issue isn&#8217;t whether Christie knew about the lane closures. It&#8217;s how did he run an administration where people very close to him thought that was O.K. to do.</p>
<div class="a left">A.</div>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody"> Well, the key part of that brilliant aide&#8217;s analysis, who&#8217;s probably never run anything in his or her life, is when he or she said most aides don&#8217;t do that. Key part of that â most aides. The whole point is that when someone goes rogue, as â the definition is you are doing something that isn&#8217;t acceptable. Someone went rogue on my watch. Now, listen, I&#8217;m accountable for that, and if you haven&#8217;t watched what&#8217;s been going on the last six months, I think there&#8217;s been a decent amount of accountability thrown my way, and I have accepted.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">I turn over every email, every text message, everyone gets to look at it, and it&#8217;s become clear now, he didn&#8217;t know. Then they go O.K., let&#8217;s shift it to, he didn&#8217;t know, but he created an atmosphere where this type of thing was permissible. I didn&#8217;t. In fact, the atmosphere we created over time has allowed for more bipartisan accomplishment than you have seen in probably any state capitol across the country, with a Republican governor and Democratic Legislature. Why would Democrats ever sit down with me, let alone make agreements with me that, in fact, I kept to and they kept to? So the point is, someone went rogue. I am very unhappy about that, and extraordinarily disappointed, and saddened by it. I am ultimately accountable for it, but don&#8217;t give me this garbage about he created an atmosphere.  If that was the straight line, it would have happened many more times than just at the tail end of the fourth year of the administration.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">The people understand where I stand, and who I am. That&#8217;s why the people of New Jersey don&#8217;t believe that I had anything to do with this, because they know me. And they have gotten to know me over the years. The fact is, when you run an organization of 65,000 employees, there are going to be times people do things that are monumentally stupid and maybe inexplicable to the person at the top. This would be one of those moments. I can&#8217;t explain it. I wish I could, but I can&#8217;t. My job then is to take decisive action in the aftermath. We terminated the people who were involved with it, we put together a private group to go and look at what happened here, give me suggestions on how to change the structure of my office, to prevent it in the future. And then to fully cooperate with any outside authority looking at that conduct.<br />
If that disqualifies you from being perceived as an effective leader, then the few people left who have not had one of these experiences will soon be disqualified too, because they will have it.</p>
<div class="q left">Q.</div>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody"> You&#8217;re running?</p>
<div class="a left">A.</div>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody"> Such a great question.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">You should beware of people, in my opinion, who are overanxious to make that decision before they need to. That would indicate to me ambition before wisdom. And I don&#8217;t think that&#8217;s what you want from the person sitting in the Oval Office. I think what you want from that person is wisdom and strength and determination and a sense inside them that they&#8217;re there for a reason, not just for the title. And I think anybody who at that moment decided hey, I&#8217;m the guy. Be careful of that person, I think. So, I&#8217;m going to be very deliberative about this.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">I&#8217;ve got lots of people who are in my ear all the time, telling me you&#8217;ve got to do this. I do what I want to do. And what I think is best for me first, for my family second, for my state third and for my country fourth. That&#8217;s the order of responsibility I have.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">And by the way, it&#8217;s pretty nice to be asked. If you really stink, they don&#8217;t ask. You know? If you&#8217;re awful, no one&#8217;s asking.</p>
