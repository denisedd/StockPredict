            <p class="paid-text">Rising anxiety over the prospects for the global economy in 2015 hasn&#x2019;t shaken the confidence of corporate dealmakers, especially in the United States. Among senior executives recently surveyed by EY, more than 80 percent of U.S. respondents said they expect the global market for mergers and acquisitions (M&amp;A) to improve in the next 12 months, compared with 60 percent of respondents globally.</p>
            <div class="graphic-right graph-mobile"> <img src="https://paidpost-assets.nyt.com/paidpost/ey/big-deal/images/markets-respondents-graph-mobile.png"></div>
            <p class="paid-text">The results of the survey of more than 1,600 executives in 62 countries &#x2014; including more than 400 from the U.S. &#x2014; are reported in the <a href="http://www.ey.com/US/en/Services/Transactions/EY-capital-confidence-barometer-United-States?CMPNID=CCB_NYT_US_PaidPost_Nov2014" target="_blank">October 2014 edition of EY&#x2019;s Capital Confidence Barometer.</a></p>
            <p class="paid-text">U.S. executives&#x2019; confidence in the M&amp;A market reflects their notable optimism about the stability of the economic environment, as the survey found broad-based positive sentiment regarding corporate earnings, credit and market stability, and job creation. These executives overwhelmingly see the economic outlook as either stable or improving, both globally and in the U.S. By comparison, executives outside the U.S., facing greater exposure to geopolitical instability and economic headwinds, appear to be shifting their outlook from improving to stable.</p>
            <p class="paid-text">&#x201C;After a slow but steady macroeconomic recovery that saw the U.S. out in front, our most recent survey gives every indication that the U.S. will be ahead of the curve in dealmaking, as well,&#x201D; says Richard M. Jeanneret, EY&#x2019;s Americas Vice Chair, Transaction Advisory Services. &#x201C;U.S. executives appear to have factored some amount of macroeconomic risk into their outlook and are prepared to transact in this new environment.&#x201D;</p>
            <h3>Momentum Moves to the Middle</h3>
            <p class="paid-text">As predicted in a previous edition of the Capital Confidence Barometer, 2014 has seen a big increase in multibillion-dollar &#x201C;megadeals.&#x201D; Examples include <a href="http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2014/02/12/comcast-set-to-acquire-time-warner-cable/?_php=true&amp;_type=blogs&amp;_r=0" target="_blank">Comcast&#x2019;s proposed acquisition of Time Warner Cable for nearly $45 billion</a> and <a href="http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2014/05/18/att-to-buy-directv-for-48-5-billion/" target="_blank">AT&amp;T&#x2019;s proposed acquisition of DirecTV for $48.5 billion.</a> With the climate still favorable for these &#x201C;megadeals,&#x201D; further transformational and market-disrupting transactions are expected in the near term.</p>
            <p class="paid-text">Beyond these megadeals, the growth engine of M&amp;A over the next year is likely to be the middle market, involving matches valued at less than $1 billion. EY&#x2019;s analysis of year-on-year changes in deal volumes shows that previous upturns have been led by megadeals and upper-middle-market deals, followed by an upswing in the lower middle market. Large transactions create M&amp;A activity further down the deal-size chain as companies look to reshape recently acquired assets.</p>
            <p class="paid-text">&#x201C;In the U.S., the cycle is proceeding on schedule, as we see a major increase in companies&#x2019; expectations for deals in the middle market,&#x201D; says Jeanneret. Seventy-one percent of U.S. executives say their sweet spot during the next 12 months will be deal values between $50 million and $250 million; that category is up from only 43 percent in EY&#x2019;s April 2014 survey. &#x201C;We believe the confidence we have seen this year via the larger deals will cross over to the middle market, as dealmakers take more risk in light of an overall improving economic environment,&#x201D; Jeanneret adds.</p> <img src="https://paidpost-assets.nyt.com/paidpost/ey/big-deal/images/mid-market-graph.png" class="large-graph graph-desktop"> <img src="https://paidpost-assets.nyt.com/paidpost/ey/big-deal/images/mid-market-graph-mobile.png" class="large-graph graph-mobile">
            <p class="paid-text">A renewed focus on defending, strengthening and expanding core business operations is motivating acquisitions, as businesses look to boost market share, manage costs and improve margin growth in a rapidly changing business environment. For example, to bolster its portfolio of sterile injectable products, <a href="http://manufacturing.pharmaceutical-business-review.com/news/pfizer-acquires-innopharma-260914-4385982" target="_blank">Pfizer acquired InnoPharma, a private drug development company, for $360 million.</a></p>
            <p class="paid-text">Middle-market companies appear to be boosting dealmaking plans (and may be targets themselves), while larger companies are analyzing geographic, product and market gaps and looking to fill them with quality assets. For example, to diversify its lineup of sausages and hot dogs with products perceived as healthier options, <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2014-04-21/hillshire-to-buy-van-s-natural-foods-for-165-million.html" target="_blank">Hillshire Brands acquired Van&#x2019;s Natural Foods for $165 million.</a></p>
            <h3>A More Disciplined Approach</h3>
            <p class="paid-text">Executives&#x2019; approach to dealmaking appears to be more disciplined than it was a decade ago. When asked whether they will actually execute a deal in the next 12 months, one-third of U.S. companies say yes &#x2014; an improvement from the April 2014 survey, but still a fairly modest result. The number of U.S. companies planning acquisitions is lower than the overall global number and contrasts with U.S. respondents&#x2019; more positive outlook for deal market growth.</p>
            <p class="paid-text">The explanation may lie in U.S. executives&#x2019; concern over their ability to complete deals. Just over one-third of executives are confident about the likelihood of closing acquisitions. Executives&#x2019; caution may also reflect increased rigor in their search for and analysis of strategically aligned assets, their more thorough due diligence and the greater overall competition for quality assets.</p>
            <p class="paid-text">Renewed discipline in dealmaking is causing companies to thoroughly examine many more investment opportunities to find the best strategic fit. The number of U.S. companies that have more than five deals in their respective pipelines has increased significantly &#x2014; up to 41 percent from only 8 percent six months ago.</p>
            <p class="paid-text">Overall, the number of deals being considered by respondents has substantially increased, with the aggregate global total up 30 percent since April 2014. In addition, two-thirds of executives expect M&amp;A pipelines to expand further over the next year &#x2014; more than double the number expecting expansion six months ago. Global respondents have fewer deals currently in the pipeline than U.S. companies, but they are more likely than U.S. executives to anticipate pipeline growth over the next 12 months &#x2014; confirming that the U.S. is further along in its M&amp;A upswing.</p>
            <p class="paid-text">Although the overwhelming majority of companies are focusing on acquiring businesses in their core sectors, U.S. companies are much more likely than their global counterparts to consider high-risk or &#x201C;disruptive&#x201D; investments &#x2014; again indicating that the U.S. M&amp;A market is ahead of the curve.</p> <img src="https://paidpost-assets.nyt.com/paidpost/ey/big-deal/images/small-graph-left.png" class="graphic-left graph-desktop"> <img src="https://paidpost-assets.nyt.com/paidpost/ey/big-deal/images/small-graph-left-mobile.png" class="graphic-left graph-mobile">
            <p class="paid-text">About half of U.S. companies expect their inorganic growth to take the form of &#x201C;disruptive&#x201D; deals &#x2014; acquisitions that change the structure and direction of their business models &#x2014; compared with less than a quarter of global companies. &#x201C;U.S. companies would rather be transformative than incremental,&#x201D; says Jeanneret.</p>
            <h3>Automotive and Technology In Front</h3>
            <p class="paid-text">Executives in the automotive and transportation sector expressed the keenest interest in dealmaking. Just over half (51 percent) said they expected their company to pursue acquisitions during the next 12 months, compared with 33 percent of all U.S. executives surveyed.</p>
            <p class="paid-text">The sector&#x2019;s M&amp;A activity is being driven by renewed optimism around increasing sales in both developed and emerging markets and an industry-wide drive to decrease costs and improve efficiencies. A significant number of deals have focused on acquiring emergent technologies, such as driverless cars, and advanced materials.</p> <img src="https://paidpost-assets.nyt.com/paidpost/ey/big-deal/images/us-sectors.png" class="graphic-right">
            <p class="paid-text">For example, ZF Friedrichshafen, a leading European maker of transmissions and other auto parts, <a href="http://ir.trw.com/releasedetail.cfm?ReleaseID=884022" target="_blank">plans to take control</a> of TRW Automotive, a U.S. maker of safety systems, for $12.4 billion. Recognizing the auto industry&#x2019;s increasing demand for aluminum, France-based aluminum supplier Constellium is acquiring Alabama-based supplier Wise Metals for $1.4 billion.</p>
            <p class="paid-text">The appetite for deals is also especially high among technology executives, as 38 percent expect to pursue deals during the next year. Dealmaking is motivated by increasing competition for assets related to smart mobility, cloud computing, social networking, big data analytics and accelerated adaptation, as well as new technologies such as the Internet of Things (IoT) and augmented or virtual reality. Leading examples include Facebook&#x2019;s acquisitions of <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/parmyolson/2014/10/06/facebook-closes-19-billion-whatsapp-deal/" target="_blank">mobile messaging service WhatsApp for $19 billion</a> and <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/jul/22/facebook-oculus-rift-acquisition-virtual-reality" target="_blank">Oculus VR, the maker of a virtual reality headset, for $2 billion.</a></p>
            <h3>Shareholder Activism Rises</h3>
            <p class="paid-text">As they intensify their pursuit of deals, U.S. executives are also stepping up their efforts to proactively respond to the trend of shareholder activism, according to the EY survey. Nearly a third of U.S. companies are watching out for early warning signs of activist pressure, and close to one-fifth are conducting a so-called &#x201C;activist audit&#x201D; to improve cost controls, efficiencies and performance.</p>
            <p class="paid-text">Shareholders are shaping transaction activity too: 60 percent of companies have elevated spinoffs, IPOs, strategic divestments and acquisitions on their boardroom agenda as a result of shareholder activism. On the whole, 81 percent of U.S. respondents report that they are addressing activism in various concrete ways. An example is eBay&#x2019;s announced plan to spin off its PayPal unit into a separate publicly traded company &#x2014; <a href="http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2014/09/30/ebay-to-spin-off-paypal-adopting-strategy-backed-by-icahn/" target="_blank">a move previously advocated by activist investor Carl Icahn.</a></p>
            <p class="paid-text">U.S. executives also expect global megatrends to have a significant impact on their business and acquisition strategies. Like their global counterparts, U.S. executives cite the future of work &#x2014; shifting employment patterns and the impact of technology and mobility on workplace practices &#x2014; as their key concern. Accordingly, 48 percent said it would affect their core business strategy more than any other trend in the next 12 months.</p>
            <p class="paid-text">&#x201C;The move to a more flexible workforce will provide more opportunities for collaboration and productivity, as well as acquisitions,&#x201D; says Jeanneret. &#x201C;Dealmaking in many industries, especially those that are high-tech or IP-rich, will center on the battle for talent.&#x201D;</p>
            <p class="paid-text">U.S. executives cited digital transformation as a leading concern for both business and acquisition strategies. Emergent technologies are combining with advanced networks, computing and new ways of communicating to fundamentally change businesses.</p>
            <p class="paid-text">&#x201C;As companies adapt to these advances, dealmakers in all industries will need to decide where to strategically invest in technology,&#x201D; says Jeanneret. &#x201C;Front-end early adapters will be the most attractive acquisition targets, offering innovative and nimble strategic capabilities to acquirers.&#x201D;</p>
