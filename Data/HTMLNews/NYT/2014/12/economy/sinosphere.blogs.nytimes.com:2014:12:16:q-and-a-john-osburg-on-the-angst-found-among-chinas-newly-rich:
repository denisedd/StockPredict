<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">In the first part of an interview, Mr. Osburg discussed how embedded corrupt practices are in China, the prospects for change after President Xi Jinping&#8217;s crackdown on graft and why so many rich Chinese are emigrating. In a second part, he will discuss his latest research on the surprising turn that many of China&#8217;s new rich have made toward Tibetan Buddhism and other forms of spiritual fulfillment. </p>
<div class="q left">Q.</div>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody"><strong>How did you get the idea of studying China&#8217;s new rich? </strong></p>
<div class="a left">A.</div>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">I went to China in 1997 to teach English in a teachers college in Guangzhou. Some of my male students began to complain about rich men taking âtheir womenâ away. It was often, &#8220;These men have no education, but they are rich and now have three wives and I can&#8217;t get married even though I&#8217;m a respectable, but poor, teacher.&#8221;<br />
<span id="more-24299"></span></p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">I began to realize that I was witnessing a society that was undergoing a transition from being one of the most equal to one of the most unequal in the world. A lot of attention has focused on the new poor in China, but I wanted to look at the new rich and how both they themselves and ordinary Chinese interpreted their rise. I chose Chengdu because it&#8217;s farther from the coast and maybe then was a bit less further along in its development than cities like Beijing or Shanghai.</p>
<div class="q left">Q.</div>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody"><strong>And you were aided by being on a local television show? </strong></p>
<div class="a left">A.</div>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Basically it was an infomercial. The show was about a foreigner examining Chinese culture. I&#8217;d say, âToday we&#8217;re going to learn about Chinese tea culture.â And we&#8217;d go do a feature on a tea house that had sponsored us.</p>
<div class="q left">Q.</div>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody"><strong>So you were already involved in corruption!</strong></p>
<div class="a left">A.</div>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Right! &#8220;Today I&#8217;m going to take my foreign friends to my favorite Chinese restaurant.&#8221; Not only was it a restaurant I&#8217;d never been to, which had paid us, but I was with people I&#8217;d never met before &#8212; a student from Ukraine, or Ghana, or wherever, who were posing as my friends. But the business owners I met through the show became subjects for my book. They were some of my first informants. </p>
<div class="q left">Q.</div>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody"><strong>And you found that they felt they could only get ahead by cultivating officials over banquets and socializing. It sounds similar to Japan, where socializing is so important after hours.<br />
</strong></p>
<div class="a left">A.</div>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">In Japan you have a rigid workplace hierarchy. Drinking is a way to break this down by drinking and joking around with oneâs colleagues and maybe making fun of the boss. There is also a similar courtship of clients in hostess clubs in Japan. But itâs my understanding that the shared consumption of sexual services is less integral to business deals than in China. And I think state officials are not really present to the degree they are in China.</p>
<div class="q left">Q.</div>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody"><strong>Could this be because there is less of a state role in the Japanese economy? </strong></p>
<div class="a left">A.</div>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">This is true, but even if connections to the state are not significant for business success, China is still a society where social connections are necessary for almost all endeavors. For example, if I want you to contribute an essay to a book I&#8217;m working on, I&#8217;m going to take you out to tea and chat you up. So officials may no longer be part of the courtship in nightclubs, but other people will still be there &#8212; bosses, clients and so on. There will still be a need to cultivate people for all sorts of purposes. And banqueting, drinking and entertaining in nightclubs will still be a part of this. </p>
<div class="q left">Q.</div>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody"><strong>Women play a big role in this. </strong></p>
<div class="a left">A.</div>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">There&#8217;s a saying that as soon as a man gets rich he goes bad and as soon as a woman goes bad, she becomes rich. I&#8217;d heard that over and over again, that notion that wealth was corrupting men &#8212; the figure of the new-rich man as a womanizer was really prevalent in the late 1990s and early 2000s &#8212; but women as well.</p>
<div class="q left">Q.</div>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody"><strong>If the men get ahead through socializing and sex, how did the women get ahead? </strong></p>
<div class="a left">A.</div>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Many businesswomen delegated their entertaining to their male employees. Several times I also witnessed women who would accompany their male clients during a banquet and then take them to a nightclub, but only have one drink and then leave the men to âenjoy themselves.â But it was understood that she would be paying the bill. </p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">I would say 90 percent of the businesswomen I encountered in my research were divorced or single. Those who were single felt considerable pressure to get married, but were often reluctant to do so because the men they saw as their social equals demanded they stop their businesses as a condition of  marriage. These men didn&#8217;t want their potential wives constantly accompanying male business partners to nightclubs.</p>
<div class="q left">Q.</div>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody"><strong>Do some women parlay their sexuality into a career?</strong></p>
<div class="a left">A.</div>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Successful women were constantly accused of this, but it was rarely the truth. But many mistresses and housewives do make a successful transition to business. I encountered a few examples of successful businessmen, who, once their kids were college age, would give their wives some business to âplay around with.â In a couple of instances, the wifeâs businesses outperformed the husband&#8217;s. I also know of a man who gave his mistress some businesses to oversee. She did extremely well, and later when his businesses struggled, she dumped him. Or you also find women who amass capital by serving as a mistress and then open their own business like a dress boutique, restaurant or tea house. </p>
<div class="q left">Q.</div>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody"><strong>You said the men sometimes cloaked this in terms like they were &#8220;affectionate&#8221; to each other. Was there affection? Or a delusion on the man&#8217;s part that the woman really cared for him? </strong></p>
<div class="a left">A.</div>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">There was a wide spectrum in relationships, from those that didn&#8217;t have affection to those that, even though there was a financial underpinning, there was mutual affection. I know a businessman who had three separate households. One was his legal wife, one was his mistress and one was a woman he saw infrequently. He had a troubled relationship with his wife, but a very warm relationship with his mistress. He spoke of her in very loving terms, and it seemed to be reciprocated. With the third household, he saw her the least frequently and their relationship struck me as basically a business transaction. When he&#8217;d visit, she&#8217;d put on a show about missing him, but it didn&#8217;t strike me as genuine. </p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">But one of the things I talk about in my book is, in China thereâs less of this notion you find in the West that romantic relationships are tainted by money. In China there&#8217;s a sense that, if you love me and care for me, demonstrate it through your actions. In a husband-and-wife relationship it would be through fulfilling oneâs domestic duties: earning money for the family, doing chores, caring for someone when they&#8217;re sick, etc. But in the case of the mistress, buying her things, setting her up with an apartment, ensuring that her future is secure, even helping out her parents and her family members were established ways of showing you&#8217;re serious about the relationship. </p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">But there&#8217;s no question that some of these relationships are much more cold and calculating. Sometimes there&#8217;s even a quote up front: It&#8217;s going to cost you 10,000 or 20,000 a month for the first few months, and after that I need a BMW. If you can&#8217;t agree to those terms, you&#8217;ll have to look somewhere else. I know a guy who was in Chengdu and trying to keep a mistress in Beijing, but he couldn&#8217;t afford it because Beijing housing kept getting too expensive. He longed for the day when he could buy women mobile phones. He said that now that even students all have iPhones, most women are looking for apartments and cars. </p>
<div class="q left">Q.</div>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody"><strong>Can all of this survive the corruption crackdown of Xi Jinping? </strong></p>
<div class="a left">A.</div>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">The effects of the crackdown are pretty dramatic. In the past, I had never made a trip to Chengdu without ending up in a karaoke club, but I&#8217;ve been back three months now and haven&#8217;t been once. Some of my friends have lost their money, some have been detained, while others are afraid to spend much time in Chengdu or even in China.</p>
<div class="q left">Q.</div>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody"><strong>Where are they? </strong></p>
<div class="a left">A.</div>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Many have migrated abroad and only come back when they absolutely have to.  I hear over and over again that government officials are afraid to accept anything, including gifts and dinner invitations. I even heard of officials returning gifts had they received before the crackdown. In the short term it seems to have had a dramatic effect. In the long term it&#8217;s harder to tell. </p>
<div class="q left">Q.</div>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody"><strong>What&#8217;s your gut feeling? </strong></p>
<div class="a left">A.</div>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">I think it will loosen up a bit, but this campaign does seem more significant than any corruption crackdown in the post-Mao years. </p>
<div class="q left">Q.</div>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody"><strong>In your book, you show that this web of business and government officials is the way things are done in China. If the crackdown eliminates the corrupt entertainment practices that seem to be at the heart of it, what will happen?</strong></p>
<div class="a left">A.</div>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Thatâs a difficult question to answer. One unintended consequence of this campaign has been bureaucratic paralysis. Officials are afraid to start any ambitious project. This could generate economic repercussions. </p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">When I first started researching the book, it was just after China had joined the W.T.O. [Dec. 11, 2001], and it seemed that Chinaâs economy was gradually adopting  international norms. But since the 2008 financial crisis, which many Chinese leaders viewed as an indication of the fragility of American-style liberal capitalism, China seems to be moving further away from Western political and economic models. They don&#8217;t want a Western-derived system, but they don&#8217;t want the old corrupt system either. The leadership is hoping that they can reform their current state capitalist system to be more rule-governed, yet still party-controlled, and hopefully less susceptible to corruption.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">It seems they&#8217;re looking at a top-down crackdown &#8212; beefing up the Central Disciplinary Inspection Commission, and so on.<br />
What I fear is that what this will lead to is purge after purge, one campaign after the other. You&#8217;d think the lessons of the Cultural Revolution would be fresh enough in the minds of the Communist Party leadership that this would be something theyâd want to avoid, especially if the anticorruption campaign starts to generate significant resentment among lower-level officials. This could contribute to the bureaucratic paralysis I mentioned earlier.</p>
<div class="q left">Q.</div>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody"><strong>You mentioned that people were fed up with the way things operate in China. They&#8217;re not fed up with the Communist Party per se, but the system that they obviously have profited from makes them uncomfortable. </strong></p>
<div class="a left">A.</div>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">I think the sense of feeling conflicted came from resenting being at the mercy of government officials on the one hand, but  not being able to imagine another political system for China on the other. They feared instability. Political stability was no doubt good for their business. I think many of the wealthy Chinese I interviewed also knew that they were not particularly well-liked by the masses of Chinese people and granting them enfranchisement might lead to trouble for them. They admired political democracy and a multiparty system, but a lot of them were skeptical about how suitable this would be for China, given its state of development.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">At the same time they resented having to entertain government officials and they were frustrated by the fact that someone who is more well-connected is always able to leverage their relationship to make them vulnerable. Despite all the time invested in entertaining and maintaining good connections, they could evaporate overnight in the event of a crackdown. </p>
<div class="q left">Q.</div>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody"><strong>Are we perhaps seeing in China at the high tide of guanxi, or connections, grubbing? Could it be that the social guanxi creation that we see right now isn&#8217;t the cultural norm, but is at least partly caused by economic and political systems? By the sense that you can&#8217;t count on systems, so you must rely on personal relationships? But once things are more systemized, it will be less so?<br />
</strong></p>
<div class="a left">A.</div>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody"> In the past, scholars posited the incompatibility between a competitive market economy and guanxi. But if you look at the job market in China today, you can see that the two exist together. It&#8217;s so ultra-competitive, and there are so many talented applicants, that you have to be both qualified and well-connected to find a good job. So rather than being opposed, they are complementary. </p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Iâve also noticed that even the wealthy, who have benefited from their guanxi, are starting to tire of the insecurity generated by a legal system ruled by connections. Thereâs always the chance that someone else out there has better guanxi than you. But it&#8217;s a system where they don&#8217;t have any mechanism to push for change. The primary response among the new rich to this sense of insecurity has been for them to emigrate to the United States, Canada or Australia, where they feel that at least their assets will be protected. </p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">I liked the idea that the system is more open than one might think. That you can get access through cultivating ties and that outsiders can participate in this. </p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">As an anthropologist I am hesitant to make predictions about the evolution of political systems, but one thought Iâve been having is that the Xi Jinping crackdown may make the whole system more closed. It used to be that ordinary people could in a sense work their way up through bribes and cultivating connections. Take the example of the Sichuan businessman Liu Han, who was not from a privileged family but rose to be one of the richest men in the country. Liu Han worked his way up by bribing and cultivating people until he was under the protection of one of the most powerful men in China, Zhou Yongkang [the former domestic security chief, now facing corruption charges]. But if this is closed off, then ordinary people won&#8217;t have a way into the system. It will become an exclusive domain of the established elite. So what you might see is that guanxi becomes less significant than bei jing &#8212;  background &#8212; the personal connections that come with being born into a particular elite family.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Guanxi is malleable, purchasable, but bei jing is something you&#8217;re born with. Bei jing is based primarily on kin relationships &#8212; your family, or spouse&#8217;s family. I&#8217;ve heard businesspeople starting to complain that theyâre doing O.K., but there&#8217;s this other level of people way above them who have bei jing. They complain,  âI&#8217;ll never have that and they&#8217;re the ones who can really succeed.â </p>
<div class="q left">Q.</div>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody"><strong>Many Chinese tell me that their lives are exhausting. They don&#8217;t have a lot of down time.</strong> </p>
<div class="a left">A.</div>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Absolutely. That was often the No. 1 complaint I heard during my research, not having enough time to oneself, of having nonstop social obligations. There was even this sense of disappointment: âNow I&#8217;m a big boss I thought I could do what I wanted, but now I feel less free than before.â</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">That&#8217;s another appeal of emigrating abroad. It&#8217;s one of the few ways of pulling yourself out of these incredibly demanding social schedules, which demand your appearance at dinner after dinner, or to host dinner after dinner. </p>
<div class="q left">Q.</div>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody"><strong>When you did all this work, were you worried about your own liver? </strong></p>
<div class="a left">A.</div>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Yeah, I worried a lot. Actually it got me on a fitness regimen to maintain my own physical and mental health. Most of my field work was at night, so I had time during the day to exercise. I credit it with putting me on a fitness regimen that I&#8217;ve been able to maintain today.</p>
