<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody"><webonly><span id="t18h4s" class="update">Updates below | </span></webonly>After years of gauging the environmental, medical, economic and political risks of hydraulic fracturing, Gov.Â <a title="More articles about Andrew M. Cuomo." href="//topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/c/andrew_m_cuomo/index.html?inline=nyt-per" target="_blank">Andrew M. Cuomo</a>Â is moving to ban this method of extracting natural gas from shale deposits in New York State.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">[<em>Update</em>, 9:30 p.m. | See the end of the post for an excerpt from the state health study that underpinned the decision.]</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">It had been clear for years, as I wrote in 2012, that there was <a href="//dotearth.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/08/31/the-inevitable-slow-path-to-fracking-in-new-york/">little political or economic impetus to act quickly</a>, even though I felt (and still am convinced) that gas extraction from shale can be done safely and cleanly if properly regulated.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">I would have preferred an approach allowing some carefully supervised drilling where communities were supportive &#8212; which Cuomo <a href="//www.nytimes.com/2012/06/14/nyregion/hydrofracking-under-cuomo-plan-would-be-restricted-to-a-few-counties.html">had pondered several years ago</a>. See my <a href="//dotearth.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/06/28/gasland-filmmaker-takes-on-cuomo-and-dot-earth/">conversation with Josh Fox</a>, the director of &#8220;<a href="//www.gaslandthemovie.com/">Gasland</a>,&#8221; for more on my view.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">But for a governor, data on drilling risks are just one of a host of considerations. The issue is similar to <a href="//dotearth.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/09/08/more-on-tar-oil-pipelines-and-presidents/#more-37067">President Obama&#8217;s quandary on the Keystone oil pipeline</a>. (It&#8217;ll be interesting to see if low oil prices prompt the president to tip the balance there toward rejection. On Tuesday, Obama announced<a href="//www.nytimes.com/2014/12/17/us/obama-indefinitely-bans-drilling-in-alaskan-bay.html?ref=earth"> he was barring oil and gas exploration</a> in Alaska&#8217;s Bristol Bay.)</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Cuomo faced sustained, forceful and creative opposition from his left (the image below is one example of the creativity) and, as the upstate journalist Tom Wilber made clear in <a href="//tomwilber.blogspot.com/2012/07/is-decs-top-regulator-too-close-to-big.html">his blog</a> and book, &#8220;<a href="//www.cornellpress.cornell.edu/book/?GCOI=80140100032350">Under the Surface</a>,&#8221; there were few signs that New York would be able to provide sufficient oversight to justifyÂ drilling. (<a href="//dotearth.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/07/18/cuomos-next-wise-move-on-gas-fracking/#more-45315">Read here for more</a> on that question.) On top of this, courts were increasingly upholding community efforts to enact local bans.</p>

<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">The natural gas news is nicely summarizedÂ by <a href="//www.nytimes.com/2014/12/18/nyregion/cuomo-to-ban-fracking-in-new-york-state-citing-health-risks.html">The New York Times</a>Â and <a href="//www.bigstory.ap.org/article/e6a4f4562fad4493b22e1704e24f9bdf/new-york-will-move-prohibit-fracking">Associated Press</a>. The A.P. story had this excellent section laying out how the decision was unveiled, with the prime factors being &#8220;red flag&#8221; issues described by the state health commissioner, Howard Zucker, and scant signs of an economic benefit described by Joe Martens, the environmental conservation commissioner:Â <span id="more-53875"></span></p>
<blockquote><p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Zucker and Martens on Wednesday summarized the findings of environmental and health reviews that concluded that shale gas development using high-volume hydraulic fracturing carried unacceptable risks that haven&#8217;t been sufficiently studied&#8230;.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">The gas drilling boom in the Marcellus Shale, a rock formation underlying southern New York, Pennsylvania, Ohio and West Virginia, was made possible by fracking, or high-volume hydraulic fracturing, which releases gas from rock by injecting wells with chemically treated water at high pressure.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">The drilling technique has generated tens of billions of dollars and reduced energy bills and fuel imports. But it&#8217;s also brought concerns and sparked protests over air and water pollution, earthquakes, property devaluation, heavy truck traffic and health impacts.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">New York has had a ban on shale gas development since the environmental review began in 2008.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Zucker said he had identified &#8220;significant public health risks&#8221; and &#8220;red flag&#8221; health issues that require long-term studies before fracking can be called safe. He likened fracking to secondhand smoke, which wasn&#8217;t fully understood as a health risk until many years of scientific study had been done.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Martens noted the low price of natural gas, the high local cost of industry oversight and the large areas that would be off-limits to shale gas development because of setback requirements, water supply protections, and local prohibitions. He said those factors combine to make fracking less economically beneficial than had been anticipated.</p></blockquote>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">I reached out to a variety of people involved in, or tracking, the New York gas-drilling fight for reactions. TheÂ first responseÂ are below, with more added as they come in.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">But first here&#8217;s a helpful excerpt from the <a href="//www.nofrackingway.us/2014/12/17/governor-cuomo-saves-new-york-from-getting-fracked/">No Fracking Way</a> blog written by Chip Northrup, a former oil and gas investor who has long fought against drilling in New York (and who&#8217;s <a href="//dotearth.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/08/31/the-inevitable-slow-path-to-fracking-in-new-york/">been on Dot Earth before</a>). Alluding toÂ the arguments of Cuomo&#8217;s commissioners Zucker and Martens, Northrup noted:</p>
<blockquote><p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Both of them cited the greatly reduced area where fracking would actually take place in New York âÂ <a href="//www.fractracker.org/map/us/new-york/moratoria/">since most upstate towns ban it.</a></p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">And the only towns that might allow it are in an small area by the Pennsylvania borderÂ <a href="//www.nofrackingway.us/2014/11/09/why-new-york-wont-get-fracked/">that is not currently economic.Â </a>Â So, frankly, simply not worth fracking fooling with.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Which makes perfect sense from all standpoints: environmentally, economically and politically.</p></blockquote>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody"><a href="//www.colgate.edu/facultysearch/facultydirectory/bselleck/naturalgas">Bruce Selleck</a>, a geologist at Colgate University who is deeply conversant with both the shale and gas down below and politics on the surface, offered this trenchant reaction:</p>
<blockquote><p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">My suspicion is that Andrew Cuomo sees little chance of being nominated for president in 2016, and 2020 is such a long time away that making this decision now keeps his close supporters happier.Â Low natural gas (and crude) prices also make it an easier call. Now we have four new casinos, but no new rural economic development. What a great state!</p></blockquote>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody"><a href="//www.toxicstargeting.com/about_us">Walter Hang</a>, an environmental mapping consultant and nonstop anti-drilling campaigner, wrote this:</p>
<blockquote><p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">This stupendous victory was won by an unrelenting grassroots citizen campaign powered by amazing press coverage that systematically highlighted the public health and environmental concerns of shale fracking. That effort has won a victory unparalleled in the annals of the American environmental movement.</p></blockquote>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Here&#8217;s <a href="//www.pace.edu/paaes/faculty-and-staff#johncronin">John Cronin</a>, formerly the Hudson Riverkeeper and currently senior fellow for environmental policy at Pace University&#8217;s Pace Academy for Applied Environmental Studies (we teach one course together):</p>
<blockquote><p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">I take Governor Cuomo at his word â fracking will run afoul of New Yorkâs interests in public health and the environment. The case is strong. I believe he is convinced by the evidence, which has only been made stronger during the prolonged regulatory decision period. There is no political advantage to Cuomoâs decision. No realistic presidential candidates from either party are articulating strong anti-fracking positions. There is no possibility there will be a future gubernatorial upset over the issue. Mainstream environmentalists will never abandon him in favor of a Republican or independent challenger. He is alienating parts of the public, and monied interests, for whom regional fracking is a voter getter. Sometimes decisions are made for the very reasons that officials articulate.</p></blockquote>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody"><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/steveeverley">Steve Everley</a>, who for years has represented the industry position on gas in the Marcellus through the <a href="//energyindepth.org/?s=%22new+york%22">Energy in Depth</a> blog, sent a long note from which I&#8217;m extracting this excerpt (I&#8217;ll post the full note in the comment string):</p>
<blockquote><p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">What strikes me about the Cuomo administrationâs use of health risks to restrict fracking is that, just a few short years ago, the same New York Department of Environmental Conservation declared, âweâve concluded that high-volume hydrofracking can be undertaken safely, along with strong and aggressive regulations.â Other than political considerations, what changed?</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Certainly the DEC would claim that ânewâ studies show the health risks are too great. But there were studies before DECâs 2011 proclamation that suggested there are concerns that need to be addressed. Isnât that why we have regulations â to make sure risks and other concerns are addressed? There have also been studies showing that development is protective of public health, to say nothing of the fact that natural gas is a far cleaner alternative to some of our other power and heating options. New York is the fifth largest consumer of natural gas in the United States, but I heard nothing from DEC suggesting that it would be imposing a moratorium on the use of gas produced by fracking elsewhere.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">If this were a real health threat, and not motivated by politics, then wouldnât the Cuomo administration be pleading with its neighbors in Pennsylvania to stop producing natural gas? I must have missed that portion of the press conference.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">The decision to ban any economic activity â be it oil and gas development or any other industry â suggests that the process itself is inherently unsafe and cannot be done safely. No one who is interested in objectivity could make that claim about hydraulic fracturing. Gallup reported earlier this year that the top state in overall wellbeing wasÂ <a href="//www.gallup.com/poll/167435/north-dakota-well-being-west-virginia-still-last.aspx">North Dakota</a>, fueled by the massive economic opportunities unleashed by the oil boom. That ranking included factors such as health and access to basic necessities. If allowing fracking posed insurmountable health problems, then how are people in North Dakota doing so well?</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Somehow, weâve discovered ways to develop oil and gas in ways that are not only protective of public health, but actually lead to net benefits in terms of well-being. Itâs not that we couldnât replicate that in New York, itâs that the DEC didnât even want to try.</p></blockquote>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">In his email, Everley noted that he had relocated from the Northeast back to Dallas earlier this month.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">In many ways, that move may well reflect the inevitability of what just happened.</p>

<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody"><em>Added</em> 6:22 p.m. | <a href="//tomwilber.blogspot.com/p/about-me.html">Tom Wilber</a>, the author and journalist focused on the Marcellus gas fight, wrote:</p>
<blockquote><p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">This decision is consistent with Cuomo&#8217;s progressive politics that got him to where he is now. It&#8217;s a bold move and I optimistically take it as sincere attempt to overcome inertia of fossil fuel dependency. But it needs to be accompanied by practical reforms/initiatives in energy development &amp; consumptionâ¦.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Cuomo finally got tired of being hounded on the issue by his political base. The movement in New York against shale gas was relentless and it was directed at him personally. At one point, he told Susan Arbetter, host of Capitol Press Room, that it was the most effective political action campaign he had seen. (I have a note out to Susan for the date of that show) Activists, both institutional and grass roots, promised to step it if he allowed a single well.</p>

<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody"><em>Added</em>, Dec. 21, 10:40 p.m. | Kirsi Jansa, the Finnish filmmaker who&#8217;s been chronicling gas drilling in Pennsylvania in a series of videos called <a href="//www.kirsijansa.com/Gas_Rush_Stories.html">&#8220;Gas Rush Stories&#8221;</a> (<a href="//dotearth.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/11/26/a-fresh-look-at-americas-gas-lands">see my post on her work</a>), sent this note:</p>
<blockquote><p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">
Gov. Andrew Cuomoâs decision to ban fracking based on health concerns is a bold move in the American energy domain. Prioritizing public health to financial interests narrows the energy policy gap between Europe and the United States.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">European policy makers are much more apt to use âprecautionary principlesâ than than their American counterparts. During the last few years, various European countries have either banned fracking or put a moratorium on fracking, stating that there is not enough information about the impacts of shale gas exploration on public health or fugitive methane emissions and global warming. Meanwhile the U.S. has moved fast forward with the shale gas development as if the critical questions regarding the safety of the procedure were answered. I asked for an explanation for this from Carlos Pasqual, the State Department Special Envoy and Coordinator for International Energy Affairs. His response was that every country needs to find its comfort zone balancing the risks and benefits.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Many Pennsylvanians living in the neighborhoods where drilling is happening are not happy with the pro-drilling approach of their elected leaders. Public health experts who work on the âshale fieldsâ among impacted citizens have been ringing alarm bells: âI don&#8217;t know if I have ever seen a problem as widespread as this with as little information collected about it, and as relaxed an attitude in terms of the sense of urgency, in the sense of responsibility on the part of the state and federal governments, and for that matter, the drilling industry,â cautioned a seasoned public health toxicologist David Brown from Southwest Environmental Health Project in my interview for Gas Rush Stories.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Gov. Cuomo had the patience to take time to make an informed decision instead of giving in to the public pressure from both pro- and anti-drilling communities. New Yorkâs governor also had courage to say no to money interests.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">What kind of impact Gov. Cuomoâs decision will have on the state economy remains to be seen. It is also interesting to see what will happen to renewable energy development in New York. New York is on a European sustainability track in this sense, too, requiring that <a href="//www.dsireusa.org/incentives/incentive.cfm?Incentive_Code=NY03R">29 percent of the stateâs energy</a> comes from renewable sources by 2015. Pennsylvania has set its renewable energy goal to 8 percent by 2020. By banning one fossil fuel source in his state, Gov. Cuomo is setting an example for other local leaders to build a bridge to a more sustainable future.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Gov. Cuomo could also roll up his sleeves and choose not to abandon the state&#8217;s Southern Tier that is now devastated by the loss of shale gas millions. There is work to be done before New York can become a luminary for renewable energy like Germany is. According to Harry Lehmann, General Director at Germany&#8217;s Federal Environment Agency and Executive Chairman of the World Council for Renewable Energy, it took Germany a decade to build a renewable energy industry that has created 400,000 new work places.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Harry Lehmann lists things that need to happen in the US if the US wants to get where Germany is today, generating about 30 percent of its electricity from renewable sources: You need to educate the people &#8212; regular citizens, managers, bankers &#8212; about renewable energy. You need to train the labor force for the renewable energy industry. You need to build an infrastructure, a network of renewable energy producers. And you need to adjust the economical situation and energy policies so that renewable energy can enter the market in bigger scale. (Harry Lehmann&#8217;s interview is here: <a href="https://vimeo.com/55490513">âGas Rush Stories Extra: Renewable Energy Experts, 30 min interview with Harry Lehmann, Prof. Terry Collins and Rachel Carson scholar Patricia DeMarco.â)</a></p>

<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody"><em>Added</em>, Dec. 19, 2 p.m. | Jesse McKinley filed a piece on the ramifications of the shale-gas ban (and a failed casino plan) for the struggling communities on the New York side of the border with Pennsylvania: &#8220;<a href="//www.nytimes.com/2014/12/19/nyregion/shock-in-southern-tier-of-new-york-as-hopes-of-gambling-and-fracking-both-die.html?hp&amp;action=click&amp;pgtype=Homepage&amp;module=mini-moth&amp;region=top-stories-below&amp;WT.nav=top-stories-below">Shock in Southern Tier of New York as Hopes of Gambling and Fracking Both Die</a>.&#8221;</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">The frustrations of many of those in this region who saw fracking as a boon come in part by hearing satisfied stories from the Pennsylvania gas zone. Here is a chat I had with one homeowner profiting from a lease in 2012:</p>

<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody"><em>Added</em>, Dec. 17, 9:30 p.m. | Here&#8217;s an excerpt from the <a href="https://www.health.ny.gov/press/reports/docs/high_volume_hydraulic_fracturing.pdf">Department of Health review of research on shale gas and illness</a>, which found too many unresolved questions and plausible risks to endorse high volume hydraulic fracturing (abbreviated as HVHF in the report):</p>
<blockquote><p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Based on this review, it is apparent that the science surrounding HVHF activity is limited, only just beginning to emerge, and largely suggests only hypotheses about potential public health impacts that need further evaluationâ¦.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">As with most complex human activities in modern societies, absolute scientific certainty regarding the relative contributions of positive and negative impacts of HVHF on public health is unlikely to ever be attained. In this instance, however, the overall weight of the evidence from the cumulative body of information contained in this Public Health Review demonstrates that there are significant uncertainties about the kinds of adverse health outcomes that may be associated with HVHF, the likelihood of the occurrence of adverse health outcomes, and the effectiveness of some of the mitigation measures in reducing or preventing environmental impacts which could adversely affect public health. Until the science provides sufficient information to determine the level of risk to public health from HVHF to all New Yorkers and whether the risks can be adequately managed, DOH recommends that HVHF should not proceed in New York State.</p></blockquote>

<p class="summary">By 2050 or so, the human population is expected to <a href="//esa.un.org/unpd/wpp/index.htm">pass nine billion</a>. Those billions will be seeking food, water and other resources on a planet where humans are already shaping climate and the web of life. Dot Earth was created by <a href="//about.me/revkin">Andrew Revkin</a> in October 2007 -- in part with support from a John Simon Guggenheim Fellowship -- to explore ways to balance human needs and the planet's limits.</p>
<p class="summary">The blog moved to the Opinion side of The Times in 2010 when Revkin left the Times staff to teach communication courses at Pace University. He won a <a href="//dotearth.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/09/15/four-years-163-posts-and-a-nice-award/">National Academies Communication Award</a> for Dot Earth in 2011 and Time Magazine named him <a href="//techland.time.com/2013/08/05/the-25-best-bloggers-2013-edition/slide/andrew-revkin-dot-earth/">one of the web's 25 top bloggers</a>Â in 2013.</p>
<p class="summary">In December 2016, Revkin ended the blog and left PaceÂ to return to full-time journalism as senior reporter on climate and related issues for the public-interest newsroom <a href="https://www.propublica.org/about/andrew-revkin-to-join-propublica-as-senior-reporter-on-climate-change" target="_blank">ProPublica</a>.</p>
