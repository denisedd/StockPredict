<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody"><webonly><span id="t17h51s" class="update">Updated, 5:51 p.m. | </span></webonly>LOS ANGELES â In a stark departure from its usual seriousness, the<a href="//carpetbagger.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/12/03/sundance-film-festival-2015-lineup#list"> Sundance Film Festivalâs competition lineup</a> will feature seven comedies in January. Even the festivalâs high-profile opening-night slot, the one that went to the searing âWhiplashâ last time, will be devoted to a funny movie.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">But cinema buffs and the distributors who come to the festival to shop for films will also get served the typical Sundance mix of hot-button documentaries and, in contrast to what Hollywood delivers, multicultural stories from racially diverse directors and lots of female-focused narratives.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">âThere is an intensity in a lot of the films this year that is different and noticeable,â said John Cooper, the festivalâs director. âIâd call it a wild ride of emotional extremes.â</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody"><a href="//carpetbagger.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/12/03/sundance-film-festival-2015-lineup#list">View the festival competition lineup.</a></p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Sundance, running from Jan. 22 to Feb. 1 in Park City, Utah, will showcase 118 feature-length movies in categories that range from foreign documentaries to midnight thrillers. On Wednesday, the festival unveiled the 32 American-made narrative films and documentaries â world premieres all â that will compete for grand jury and audience prizes.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Sundance, now in its 31st year, always warns against scrutinizing its lineup too carefully for trends, noting that programmers are at the mercy of what gets submitted. This time, 4,105 feature-length films were offered, about 50 more than last year. (More than 8,000 short films were submitted.)</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">But scrutinize people will, in part because, as the pre-eminent showcase for American art cinema, Sundance often serves as a mirror. âThe work of independent artists inevitably reflects the state of our culture and the times in which we live,â Robert Redford, Sundanceâs founder, said in a statement.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">There are at least two incendiary competition documentaries: Marc Silverâs racially charged and culturally topical â3 Â½ Minutes,â an examination of the <a href="//www.rollingstone.com/culture/news/loud-music-shooter-michael-dunn-receives-life-sentence-without-parole-20141017">2012 shooting of an unarmed teenager</a> and its aftermath in the justice system; and â(T)error,â directed by Lyric R. Cabral and David Felix Sutcliffe and billed as âthe first film to document on camera a covert counterterrorism sting.â</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">In his follow-up to âThe Cove,â which won the 2010 Academy Award for best documentary, Louie Psihoyos again pushes the boundaries of undercover filming with <a href="//www.racingextinction.com/">âRacing Extinction,â</a> an incendiary look at the way humans treat a wide array of animals.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Sundanceâs last narrative competition included the premiere of âWhiplash,â a dramatic thriller now playing in theaters, and the 2015 festival will continue to throw its weight behind similarly intense films. One is called âThe Witch,â a horror film set in 1630s New England from <a href="//carpetbagger.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/01/19/2-producers-3-last-minute-productions/">Parts and Labor</a>, a New York production company with credits like âBeginners.â In the 1970s-era âThe Diary of a Teenage Girl,â Bel Powley plays a teenager lost in a drug haze; Alexander Skarsgard and Kristen Wiig co-star.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">âI Smile Back,â starring Sarah Silverman in her first dramatic lead, tells the story of a suburban mom who goes off the rails with drugs. âItâs a very raw, very heavy watch,â Trevor Groth, Sundanceâs programming chief, said of Ms. Silvermanâs performance.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Still, the seven comedies that will play in the 16-film American-made narrative category represent a significant increase over the three in that section the last time. The most prominent is âThe Bronze,â directed by Bryan Buckley, known for his long list of Super Bowl commercials; the film, which stars Melissa Rauch (âThe Big Bang Theoryâ), is about an aging, sour gymnast whose small-town status is threatened by a talented newcomer.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">âThe Bronzeâ will play opening night in the spot given last year to âWhiplash,â about a drummer driven to extremes by an abusive teacher.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Other comedies include âThe Overnight,â from Duplass Brothers Productions, starring Adam Scott and Taylor Schilling, which people in the industry say is notable for a penis sight gag; and âThe D Train,â a high school reunion tale starring (and produced by) Jack Black.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Independent filmmakers may be pursuing comedy in an attempt to make their films more economically viable; comedy tends to perform better on video-on-demand services than drama, for instance. Even many of the dramas contain thriller or horror elements, something Mr. Cooper said âadds a little bit of audience access.â</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">On Wednesday, Sundance also made public its world cinema showcase, a collection of narrative features and documentaries that compete for separate awards and that this year include a number of films with recognizable stars (Nicole Kidman, Michael Fassbender, Toni Collette). The festival also announced its Next section, a 10-film group reserved for riskier, lower-budget dramas and comedies.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Next, which served up the art house hit âObvious Childâ during the festivalâs last go-round, will this time include Sean Bakerâs âTangerine,â a comedic drama about transgender prostitutes in Los Angeles, and âJames White,â a drama about a self-destructive New Yorker from t<a href="//nymag.com/movies/features/borderline-films-2011-10/">he people behind</a> âMartha Marcy May Marlene.â</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">As ever, there are some quirky films that only Sundance programmers could pluck from the submission pile. âFinders Keepersâ is a documentary about a recovering addict and amputee who finds himself in a stranger-than-fiction battle to reclaim his mummified leg. (A man found it inside a meat smoker he bought at auction.)</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">And Bobcat Goldthwait, perhaps still best known for his screechy Zed in the 1980s-era âPolice Academyâ series, will be prowling Park City in January. He directed âCall Me Lucky,â a documentary about Barry Crimmins, a volatile bar comic turned political satirist.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">The rest of the noncompetition lineup â where Richard Linklaterâs âBoyhoodâ made its debut in January â will be announced over the coming week. Here are the selections unveiled on Wednesday:</p>
