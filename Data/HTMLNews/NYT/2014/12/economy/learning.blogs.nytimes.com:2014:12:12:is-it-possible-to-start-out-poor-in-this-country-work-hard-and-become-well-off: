<blockquote><p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">
Despite an improving economy and jobs picture, the public is more pessimistic than it was after the 2008 financial crisis that it is possible to work hard and become rich, according to a New York Times poll.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">The poll, which explored Americansâ opinions on a wide range of economic and financial issues, found that only 64 percent of respondents said they still believed in the American dream, the lowest result in roughly two decades. Even near the depth of the financial crisis in early 2009, 72 percent of Americans still believed that hard work could result in riches.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">âThings have changed a lot,â Michael Herdmann, a 54-year-old retired public works employee from Fairview Park, Ohio, said in a follow-up interview. âThe decks have been stacked against not only the lower class but also the lower middle class.â</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">âThe modern-day politician has lost track of why the welfare programs were put in place,â he added. âThey donât understand that part of the reason we help the poor to buy food was also to help fund the farmers. They have systemically reduced most of what was there to help the poor.â</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">The significant drop in faith comes as the nation added 321,000 jobs last month and average hourly earnings for ordinary workers increased much more than expected. The economy is also being buoyed by a drop in oil prices, putting more money in the pockets of average Americans as the holiday season approaches.

			<p>It is possible in this country to work hard and become well-off if you do not give up. It is not incredibly possible because jobs are hard to come by and it is hard to find well paying jobs even with a college degree;however, it is still possible to find a job and make money. I think it is becoming harder now to work hard and become well-off because of the lack of jobs but also the lack of motivation a lot of people have.<br />
I still believe that America is the &#8220;land of opportunity&#8221; and that the American dream is alive. America is still a place to come for freedom and rights and opportunity to become someone. You can still work hard even if you do not become rich you can say you lived life well. The American dream is alive in my opinion because we are still able to work. I might not become rich over night or own my own company but the ability to do so is there and with it so is the American dream.<br />
Young people with wealthy families do have a large advantage because going to college and having credentials for jobs comes easier to them. Their parents have the money to send them to college and maybe come out with no debut, which a lot of people can not do, and then they have connections through their parents so yes it is easier for young people with wealthy families but it is not impossible to get a lot out of life for anyone.<br />
I am very optimistic about finding a job in the future because even if there are very few jobs in the world there are still jobs and I plan on trying my hardest to get one of those jobs. I might not live comfortably for a while but the key is to not loose hope and to not give up. I think living comfortably and having a job is something that is very possible with a lot of effort and a lot of faith.</p>

			<p>I believe that it is still possible to start out in the lower-middle class of the United States and still achieve &#8220;The American Dream&#8221;. I believe it is just as possible for anyone to achieve their dreams no matter their economic class when they start. I believe it takes very hard work and dedication for anyone, rich or poor, to achieve their dreams. I think that doing this is getting harder in today&#8217;s time, students are being tested more and the need for a good education is extremely prevalent. America still has many great opportunities for the rich and the poor, The American Dream is still very much alive. When it comes to to an advantage that wealthy families have over poor families I believe that for many wealthy families going to college for a good education isn&#8217;t a problem. With the very large emphasis and need for a good education in college in today&#8217;s time many poor families may think that going to college is just out of reach to them because of their situation. I am very optimistic that I will be able to get a good job and live my life without worry. I know that it will take a lot of work to get it done but I am ready to take the challenge.</p>

			<p>1. In this country it is possible to start out poor and then work your way up. I think this is possible because we have the freedom to get the job and education that we want, and also if you are poor growing up more than likely you want to change that circumstance so that your kids don&#8217;t have to live like that. I think that it is getting easier than it used to be because of the education and capabillities we have now.<br />
2. I do believe that the U.S. is the &#8216;land of opportunity&#8217;. I believe that the America dream is alive and well; we have freedom and are able to do what we want to a certain extent.<br />
3. When it comes to getting ahead in the country I do think that some wealthy follks have better opportunity&#8217;s but also I think that the poor class can and will do what they set their mind to.<br />
4. I am excited and ready to get a job in the future, so that I can be more independent and I don&#8217;t have to rely on my parents for my wants.</p>

			<p>Personally, I think that it is possible to start out poor, work hard, and become well-off in this country. America is known as the land of opportunities, people that are in the big businesses are looking for hardworking people who they could be able to trust. If you show that. you are eager to learn new things and are hardworking, most people will hire you. Without a doubt, it is getting harder to do so because the competition for jobs are a lot higher, but it&#8217;s not impossible. Like I was saying before, I fully believe that America is the land of opportunities, and if you know how to play your cards well, then you can get very far. The American Dream still exists but it takes a lot of work to accomplish it, it was only made for the people willing to take on a big challenge. Young people coming from wealthy families have the advantage, which is money, but money can only get you so far. If you come from a poor family you will always have to work hard to get what you want, and that&#8217;s what owners of jobs are looking for in their workers. Would you rather hire someone who works hard and is thankful for the job or someone who is there just to be there and doesn&#8217;t need the job? I am very optimistic about my future and what it holds. I know that by working hard in school and everything else that I do, I can get far in life and become one of the people who pursue the American Dream.</p>

			<p>In my opinion I do think it is possible to start off poor. If you have a job and are earning money you still aren&#8217;t well off. Gas prices are high, the minimum wage isn&#8217;t enough to pay bills and personal thing everyone has to have. In my opinion the US is not the land of opportunity. You can&#8217;t do anything without being judged or being told you can&#8217;t do that. I honestly don&#8217;t think the US isn&#8217;t the land of opportunity that it used to be. I think young people that come from wealthy families get ahead of young people that come from poor families because people with money have connections and can basically do whatever they want. The rich have it easy, while the poor barely have it. I think the young people that come from wealthy families don&#8217;t &#8220;live&#8221;, while the poor &#8220;die&#8221; trying. Its hard to make it in this world. You have to have money for everything. But I am very optimistic when it comes to getting a job and living comfortably when I get older. It is going to be hard but i&#8217;m not going to give up. I think everyone has to be at least a little optimistic when it comes to things like that.</p>

			<p>1.)No, people who are poor usually stay poor. Hard work and cheep pay in the US.<br />
2.)I would like to think that I can be again. But for now it is not. All of these people come here for that &#8220;American Dream&#8221;. But who actually makes it?<br />
3.)An 100% advantage. You never hear about an poor person doing anything. Its only wealthy people<br />
4.)I am personally not excited for a job in the future. I already have a job and it is another example of hard work is cheep pay. But maybe that can change in the future and I can have an good job with good pay to support my family around me, But without EDU its a almost impossible. Even with it now these days its still hard.</p>

			<p>1. yes you can become rich if you grow up poor. Its very possible because if you look at athletics they go up poor now look. Its getting easier because people care more about people these days.<br />
2.I think it is and yes everybody can do what ever they wont so yes its the land of opportunity. I still believe in it someones is always dreaming<br />
3. It all depends on what they do,ex-in sports a poor kid will go cause he ant got nothing and the coach will buy him things. In politics the rich kid has got it<br />
4.I wont a great job and a nice house and know im not flipping burgers all my life</p>

			<p>1) I think it is possible to start out with little then eventually work really hard to get what you want. You can&#8217;t be wasteful and expect to always have things handed to you. You have to work for it and it may even take years to get there.<br />
2)The United States has many different opportunities to get to where you need to be.<br />
3) Wealthy parents teach their kids how to become wealthy later on in life and yes i think they have a bigger chance at being wealthy when their older then the kids who are poor. If you grow up in a poor environment you&#8217;re going to think it&#8217;s okay to live that way. What you are around you whole life is what you will act like, unless you really want to be different.<br />
4) Honestly when I get older I am going to go to college first and get a side job so i can study to be what i want to be which pays good money so I know if that&#8217;s what I become I will be living comfortably.</p>

			<p>I believe that it&#8217;s possible to start out poor and get wealthy same implies to being wealthy and becoming poor. Being poor may start out hard at times and while you work hard then the easier it gets and you will live your old life. If wealthy then go bankrupt then I&#8217;ll be a struggle. At first I&#8217;ll be easy because you have money and you struggle a lot when you loss money. But doesn&#8217;t necessarily mean I&#8217;ll be hard. But of you work hard then you be back to being wealthy.<br />
I believe America is the land of opportunity. Even if you live here doesn&#8217;t mean you get it in a blink of an eye. But have to work hard at it.<br />
Young people in wealthy families can be able to afford certain things and I&#8217;ll be easier. Young people with poor families then I&#8217;ll be hard for them to obtain certain things. But here in America I think both classes are bale to afford it because the prices are decent. Not to expensive not to cheap just right.<br />
As of right now getting a job here should be easy. I think I gonna be able to live comfortable and not have to worry about some many things in my life span.</p>

			<p>I feel like it is possible to start out poor in this country and that if you work hard for what you want then you will become well-off. To me it seems very possible because if you want it then you will work for it. To me it seems that its getting easier to become better in money because today there are better opportunities than there was a time ago. I do believe that the U.S. is the &#8220;land of opportunity&#8221; because in other places aroun the world there really is not a lot or as much of great opportunities or freedom as there is here. I feel like the wealthy and poor families have the same opportunity of getting ahead in this country because no matter the money there will always be a way to get better even though it means hard work. I am very optimistic about getting a job and living a good life when i get older mainly because i know im on the right track and that I want a better life for me and my family.</p>

			<p>I think it is possible to start out poor, and work hard to become well-off. If you really work hard to become well-off and you are smart about how you spend money, then you can become rich. I think it is possible if you spend money wisely instead of blowing it, and if you do all you can to reach that goal of becoming rich.  I think it might be harder then it used to be, with money needed to be spent here and their for things we need adds up. We spend a little money here and a little money here then we are out of money, with prices going up for many things its hard to get things you need and still have money saved up. United States is the &#8220;land of opportunity&#8221; because, with United States creating new technology and trying to find more ways of making new jobs, people can find something new. The American Dream is alive and well, I think the American Dream is alive because, people of our nation are always finding ways to try and improve our nation. Young people from wealthy homes have the  better advantage because, most can afford to go to college and get well paying jobs. While, people from poorer homes may not be able to afford college so they can not further education, so they are left with what they can get. I am very optimistic that if I do my best and try my hardest I can find a job right for me that I will be happy doing. I think living comfortably is living with at least enough to let you get by with what you need, even if that means you do not always get what you want. So as long as I am smart about how I do things I can live a comfortable life.</p>

			<p>I think it is still possible for people to start off poor and be okay and well-off in the future.  I think it is getting harder but I still think it is very possible if you work hard enough. </p>
<p>I think the U.S is still a land of opportunities because other countries are having really serious problems economically, with violence, crime, and hunger.</p>
<p>For me getting ahead in this country is not always measured with what you have. As long as you are living in peace, you have what you need and you are happy with it is more than enough. So if you work hard enough everyone is about the same. Lets say wealthy people have a &#8220;head start&#8221;. </p>
<p>I am very optimistic with getting a job when I get older and living comfortably when I get older.</p>

			<p>I think it is still possible to start out poor in this country, work hard and become well off. However, I also think it is getting less and less possible as time goes on. Although there are more jobs being added to the market, it is still fairly difficult to find a good paying job with work hours that will not interfere with other necessary aspects of your life. I think it is harder now than it was in the past to pick up a job, start saving money, and buy the stereotypical big house with nice furniture. It can be done, but most of the time this financial security does not come until citizens are much older, if it ever comes at all.<br />
     I believe the United States could be considered the &#8220;land of opportunity.&#8221; We do have many jobs to choose from, and a lot of potential for people to develop. I also think the American dream is still alive, but at a much lower standard. It is becoming increasingly harder to find one of those model families with a happy couple, two children, a large house, fancy furniture, and the newest cars and technology. There are way more obstacles and distractions today than there were even ten years ago. People are making up their own American dream, though, where they come here and make a famous name for themselves, however long it lasts.<br />
     I think young people from wealthy families have a better chance of getting ahead in this country than young people from poor families. Wealthier people have names that are readily known in their community, sometimes even nationwide. This gives those young people an advantage to get better opportunities when it comes to colleges and careers. Of course, with enough motivation and effort, a poor person could get ahead in this country as much as anyone else. Still, wealthier people with well-known names are more likely to carry on the family tradition of being ahead.<br />
     I am pretty optimistic about getting a good job and living comfortably when I am older. Although I do not plan on going to a four-year university, I will be content on the money I make. I want to pursue a career in the medical field, which is very stable. I believe that I will be able to live comfortably when I am older, especially since money is not the most important thing in my life.</p>

			<p>1. I believe that it is possible to start out poor in this country, work hard and become well off. I think it is possible through higher education like honors courses, and college. I think it is getting harder than it used to be as many more people are trying to do this, which is making them do literally anything to get there, including back stabbing, cheating, lying, and ruining others carries just to try to get there. Everyone scratching and clawing to get to the top.</p>
<p>2. I do believe the USA is the land of opportunity, because these options are not aloud in other places. I think the American Dream is different for each of us and is alive and well.</p>
<p>3. I think wealth young people have way more of an advantage than others. They can just pay their way to almost anywhere.</p>
<p>4. I guess you could say i am optimistic on my outlook of how it would be.</p>

			<p>-I do believe that it is still possible for people to start out poor, work hard and then live comfortably; but, people rising up like that doesn&#8217;t happen very often anymore. It is getting harder and harder to be able to rise up like this. Maybe people have just given up hope of rising up, so they stick with what they have. It is definitely possible for someone to work their way out of the lower class, but it is more difficult than just finding a good paying job now.<br />
-America is still the land of opportunity, just not job opportunities. People in the lower class have little time on their hands to go to college, because they are working to be able to keep a roof over their heads. That makes it even more difficult to get a job when everyone is looking for someone with a college degree. The American dream is still alive but I believe that it is slowly looking more and more like just a dream to most people. There are plenty of opportunities out there we just have to work hard enough to be able to reach them.<br />
-In my opinion, young people from rich families will have a lot more opportunities to get ahead in this country. They have money and that is what they need to get everything they need to be successful. They can pay for a good college, and, if they get into the right field, can help get a better job. Young people from poor families are usually hard workers. They realize that nothing is going to be given to them; therefore, they fight their way to the top. It is hard to move up that way and a lot them will not make it. Young rich people don&#8217;t have to fight as hard and things will be close by them. So yes, it is easier for a young rich person.<br />
-Coming from a poorer family, I don&#8217;t think that I am going to be in the upper class one day. Being in the middle class is more reasonable for me. But there are a lot of opportunities out their that our parents didn&#8217;t have. Things like the early college program, that will help you get ahead in your education without having to pay. I have high hopes that I will be able to live comfortably in the middle class when I get older, but I don&#8217;t think it will be easy to make it there.</p>

			<p>1) It is possible to start out poor and become well-off with hard work. I think this because there are opportunities for higher paying jobs for lower class people and a way for a higher education. Rather it is getting harder or easier probably depends on what you want to how and how you do it.<br />
2) I still think America is a &#8220;land of opportunity&#8221; considering we still have a good amount of freedoms compared to the other countries in the world. So I suppose the American dream is somewhat alive still somewhere.<br />
3) I think wealthy families have a pretty good sized advantage over people from poor families. They can get things and a higher education without as much effort and normally have good leverage over lower-class ones.<br />
4) Though I&#8217;m not too found of the &#8220;job&#8221; part of getting older I would feel alright about having a good one and living comfy. But I&#8217;m pretty optimistic about it and am sure if I keep working at it, it can happen.</p>

			<p>I think that it is possible to start out poor, work hard, and become well-off in this country. because we have the freedom and get the job we want , In my opinion the United States we can take any work effort and achievement.<br />
I do believe that U.S. is the &#8216;land of opportunityâ because the U.S. is a place where you have opportunity and can have motivation to study and work, a country that have freedom.<br />
Many parents teach their kids how to become wealthy later on in life and Yes I think they have a bigger chance at being wealthy when they teach and educates their children to a best future and life.<br />
I am very optimistic about getting a job because I want a good job and a best future for me and my family. Because my parents want the best for me when I finally my study how college or other place.</p>

			<p>I think that in all country you can be successful and have opportunities because all the things that you want depend on you. Poor people can be reach if they work too much and save their money to invest in businesses where they going to get enough money to be reach. Young people should consider this point of view because for them, it is more easier make it since beginning. Also, I believe that we need to behave optimistic to reach our dreams accurately.</p>

			<p>well I think that U.S.A is one of the country when you have more opportunities, but I don&#8217;t think that you can&#8217;t get better opportunities in your country because  every place has advantage. so many people come here with their Americans dreams, I don&#8217;t know what are they mean with this. But I think here you can&#8217;t have a lot of opportunities if you work hard and you are able to work.</p>

			<p>It is possible to work and become well-off, but unless you already have enough money to live and get various luxuries as well, you will never become &#8220;rich&#8221;. Every year, as the petrol dollar decreases in buying power and jobs are continuing to be devalues and replaced by machines, it is getting harder to get anything out of work, unless a robot cannot be used in that field.</p>
<p>The USA has become the land of wage slavery, the majority of people survive off of welfare, even when both parents are working, and they now live from paycheck to paycheck. This doesn&#8217;t foster the &#8220;American Dream&#8221; at all.</p>
<p>When you have money in the USA, you are already more likely to become a high paying professional than a poor person, just because you&#8217;re able to go to that expensive college.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s very unlikely I&#8217;ll find a good job, most likely I&#8217;ll be in debt paying for schooling without a job, or have some dead-end job with no chance to grow.</p>

			<p>It is possible to start out poor and become well off if you set your mind to it and work your butt off. I think it is becoming harder to accomplish this because of the demands in the job market.</p>
<p>The american dream is not as it once used to be since there are less and less opportunities to accomplish what you want.</p>
<p>Young people with wealthy parents have a significant advantage because they start off rich and can easily build themselves up.</p>
<p>I am very optimistic about getting a good job and living comfortably because I know if I work hard enough I can accomplish what I want.</p>

			<p>Is it possible to start off poor in this country but work hard and become rich? My parents sure think so, even though they aren&#8217;t too good of an example. I think the &#8220;American Dream&#8221; is still obtainable. If you see that dream as being the head of an oil company raking in the riches, then maybe it isn&#8217;t so obtainable. But working hard in school and getting grades that are at or above par you can make your way into a nice college and get a degree, but that is where the easy part ends. Finding a job is your next task, and with certain degrees that is almost impossible. If you are born into a more well-off family then your window of opportunity is a lot bigger and closes slower than someone from a poor family. Don&#8217;t get me wrong that window is still there for everyone and it is very possible to make it through but some people do have it easier than others. But I do believe it is possible to live well-off in your future no matter your background. Personally, I can&#8217;t wait to get into college and have a nice job making a decent amount of money. I know the field I&#8217;m going into has a ever-expanding job market and I am more than certain there will be a position for me to fill when I am done with my studies.</p>

			<p>In my opinion anyone can be successful if they work hard enough they will become well-off . Being poor is just a quality of life. You are either born in a poor family or born in a rich family. Being poor is just another saying that you have to work a little more harder in succeeding to become well-off. I think it is very possible also but today I see many people complain with not being able to pay rent, or buy food, ect. To led to that I think it&#8217;s all about motivation and laziness. If you are complaining about not having enough money, get up and start looking for ways instead wasting your life away because your &#8220;too lazy&#8221; and that&#8217;s what most Americans struggle with because we are so &#8220;pampered&#8221; in society that we don&#8217;t know what real work is and the struggle of what other people around the world have to deal with. I do think it is getting harder but that doesn&#8217;t mean you still quit to find a job. Even though jobs can be hard to come by, you don&#8217;t give up cause if you do give up then that&#8217;s what makes life harder. I do believe that United States is the &#8220;land of opportunity&#8221; and it is alive and well. We are the most mixed country of foreigners and I think why is because we have the peace, freedom, jobs and rights to offer that to them it&#8217;s the destination to go. The advantages variety. I think the people born into rich families have more of a advantage because going to college, getting a good job, paying off debt can be easier to handle then verses poor families who have to work harder to pay for college, getting a job before hand and paying off any debt. Even though poor families have to struggle more than the rich, it can be done even though it might consume more time on hand.  I am very optimistic about getting a good job and living in an environment where I&#8217;m conformable to live in. I want to grown up, go to college, and experience new things in the world. I know I have to work extremely hard to get where I want to be at; but, I know it is very possible and I will succeed one day living the dream life I am dreaming of today.</p>

			<p>1.) I believe it is possible to start out poor in this country and if you work hard, you will become well-off. If you work hard and find the right paying job, then you might move up. But jobs are hard to find sometimes. The money you earn is not enough for some people. It is getting harder and easier to earn more money and rise in the social ladder. It is harder because the amount of money you earn for your labor is okay, but then you have all these things you have to pay for. Also companies are replacing manual labor with machines because they cost less.  Its easier because people are making new jobs, adding to the ones they already have, looking for new people to hire.<br />
2.) In a way America is the &#8220;land of opportunity&#8221;. But not as other want to believe the America dream is. Everyone sees the American Dream as a place where there is freedom, and jobs, and homes to live in. But in reality the &#8220;American Dream&#8221; is kinda of a nightmare. Some places are alive and well, but others, others suffer from taxes, and money. The &#8220;land of  opportunity&#8221; is not as full of opportunities as everyone thinks.<br />
3.) Young People form wealthy families have a huge advantage over young people from poor families. One because the wealthy families have more to offer their kids. Poor families are limited to the amount they can give. Two because the young wealthy kids themselves have a life planed for themselves. Also they have more opportunities open for them. Like colleges and jobs. They really don&#8217;t have to work hard for that stuff. Young poor kids have to work hard for what they want to get out of life.<br />
4.) I wish to have a good life and job when I get older. To be able to live the life I wished for. I want to be able to make my families and friends proud of me.</p>
