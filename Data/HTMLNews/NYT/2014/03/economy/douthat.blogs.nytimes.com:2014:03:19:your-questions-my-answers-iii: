And as before, my thanks to everyone who offered questions, and my apologies for only answering a selection of the many that were posed.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">*</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody"><strong>Q:</strong> I have to say that I don&#8217;t agree with you a lot. What do you think should be done (or not done, if you deny climate change science) about climate change? It seems like the only way to prevent ourselves from passing the point of no return is to have a massive government intervention in the economy. To me, it is clear that the free market isn&#8217;t cutting it when it comes to climate change. But you&#8217;re a reasonable (someone who thinks out his or her argument) conservative: how do we fight climate change?</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody"><em><a href="//douthat.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/03/11/ask-me-anything/#permid=11321789">âPN, St. Louis, MO</a></em></p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody"><strong>A:</strong>Â Mostly by hoping for technological breakthroughs, and looking for ways âÂ prizes, research funding, removing distortions in energy markets âÂ to speed them. It&#8217;s completely plausible, as you suggest, that climate change will turn out to be an externality that market forces alone can&#8217;t solve; the difficulty is that the most direct forms of government intervention (CO2 regulation, carbon taxation, the various cap-and-trade regimes) probably aren&#8217;t going to work either, because they require a level of global political cooperation and economic self-sacrifice that the slow-motion pace (from our perspective, not nature&#8217;s) of ecological change is extremely unlikely to inspire.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">At best, you might be able to get some movement on cap-and-trade in U.S. politics if the economy roared for a sustained stretch. (It&#8217;s not a coincidence that the last period of bipartisan enthusiasm peaked with the Bush-era economy.) <span id="more-19609"></span>But even then the finished legislative product would probably be a costly kludge, with even more inefficiences than Europe&#8217;s none-too-effective attempt at carbon markets, and a minimal impact on the underlying problem. And then we still wouldn&#8217;t be close to figuring out how to deal with the heart of the problem, which is the (completely understandable) aversion to self-sacrificial regulation in developing countries around to the world, which has helped scuttle every attempt at a global climate change regime.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Or at least that&#8217;s my sense of the state of play at the moment: Innovation is our best hope, adaptation and mitigation our most likely future, and we should hope that the recent, much-debated slowdown in the pace of warming continues without kidding ourselves that it somehow proves that no problem exists. But as I mentioned in an earlier round of questions, I try not to be too doctrinaire about policy areas where other writers have a much stronger handle on the material,Â and so I&#8217;d recommend reading elsewhere for the &#8220;reasonable&#8221; skepticism about liberalism&#8217;s existing climate change agenda it sounds like you might be looking for.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">A couple of suggestions: In short form, the comments from Tyler Cowen and Larry Summers (one libertarian and the other neoliberal but neither any kind of &#8220;climate change denier&#8221;)Â <a href="//globalenergyinitiative.org/environment/139-the-economist-solution-to-climate-change.html">in this symposium</a>Â both strike me as plausible reads on the problem. In longer-form, the work ofÂ <a href="//www.cato-unbound.org/2008/08/11/jim-manzi/keeping-our-cool-what-do-about-global-warming">Jim Manzi</a> (from the center-right) and <a href="//thebreakthrough.org/">Ted Nordhaus and Michael Shellenberger</a> (from the center-left) is worth dipping into extensively as well.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">And then you can seek out their many liberal critics in turn &#8230; <a href="//grist.org/climate-change/2011-04-26-why-ive-avoided-commenting-on-nisbets-climate-shift-report/">they aren&#8217;t hard to find</a>.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody"><strong>Q:</strong> Given the damaging impasse in our culture and politics, and with it the pressing need for someone to move off their viewpoint, what is the bedrock principle âÂ i.e; gun control, abortion, freedom of speech, climate change, gay marriage, etc. âÂ that you would bend or break on to help foment a healthier discourse in our nation?</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">It is the hardest question that I ask myself.Â Thanks for being vulnerable.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody"><em><a href="//douthat.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/03/11/ask-me-anything/#permid=11321537">âDavid Roy, Fort Collins, Colorado</a></em></p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody"><strong>A:</strong> I think &#8220;bend&#8221; and &#8220;break&#8221; are very different things. Really, I&#8217;d be willing to bend on most issues, in part because that&#8217;s just a necessary part of democratic politics, and also because on a lot of issues my views are based (or at least I&#8217;d like to think so!) on cost-benefit analysis as well as ideology, so imagining compromise isn&#8217;t that difficult. I&#8217;d be willing to accept a slightly larger government in exchange for a lighter regulatory footprint and very different spending priorities; I&#8217;d accept the kind of carbon tax that I just expressed skepticism about if it were part of a tax reform that included the kind of work and family-friendly tax cuts I support; I&#8217;m open to modest gun control measures where their effectiveness can be demonstrated (here&#8217;s some <a href="//www.realclearpolicy.com/blog/2014/02/17/whats_the_matter_with_the_missouri_murder_rate_841.html">interesting recent evidence</a>Â on the pro-gun control side); I&#8217;d be willing to endure a socialist dictatorship if I were allowed to co-write the next season of &#8220;True Detective&#8221; &#8230; you get the idea.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">&#8220;Breaking,&#8221; though, implies just giving up on a principle or idea entirely, which is a lot harder to do. That&#8217;s part of why the culture wars, where important principles are clearly at stake, burn so hot despite well-meaning (or not so well-meaning) attempts to push them to the back of the political stove. Not that compromise is impossible on these issues: As someone who&#8217;s an anti-abortion absolutist as a philosophical matter, for instance, I don&#8217;t disdain realism and compromise on the issue, and indeed I think the pro-life movement has been resilient in an often-hostile political landscape precisely <a href="//www.nytimes.com/2008/12/07/opinion/07douthat.html?pagewanted=all">because it hasn&#8217;t made the perfect the enemy of the good</a>. But the culture war does present cases (and this is true for both sides) where conceding on the principle is morally problematic or worse, even when the politics are hopeless, and where the term &#8220;break&#8221; is an appropriate description of what giving up would mean. And while comity is valuable, I wouldn&#8217;t want to endorse such breakage in most cases; indeed, I think that ruling certain issues off the table can create a price of entry into political debate that a principled citizen shouldn&#8217;t be expected to accept.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody"><strong>Q:</strong> Why do you think George W. Bush turned out to be such a bad president? I&#8217;ve heard a lot of character/personality explanations over the years (he&#8217;s stupid etc) but do you think there might be a structural reason why the GOP nominated him, or how his presidency functioned that might explain it? Or is it basically just his fault after all?</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody"><em><a href="//douthat.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/03/11/ask-me-anything/#permid=11321321">âjka418, Twin Cities</a></em></p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody"><strong>A:</strong> I could give an answer as long and complicated as his presidency, but a short answer might be useful: Because he and his team believed (along with a lot of people) that Saddam Hussein had a significant W.M.D. program, because they (along with a lot of people) overestimated our ability to pacify Iraq and build up democratic institutions in that country, and because they made specific choices during the occupation (for which they bear full responsibility) that made a bad situation that much worse.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">This kind of Iraq War determinism, which <a href="//douthat.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/03/25/the-iraq-war-and-domestic-politics/">I&#8217;ve elaborated on</a> and <a href="//douthat.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/03/25/the-iraq-war-and-domestic-politics/">defended</a> in the past, is obviously incomplete as a story of the Bush presidency&#8217;s problems. But it has advantages over a lot of the Grand Theories that get spun about those eight years, in which Bush&#8217;s failure is alleged (by liberals) to prove the impossibility of conservative governance, or alleged (by conservatives) to demonstrate that any attempt to govern from the center-right is doomed to be a budget-busting failure. I have lots of problems with Bush&#8217;s policy choices overall, but <a href="//douthat.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/04/25/george-w-bush-in-hindsight/">I don&#8217;t think they vindicate either caricature</a>: Instead, a lot of what went wrong seems highly contingent, some of what seemed to go wrong wasn&#8217;t actually so disastrous (Harriet Miers is the answer to a trivia question, Medicare Part D&#8217;s implementation turned out fine, etc.), and some of what went right (or at least <a href="//douthat.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/04/25/george-w-bush-in-hindsight/">what could have been much, much worse</a>) was connected to some of the same personal characteristics that are often cited as the qualities that doomed his presidency to failure.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">So I&#8217;m just hesitant about scripting an entire conclusive narrative around Bush the Man or Bushism the Ideological Vision. I think it&#8217;s better to just evaluate his specific policy choices on a case by case basis, and there it seems to me that what happened in Iraq looms so large (and shaped every subsequent choice so dramatically) that it will be the central evaluative issue for future historians of his presidency, period.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody"><strong>Q:</strong> Why do conservatives object to directly increasing the minimum wage by making employers pay for it, while they are O.K. with indirectly increasing the minimum wage by making taxpayers foot the bill through the EITC? If I don&#8217;t shop at Walmart because I don&#8217;t think it pays enough, I certainly don&#8217;t want to subsidize Walmart&#8217;s profits with my tax dollars.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody"><em><a href="//douthat.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/03/11/ask-me-anything/#permid=11320830">âBob Hanle, Madison, WI</a></em></p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody"><strong>A:</strong> Not all conservatives are pro-EITC, but on behalf of those of us who favor its existence and potential expansion, I&#8217;d offer this answer: Because we prefer a transparent welfare state that supplements market income after the fact to a hidden welfare state that interferes with market forces more directly.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">It may well be, as you suggest, that Walmart could afford to pay its workers more âÂ though <a href="//www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2012/11/26/why-can-t-walmart-be-more-like-costco.html">the underlying issues</a> are, well, complicated, and there&#8217;s a pretty good case that Walmart&#8217;s low pricesÂ <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=0CCYQFjAA&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mackinac.org%2Farchives%2F2006%2Fwalmart.pdf&amp;ei=xJgoU-SmEuXA0gHa4oHwCg&amp;usg=AFQjCNFWqg65SihV24rExEaobJ5aW7MBRw&amp;sig2=GYYs3Oj7yo_vjcQD2MMGjg&amp;bvm=bv.62922401,d.dmQ">benefit the working class.</a> But conservatives would say, following Hayek, that even if you feel certain thatÂ Walmart is run by greedheads who are just lining their own pockets, the government is extremely ill-equipped to judge that kind of question âÂ and for that reason and others, ifÂ you&#8217;re trying to maximize growth, employment and entrepreneurship overall, it&#8217;s much wiser to leave it to the market to decide the prevailing wage.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Then if we, as a society, think that market forces and economic efficiency are leaving too many people behind, and some kind of wage threshold makes sense as a matter of distributive justice &#8230; well, then, we can create one, as programs like the E.I.T.C. effectively do. But we should recognize that what we&#8217;re doing is straightforward redistribution, and just redistribute transparently instead of imposing what amounts to a tax on low-wage employers and calling it a living wage. (And this is especially true in an era of mass unemployment, when we want low-wage employers to feel comfortable hiring as many people as possible.)</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">The issue, again, is not that you&#8217;re necessarily wrong to judge Walmart&#8217;s wage decisions harshly. It&#8217;s that there just isn&#8217;t some kind of perfect morality-plus-economics mechanism for policymakers to use to figure out which businesses have selfish motives and which ones are paying the best wage that their business model enables them to afford. So rather than imposing a single standard on an incredibly diverse landscape, it&#8217;s better to do whatever redistribution you favor more directly, even when it sometimes seems to let bad actors off the hook.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody"><strong>Q:Â </strong>Itâs clear that, as a Christian, you disagree with the âNew Atheistsâ about many things. But you seem unaware about how out of touch your particular version of Christianity is with the vast majority of those who claim to be Christian.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Why donât you write a blog post condemning the theology/philosophy/ethics of the Christians with whom you obviously have little in common? (I think youâll discover that you have more in common with most irreligious people than you do with fellow Christians.)</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody"><em><a href="//douthat.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/03/11/ask-me-anything/#permid=11319659">âMark B., Toronto</a></em></p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody"><strong>A:</strong>Â I&#8217;m actually quite aware that many of my fellow believers don&#8217;t share all of my opinions! But I&#8217;d make two points in defense of the subjects I take up on the blog and in the column, and then throw one point back at you.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">First, I think it&#8217;s a good idea for a writer to try to be useful to his audience, in the sense of provoking interesting arguments, and raising points his readers might not otherwise consider. And my <em>strong</em> impression is that the Times&#8217; readership (and I&#8217;m including religious as well as secular subscribers) does not need regular instruction about the intellectual problems with, say, premillennial dispensationalism or &#8220;name it and claim it&#8221; prosperity theology, and that it&#8217;s a far better thing â especially in an era when fundamentalism&#8217;s political influence is waning rapidlyÂ âÂ for me to challenge and discuss ideas that actually have a strong purchase among the audience that reads my work.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Not that the issues you raise are unimportant: I think they&#8217;re important enough to have devoted a lot of ink to them in <a href="//books.simonandschuster.com/Bad-Religion/Ross-Douthat/9781439178331">my recent book on American Christianity</a>, where you can find extended critiques of figures like Joel Osteen and Glenn Beck, among others. And maybe I&#8217;m not getting the balance exactly right, and I should work more critiques of the fundamentalist strand of what I&#8217;ve called &#8220;bad religion&#8221; into my semi-daily writing. But you have to choose your targets in this profession, and I think the prejudices of secularism are often a more appropriate target for my blogging and columnizing than the errors of fundamentalism. (Though I do sometimes manage <a href="//douthat.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/10/04/why-atheists-need-fundamentalists/">to critique both at once</a>.)</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Second, and in defense of my co-believers &#8230;Â I think there&#8217;s a tendency among non-religious readers to read philosophical defenses of religious belief (in the vein of David Bentley Hart&#8217;s &#8220;The Experience of God,&#8221; to picked <a href="//theweek.com/article/index/254941/memo-to-atheists-godrsquos-not-dead-yet">the most-discussed</a> recent example), snort, and say &#8220;well, that&#8217;s all well and good, but that&#8217;s not what most people in the pew believe!&#8221; Which isÂ <em>sort of</em> true, in the sense that most people aren&#8217;t philosophers or theologians and don&#8217;t base their beliefs on a careful reading of Aquinas or Maimonides. (Though I wonder how many secular partisans of Science! could actually explain all or most of the theories they endorse.)</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">But it&#8217;sÂ also sort of false, because many serious philosophers of religion (Hart, for instance, very much included) <a href="//douthat.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/02/13/among-the-believers/">don&#8217;t see themselves</a> as advancing theories that contradict the basic tenets of their respective faiths; they see themselves as broadening, deepening, explaining and justifying those tenets, in ways that fulfill rather than contradict the assumptions of the typical believes. (Or if they <em>are</em> contradicting them, they&#8217;re often doing so a context that assumes the beliefs in question might be true, and are at the very least worth debating.) What&#8217;s more, as Hart points out in his book, it does &#8220;ordinary&#8221; believers a disservice to insist that they&#8217;re all literal-minded dunces who think God is a white-bearded guy sitting on a cloud somewhere due west of Pluto:</p>
<blockquote><p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">&#8230; Certainly the average believer may have very little knowledge of the history of metaphysics or the technical language of philosophy, and might not be able to formulate propositions regarding the logic of divine transcendence with the practiced ease of some saturnine old Jesuit in some Midwestern Catholic collegeâs philosophy faculty &#8230;</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Nevertheless, if one asks that average believer certain question about what he or she understands God to be, the answers will often be in principle perfectly concordant with the more arcane formulate of the metaphysicians: that God is Spirit, incorporeal, not an object located somewhere in space, not subject to the limitations of time, not a product of cosmic nature, not simply some craftsman who creates by manipulating materials external to himself, not composed of parts, but rather residing in all things while remaining perfectly one, present to us in the depths of our own beings . . . (and so forth). As a practical reality, the God of faith and the God of philosophers are in many crucial respects recognizably one and the same.</p></blockquote>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">And by the same token, it&#8217;s a mistake for secular readers to assume that the &#8220;reasonable believers&#8221; they encounter in, say, the pages of the Times share all of their assumptions about what constitutes a reasonable belief. To use your formulation, <em>some</em> philosophically-minded believers may have more in common in <em>some</em> ways with <em>some</em>Â irreligious people than they do with <em>some</em> of their fellow Christians. ButÂ Aquinas believed in the physical resurrection of Jesus of Nazareth; so does David Bentley Hart; so do I. And that shared belief fixes a gulf between me and Richard Dawkins, and creates a commonality between me and (for instance) Ken Ham, that would be fruitless to deny.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">And then as for the commonalities that I do have with many nonbelievers, Dawkins included â well, for my last point, I&#8217;d just turn the issue around, and suggest that what we have in common is as much of a challenge to atheistic prejudices as to Christian ones. That is, to the extent that contemporary atheists are also idealistic liberals who believe in human rights and human reason (which in many cases they seem to be!), they are actually making their own metaphysical bets that have little or nothing to do with the scientific method or the latest in evolutionary theory or a rigorous devotion to pure materialistic empirics, and have more in common with the religious world-picture than they admit.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">This isn&#8217;t just a matter of intellectual genealogy and <a href="//www.newstatesman.com/culture/2014/03/ghost-atheist-feast-was-nietzsche-right-about-religion">the often-unacknowledged debt</a> modern liberalism still owes to Western monotheism, or <a href="//douthat.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/01/06/the-confidence-of-jerry-coyne/?_r=0">the potentials tensions and problems within a worldview</a> that tries to be politically progressive while also embracing eliminative materialism. It&#8217;s a matter of the plain substance of a lot of contemporary secular-liberal belief, and the place that essentially supernatural conceptsÂ â from <a href="//www.nytimes.com/2014/02/16/opinion/sunday/is-the-universe-a-simulation.html">Platonic forms</a>Â to <a href="//www.nytimes.com/2012/03/25/books/review/a-universe-from-nothing-by-lawrence-m-krauss.html?_r=0">ex-nihilo physical laws</a> to <a href="//www.thenation.com/article/178330/beyond-naturalism-ronald-dworkin?page=0,1">effective-religious assumptions</a> about the objective reality ofÂ human rights and moral valuesÂ all the way down to &#8220;arc of history&#8221; views of human progressÂ â still occupy in the intellectual furnishing of well-educated modern minds &#8230; even minds that insist that <em>they</em> rely exclusively on the scientific method, and that their religious critics are spaghetti-monster worshiping obscurantists.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">To be clear, I&#8217;m not saying that embracing (or admitting the possible existence of) certain &#8220;God-concepts&#8221; requires one embrace theistic ideas, let alone Christian ones. I&#8217;m just saying that these concepts, and others like them, create an enduring, effectivelyÂ <em>metaphysical</em>Â common ground between believers and (some) atheists, and that contemporary atheism would profit greatly from acknowledging as much âÂ instead of pretending that its every premise and principle derives directly from laboratory investigation.</p>
