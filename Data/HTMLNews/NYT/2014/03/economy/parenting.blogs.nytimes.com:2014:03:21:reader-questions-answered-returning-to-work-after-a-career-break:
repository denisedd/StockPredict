<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody"> <a href="//parenting.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/03/17/reader-comments-and-questions-helping-the-stay-at-home-parent-and-more-get-back-in-the-game/?_php=true&#038;_type=blogs&#038;smid=fb-share&#038;_r=0#permid=11367715">Trish from North Carolina</a>: We relocated to a new state for my husband&#8217;s job while I was on my first maternity leave. Now that my youngest is 2, I&#8217;d like to return to work, but all my professional contacts are several states (and four years) away. How do you re-create that network in a new place?</p>
<div class="a left">A.</div>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Given the global nature of business today, contacts from your prior work experience might well know people who could be helpful  in your new location. So reach out to them and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vpuPdJ0WCYU" title="youtube video with tips on networking ">ask  if they know people in your field</a>, in your area. Donât be shy, even if you have not been in touch  for several years. With LinkedIn, itâs so easy to send someone a Connect notice as a first step to getting back in touch. Then you can follow up by trying to set up a call or meeting. Make sure you indicate you are in information gathering mode, so they donât think that you will be asking them for a job.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">You also need to start to build a professional network in your new location. Ideal venues include Toastmasters, a university lecture series, alumni clubs or LinkedIn groups for your college, and professional association events. Volunteer to help a local professional association organize events. This will allow you to contact experts in your field to recommend speakers or serve as speakers themselves. By doing this, youâll build a relationship with them that is separate from your job search. Later, when you know them better, you can ask them about job opportunities. Professional association events can be expensive. To attend without breaking your budget, tell the organizers that youâre on a career break and ask if you can attend at the student rate, or volunteer to help at the event in exchange for free or discounted admission. </p>

<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody"> <a href="//parenting.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/03/17/reader-comments-and-questions-helping-the-stay-at-home-parent-and-more-get-back-in-the-game/?smid=fb-share#permid=11374742">ceilidh from Boulder, Colo.</a>: How does one deal with returning to work in an area where jobs in your field are difficult to find?</p>
<div class="a left">A.</div>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">You donât want to be defeated by negative talk about the economy before you even start your search. In a tough economy, you need to rely even more strongly on personal connections, and this means going public with your job search, telling everyone you know, starting with your family and your close circle of friends and then moving on to people you know less well and people in professional settings. The more you practice telling your story &#8212; what youâre good at and the kind of work youâre looking for &#8212; the better youâll sound, and the more confident youâll feel.  </p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">If there truly is a contraction in your field in your geographic area, you may need to consider other employers who can use your skills. For example, if you were a trader in New York  and you are now in Boulder, you may want to think about what other kinds of quantitative or analytical roles might be a fit for you. </p>
<div class="q left">Q.</div>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody"> <a href="//parenting.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/03/17/reader-comments-and-questions-helping-the-stay-at-home-parent-and-more-get-back-in-the-game/?smid=fb-share#permid=11365694">munoz04 from Queens</a>: What advice do you have for men specifically (considering the stigma from reversed traditional gender roles)?</p>
<div class="a left">A.</div>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody"> We think at-home dads returning to work should follow the same strategy as at-home moms.  We think the bias against at-home dads is diminishing, in large part because there are more stay-at-home dads now than ever before. So you should go forward with your search in a confident, nondefensive way.  Our <a href="https://www.irelaunch.com/sites/default/files/Seven_Steps.pdf">Seven Steps to Relaunch Success </a> career re-entry framework is gender neutral and equally effective for people returning to work following career breaks for elder care, pursuing a personal interest, or a health issue as it is for those returning after career breaks for child care reasons. </p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Last year we hit a milestone, when a dad who was home with his kids for 13 years attended our<a href="//www.irelaunch.com/viewconference/1505"> iRelaunch Return to Work Conference in 2012</a>, returned to work successfully in a strategy role at an independent K-12 school and <a href="//www.irelaunch.com/DCarty">presented his  success story</a> at our 2013 conference. It was the first time we had a returning dad on our panel. He told us: âIf you are proud of your role as a stay-at-home parent, then you want to work in a place that gets that and respects that choice. You need to interview them as much as they are interviewing you.â When he perceived a negative reaction during an interview to his decision to stay at home, he moved on to other employers who were more receptive. </p>
<div class="q left">Q.</div>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody"> <a href="//parenting.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/03/17/reader-comments-and-questions-helping-the-stay-at-home-parent-and-more-get-back-in-the-game/?smid=fb-share#permid=11371014">Wu Ming from Amsterdam</a>: I&#8217;m 60. I went back to school and got a master&#8217;s in a fairly sought-after subject last year. All my new classmates got jobs after graduation; they&#8217;re in their 20s. How can an older person compete with younger peers?</p>
<div class="a left">A.</div>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody"> Is ageism out there? Yes. However, you must filter out your ageism-related concerns or you will feel defeated before you even walk out the door. </p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Make sure to tell everyone you know that you are looking to return to work and that you have a new master&#8217;s degree and expertise in subject X. Applying online will not yield results as you are likely to get screened out. Your  success is going to be highly dependent on a personal handoff from someone who knows you. That person needs to tell a friend or colleague who is hiring that you were a star when you worked together and she just has to talk to you. Or the person who knows the interviewer needs to hear from a mutual contact who knows you well about how great you are so she can tell him that you should be considered. LinkedIn is very helpful in showing such connections. </p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Donât forget people who might have reported to you, whom you mentored or whom you knew in a prior job. We have numerous stories of returning professionals who were hired to work for someone who used to work for them (including Carol). They know and respect you and can sometimes open a door for you. </p>

<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Every employer we work with tells us that an internal employee reference moves the rÃ©sumÃ© to the top of the pile. Some employers even compensate employees who recommend people who are hired. When you meet practitioners in your field, demonstrate your knowledge of the latest thinking in the field from your recent academic work. Donât be afraid to show enthusiasm, excitement and knowledge. That energy will help counteract ageist perceptions.  If you know who you will be meeting &#8212; say a panelist at a professional association event &#8212; and the person has published work on the topic or has a special research interest in it, review their work ahead of time and tell them your reaction to it. Even better, try to identify this work via Twitter, Facebook or YouTube, and mention: âI was on your companyâs Twitter page and saw the post about your new report. I clicked through and read it, and I was particularly drawn to point Y. I was wondering what you thought about Big-Guru-in-the-Field Zâs thinking on that point.â Indicating in this subtle way that you are comfortable with social media will help reduce age-related concerns.</p>

<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody"> Plenty of <a href="//www.irelaunch.com/CTanelli">returning professionals who were expats </a> during their career break return to work successfully upon their return. Usually visa restrictions keep the  trailing spouse or partner from working overseas. However, the experience of living in another country for an extended period can be valued by employers with a <a href="//www.internations.org/magazine/following-your-spouse-abroad-reinvent-yourself-16659?utm_source=newsletter_mails&#038;utm_medium=email&#038;utm_campaign=12_20140320&#038;utm_content=1 "> global presence.</a></p>

Beyond, that, we think she should follow the strategies covered elsewhere in this Q. and A. </p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Your question raises the issue of how to maintain career continuity when a spouse or partnerâs job requires frequent moves, a situation in which military spouses frequently find themselves. Remote work, meaningful volunteer experiences, portable careers and transferable skills keep rÃ©sumÃ©s strong until spouses can settle in one area permanently and resume a more conventional career. <a href="//www.irelaunch.com/remotemilitary ">Some tips are here.</a>  One military spouse, <a href=" //www.irelaunch.com/node/839  ">Christina Crawford</a>, a top sales representative and a <a href="//www.stampinup.com/ECWeb/default.aspx?cid=34">director for Stampin&#8217; Up</a>,  a home-based stamp and craft company, built her business as she moved from base to base over a 15-year period. Christina continued to work remotely out of her home, picking up more customers and more military spouses who wanted to work as demonstrators on her team. In 2011, when I interviewed Christina, she and her team had sold $45 million worth of products since her start with the company, and she was leading a team of 1,000 demonstrators. Christina and I spoke at the <a href="//www.nationalmilitaryspousenetwork.org/public/main.cfm ">National Military Spouse Network</a> annual summit, where she told the audience her income was &#8220;in the six figures&#8221; from her Stampin&#8217; Up business.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Christina&#8217;s story is especially illustrative, because she employed almost every strategy to maintain an updated rÃ©sumÃ© and career continuity, despite her frequent moves. Christina spent a  year volunteering for Army Emergency Relief and Army Community Service at Fort Lewis, where her husband was stationed. Army Emergency Relief ultimately employed her as a budget counselor, helping families figure out how to pay their bills, and assisting with credit counseling and bankruptcy filings. She took an H&#038;R Block tax course and did tax preparation work for six months before moving to Fort Benning, where she worked as a retail sales associate for five months. Moving to Germany, Christina became certified as an aerobics instructor and took over an aerobics class on the base from another instructor who was moving away. Christina was successful in finding paid work every time she moved, finding her tax preparation skills and her aerobics instructor certification were particularly marketable. She was able to get work in one of these two areas whenever she moved, both on base and off.  Ultimately, she became a demonstrator for Stampin&#8217; Up.&#8221;</p>

I worked in nonprofit fund development for a long time, but I donât want to do that anymore. I have experience in marketing, communications, bookkeeping, etc.</p>
<div class="a left">A.</div>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody"> First, you have to figure out what you want to do. Letâs say you decide to pursue a communications role at a for-profit company in a related industry to the nonprofit you were in previously. Make sure you add a summary at the top of your rÃ©sumÃ©, citing your communications skills and explaining the transition you wish to make. In particular, you might want to list the most important transferable skills, such as social media savvy or understanding of a market segment or whatever the relevant buzzwords are for the jobs for which you are applying. Use the same keywords in your rÃ©sumÃ© that are used in a particular job posting and customize your rÃ©sumÃ© for each job posting. In your LinkedIn profile, describe yourself as a communications professional, not as a nonprofit development executive. </p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Donât shy away from temp work as a way to get a foot in the door.  Employers engage temporary workers not only to fill a temporary need, but also to identify top performers they can move into permanent roles. Also consider <a href="//www.irelaunch.com/Research_Publications">proposing an internship </a> even if a company does not have a formal internship program, as most companies do not. For example, if you  think a company is reluctant to hire you because of your career break or because you are making a transition, ask if it would consider hiring you for a contract assignment or special project &#8212; some kind of short term, nonbinding work arrangement.  The company can evaluate you based on an actual work sample, and you can determine whether the employer is a place you would want to work longer term.</p>

<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">There are networking benefits because you meet fellow students and professors. By virtue of your student status, you have the opportunity  to attend campus career fairs, access career services and, in some cases, apply for internships and interview with companies that are recruiting on campus. Plus, the academic experience gives you relevant and updated information to include on your rÃ©sumÃ© and to bring up in conversations with hiring managers. We particularly recommend courses with field studies or capstone projects so that you can meet professionals in your field and have rÃ©sumÃ©-worthy work experience. You can list the field study as a separate entry on your rÃ©sumÃ©, in addition to your coursework. Field studies are great fodder for networking conversations and interviews.  </p>

<div class="a left">A.</div>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody"> If your child is in school or you are planning to enroll your child in day care, you need to have a backup plan in case your child is sick or there is a vacation or snow day. Options include lining up a neighbor who can take your child on a vacation or snow day in exchange for some favors you offer to do for her, building   a network of babysitters, or taking turns with a spouse or partner. In fact, formulating a child care strategy is an important part of a conversation that you need to have with your spouse or partner  early in the process of returning to work. You also need to have conversations with your children, if any, to consider what the impact of your return is going to be. One woman going back to work told her preteens that everyone was going to have to contribute a half-hour of time every day to share the chores that she used to perform. And donât feel guilty about making your kids pitch in. Helping out in this way is good for them. Parents have told us their children matured tremendously as a result of their return to work. We also recommend involving your children in a  positive way in the process. With older children, show them job descriptions of positions youâre exploring and ask them if they think theyâre a good fit for you. Or draw up a list of what you think are your top 10 attributes and ask them to pick what they perceive as your top five. You can engage your spouse or partner in these activities as well.

<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody"> <a href="//parenting.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/03/17/reader-comments-and-questions-helping-the-stay-at-home-parent-and-more-get-back-in-the-game/?smid=fb-share#permid=11368803">happyjoyfulday from Sahuarita, Ariz.</a>: I recently quit my job to have my first baby. I donât plan to start looking for another six months. What can I do to not fall out of the working world completely? Are there jobs out there that would allow a mother to sometimes work from home maybe two days a week to cut back on day care costs? </p>
<div class="a left">A.</div>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody"> In most cases, if you anticipate a career break of less than a year, you should approach your current employer and try to negotiate a part-time work arrangement for that period. For someone who has already left, if you had a good relationship with your employer, consider going back to that employer and asking if you can work on a part-time or project basis. Ask them to keep you in mind to cover maternity or other employee leaves of absence. If you have determined that you don&#8217;t want to return to your prior employer, or your prior employer is not willing to allow you to work part time, you might want to try to access part-time opportunities through a temp agency. We also recommend targeting small and midsize companies that might be more flexible than large, highly structured organizations. Even if going back to work is a break-even proposition after paying for child care, you should think of it is an investment in your future career. Any income you earn will also add to your account at Social Security. If you have a spouse or partner, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jk5bCRsVlzQ ">we strongly recommend that child care costs be weighed</a> against the coupleâs combined projected income and not only against the incremental income you will be bringing in when returning to work. </p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">If you canât find a part-time role thatâs a good fit for you, we recommend pursuing volunteer roles that are in line with your career goals. Some sources for such roles include www.idealist.org, www.volunteermatch.org and  www.catchafire.org.  </p>

<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody"> <a href="//parenting.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/03/17/reader-comments-and-questions-helping-the-stay-at-home-parent-and-more-get-back-in-the-game/?smid=fb-share#permid=11370053">ROK from Minneapolis</a>: My question as an attorney with over 20 years in who &#8220;never left&#8221; despite having a young child of my own (because I love the law and would have been abject and miserable as a stay-at-home mom) and now is in the position of hiring is: &#8220;Why should I hire you?&#8221; &#8220;What do you think you should be hired for?&#8221; Do candidates realize that after a significant period of time at home that they may no longer be qualified to walk right back into that partner or AGC or DGC position? What can you tell me to help me help you? How are you going to overcome my bias towards you? Honest questions.</p>
<div class="a left">A.</div>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody"> Thanks for being honest and sharing your biases. First of all, most people returning after a long career break  are willing to come back in at a level lower than where they left and are prepared to prove themselves and hopefully grow over time. More important, however, there are several reasons to consider hiring an experienced professional who has taken a career break versus a less experienced candidate or a lateral hire who has not taken a break. The returning professional has experience, maturity and perspective that the newbie lacks.  And the returning professional may be less expensive and more enthusiastic than the lateral hire. Regarding a skills gap, with many professional fields changing rapidly, returning professionals are often not at a disadvantage, because everyone in the field has to update themselves constantly. Most important, women and men who have been on career break often have many âsoftâ skills that can make the difference between a so-so hire and a standout. These include leadership ability, the ability to build communal relationships and resourcefulness, developed while pursuing  household projects and volunteer endeavors.  </p>
