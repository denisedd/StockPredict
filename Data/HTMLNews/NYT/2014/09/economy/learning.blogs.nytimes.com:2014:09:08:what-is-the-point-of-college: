<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">What is the purpose of attaining a college degree? Is it to ensure a life of financial stability? Is it to develop as a person and as a thinker? </p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Can it be all of these things&#8211;or is it, for you, about something else entirely?</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">In the Op-Ed <a href="//www.nytimes.com/2014/09/07/opinion/sunday/frank-bruni-demanding-more-from-college.html">&#8220;Demanding More From College,â</a> Frank Bruni writes about the &#8220;rightful mission&#8221; of higher education.</p>
<blockquote><p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">
Meanwhile, the sociologists Richard Arum and Josipa Roksa were out with a new book, âAspiring Adults Adrift,â in which they assessed how a diverse group of nearly 1,000 recent graduates were faring two years after they finished their undergraduate studies. About one-quarter of them were still living at home. And nearly three-quarters were still getting at least some money from parents. These were the nuggets that the media understandably grabbed hold of, drawing the lesson that college isnât the springboard that young men and women want and perhaps need it to be.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody"><span id="more-149554"></span></p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">I have a problem with all of this. But my concern isnât about the arguments themselves or some of the conclusions drawn. Itâs about the narrowness of the discussion, which so heavily emphasizes how a career is successfully forged and how financial security is quickly achieved.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">While those goals are important and that focus is understandable, thereâs another dimension to college, and itâs one in which students arenât being served, or serving themselves, especially well. Iâm referring to the potential â and need â for college to confront and change political and social aspects of American life that are as troubling as the economy.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">We live in a country of sharpening divisions, pronounced tribalism, corrosive polarization. And I wish we would nudge kids â no, I wish we would push them â to use college as an exception and a retort to that, as a pre-emptive strike against it, as a staging ground for behaving and living in a different, broader, healthier way.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">&#8230; And college is the perfect chapter for diversifying friends and influences, rummaging around in fresh perspectives, bridging divides. For many students, itâs an environment more populous than high school was, with more directions in which to turn. It gives them more agency over their calendars and their allegiances. They can better construct their world from scratch.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">And the clay hasnât dried on who they are. Theyâre not yet set in their ways.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">But too many kids get to college and try instantly to collapse it, to make it as comfortable and recognizable as possible. They replicate the friends and friendships theyâve previously enjoyed. They join groups that perpetuate their high-school experiences.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">&#8230;As we pepper students with contradictory information and competing philosophies about collegeâs role as an on ramp to professional glory, we should talk as much about the way college can establish patterns of reading, thinking and interacting that buck the current tendency among Americans to tuck themselves into enclaves of confederates with the same politics, the same cultural tastes, the same incomes. That tendency fuels the little and big misunderstandings that are driving us apart. Itâs at the very root of our sclerotic, dysfunctional political process.</p>

<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">&#8230; Now more than ever, college needs to be an expansive adventure, yanking students toward unfamiliar horizons and untested identities rather than indulging and flattering who and where they already are.

<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">It could mean a better future â for all of us. And thereâs no debate that college should be a path to that.

			<p>I feel that the police should have known more about the situation and not jumped to conclusions before knowing all the facts. In many cases the people of Ferguson and around the country view the police and being racist and opening fire at the first suspect they saw. I think that changes will go into effect soon such as the police will now be required to use tazers even though the assailant has a fire arm, until they realize that the only way they will get the action to stop is to use necessary lethal force. I feel that our teachers should highlight some key points about what happened in the town recently and what some speculations are as to how it will be dealt with accordingly. They could talk about some specific details about the incident such as the cops didn&#8217;t know all the facts and jumped to conclusions, which in the end resulted in the ending of a life. I think that just because the interaction was between a some caucasian police men and an african american man they immediately jump to the fact that it was a hate crime, and thats what the media does it blows things out of proportion. I think talking to other people about race is hard because if you look at almost every other race besides your own, you will realize that they have done something cruel or unjustified to another race such as the bombing of Pearl Harbor, The 9-11 Attacks, the Holocaust, and many more follow after.</p>

			<p>i believe college canâand doesâserve as an antidote  to the american life because if you go to collage you get&#8217;s you more and better job&#8217;es so you can earn more money.</p>

			<p>Its not right for a person to spend years in college, graduate, and then be left thousands of dollars in debt and not be able to find a livable wage. Very bad way to start out your life. College needs to be rethought.</p>

			<p>For only school related comments. For an example whether or not they are teaching the subject and if it makes sense. I don&#8217;t think student have the right to comment about the teachers personal life or insult them about there personal beliefs. Other wise I think it&#8217;s ok.</p>

			<p>College is an investment. It pays the intelligent well, but crushes the mediocre. Use Asians at role models. Asians, with their professional degrees, are the most affluent race in the US.</p>

			<p>It it not reasonable to judge the worth of a college education on how many students are still getting money from there parents after they graduate. College tuition is ridiculously expensive, and it is difficult to find jobs. Grown adults with experience have difficulty finding work nowadays, let alone a new graduate carrying thousands of dollars in debt. I find it reasonable that college graduates live and financially depend an there parents. College pushes you into new ideas, thoughts and opinions, educationally as well as socially.</p>

			<p>I do not think it is reasonable to judge the worth of a college education on how many graduates are getting financial help from their parents two years after graduating. College gives students the foundation they need to be able to get jobs after school. Some jobs take longer and are harder to find than others. It is only natural that the parent would want to help their child during the waiting period. Most recent college graduates receive a great education. However, some of these educations are in a field that has a lower demand. This will just require the applicant to have to wait longer to get their job than others. That in no way lessens the worth of the education they received.</p>

			<p>I recently graduated from college, and anything negative direct toward college education is correct for the most part. Colleges don&#8217;t teach students how to survive in the real world or provide them with practical information aside from what literally taught in those textbooks.</p>

			<p>Like parents have a responsibility to set standards for how their child may act. Sports teams have a responsibility to hold their players to a standard for how they conduct their personal lives. Sports teams should set standards to a playerâs personal life because as they say, what you do can reflect against you and your team. They say this because on and off the field people may know you as for what you do, and such bad actions can cause a bad reputation towards the program. As well as athletes such like Ray rice maybe considered a role model to people or fans.<br />
Teams should hold a consequence depending on how bad their action may be and what it may have affected. In a professional level, consequences should be held more seriously because a professional athletes show credibility by being at a high level of athleticism and they have proven to have the responsibility and skill to handle the concept of being a professional for the sport.<br />
I believe that all teams including high school and college teams should have formal codes of conduct for athletes off the field because in high school and college many athletes arenât really being punished to understand the responsibility of their reputation. As well as they donât understand that many young people may look up to someone in a higher level of competition like college and high school students. Behavior such like getting fights, doing drugs, doing inappropriate age things, and disrespecting people are definitely prohibited.<br />
 I disagree with the way the N.F.L and the ravens have handled the situation with Ray Rice because what happens in someoneâs personal life can truly affect how you play on field, but the NFL didnât really do anything to prevent such a situation in his personal life like this to help and stop it. For instance, such coaches and administration could have simply provided therapy if they knew that something was going on and not just expel him from the N.F.L. The N.F.L should take more responsibility to understand what an athlete or like any normal person may be going through in their personal life to prevent such situations like these that can affect his team and him.<br />
The NFL should have not only imposed such a penalty earlier but to not expel him from the N.F.L. and to only suspend him for a whole season or 2 but as well as send him through therapy to help him through his personal problems. This Indefinite suspension of Rice Monday didnât really seem appropriate to be announced on twitter because I believe the cause of his indefinite suspension was because of media. I believe that it came to ones attention to recognize that he was only suspended for two games, for when other people had been in an even worse consequence for such a situation and may have thought it was unfair and came to N.F.L. and media about this.</p>

			<p>I feel that College is a very important part of peoples lives, because with a higher education you can get better jobs make a higher salary in a year and do what you truly want to do.<br />
I don&#8217;t feel it is right to judge the worth of a college by the people that are not financially independent and live off of their parents, because it does not mean a college is too &#8220;expensive&#8221;, it just means that that person doesn&#8217;t know how to live independently, now that may or may not be a bad thing, but that is not a reason to say colleges are too &#8220;expensive&#8221;.</p>

			<p>America is absolutely full of division. Many of our most troubling issues are not being solved simply because we refuse to find common ground. We are so determined to win our arguments, to be right, that we fail to realize that, most of the time, people on opposite sides are fighting for the same thing &#8211; to better protect the lives and rights of people. That, and to prove they&#8217;re right.<br />
That being said, I question whether college is as bad as Mr. Bruni believes it to be. I have been going to college for almost a month now, and already it is a far more welcoming and open-minded atmosphere than what I typically found in high school. Students seem friendly, willing to listen, and though they have very definitive political views, they also seem ready to learn and look at things from a new perspective. Or at least, more so than I&#8217;ve previously experienced.<br />
I do agree that college should be a time of looking at new perspectives, and broadening your view of the world. But I also believe that the issues of divisions and stubborn opinions should be considered earlier, at the high school level. High school is also a time of changes, a time to examine yourself and your future, and a time where opinions and beliefs are shaped, often for life. Mr. Bruni said that students try to make college &#8220;as comfortable and recognizable as possible.&#8221; After all, they&#8217;ve been thrust into an entirely new world. So they try to replicate what&#8217;s familiar to them&#8230;high school, usually. To make students more open-minded it college, it may be much more effective to tackle the problem in high school &#8211; when students are seeking changes anyway, rebelling against the familiarity of a decade and a half in the same place, and when their minds are forming opinions that will often last a lifetime.</p>

			<p>I think colleges should yank college kids out of there comfort zones. Having friends now in college I see a lot of the same habits they had in high school, almost like they are trying to recreate their past. I think by doing this make some classes that are mandatory that maybe not everybody would want to take, or workshops. Get them out of there comfort zones. Maybe even in every class have a day where you fix your browser and fill it with different things and you look into things you don&#8217;t usually look into. I think in the long run it would have lots of great benefits.</p>

			<p>I think that colleges can &#8220;yank students toward unfamiliar horizons&#8221; by having different stands to go and check out.  Especially on the first couple days the freshman arrive at the college.  That way they have to at least look and see all the different clubs or activities they could join.  Hopefully, seeing something that they would have never known was even a club will open their eyes to something new. This is just one simple way to get the students out of their own comfort zone!</p>

			<p>College can help you become more open-minded, and can get you to reach out to different communities of people, however, you must be willing to search and try to become more open-minded to achieve this. Plenty of people find new passions and form new opinions when exposed to the melting pot of people at college. Yet, there will be people who will search for a life that replicates their past, these people will not achieve this. Also, the closer you are at home when you are at college, the harder it will be to find different ideas and views, than say moving across the country, because the demographic will generally be the same if you are close to home.</p>

			<p>I believe that college students seek out what is familiar to them. &#8220;Same politics, same cultural tastes, and same incomes.&#8221; That is so true. People want to fit in. When a person is tossed into a completely new environment, they look for others with the same interests. It&#8217;s a natural human instinct. One huge example are fraternities and sororities. They all want to fit in with the rest of the house. For the most part, they all enjoy the same or similar things. Those people often enclose themselves into their small little world too. This hurts the students ability to &#8220;construct their world from scratch.&#8221; If they only do the things they have always done in the past, they are no longer growing. They no longer build their world from scratch. These students built their world based on other people. Independence has a lot to do with constructing your own path. Not being afraid to look silly or bad at something is critical to being a more complete person. To become a better person you must put yourself in someone else&#8217;s shoes and be able to try new things. Make yourself a diverse person. You and along with the rest of the world will benefit from it.</p>

			<p>If this is something we should ALL do, why the hell is it upwards of a brand new car to go to get an education?  Then they blow smoke up our arses saying that the only way to go anywhere in life is to get this education.  Well heres my answer to that comment, I have worked at 3 fast food restaurants and you know who gets hired most?  Not kids looking for summer work, no they&#8217;re hiring mostly college grads with degrees in science, business, etc.  to flip and make burgers and fries all day because no one needs work, but these kids have to pay for a new car every semester.  No graduated employee who has a decent job with their degree has the money to pay for a new car every couple months, why the hell do people think that a teenager has that? Thast why college is a ridiculous concept.  You&#8217;re expected to go to be anything, but heres the catch, you&#8217;re not guaranteed to get anything with your degree and make what you want.  Also, before any idiots say something about the car thing, i said that because a car usually costs at least 15-20K.  Thast the cost of most cheap colleges, after that, the price only goes up!!! Please respond to me, i want to know what others think and if they agree or disagree with my thoughts.</p>
