<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">That&#8217;s what  <a href="//www.nytimes.com/1993/10/31/books/children-s-books-335293.html">The Times&#8217;s book critic said</a> about &#8220;The Giver&#8221; when the novel was first published in 1993.

<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Lois Lowry talks in the video at the top of this post about how &#8220;The Giver&#8221; came to be, and she talks in <a href="//www.nytimes.com/2014/08/03/magazine/lois-lowry-on-giving-up-the-giver-to-hollywood.html">this brief interview</a> about all the ways young-adult fiction has changed since she published âThe Giverâ two decades ago.  Use either or both to give your students more context about the novel as they read it. </p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Students might also like to read <a href="//www.nytimes.com/2012/10/07/magazine/lois-lowry-the-childrens-author-who-actually-listens-to-children.html">&#8220;The Childrenâs Author Who Actually Listens to Children&#8221;</a> by Dan Kois. Among other things, he writes about how the 1995 death of Ms. Lowry&#8217;s son, Grey, has affected her books, particularly the final novel in &#8220;The Giver&#8221; series&#8221;:</p>
<blockquote><p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">When Lowry lost her son, she had recently published âThe Giver,â a slim novel about a boy in an isolated community discovering the terrible secrets behind the pleasant, emotionless life he and his friends live. In âThe Giver,â Jonas, upon his 12th birthday, is apprenticed to the title character â the repository of the communityâs collective memory and the one man who remembers what it was like when citizens experienced love, sadness, danger, death, lust. (Even color is a mystery to most of the community.) When Jonas learns that Gabriel, a fussy baby he has come to love, is slated for extermination, he kidnaps Gabriel and escapes into an uncertain future.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Since that bookâs 1994 Newbery Medal, it has become a classic â selling millions of copies worldwide, landing on the curriculum of countless schools (and being challenged or banned at many more for its message of distrust for authority) and leading a wave of dystopian childrenâs literature, most of which has little in common with Lowryâs plain-spoken stories.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody"> In two subsequent novels, âGathering Blueâ and âMessenger,â Lowry explored other communities in the same postapocalyptic world. This fall, Lowry will publish âSon,â the final novel in whatâs now being called the Giver Quartet, and together the four books make a quiet masterpiece â a corrective of sorts to âThe Hunger Gamesâ and other movie-adaptation-ready Y.A. series. Where those books feature violent death and armed rebellion, the battle that Gabriel fights in âSonâ is one in which empathy and love are his only weapons. And where âThe Hunger Gamesâ features a romantic triangle among three fierce revolutionaries, âSonâ highlights the undying love of a mother for her child and the childâs for his mother.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">âThe fact that I lost my son permeates my being,â Lowry told me. And that loss permeates âSonâ as well. Itâs a book of longing in the guise of an adventure. Children will love it. It will break their parentsâ hearts.  </p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Jonas entered the Annex room and realized immediately that it was  a day when he would be sent away. The Giver was rigid in his chair, his face in his hands. </p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">&#8220;I&#8217;ll come back tomorrow, sir,&#8221; he said quickly. Then he hesitated. &#8220;Unless maybe there&#8217;s something I can do to help.&#8221; </p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">The Giver looked up at him, his face contorted with suffering. &#8220;Please,&#8221; he gasped, &#8220;take some of the pain.&#8221; </p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Jonas helped him to his chair at the side of the bed. Then he quickly removed his tunic and lay face down. &#8220;Put your hands on me,&#8221; he directed, aware that in such anguish The Giver might need reminding. The hands came, and the pain came with them and through them. Jonas braced himself and entered the memory which was torturing The Giver. </p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">He was in a confused, noisy, foul-smelling place. It was daylight, early morning, and the air was thick with smoke that hung, yellow and brown, above the ground. Around him, everywhere, far across the expanse of what seemed to be a field, lay groaning men. A wild-eyed horse, its bridle torn and dangling, trotted frantically through the mounds of men, tossing its head, whinnying in panic. It stumbled, finally, then fell, and did not rise.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Jonas heard a voice next to him. &#8220;Water,&#8221; the voice said in a  parched, croaking whisper. </p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">He turned his head toward the voice and looked into the half-closed eyes of a boy who seemed not much older than himself. Dirt streaked the boy&#8217;s face and his matted blond hair. He lay sprawled, his gray uniform glistening with wet, fresh blood. </p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">The colors of the carnage were grotesquely bright: the crimson wetness on the rough and dusty fabric, the ripped shreds of grass, startlingly green, in the boy&#8217;s yellow hair. </p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">The boy stared at him. &#8220;Water,&#8221; he begged again. When he spoke, a new spurt of blood drenched the coarse cloth across his chest and sleeve. </p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">One of Jonas&#8217;s arms was immobilized with pain, and he could see through his own torn sleeve something that looked like ragged flesh and splintery bone. He tried his remaining arm and felt it move. Slowly he reached to his side, felt the metal container there, and removed its cap, stopping the small motion of his hand now and then to wait for the surging pain to ease. Finally, when the container was open, he extended his arm slowly across the blood-soaked earth, inch by inch, and held it to the lips of the boy. Water trickled into the imploring mouth and down the grimy chin. </p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">The boy sighed. His head fell back, his lower jaw dropping as if he had been surprised by something. A dull blankness slid slowly across his eyes. He was silent. </p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">But the noise continued all around: the cries of the wounded men, the cries begging for water and for Mother and for death. Horses lying on the ground shrieked, raised their heads, and stabbed randomly toward the sky with their hooves. </p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">From the distance, Jonas could hear the thud of cannons. Overwhelmed by pain, he lay there in the fearsome stench for hours, listened to the men and animals die, and learned what  warfare meant. </p>

<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody"><em>In this forum, seven experts discuss the questions, Why do bestselling young adult novels seem darker in theme now than in past years? What&#8217;s behind this dystopian trend, and why is there so much demand for it? Below, two of the answers:</em></p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody"><strong> Craving Truth-Telling, by Paolo Bacigalupi</strong></p>
<blockquote><p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">I suspect that young adults crave stories of broken futures because they themselves are uneasily aware that their world is falling apart.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">We might pummel them with advertising that says they should buy a new iPod, or Xbox, or Droid XYZ, and that everything in the world is shiny and delightful &#8212; but whether we&#8217;re looking at the loss of biodiversity, or the depletion of cheap and easily accessible energy, or the hazards of global warming, our children will inherit a world significantly depleted and damaged in comparison to the one our parents handed down to us. And they know it.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">With &#8220;Ship Breaker,&#8221; a novel set in a future when oil has run out and New Orleans has drowned under rising sea levels, I was trying to illuminate the sort of world that we adults are handing off to them. In the story, child laborers tear apart ancient oil tankers and freighters, recycling the last valuable resources from &#8220;the Accelerated Age.&#8221; Quality of life is significantly reduced from our present circumstances, and judging from teenagers&#8217; responses, they crave precisely that sort of truth-telling. Which doesn&#8217;t really surprise me. As a teen, I remember that I craved truth-telling as well, and devoured it wherever I could find it.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Unfortunately, the truth of the world around us is changing, and so the literature is morphing to reflect it. Teens want to read something that isn&#8217;t a lie; we adults wish we could put our heads under the blankets and hide from the scary story we&#8217;re writing for our kids.
</p></blockquote>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody"><strong>Pure Escapism For Young Adult Readers, by Maggie Stiefvater</strong></p>
<blockquote><p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Ahh, dystopia. All it takes is a glimpse at upcoming young adult booklists for 2011 and 2012 to see that the dystopian trend is not only big now, but is going to get bigger in the next few years.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">The question of why these dark novels appeal to teenagers has been around awhile, and thereâs a pretty standard response. It tends to be some variation of âthese are dark, pessimistic times with the economy and culture; the darkness of the subject matter reflects those fears.â</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">My thoughts on that? Ha and double ha. I donât believe it.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">In my experience, the teenagers who are loving the dystopian themes are generally the ones who donât have to face it. I don&#8217;t think they read dark novels because it reflects their world. Would we be so enamored with dystopian fiction if we lived in a culture where violent death was a major concern? It wouldnât be escapism.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Here&#8217;s my theory: our world is getting increasingly complex. Teenagers face a huge number of choices and an almost paralyzing array of expert opinions on what constitutes right and wrong. In a culture defined by shades of gray, I think the absolute black and white choices in dark young adult novels are incredibly satisfying for readers.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Teenagers want to be able to fight for whatâs right &#8212; but finding out whatâs right is now 90 percent of the battle. If only the evil in the world was named Voldemort, we could get down to the business of slaying it. And with the dystopian novels, we know just what we&#8217;re fighting for.
</p></blockquote>

<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody"><strong>For Writing or Discussion:</strong></p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">1. In the excerpt from &#8220;The Giver,&#8221; Jonah is experiencing a memory.  What clues does the author give you about what kind of memory it is? </p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">2. The excerpt from &#8220;The Giver&#8221; is graphic, and the novel is one of the <a href="//www.ala.org/bbooks/top-100-bannedchallenged-books-2000-2009">most banned books</a> in the United States, according to the American Library Association.  The most cited reason for seeking the censorship of the book is that it is &#8220;unsuited to the age group.&#8221; What do you think?  Should middle school and high school students read &#8220;The Giver,&#8221; or is it inappropriate? If you have read the whole novel, what do you think it has taught or shown you? </p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">3.  The author Paolo Bacigalupi says that &#8220;our children will inherit a world significantly depleted and damaged in comparison to the one our parents handed down to us. And they know it.&#8221; What are some of the ways he says the world is damaged? What are some issues you worry about as you grow up? What dystopian fiction have you ever read that deals with those fears or issues in some way?</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">4. The author Maggie Stiefvater says, &#8220;Would we be so enamored with dystopian fiction if we lived in a culture where violent death was a major concern?&#8221;  What do you think?  Do teenagers who read dystopian stories do so because they are not living a life where danger lurks around every corner? </p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">5. After reading both responses, do the authors agree with each other or disagree over why teenagers read dystopian literature? What lines from the two texts can you find to show that?</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">6.  A dystopia is <a href="//www.readwritethink.org/files/resources/lesson_images/lesson926/DefinitionCharacteristics.pdf">defined by ReadWriteThink</a> (PDF) as &#8220;a futuristic, imagined universe in which oppressive societal control and  the illusion of a perfect society are maintained through corporate, bureaucratic, technological, moral, or totalitarian control. Dystopias, through an exaggerated worst-case scenario, make a criticism about a current trend, societal norm, or political system.&#8221; But dystopian novels, like &#8220;The Hunger Games,&#8221; &#8220;Divergent&#8221; and &#8220;The Maze Runner,&#8221; are some of the most popular novels for teens today. Do you read dystopian fiction?  Why or why not?  Why do you think young people like dystopian fiction so much? Do you think some of them might be too &#8220;dark&#8221; for young people? </p>

<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody"><strong>Connecting &#8220;The Giver&#8221; to Other Dystopian Literature</strong></p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">In 2011, we created a lesson plan based around the Room for Debate forum we&#8217;ve excerpted in this Text to Text.

<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">For instance, students might compare &#8220;The Giver&#8221; with a current dystopian novel to note as many commonalities as they can, or create a dystopian reading list or display (&#8220;If you liked &#8216;The Giver&#8217; you might also like&#8230;&#8221;). Or, they can write their own dystopian stories, or start a dystopian film club. </p>

<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody"><strong>An Ending for &#8220;The Giver&#8221;</strong></p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">When Lois Lowry first wrote &#8220;The Giver,&#8221; she never intended the story to continue. In <a href="//www.nytimes.com/2014/08/03/magazine/lois-lowry-on-giving-up-the-giver-to-hollywood.html">this interview</a>, she explains why she went on to write a series:</p>
<blockquote><p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody"><strong>When you wrote âThe Giver,â you did not plan any sequels. So why did you eventually decide to write three more? </strong></p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">I was somewhat surprised to find that readers â more kids than adults, I think â were distressed by the ambiguity of the ending. I didnât think I needed to think about it anymore, but letters continued to come reminding me that I did. Nowadays it seems as though people sit down to write what they know is going to be a trilogy. I donât know how they know, but it never occurred to me back when I wrote that first book.</p></blockquote>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Does the ambiguity of the ending bother you? Are you glad she continued the story, or do you wish she&#8217;d never written the sequels? When you first finished the book, what did you think might happen to Jonas and Gabriel? Why? How similar were your predictions to &#8220;Gathering Blue,&#8221;  &#8220;The Messenger&#8221; and &#8220;Son&#8221;?</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody"><strong>Memory and Memory Receivers</strong></p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">In a Times essay, <a href="//www.nytimes.com/2013/08/12/booming/the-memory-ladys-daughter-tries-to-fill-the-gaps.html">&#8220;The Memory Ladyâs Daughter Tries to Fill the Gaps,&#8221;</a> Beth Thompson writes about her role in helping her elderly mother &#8212; a wonderful storyteller &#8212; remember her past. Toward the end of the essay she laments:</p>
<blockquote><p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">I care for the generations before and after me. I live the lives of both, and my head is full of names. I donât expect my children will memorize every detail of my life and guard and conserve my memories for me. That is why I prepare myself now. I try to imagine losing my memory, my starkest talent, my most characteristic feature. I try to imagine who I will be without it. I try to imagine myself as my mother, alone without her partner who shared her memory, trying to sweep everything up before it blows away. </p></blockquote>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">What role does memory play for you? In your family? In any of the communities you are a part of? How much of your parents&#8217; stories do you know? What would be lost if, as in &#8220;The Giver,&#8221; those memories were gone?</p>

<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Have you seen the new movie version of &#8220;The Giver&#8221;? The Times critic Manohla Dargis <a href="//www.nytimes.com/2014/08/15/movies/the-giver-adapts-lois-lowrys-novel.html">called</a> it &#8220;an enervating hash of dystopian dread, vague religiosity and commercial advertising-style uplift.&#8221; Do you agree?  If so, why do you think it is so hard to make a movie version of a beloved book that does the book justice? What aspects of the novel do you think the film got right? Where, in your opinion, did it go wrong?</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">You might try your own hand at creating a book trailer for the film. A quick search of YouTube turned up many that students have done over the years at the behest of their English teachers, including <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEDahlr8izs">this one</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLlsUdob9yo">this one</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zCwnrOoFOH4">this one</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6Yovraovwg">this one</a>.
