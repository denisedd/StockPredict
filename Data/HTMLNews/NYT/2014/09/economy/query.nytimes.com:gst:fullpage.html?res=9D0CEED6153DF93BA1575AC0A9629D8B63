                    </p><p class="summary ">By Martin Wolf</p><p class="summary ">Illustrated. 466 pp. Penguin Press. $35.        </p>
                        <p itemprop="articleBody ">
                    Martin Wolf is as grand and important as an economic journalist can ever become. A respected economist in his own right, Wolf has had top-level access to economic policy makers for decades now, seeing generations of finance ministers and central bank governors come and go. All of them care, deeply, about what he thinks and what he writes, and they tend to spend as much time as they can trying to persuade him of their point of view. The result is a classic virtuous cycle: He&#x2019;s well informed because he&#x2019;s extremely influential, and he&#x2019;s influential because he&#x2019;s extremely well informed.        </p>
                        <p itemprop="articleBody ">
                    In the wake of the financial crisis, Wolf has become an even rarer beast: the highly influential radical. His is the loudest and foremost voice saying that the global policy response to the crisis was far too timid; that it all but ensures we will have an even worse crisis down the road; and that unless we start implementing extreme measures today, we will be running headlong into catastrophe.        </p>
                        <p itemprop="articleBody ">
                    For his change of stance alone, Wolf, the chief economics commentator for The Financial Times, deserves a great deal of credit. Public intellectuals too often feel their views need to remain consistent over time; Wolf is honest and brave enough to say that his pre-crisis views were wrong. Even though he wholeheartedly embraced the financial-liberalization policies of the Thatcher years, and subsequently wrote a book entitled &#x201C;Why Globalization Works,&#x201D; he now concludes that &#x201C;the interaction between liberalization and globalization has destabilized the financial system.&#x201D; The crisis, Wolf says, &#x201C;was no ordinary economic event&#x201D;: &#x201C;To pretend that one can return to the intellectual and policy-making status quo ante is profoundly mistaken.&#x201D;        </p>
                        <p itemprop="articleBody ">
                    Wolf splits his new book, &#x201C;The Shifts and the Shocks,&#x201D; into three sections. The first is an economist&#x2019;s history of the financial crisis (&#x201C;the shocks&#x201D;); the second is a broader view of the global economic conditions that helped cause the crisis (&#x201C;the shifts&#x201D;); the third is a series of prescriptions for how we might prevent such a calamity from ever happening again (&#x201C;the solutions&#x201D;). In all three sections, expect a lot of econo-&#xAD;wonkery and almost no narrative: You&#x2019;ll find precious few human protagonists here.        </p>
                        <p itemprop="articleBody ">
                    Wolf doesn&#x2019;t tell a story so much as rattle off lists of economic phenomena, and the result is not easy to read. Here, for instance, is a typical sentence:        </p>
                        <p itemprop="articleBody ">
                    &#x201C;With the eurozone in internal and external balance and creditor eurozone seeking internal balance via ever-&#xAD;larger external imbalances in the form of current-&#xAD;account surpluses, debtor eurozone could only attain internal balance with ever-&#xAD;larger external imbalances in the form of current-account deficits.&#x201D;        </p>
                        <p itemprop="articleBody ">
                    Wolf is very fond of such wonkish econo-&#xAD;tautologies: &#x201C;If domestic output is to be sufficient to generate full utilization of capacity, aggregate demand must exceed domestic output by the size of the current-&#xAD;account deficit, at full employment,&#x201D; he explains at one point.        </p>
                        <p itemprop="articleBody ">
                    Given a choice between precision and ease of understanding, Wolf will always choose precision, talking about countries&#x2019;  &#x201C;net external liability position&#x201D; (instead of &#x201C;national debt&#x201D;) on one page, and their &#x201C;real unit labor costs&#x201D; (instead of &#x201C;wages&#x201D;) on the next. He&#x2019;s also fond of repeating himself:        </p>
                        <p itemprop="articleBody ">
                    &#x201C;Friedman&#x2019;s view emphasized not the price of money (the interest rate), but its quantity. He was a quantity theorist in the tradition of Irving Fisher: He argued that what mattered was not the price of money, the rate of interest, but its quantity, the stock of money. Friedman believed that the rate of interest does not tell one whether monetary policy is loose or not. Only the rate of growth of the money supply does that.&#x201D;        </p>
                        <p itemprop="articleBody ">
                    You need to be a very devoted Wolf fan to wade through hundreds of pages of such material. And, at least for the first two-thirds of the book, the rewards for doing so are meager. After all, if you&#x2019;re educated and sophisticated enough to know what &#x201C;nonfactor services&#x201D; are, you probably know already what happened to the global economy during the crisis.        </p>
                        <p itemprop="articleBody ">
                    Still, the first two sections do present a reasonably clear worldview. Wolf paints a picture of a global economy being wrecked both by freedom of capital &#x2014; trillions of dollars flowing to areas where such sums can end up causing tremendous harm &#x2014; and by the imprisonment of 18 European countries in a fixed currency system that robs them of setting their own monetary policy. It&#x2019;s a worldview in which central bankers, rather than their commercial brethren, are the people who really determine whether the world crashes and burns: The Jamie Dimons simply end up acting in accordance with the incentives that the Alan Greenspans put in place. Indeed, while Wolf talks only in vague terms about punishing &#x201C;guilty&#x201D; bankers, without naming any names, he is happy to berate Ben Bernanke, by name, in the harshest terms. In 2007, Wolf writes, Bernanke &#x201C;was almost clueless&#x201D; about the coming catastrophe, and one of Bernanke&#x2019;s speeches before the crisis was &#x201C;complacent, indeed vainglorious.&#x201D; (The feeling isn&#x2019;t mutual: Bernanke has happily provided a glowing blurb for the book.)        </p>
                                                <p itemprop="articleBody ">
                    Wolf may have a central banker&#x2019;s technocratic soul and deeply rooted fluency in economics, but he also has withering scorn for what central bankers have wrought. &#x201C;The view that stabilizing inflation was a sufficient condition for economic stability has been proved grotesquely wrong,&#x201D; he writes. &#x201C;The truth is the opposite.&#x201D; In a world in which it&#x2019;s largely taken for granted that the job of a central bank is to keep inflation low, Wolf persuasively argues that central banks should target a much higher rate of inflation, noting that, in the eurozone, &#x201C;inflation of 3 to 4 percent a year would not be a disaster&#x201D; and would actually be very helpful in terms of getting the European economy back on its feet.        </p>
                        <p itemprop="articleBody ">
                    And that&#x2019;s not the most radical thing Wolf wants central bankers to do. Modern banks hold just a small fraction of their deposits in cash. But Wolf, finding that fractional-reserve banking was a key cause of the financial crisis, says all banks should have much higher capital requirements, and then goes much further: He spends a lot of time describing an economy in which banks have to back up all their deposits with reserves held at the central bank. Such a system, he says, is &#x201C;definitely an experiment worth making.&#x201D; As Wolf puts it, &#x201C;No industry should have the capacity to inflict economic costs that may even surpass those of a world war.&#x201D;        </p>
                        <p itemprop="articleBody ">
                    &#x201C;The Shifts and the Shocks&#x201D; is extremely good at untangling the causes of the global financial crisis, and Wolf does have at least one eye on practical matters: He says the French economist Thomas Piketty&#x2019;s recommendation of a global wealth tax &#x201C;is unquestionably too ambitious.&#x201D; Yet Wolf&#x2019;s own recommendations are more ambitious still. They include attempts to prevent corporations from accumulating cash; an end to the tax-deductibility of interest payments; a scaling back of international banks in a global &#x201C;financial disintegration&#x201D;; a mass refinancing of European sovereign debt into eurobonds, payable jointly and severally by all eurozone nations; a radical change in debt contracts to make them much more equitylike; and, of course, that idea about abolishing &#xAD;fractional-reserve banking, which would give governments the job of directly creating all the money in the economy.        </p>
                        <p itemprop="articleBody ">
                    None of these prescriptions are really fleshed out. Wolf&#x2019;s chapter on the future of the eurozone is the best in the book, but even on Europe his measures can be irritatingly skeletal: &#x201C;Some time after the crisis is over,&#x201D; he writes, &#x201C;consideration might be given to a partial breakup of what has proved an enormously costly arrangement.&#x201D; Who might do the considering, and how they might be able to consider such a thing without precipitating a continentwide panic, he doesn&#x2019;t say.&#x2029;        </p>
                        <p itemprop="articleBody ">
                    Wolf is, ultimately, too grand and important, too close to too many policy makers, to be a true radical. He certainly tries to walk the walk: His final chapter, &#x201C;Fire Next Time,&#x201D; includes a section headed &#x201C;What Is to Be Done?&#x201D; The references are to James Baldwin and Vladimir Ilyich Lenin, respectively. But in the book&#x2019;s concluding paragraph, he feels the need to pull his punches: For all that the safety of the global economy &#x201C;will require more radicalism than most recognize,&#x201D; such changes will have to be made &#x201C;without eliminating those aspects of an open world economy and integrated finance that are of benefit.&#x201D; It&#x2019;s an escape hatch big enough to fit a dozen helicopters &#x2014; and Wolf knows it.        </p>
                        <p itemprop="articleBody ">
                    Which is why, despite Wolf&#x2019;s attempts to don the garb of a revolutionary, this book is actually something more familiar, and more depressing: a wonkish eschatology of how the global economy, and Europe&#x2019;s in particular, is doomed. If Wolf&#x2019;s prescriptions aren&#x2019;t followed, he says, &#x201C;further crises seem certain,&#x201D; erupting again and again, &#x201C;until governments are no longer able to prevent some kind of fiscal or monetary collapse.&#x201D; And it&#x2019;s the collapse, not the revolution, that is Wolf&#x2019;s base-case scenario. His final words? &#x201C;Our open world economy could end in the fire.&#x201D;        </p>
