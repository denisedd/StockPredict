            <p class="paragraph paragraph-5">Outsiders, he explained, simply need to be educated out of their fear of fracking: &#x201C;There is a way to explain it that really relaxes people, that makes them understand this is not a dangerous thing that we&#x2019;re doing out here, that it&#x2019;s really very well managed and very safe and really the key to the future of not only North Dakota but really our entire nation.&#x201D;</p>


            


            


            

            

            

            

            


            



            



            


            



            




            




            

            
            



        

            <p class="paragraph paragraph-6">Tioga, population 3,000, welcomed North Dakota&#x2019;s first well in 1951, more than a half-century before hydraulic fracturing liberated the &#x201C;tight oil&#x201D; trapped in the Bakken shale formation. So it was fitting that Tioga ring in the daily production milestone that had ushered the Bakken into the rarefied company of historic oil fields worldwide.</p>


            


            


            

            

            

            

            


            



            



            


            



            




            




            

            
            



        

            <p class="paragraph paragraph-7">But Tioga also claims another record: what is considered the largest on-land oil spill in recent American history. And only Brenda Jorgenson, 61, who attended &#x201C;to hear what does not get said,&#x201D; mentioned that one, sotto voce.</p>

            <p class="paragraph paragraph-8">The million-barrel bash was devoid of protesters save for Ms. Jorgenson, a tall, slender grandmother who has two wells at her driveway&#x2019;s end and three jars in her refrigerator containing blackened water that she said came from her faucet during the fracking process. She did not, however, utter a contrary word.</p>


            


            


            

            

            

            

            


            



            



            


            



            




            




            

            
            



        

            <p class="paragraph paragraph-9">&#x201C;I&#x2019;m not that brave (or stupid) to protest among that,&#x201D; she said in an email afterward. &#x201C;I&#x2019;ve said it before: we&#x2019;re outgunned, outnumbered and out-suited.&#x201D;</p>


            


            


            

            

            

            

            


            



            



            


            



            




            




            

            
            



        

            <p class="paragraph paragraph-10">North Dakotans do not like to make a fuss. Until recently, those few who dared to challenge the brisk pace of oil development, the perceived laxity of government oversight or the despoliation of farmland were treated as killjoys. They were ignored, ridiculed, threatened, and paid settlements in exchange for silence.</p>


            


            


            

            

            

            

            


            



            



            


            



            




            




            

            
            



        

            <p class="paragraph paragraph-11">But over the past year and some, the dynamic seemed to be shifting.</p>


            


            


            

            

            

            

            


            



            



            


            



            




            




            

            
            



        

            <p class="paragraph paragraph-12">Satellite photos of western North Dakota at night, aglitter like a metropolis with lighted rigs and burning flares, crystallized its rapid transformation from tight-knit agricultural society to semi-industrialized oil powerhouse. Proposals to drill near historic places generated heated opposition. The giant oil spill in Tioga in September 2013 frightened people, as did the explosion months later of a derailed oil train, which sent black smoke mushrooming over a snowy plain.</p>

            <p class="paragraph paragraph-18">As a boy in the 1950s, Mr. Schwalbe scampered up and down the steep banks of Corral Creek, which flows from Killdeer Mountain into the Little Missouri River. His family homestead lay in the remote region where Theodore Roosevelt sought solitude in what he called the &#x201C;desolate, grim beauty&#x201D; of the Badlands.</p>


            


            


            

            

            

            

            


            



            



            


            



            




            




            

            
            



        

            <p class="paragraph paragraph-19">Like many in his generation, Mr. Schwalbe took for granted the craggy buttes and rippling grasslands, the cottonwoods and poplars, the mule deer and mountain lions. He never anticipated a day when this singular landscape would be ravaged, in his view, by rigs, pumping units, waste pits and pipelines and when he would become an archetypal North Dakotan of a certain age, disheartened by what others saw as progress.</p>


            


            


            

            

            

            

            


            



            



            


            



            




            




            

            
            



        

            <p class="paragraph paragraph-20">As he helped his father run cattle 11,000 feet above the Bakken formation, Mr. Schwalbe came to understand that the family ranch would never sustain his parents and their six adult children. After college, he settled in eastern North Dakota, returning home mostly for &#x201C;brandings, hunting and holidays.&#x201D;</p>

            <p class="paragraph paragraph-21">When their father died, five Schwalbe siblings &#x2014; David, Dennis, Donnie, Donnette and Dale &#x2014; sold their shares of the ranch to their brother Delry. All six kept their rights to what lay beneath the surface, however. Just in case.</p>


            


            


            

            

            

            

            


            



            



            


            



            




            




            

            
            



        

            <p class="paragraph paragraph-22">The Schwalbes were following the lead of Burlington Northern Railroad, which once owned every other tract in the area, the legacy of a federal land grant. The railroad eventually sold the surface but retained the minerals, which were managed by its energy company, Burlington Resources, now a subsidiary of ConocoPhillips.</p>

            <p class="paragraph paragraph-24">Land has long been sliced and diced in North Dakota from generation to generation, with surface ownership severed from the ownership of underlying minerals like coal and oil. Given that mineral rights trump surface rights, this made many residents of western North Dakota feel trampled once the boom began.</p>

            <p class="paragraph paragraph-30">On June 20, 2011, the Schwalbes received a letter informing them that Burlington Resources intended to forge a 30,883.94-acre oil production unit that would effectively override their lease agreement with Marathon and subsume their mineral property. In the Bakken, such units are typically 1,280 acres.</p>


            


            


            

            

            

            

            


            



            



            


            



            




            




            

            
            



        

            <p class="paragraph paragraph-31">The Schwalbes were instructed to sign a ratification agreement by August, when a hearing was scheduled on what some started calling &#x201C;the mega-unit.&#x201D; The mega-unit would include the Little Missouri State Park, a patchwork of private, state and federal land beloved for its rugged trails.</p>


            


            


            

            

            

            

            


            



            



            


            



            




            




            

            
            



        

            <p class="paragraph paragraph-32">Initially perplexed by the thick document on their doorstep, the Schwalbes soon grasped a painful point: though they would be ceding control of their mineral property, their consent was not required. Only the owners of 60 percent of the unit&#x2019;s minerals were needed for ratification, and Burlington, together with the federal government, already met that goal.</p>

            <p class="paragraph paragraph-35">As ConocoPhillips officials explained at the August hearing, they aimed to maximize oil recovery by being freed of the &#x201C;artificial boundary lines&#x201D; that require 200-foot setbacks from the borders of each standard production unit. Their plan would allow for 23 more wells; for 73,000 more barrels of oil per well; and for consolidated production that would reduce &#x201C;surface disturbance,&#x201D; truck traffic and air pollution. It was a proposal &#x201C;for the common good,&#x201D; they said.</p>

            <p class="paragraph paragraph-37">In normal units, oil leases expire after a set time if no drilling occurs and owners can then renegotiate on better terms or put them up for bid. But under the proposed unit, Mr. Fettig said, &#x201C;You wouldn&#x2019;t have to drill one additional well to hold all the acreage here theoretically for a very long period of time.&#x201D;</p>


            


            


            

            

            

            

            


            



            



            


            



            




            




            

            
            



        

            <p class="paragraph paragraph-38">He worried, too, he said, that Burlington would have unfettered access to a nearly 50-square-mile area and be able to situate well pads, roads and gathering pipelines without having to negotiate easements or rights of way.</p>


            


            


            

            

            

            

            


            



            



            


            



            




            




            

            
            



        

            <p class="paragraph paragraph-39">&#x201C;Mr. Fettig, you&#x2019;re not an engineer, are you?&#x201D; a lawyer for Burlington asked him. &#x201C;You&#x2019;re not a geologist?&#x201D;</p>


            


            


            

            

            

            

            


            



            



            


            



            




            




            

            
            



        

            <p class="paragraph paragraph-40">&#x201C;I&#x2019;m not a lawyer, either,&#x201D; Mr. Fettig replied.</p>


            


            


            

            

            

            

            


            



            



            


            



            




            




            

            
            



        

            <p class="paragraph paragraph-41">Mr. Schwalbe&#x2019;s lawyers cautioned that he would see a significant drop in his monthly checks, as his royalties would be shared with all the mineral owners in the mega-unit, including ConocoPhillips itself. Down the road, he could recoup that loss, and then some, when wells were developed elsewhere in the unit. But he worried that if, say, oil prices dropped, he would not see that income in his lifetime.</p>


            


            


            

            

            

            

            


            



            



            


            



            




            




            

            
            



        

            <p class="paragraph paragraph-42">Before the hearing, Mr. Schwalbe had approached Lynn D. Helms, director of the state&#x2019;s Department of Mineral Resources, with a compromise: unitize the property in phases to be fairer to the owners of the dozen existing wells.</p>


            


            


            

            

            

            

            


            



            



            


            



            




            




            

            
            



        

            <p class="paragraph paragraph-43">&#x201C;I realize in the overall scope of things, my check is pretty small, but it&#x2019;s got a Social Security check beat all to hell,&#x201D; Mr. Schwalbe said at the hearing. &#x201C;I&#x2019;m hoping with the help of the commission this can be worked out equitably for everybody.&#x201D;</p>


            


            


            

            

            

            

            


            



            



            


            



            




            




            

            
            



        

            <p class="paragraph paragraph-44">Mr. Helms ultimately executes the policies of the three elected officials &#x2014; the governor, attorney general and agriculture commissioner, all Republicans &#x2014; who make up the North Dakota Industrial Commission, which regulates the oil and gas industry. Yet at their monthly meetings, he guides them calmly from vote to vote and rarely encounters dissent. A review by The New York Times of meeting minutes since 2011 found no failed motions concerning oil and gas.</p>


            


            


            

            

            

            

            


            



            



            


            



            




            




            

            
            



        

            <p class="paragraph paragraph-45">&#x201C;You feel as if the meetings are a performance, that everything&#x2019;s sort of done under the table, with a lot of back-room deals,&#x201D; said Wayde Schafer, the Sierra Club&#x2019;s sole employee in North Dakota.</p>


            


            


            

            

            

            

            


            



            



            


            



            




            




            

            
            



        

            <p class="paragraph paragraph-46">Private citizens were not the only ones concerned about the mega-unit. &#x201C;Before we get all up in arms about it, we have a few questions about what the proposal is and if it is going to benefit us or not,&#x201D; a state land official wrote to a state oil official in October 2011. &#x201C;One of the things that has got us so upset is that they are playing this off as a &#x2018;done deal.&apos;&#x2009;&#x201D;</p>


            


            


            

            

            

            

            


            



            



            


            



            




            




            

            
            



        

            <p class="paragraph paragraph-47">It is essentially a done deal, the oil official responded, saying he expected an order at the Nov. 21 commission meeting would &#x201C;dispose of this case.&#x201D;</p>

During the long discussion that followed, the park was barely mentioned, though Mr. Helms did note that the development called for no tank batteries inside it.</p>

            <p class="paragraph paragraph-97">The current governor is better known for his business acumen than his rhetoric. John Stewart Dalrymple III, 66, is something of a patrician, a rarity in North Dakota. His state biography says he grew up &#x201C;on the family farm in Casselton,&#x201D; N.D., but he was born in Minneapolis and attended a private day school there before boarding at St. Paul&#x2019;s School in New Hampshire and going on to Yale, like his father before him.</p>


            


            


            

            

            

            

            


            



            



            


            



            




            




            

            
            



        

            <p class="paragraph paragraph-98">The 140-year-old family farm once stretched over 32,000 acres, making it &#x201C;the largest cultivated farm in the world,&#x201D; according to North Dakota State University archives. More recently, Dalrymple Farms has been one of the state&#x2019;s largest recipients of federal commodity subsidies.</p>


            


            


            

            

            

            

            


            



            



            


            



            




            




            

            
            



        

            <p class="paragraph paragraph-99">Mr. Dalrymple was more of an agribusinessman than the typical North Dakota farmer: &#x201C;I&#x2019;m not saying he never greased a combine, but his farm office was in the National Bank building in Casselton and he&#x2019;d wear a white shirt to work,&#x201D; said Bill Patrie, a specialist in rural cooperatives who worked with Mr. Dalrymple to establish a farmer-owned pasta co-op.</p>


            


            


            

            

            

            

            


            



            



            


            



            




            




            

            
            



        

            <p class="paragraph paragraph-100">Mr. Dalrymple served as co-op chairman through eight years in the legislature and a decade as lieutenant governor. While lieutenant governor, he championed the cooperative&#x2019;s conversion to an investor-owned firm in which he was a major shareholder, and then oversaw its sale to a Canadian conglomerate, making $3.77 million.</p>

            <p class="paragraph paragraph-104">Many Democrats were incensed when Edward T. Schafer, a Republican former governor, toured the state in an oil industry-sponsored &#x201C;Fix the Tax&#x201D; bus in 2011, arguing that oil taxes should be lowered to prevent the boom from going bust. The effort failed; afterward, Mr. Schafer was named to the board of Continental Resources, and awarded a compensation package, mostly stock, valued at $700,000 that year.</p>

            <p class="paragraph paragraph-122">At the entrance to the mega-unit, on the dirt access road built for the hundreds of trucks that now traverse what used to be pristine pastures, Mr. Schwalbe&#x2019;s cousin, Candyce Kleemann, sat at the wheel of her pickup, photographs on her dashboard.</p>


            


            


            

            

            

            

            


            



            



            


            



            




            




            

            
            



        

            <p class="paragraph paragraph-123">&#x201C;These are the before pictures: before the invasion,&#x201D; said Ms. Kleemann, who lives and ranches inside the unit. &#x201C;When we fought the unit, they told us there would be minimal damage or changes. But it&#x2019;s a different landscape. Look, that&#x2019;s our new saltwater injection well.&#x201D;</p>


            


            


            

            

            

            

            


            



            



            


            



            




            




            

            
            



        

            <p class="paragraph paragraph-124">She pointed to a sign: &#x201C;Danger: H2S. Poisonous gas.&#x201D; And to another: &#x201C;Caution: power lines.&#x201D; Her own sign, proclaiming her land to be private property, made her snort.</p>


            


            


            

            

            

            

            


            



            



            


            



            




            




            

            
            



        

            <p class="paragraph paragraph-125">&#x201C;That one&#x2019;s useless,&#x201D; she said. &#x201C;We&#x2019;re even more powerless than surface owners in the rest of the oil patch. In this unit, oil can go wherever they want here, put roads and gathering lines wherever they want, bury crud in our ground. The state does not seem to care.&#x201D;</p>


            


            


            

            

            

            

            


            



            



            


            



            




            




            

            
            



        

            <p class="paragraph paragraph-126">In 2012, Ms. Kleemann&#x2019;s husband, Robert, a Dunn County commissioner, complained to the state that the unit development plan was being modified, putting 11 wells within a half-mile of six homes.</p>


            


            


            

            

            

            

            


            



            



            


            



            




            




            

            
            



        

            <p class="paragraph paragraph-127">When an official responded that the changes appeared necessary for topographical reasons, Mr. Kleemann wrote back, &#x201C;I do not think you could understand our concerns unless we could put a drilling rig on each side of your house so you could listen to the clang of pipes, the roar of motors, the constant beep of the horn and be awakened in the morning to the driller giving orders over the bullhorn and you could try to sleep with the constant noise of Jake Brakes.&#x201D;</p>

            <p class="paragraph paragraph-128">State officials were more concerned that ConocoPhillips was not developing the unit as aggressively as promised. Now the pace has picked up, with several dozen wells drilled in 2013 and several dozen more this year.</p>


            


            


            

            

            

            

            


            



            



            


            



            




            




            

            
            



        

            <p class="paragraph paragraph-129">In April, when the Schwalbes laid out their concerns to two F.B.I. agents in a windowless room in the Fargo federal building, they felt encouraged. The agents seemed apprehensive &#x201C;because of the individual involved,&#x201D; Mr. Schwalbe said, but gradually &#x201C;their interest was piqued.&#x201D;</p>


            


            


            

            

            

            

            


            



            



            


            



            




            




            

            
            



        

            <p class="paragraph paragraph-130">&#x201C;They thanked us for coming forward,&#x201D; he said afterward, surprised.</p>


            


            


            

            

            

            

            


            



            



            


            



            




            




            

            
            



        

            <p class="paragraph paragraph-131">In the summer, though, a final meeting with the agents left them disheartened. The investigation remained open, they were told, but prosecutors saw no federal case to be made.</p>


            


            


            

            

            

            

            


            



            



            


            



            




            




            

            
            



        

            <p class="paragraph paragraph-132">Mr. Schwalbe, who had wagered that &#x201C;this year is going to be better because people are starting to get mad,&#x201D; was disappointed by the November elections, too.</p>


            


            


            

            

            

            

            


            



            



            


            



            




            




            

            
            



        

            <p class="paragraph paragraph-133">His wife&#x2019;s former running mate, Mr. Taylor, ran again, this time for agriculture commissioner, proposing that oil well setbacks from homes be increased to a quarter-mile from 500 feet and that pipelines be fitted with antispill devices. But he lost, as did a ballot initiative to set aside tax revenues for conservation. With considerable oil industry backing, the agriculture commissioner was re-elected, as was the attorney general, extending the mandate of the current Industrial Commission.</p>


            


            


            

            

            

            

            


            



            



            


            



            




            




            

            
            



        

            <p class="paragraph paragraph-134">Mr. Schwalbe does not like to visit Corral Creek anymore. The landscape is, in his eyes, scarred, the tranquillity spoiled. His new outspokenness led him into an uncharacteristic public role as spokesman for a new group, North Dakota Rural Voters.</p>


            


            


            

            

            

            

            


            



            



            


            



            




            




            

            
            



        

            <p class="paragraph paragraph-135">&#x201C;I never thought I&#x2019;d be involved in anything like this,&#x201D; he said. &#x201C;At my age, I thought we&#x2019;d just slide through the rest of our lives. But at a certain point, it became a point of pride for me personally and me as a North Dakotan. I don&#x2019;t like people taking things that don&#x2019;t belong to them, not my money, not my property, not my state.&#x201D;</p>

          <strong> Correction: Nov. 27, 2014 </strong> <br/>
          <p>An article on Monday about the politics surrounding an unusual land deal in the North Dakota oil country described incorrectly, in some editions, a redistricting plan that eliminated the State Senate seat of Ryan Taylor, a Democrat who ran against Gov. Jack Dalrymple in 2012. Mr. Taylor&#8217;s seat was eliminated in late 2011, as he was preparing to announce his candidacy, not after he lost the election the following November.</p>
