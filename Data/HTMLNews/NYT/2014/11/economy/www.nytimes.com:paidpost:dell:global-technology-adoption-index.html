Indeed, across key emerging technologies &#x2014; including cloud, big data and mobility &#x2014; security woes appear to be a drag on new investment. </p> <p> This is the main finding of the inaugural Dell Global Technology Adoption Index, which set out to assess how often-overlooked midsize companies &#x2014; organizations with 100 to 5,000 employees &#x2014; are adapting these technologies to spur growth. </p> <div class="moreBtn" id="SecurityArticle">READ MORE <div id="plus"> +</div> </div> <p> The research involved thousands of interviews with senior managers and information-technology decision-makers from 11 countries, ranging from emerging markets to wealthy economies. The state of security that emerged reveals that most companies must make significant strides in preparedness to improve their chances of thwarting attacks. Among the findings: </p> <img class="security-graphic web-visible" src="https://paidpost-assets.nyt.com/paidpost/dell/global-technology-adoption-index/images/Dell_Security_rg.svg" alt=""> <!-- <ul> <li>A majority (76 percent) admitted they lack response plans for every kind of data breach.</li> <li>Most respondents (60 percent) reported that only some end users understood company security rules.</li> <li>Just 36 percent confirmed they know how to measure security system effectiveness fully.</li> <li>And 37 percent said compliance required greater focus than defending against hackers.</li> </ul> --> <p> When treated as a constructive investment, security upgrades can allow companies to confidently adapt new technology. When viewed as a costly chore, however, dealing with security risks can raise anxiety levels among key decision-makers and delay the pursuit of innovations that may otherwise boost productivity, improve customer experience and lift the bottom line. </p> <p> Indeed, when asked what was stopping companies from adopting big data and cloud solutions, doubts about data security ranked high. Those trepidations were identified by 44 percent of decision-makers who were asked about barriers to expanding mobile programs. Fear of a data breach easily topped the list, trumping the perennial challenge of scarce financial resources. </p> <blockquote>Across key emerging technologies &#x2014; including cloud, big data and mobility &#x2014; security woes appear to be a drag on new investment.</blockquote> <p> &#x201C;Yes, security worries may, at first blush, put a damper on tech investment. Yet for midsize companies willing to commit, this barrier can be transformed into an opportunity, driving out the fear and doubt that would otherwise impede a forward-leaning embrace of those very technologies that can bring about their next level of growth,&#x201D; said John McClurg, vice president of global security at Dell. &#x201C;Smart security investment can trigger a cascade of further technological gains that, in turn, can open up a competitive lead.&#x201D; </p> <p> Confidence in the next-generation firewalls used by Amerijet encouraged the Florida-based freight carrier in July to place its cargo management system in a private cloud, said Jennifer Torlone, the company&#x2019;s senior director of technology and information services. </p> <p> She credits the shift with simplifying and accelerating the process of opening remote offices around the world. Before the move, it took a new office at least 90 days to become fully functional. This summer, Amerijet opened 11 offices in only a week, she said. </p> <p> &#x201C;Because of the technology we have in the data center, we can be more flexible,&#x201D; Torlone explained. </p> <div class="divider-bottom"></div> </div> </div> <!--article --> </div> <a name="cloud"></a> <div id="cloudSectionWrap"> <div id="cloud" data-id="16" data-emit-events="" class="cloud-section-question viz-section slide"></div> <div class="cloud-section-article content-section slide" data-emit-events=""> <div class="dell-article center"> <div class="article-title-bar"> <h1 class="heading">Cloud</h1> <h1 class="subheading">REVOLUTION UNDERWAY</h1> <div class="divider"></div> </div> <img class="cloud-graphic mobile-visible" src="https://paidpost-assets.nyt.com/paidpost/dell/global-technology-adoption-index/images/Dell_11-03-14_Cloud_M_IB.svg" alt=""> <p> A bespoke mapping service helped organizers of the London Summer Olympics ensure that practically all aspects of the event went off without a hitch. The solution not only helped the games go smoothly, it was also a boon to the tech startup that made it. For PIE, the small company behind the service, the risk of taking on such as a large project paid off with a wave of new business. </p> <p> But sudden success also pushed the organization right up against an all-too-common capacity constraint. The on-premise digital infrastructure that underpinned PIE&#x2019;s Olympics operation wasn&#x2019;t suitable for the company&#x2019;s new business strategy &#x2014; an approach that hinged on the ability to scale and handle more dynamic data, said Freddie Talberg, the company&#x2019;s chief executive. </p> <div class="moreBtn" id="CloudArticle">READ MORE <div id="plus"> +</div> </div> <img class="cloud-graphic web-visible" src="https://paidpost-assets.nyt.com/paidpost/dell/global-technology-adoption-index/images/Dell_Cloud_rg.svg" alt=""> <p> A decision to expand key infrastructure and processing into the cloud helped PIE survive these growing pains. Today, the London-based company is on course to scale up more quickly, by providing its mapping services as a software service via the cloud. </p> <p> PIE&#x2019;s fast transformation, from proprietary operations to cloud-based services, might suggest that most industry leaders have a firm grasp on the cloud and all of its benefits. After all, most midsize businesses are using the cloud. Yet independent research commissioned by Dell found that, unlike PIE, most midsize firms aren&#x2019;t getting all that they can from the technology. </p> <p> More than three quarters of the tech decision-makers surveyed for the Dell Global Technology Adoption Index said their companies do not yet use the cloud to: </p> <ul> <li>Implement new business models.</li> <li>Bring products to market faster.</li> <li>Target and attract new customers.</li> </ul> <h2> Reasons for adoption </h2> <p> How the cloud became so popular among midsize businesses appears to come down to practicality. The largest share of respondents, just over one third, said the cloud was simply the &#x201C;best fit&#x201D; when asked why they decided to adopt it. </p> <blockquote>A decision to expand key infrastructure and processing into the cloud helped PIE survive [its] growing pains.</blockquote> <p> But competitive pressure is also driving the shift. Companies in developing nations are most likely to be motivated by a desire to be first to adopt cloud services. While 16 percent of respondents globally cited early adoption for getting into the cloud, 27 percent of firms in India cited that as their priority. Brazil and China are close behind, at 20 percent. Most new companies in emerging markets lack the capital access that&#x2019;s seen in the developed world, making cloud services&#x2019; lower up-front price tag more alluring. </p> <h2> Security fears </h2> <p> But for all of the cloud&#x2019;s promise &#x2014; from lower costs to flexibility of deployment &#x2014; worries over data security remain a major barrier. </p> <p> Adoption has advanced quickly, yet 21 percent of companies surveyed have yet to commit to the technology. And while most are considering it, the fear over a data breach is the main factor holding them back, the index shows. </p> <p> A U.S. executive in the hospitality industry captured the concerns of many holdouts. In responding to the survey, he cited &#x201C;susceptibility to interruption by hacker threats&#x201D; as the main reason for his company&#x2019;s &#x201C;wait-and-see&#x201D; approach. </p> <p> These firms will want to figure it out, said William Fellows, a cloud analyst at 451 Research. Employees have made it clear that they&#x2019;re going to work in the cloud &#x2014; whether to access email, to facilitate video conferencing, or simply share big files &#x2014; irrespective of company policy. This grassroots demand is forcing companies to open the door to sanctioned apps so employees aren&#x2019;t tempted to store company data in clouds managed by others. </p> <p> &#x201C;The range of things going on &#x2014; like Dropbox, with sync being the new save &#x2014; shows there&#x2019;s definitely a need,&#x201D; Fellows said. </p> <p> Attitudes toward the cloud&#x2019;s safety vary by region. Globally 49 percent of non-users cited security when asked why their company hasn&#x2019;t moved forward. Yet in Europe, 60 percent of executives &#x2014; more than any other area &#x2014; are similarly unconvinced. Regulations on the continent requiring in-country data storage may also be compounding Europe&#x2019;s slower adoption of cloud services. </p> <p> While a minority of companies report strong doubts about cloud security, those who have migrated to the cloud are generally upbeat. Among current cloud users, all but a few report they are confident in the security measures they had in place &#x2014; whether their networks were private, public or hybrid. </p> <p> Strong evidence of impenetrability is what Talberg from PIE wanted to see before investing in his company&#x2019;s first cloud, a private one built by Dell. &#x201C;They&#x2019;ve given us all the test evidence,&#x201D; he said. &#x201C;It was really about getting the assurance.&#x201D; </p> <div class="divider-bottom"></div> </div> </div> <!--article --> </div> <a name="mobility"></a> <div id="mobilitySectionWrap"> <div id="mobility" data-id="34" data-emit-events="" class="mobility-section-question viz-section slide"></div> <div class="mobility-section-article content-section slide" data-emit-events=""> <div class="dell-article center"> <div class="article-title-bar"> <h1 class="heading">Mobility</h1> <h1 class="subheading">TURNING POINT</h1> <div class="divider"></div> </div> <img class="mobile-graphic mobile-visible" src="https://paidpost-assets.nyt.com/paidpost/dell/global-technology-adoption-index/images/Dell_11-03-14_Mobile_M_IB.svg" alt=""> <p> It might seem incongruous, but in terms of making mobile technology integral to everyday business, companies in emerging markets are outpacing their ostensibly deeper-pocketed competitors in wealthier regions </p> <p> The finding, captured by Dell in a rare look at midsize companies, should not suggest a lack of awareness of mobility&#x2019;s promise. Rather, many companies are stymied by the challenge of managing security. </p> <div class="moreBtn" id="MobilityArticle">READ MORE <div id="plus"> +</div> </div> <img class="mobile-graphic web-visible" src="https://paidpost-assets.nyt.com/paidpost/dell/global-technology-adoption-index/images/Dell_Mobile_rg.svg" alt=""> <p> The Dell Global Technology Adoption Index found that less than half of the info-tech decision-makers interviewed would describe their company&#x2019;s mobile strategy as &#x201C;strategic and aligned with business goals.&#x201D; Results from the same self-assessment conducted in emerging markets were markedly more positive. </p> <h2> From laggards to leaders </h2> <p> How China, India and Mexico managed to leapfrog the United States and much of the developed world in folding mobility into daily operations comes down to a lack of landline connections in those countries. </p> <p> As mobile carriers came online, consumers in emerging markets quickly bought up cell phones. For burgeoning local companies, this made possible a different kind of communications ecosystem, unburdened by the need to transition from wired to wireless. </p> <blockquote>&#x201C;It&#x2019;s 2014, and we&#x2019;re still using passwords. That&#x2019;s ridiculous.&#x201D; &#x2014; Bob O&#x2019;Donnell, founder of TECHnalysis Research</blockquote> <p> Thus companies in emerging markets can avoid much of the costs of cabling and connecting phone and data networks. Indeed, they also often count on employees to supply their own gear, embracing bring-your-own-device &#x2014; or BYOD &#x2014; programs rather than restraining workers&#x2019; use of their personal technology. </p> <p> &#x201C;If you don&#x2019;t have to deal with legacy, it makes your life significantly easier,&#x201D; said Bob O&#x2019;Donnell, founder and chief analyst of TECHnalysis Research. &#x201C;It&#x2019;s the legacy problem that complicates all of these transitions.&#x201D; </p> <p> Companies in Latin America and Asia, for example, appear to be spending a relative pittance on device hardware, as executives in those countries reported having the fewest company-owned smartphones, tablets and computers. </p> <p> While U.S. firms recognize the bottom-line benefits of these BYOD strategies, they remain wary because of security threats. A liberal BYOD policy can, after all, put an organization at higher risk if data becomes easier to access by hackers. </p> <p> Focusing too much on BYOD may also detract from other aspects of mobility. Companies that can successfully develop and publish custom mobile apps, for instance, will have a greater chance of extending the capabilities of everyday business software, opening up anytime, anyplace access. </p> <h2> Security challenges </h2> <p> Among BYOD and mobile leaders &#x2014; and laggards &#x2014; security looms as a persistent worry. Executives who are attempting to think more strategically about how they use mobile devices face a series of challenges, the index shows. </p> <p> &#x201C;Security and fear of a data breach&#x201D; was identified by 44 percent of executives worldwide as a barrier to expanding mobile programs &#x2014; more than any other factor. Half said they weren&#x2019;t even comfortable with the safeguards their companies take to protect what&#x2019;s already in place. </p> <p> A top concern? Deterring employees from putting company security at risk, particularly via mobile devices. At least 25 percent of respondents cited these compliance priorities: </p> <ul> <li>Proper use of employee-owned smartphones.</li> <li>Password policies for mobile devices.</li> <li>Theft and loss protocols for mobile devices.</li> </ul> <p> O&#x2019;Donnell said that while most companies will readily admit how much they fear a data breach, many are not investing the time and effort needed to prevent one from happening. The use of biometrics in mobile authentication, for instance, is long overdue, he said. </p> <p> &#x201C;You&#x2019;re going to see a lot more about fingerprints, iris scans and all these kinds of sci-fi solutions. They&#x2019;re starting to become real,&#x201D; he said. &#x201C;It&#x2019;s 2014, and we&#x2019;re still using passwords. That&#x2019;s ridiculous.&#x201D; </p> <p> Companies that can effectively manage BYOD and mobile security will lift their odds of realizing bigger benefits from the technology. While survey respondents reported near-term gains in the form of improved efficiency and productivity, there&#x2019;s little doubt that these solutions will also help in the long term, by increasing sales and creating business opportunities. </p> <p> But for now, the potential is still greater than the reality. Dell&#x2019;s GTAI index shows that just 14 percent of companies have so far been able to boost their bottom lines in this way. </p> <div class="divider-bottom"></div> </div> </div> <!--article --> </div> <a name="bigdata"></a> <div id="bigDataSectionWrap"> <div id="bigData" data-id="53" data-emit-events="" class="big-data-section-question viz-section slide"></div> <div class="big-data-section-article content-section slide" data-emit-events=""> <div class="dell-article center"> <div class="article-title-bar"> <h1 class="heading">Big Data</h1> <h1 class="subheading">POTENTIAL UNTAPPED</h1> <div class="divider"></div> </div> <img class="bigData-graphic mobile-visible" src="https://paidpost-assets.nyt.com/paidpost/dell/global-technology-adoption-index/images/Dell_11-03-14_BigData_M_IB.svg" alt=""> <p> Bullish market forecasts suggest the big data revolution is well underway. Spending on big data will surge by 27 percent per year, to $32.4 billion, through 2017, according to market analyst IDC. Yet in many corners, using analytics to mine deep veins of raw data into prognostic insights remains an aspiration. </p> <p> The most recent figures, gathered by Dell in its inaugural Global Technology Adoption Index, show that immense stores of digital information are going untouched at midsize companies. These firms, which employ between 100 and 5,000 workers, are just now figuring out how to extract meaning from the information. </p> <div class="moreBtn" id="BigDataArticle">READ MORE <div id="plus"> +</div> </div> <img class="bigData-graphic web-visible" src="https://paidpost-assets.nyt.com/paidpost/dell/global-technology-adoption-index/images/Dell_Barriers_rg.svg" alt=""> <h2> Common challenges </h2> <p> The survey found that while 61 percent of respondents have big data that could be analyzed, less than two-fifths actually understand the potential benefits sufficiently to do so. Others said they don&#x2019;t believe their companies have anything to gain by investing in the technology. This is especially the case in health care and local government, the index found. </p> <p> A senior manager working in the U.S. utilities industry told Dell interviewers that his company recognized big data&#x2019;s promise, but remained &#x201C;very ignorant,&#x201D; explaining that they were in the &#x201C;infancy of researching the big data wave.&#x201D; </p> <p> Security and cost remain barriers, as well. As the two biggest obstacles, respondents point to the difficulty of obtaining adequate funding to invest in systems able to process the information, as well as the challenge of securing these deep pools of information. </p> <blockquote> Immense stores of digital information are going untouched at midsize companies. </blockquote> <p> Some midsize firms are inching closer to adoption, however. Latecomers to digital record keeping, they are just now taking stock of their new, searchable archives and investigating whether there may be more to reap from all the information they&#x2019;ve collected. </p> <h2> Open-sourced tools </h2> <p> New lower-cost tools are helping. For instance, Hadoop &#x2014; an open-source software that can process big batches of data using clusters of ordinary servers &#x2014; has made analytics a possibility for firms that could not justify spending huge sums on proprietary systems. </p> <p> &#x201C;I see true adoption on the horizon,&#x201D; said Joanna Schloss, business intelligence and analytics evangelist at Dell Software. &#x201C;Today, [businesses] are really looking at, &#x2018;What are we going to do with a Hadoop strategy?&#x2019; People are embracing it in earnest.&#x201D; </p> <p> Vipshop, an online discount retailer in China, uses Hadoop to analyze data that spans more than 3,000 servers in four data centers, said WenYong Yang, the company&#x2019;s senior director of operations. By studying transactional data, Vipshop looks for ways it can increase sales and improve the customer experience. </p> <p> Technology that tracks what happens to the data has eased concerns about a breach, Yang said. &#x201C;We know who&#x2019;s touching the data,&#x201D; he said. &#x201C;We are monitoring every operation. We know exactly who&#x2019;s doing what.&#x201D; </p> <h2> Global caution </h2> <p> Uncertainty over big data is commonplace in most of the world &#x2014; everywhere, that is, but China. The index shows that while 41 percent of mid-size companies globally understand big data and are pursuing it, 68 percent of Chinese companies report they are doing so. </p> <p> While the index didn&#x2019;t set out to measure in a controlled way which countries were more advanced in big data capabilities, it did take a snapshot of the world&#x2019;s attitudes on the topic. The takeaway is that companies in China are by far the most optimistic, followed by India and Canada. The U.S. ranked in the middle with 36 percent of respondents saying that their companies are pursuing big data. </p> <p> Companies chasing big data dreams need strong chief executives who are willing to push info-tech staff to mine the data to answer complex questions about future business, Judith Hurwitz, president and CEO of the tech consultancy Hurwitz &amp; Associates said. To do so, she emphasized, forceful leadership from the top is vital. </p> <p> Companies also should run security software that controls who can access and change data to protect private information, Hurwitz added. &#x201C;The problem, of course, is that the bad actors are not standing still waiting for you to figure it all out,&#x201D; she said. &#x201C;They&#x2019;re always on the move.&#x201D; </p> <div class="divider-bottom"></div> </div> </div> <!--article --> </div> <div id="device-prompts" style="text-align: center;"> <div id="mobile-use-desktop-message"> <div class="device-prompt-img"> <img src="https://paidpost-assets.nyt.com/paidpost/dell/global-technology-adoption-index/images/Dell_11-03-14_Desktop_IB_1.svg"> </div> <div> EXPLORE THIS ON <br> <b>Desktop</b> <br> FOR A MORE <br> <b>Dynamic Experience</b> </div> </div> <div id="flip-horizontal"> <div class="device-prompt-img"> <img src="https://paidpost-assets.nyt.com/paidpost/dell/global-technology-adoption-index/images/Dell_11-03-14_Ipad_IB_1.svg"> </div> <div> GO <br> <b>Horizontal</b> <br> FOR A MORE <br> <b>Dynamic Experience</b> <br> </div> </div> </div> <div class="endview"> <img class="endlogo" src="https://paidpost-assets.nyt.com/paidpost/dell/global-technology-adoption-index/images/DellLogoLg.png" alt=""> <p class="end-line">More than 2,000 companies told us how they are really using technology.
