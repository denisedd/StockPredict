On Monday night, the scene in downtown Ferguson grew increasingly unruly as the night wore on with the police using tear gas to disperse crowds who were throwing rocks and shattering store windows. Some businesses were looted, the police said. Protests also broke out in other cities, including New York, Los Angeles, Oakland and Seattle. </p>

<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Among the many things found in <a href="graphics8.nytimes.com/newsgraphics/2014/11/24/ferguson-assets/grand-jury-testimony.pdf">Darren Wilson&#8217;s grand jury testimony</a> are several references to the way he felt intimidated by Michael Brown. Though Officer Wilson is himself a large man &#8211; nearly 6&#8217;4&#8243;, around 210 pounds, according to his own testimony &#8212; he repeatedly described Mr. Brown as aggressive, big, and threatening, often in vivid language. Here are a few excerpts from his description of the altercation at the window of his patrol car:</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">&#8220;I tried to hold his right arm and use my left hand to get out to have some kind of control and not be trapped in my car any more. And when I grabbed him, the only way I can describe it is I felt like a five-year-old holding onto Hulk Hogan.&#8221;</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">&#8220;I felt that another one of those punches in my face could knock me out or worse. I mean it was, he&#8217;s obviously bigger than I was and stronger and the, I&#8217;ve already taken two to the face and I didn&#8217;t think I would, the third one could be fatal if he hit me right.&#8221;</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">&#8220;After seeing the blood on my hand, I looked at him and was, this is my car door, he was here and he kind of stepped back and went like this. And then after he did that, he looked up at me and had the most intense aggressive face. The only way I can describe it, it looks like a demon, that&#8217;s how angry he looked. He comes back towards me again with his hands up.&#8221;</p>

<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">There were numerous stretches of Ferguson late Monday night where all was calm, all was well. Stores with âI Love Fergusonâ signs in the windows. The red bows and holiday lights wrapped around the light poles downtown still perfectly intact.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">But there were pockets that felt like a city under siege.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">A Little Caesars Pizza shop was in flames. There were shattered windows at El Palenque Mexican restaurant, and at a UMB Bank branch. Thick smoke poured from the busted front entrance of a Walgreens pharmacy. Men stepped in but quickly stepped out, complaining that it was too hard to see anything because of the smoke. The sound of gunfire occasionally rang out in the distance, and the acidic smell and aftertaste of tear gas filled the air. One man exited the store and jokingly asked if anyone wanted cigarettes.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">At the intersection of North Florissant Road and Hereford Avenue â âFerguson, a city since 1894,â reads the sign at the corner â firefighters worked on putting out the Little Caesars blaze, but there were no police or fire officials at Walgreens. The fire inside continued to burn. Spectators drove up to the store, as did news crews. All the while, the pharmacyâs high-pitched security bell echoed, the soundtrack of the eveningâs drama.  </p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">âNot often you get to see anarchy, huh?â one man taking pictures outside Walgreens said.</p>

One man said he had been sitting in his car for about 45 minutes. &#8220;I knew there would be protests, but I didn&#8217;t think it would get this hectic with shutting down the freeway and all the cops,&#8221; said the man, Alex Perez, 28, of Oakland.

<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Late on Monday night, a crowd of about 200 people had blocked traffic on Crenshaw Boulevard, a main thoroughfare through South Los Angeles. The crowd swelled to over 250 as it marched north, then turned east on Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard, a central strip that cuts through South Los Angeles toward downtown Los Angeles.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Beating drums, the crowd chanted: &#8220;Turn up, turn down, we do this for Mike Brown.&#8221;</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">The crowd was young, mostly in their 20s and 30s. Police squad cars and officers stood by at a few intersections. Some protesters carried their cellphones, recording officers or photographing the scene. Helicopters hovered overhead.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">John K. Givens, 45, a Los Angeles resident who works at a freight trading company, marched with the crowd, wearing a gray Dodgers cap and a navy blue vest jacket. &#8220;I was emotionally bothered by the decision,&#8221; Mr. Givens said of the grand jury in the Ferguson, Mo., case.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Mr. Givens said that as a black male, violent interactions were to be expected. His younger brother, Mr. Givens said, had been beaten by a Los Angeles police officer. &#8220;It&#8217;s nothing new,&#8221; he said. &#8220;This is the one that got the most media attention.&#8221; </p>

</div>
<div class="updated-entry-content">
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">United States Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. issued a statement after the grand jury&#8217;s decision:</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">âWhile the grand jury proceeding in St. Louis County has concluded, the Justice Departmentâs investigation into the shooting of Michael Brown remains ongoing.  Though we have shared information with local prosecutors during the course of our investigation, the federal inquiry has been independent of the local one from the start, and remains so now.  Even at this mature stage of the investigation, we have avoided prejudging any of the evidence.  And although federal civil rights law imposes a high legal bar in these types of cases, we have resisted forming premature conclusions.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">âMichael Brownâs death was a tragedy.  This incident has sparked a national conversation about the need to ensure confidence between law enforcement and the communities they protect and serve.  While constructive efforts are underway in Ferguson and communities nationwide, far more must be done to create enduring trust.  The department will continue to work with law enforcement, civil rights, faith and community leaders across the country to foster effective relationships between law enforcement and the communities they serve and to improve fairness in the criminal justice system overall.  In addition, the department continues to investigate allegations of unconstitutional policing patterns or practices by the Ferguson Police Department.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">âThough there will be disagreement with the grand jury&#8217;s decision not to indict, this feeling should not lead to violence.  Those who decide to participate in demonstrations should remember the wishes of Michael Brown&#8217;s parents, who have asked that remembrances of their son be conducted peacefully.  It does not honor his memory to engage in violence or looting.  In the coming days, it will likewise be important for local law enforcement authorities to respect the rights of demonstrators, and de-escalate tensions by avoiding excessive displays â and uses â of force.â</p>

<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Protesters ran down South Florissant Road, out of sight of the police, and broke windows at several businesses, including a Beauty World store that they looted. Bursts of what sounded like gunfire were heard repeatedly. </p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">The looting was a dramatic change in tone after what had been a mostly somber response to the news that Officer Darren Wilson would not be charged. Officers initially stayed behind a skirmish line outside the Ferguson police station, and many demonstrators stewed peacefully in the street for about an hour.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">But tension slowly built, and people began running north away from the police. Officers did not initially pursue them, and the first widespread looting occurred at that point.<br />
The police eventually followed, warning over a loudspeaker that anyone who did not disperse would be arrested. Cars sped off in all directions as people &#8212; peaceful protesters and looters alike &#8212; darted through the street.</p>

</div>
<div class="updated-entry-content">
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">The Rev. Al Sharpton was brief and succinct, and said that while the news of the grand jury&#8217;s decision was expected, &#8220;it hurts nonetheless.&#8221;</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Beside him stood members of Eric Garner&#8217;s family, who silently sucked in their lips and tried to fight back tears. Mr. Garner died after being placed in a choke hold by a New York City police officer.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Mr. Sharpton called the judicial system in Ferguson &#8220;deeply flawed&#8221; and &#8220;very suspect.&#8221; An example was how prosecutor Robert P. McCulloch explained that it was legal to use deadly force against a fleeing felon, while he also explained that Michael Brown&#8217;s crime was stealing cigarillos from a corner store.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">&#8220;That qualifies as a felon?&#8221; Mr. Sharpton said. &#8220;You are trying to describe a shoplifter as a fleeing felon.&#8221;</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">He said that he would push for a federal investigation and prosecution. An example of the difference, he said, is that it is legal to shoot a fleeing felon under Missouri law, but not federal law.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">He also brought up both Mr. Garner and, from just last week, Akai Gurley, who also died at the hands of  a New York City police officer who officials said accidentally fired his gun inside a darkened stairwell.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">&#8220;We are dealing with the same attitudes of Ferguson,&#8221; he said, &#8220;right here in the city.&#8221;</p>

<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">ATLANTA â Civil rights leaders called for a protest in Atlanta on Monday night. But the Michael Brown decision came late in the evening, and what was supposed to be a protest became an angry news conference by civil rights leaders. They grimaced, and some cried.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">âWell, itâs a frustration that I have not become immune to,â said Vincent Fort, a Georgia state senator, who is black.  âItâs a frequent feeling,â he said, that the system âdoesnât work.â</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">The Rev. Markel Hutchins, a civil rights leader, called Monday âone of the saddest days in recent American history.â  The system, he said, âsystematically fails to protect the lives of young black men.â</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Mr. Hutchins told black parents to put their arms around their sons. âIf you donât look like Michael Brown, or have a son or a grandson or a cousin who looks like Michael Brown, you will never understand how we feel tonight,â he said.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Heather Washington brought her 14-year-old daughter, Precious Imagbe. âI canât believe that here in the 21st century, we are still marching,â Ms. Washington said. âMy parents marched, and now weâre here doing it again.&#8221;</p>

<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Benjamin Crump, a lawyer who represents the Brown family, sat waiting for interviews in a downtown St Louis hotel, watching the prosecutorâs news conference on his phone.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">âIâm going to spend the night trying to explain to my clients about the legal system, because they believe it failed them,â he said when asked what was next, âand that the killer of an unarmed child is not going to be held accountable.â</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Mr. Crump said that the family learned about the grand jury decision âabout 10 minutes before they told the world.â</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">âThey donât trust this prosecutor, they never did from the beginning,â he said. âAnd they are going to try to see if they can do something to get some positive change out of this because they understand this system needs to be changed. If we keep this system the same way, we keep getting the same results.â</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">He added that he and the Brown family would be exploring their legal options. Among the changes Mr. Crump said the family would be pushing for now was the wearing of video-cameras by police officers and the appointment of special prosecutors in cases of shootings involving police officers.</p>

<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Alvertis Simmons, 57, a civil rights activist, threw his hands in the air. âEnough is enough,â he yelled into a circle of Michael Brown supporters, his voice raw and raspy with emotion. The group burst into a enthusiastic call and response: âHands up!â âDonât shoot!â</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">âOur lives â a black manâs life in America &#8212; means nothing to white Americans,â said Mr. Simmons, who is black. âNothing. We donât mean anything to you all.â</p>

<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">The group stood silent. Some held hands. Afterward, a woman at the edge of crowd shared her story. </p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Anita Cameron, 49, said that she was nearly blind and had multiple sclerosis. Her wife urged her not to come to the protest, fearing for her safety. But Ms. Cameron insisted. &#8220;I&#8217;ve been watching the whole thing evolve out of Ferguson,&#8221; said Ms. Cameron, who is black and an activist for the disabled. &#8220;I just had to be here.

<div class="updated-entry-content">
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">The scene in downtown Ferguson grew increasingly unruly after a group of protesters marched near South Florissant Road shortly before 9 p.m. and focused their anger on a parked St. Louis County Police car that was parked just off the road. They tried to overturn it, but failed, and instead  kicked at the car several times before the police arrived. The protesters threw rocks at the police and broke at least two police car windows. The police responded with tear gas, and a strong odor of the gas permeated the frigid night air.  Nearby, the sound of glass breaking could be heard, apparently the shattering of windows of shuttered businesses. One restaurant, El Palenque, a Mexican restaurant near the Ferguson Police Station, had what appeared to be two broken windows. </p>

<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">As the prosecutor was reading his statment, protesters were listening to it on radios throughout the crowd of hundreds gathered in front of the police station. While the prosecutor was speaking, Mr. Brown&#8217;s mother, Lesley McSpadden, and his stepfather, Louis Head, stepped up onto a platform where protest leaders were standing.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">With a stern look on her face, Ms. McSpadden yelled frustrated responses to what the prosecutor was saying.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">âDefend himself from what!â she yelled, when the prosecutor spoke of Officer Darren Wilson. She added that this was a joke, injecting a profanity. </p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">âThey wrong!â she yelled, pointing toward the police officers standing outside of the station. âYou all know, you&#8217;re all wrong!â</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">She bowed her head and tears started streaming down her cheeks.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">âEverybody wants me to be calm,â she said, her eyes covered with sunglasses. âYou know what them bullets did to my son!â</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">âThey still don&#8217;t care!â she yelled. âThey never going to care!â</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Ms. McSpadden&#8217;s head sank into her husbandâs chest as she wept.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Mr. Head then turned and began to yell.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">The crowd then roared, with some rushing toward the fence near where the police were lined up. Representatives for the family helped them down off of the platform and ushered them away, through the crowd, and people began dispersing in a moment of anger and chaos. Officers in riot helmets and shields came out. Someone threw a megaphone at the officers.</p>

<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">As buses drove past, Alvertis Simmons, 57, a long-time civil rights activist, said Mr. Brownâs death had stirred the country to action, and he vowed to continue fighting for changes in police policy, no matter the grand jury&#8217;s decision in Missouri. </p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">âThis is a movement,â he said. âThis is not a moment. This is a movement.â</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">âThe police come into our community, they mistreat black and brown people,â said Mr. Simmons, who is black. âThey treat us as second-class citizens, and weâre going to change that by exercising our First Amendment right. Thatâs why weâre out here in this bitter cold.â</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Kenny Wiley, 26, stood nearby. After Mr. Brown&#8217;s death, Mr. Wiley took to Twitter to find other Coloradans who were also angered by the incident, and he found Jo Cusick, a white nurse. The two started a group called Coloradans for Justice.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Since then, the group has organized five events in support of the Brown  family, including one that drew 350 people, Mr. Wiley said.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">âFor me personally, that could be me,â he said. âTo me, Mike Brown could have been anybody. Iâm a college graduate, I speak respectably, my pants are up, but in the wrong situation that could have been me as well. And I just felt called to act.â</p>

<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">FERGUSON, Mo. &#8212; Less than an hour before the St. Louis County prosecutor was to announce the grand jury&#8217;s decison, the county&#8217;s police chief said officers were prepared for the reaction.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">&#8220;Our primary responsibility is to protect both life and property for our citizens, and we are committed to doing just that,&#8221; the chief, Jon Belmar, said in a statement.</p>

</div>
<div class="updated-entry-content">
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Less than three hours before the announcement of the grand jury decision, Missouri officials held a  news conference to urge calm.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">At the conference, which was held at the University of Missouri-St.Louis, about five miles from Ferguson, Gov. Jay Nixon, Mayor Francis G. Slay of St. Louis, Charles Dooley, the St. Louis County executive, and Dan Isom II, the director of the state Department of Public Safety, all said that they did not know what the grand jury had decided. But they tried to reassure residents and protesters that free speech would be protected and order maintained.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">âOur shared hope and expectation is that regardless of the decision, people on all sides show tolerance, mutual respect and restraint,â Mr. Nixon said. </p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">The governor talked of meeting with faith leaders earlier on Monday and said that churches in the area would be opened as safe havens. He also emphasized that the police and protest leaders had been working with protest leaders in recent months.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">âLaw enforcement officials continue to maintain open lines of communication with protest leaders to improve the interaction between police and demonstrators and prevent violence,â he said.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Mr. Dooley highlighted the demonstrations in October, which drew thousands of people but were largely peaceful. âNow is the time to show the world that we can act without being destructive,â he said.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Mr. Slay acknowledged that much long-term work needed to be done to repair race relations in the St Louis area, but also warned that violence would not be tolerated. He pointed to a largely calm demonstration that took place on Sunday night in the Shaw neighborhood of St. Louis, during which protesters were allowed by the police to block streets and which did not result in serious injuries.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">âWe may allow demonstrators to slow down traffic, but we will not allow them to hurt anyone or damage any property,â he said.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">The mayor concluded by talking about the work that still needed to be done.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">âThe world will be watching us,â he said. âTheyâre going to watch how we handle our disagreement in the coming days and how we make needed change in the coming months and years.â</p>

</div>
<div class="updated-entry-content">
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">In Atlanta on Monday night, civil rights leaders, student activists and local law enforcement were inside an old fire station that is part of the Martin Luther King Jr. National Historic Site, just yards from the slain civil rights leader&#8217;s tomb.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Their agenda &#8212; as it so often has been in this cradle of the civil rights movement &#8212; was how to make sure that angry and frustrated voices could be heard, while also keeping the peace.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">In the middle of the meeting, the Rev. Markel Hutchins came downstairs and gave a brief news conference, saying he was confident that Atlantans would react peacefully to the Missouri grand juryâs decision, no matter what it was.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">âAtlanta is unlike any other city in the nation and in fact in the world,&#8221; Mr.  Hutchins said. &#8220;We know how to do demonstrations. We know how to do direct action. And we know how to sit at the table of brotherhood and sisterhood. We saw what happened in Ferguson with the lack of communication between law enforcement and community organizations. We saw a lack of leadership in one real sense. We are determined not to let that happen in the city of Atlanta.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">&#8220;This is Martin Luther King Jr.âs town. We are met right here in the King District because we want to set an appropriate tone of how we work together as brothers and sisters whether weâre law enforcement, civil rights, students or whatever we are.&#8221;</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Civil rights leaders in Atlanta were planning on holding a rally outside of the cityâs downtown federal court building on Monday, said Faye Coffield, a human rights activist and retired Atlanta Police sergeant, who left a closed-door meeting of civil rights leaders and the police.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Ms. Coffield dismissed the idea that Atlanta would see any violence. âThis ainât Ferguson,â said Ms. Coffield, the chairwoman of the criminal justice committee of The Peopleâs Agenda, a civil rights group. &#8220;You ainât going to see no dogs. You ainât going to see no tanks.â</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Mr. Hutchins also said that civil rights groups were deciding whether to go ahead with a planned rally on Monday night in front of the federal court building in downtown Atlanta. He said they were planning other peaceful protests for the downtown district on Tuesday night.</p>

<div class="updated-entry-content">
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">FERGUSON, Mo. â In the minutes and hours after officials announced that the grand jury weighing charges in the fatal shooting of Michael Brown had made a decision, school officials here reacted swiftly.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">The Riverview Gardens school district, one of several that serve the city of Ferguson, announced that its schools would be closed on Tuesday. âThis decision was based on input we have received from local law enforcement and in consideration of the safety of all students and staff,â the district said in a statement on its website.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">At least two other Ferguson-area districts â the Ferguson-Florissant and the Hazelwood districts â also said they were shutting their schools Tuesday. In Clayton, the seat of St. Louis County and the site of the courthouse where the grand jury has been meeting, school administrators announced they were canceling all after-school and evening activities on Monday, including athletic practices and games, although they had yet to announce whether the district would be open Tuesday.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">As the St. Louis County prosecutor, Robert P. McCulloch, prepared to announce the grand juryâs decision Monday evening, he appeared to be honoring at least one request â a letter signed by several superintendents in the region asking him to make the decision public when schools were closed.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">On Oct. 22, area superintendents had asked Mr. McCulloch to avoid announcing the grand juryâs decision during the school day, citing concerns about getting children to and from school safely. The letter was sent to Mr. McCulloch by Scott Spurgeon, superintendent of the Riverview Gardens district, and it was signed by six other superintendents.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">âInformation released during the school day has the potential to greatly affect school district operations, and we implore you to refrain from making a grand jury announcement until such time as we can provide safe passage home for all students,â the letter read.</p>

One man thought the convoy was made up of F.B.I. vehicles. Minutes before Mr. Nixon drove by, a man in a Vietnam Veterans cap pounded a steel bucket, yelling: âPut the pressure on! Indict!

The tentative plan, people close to Officer Wilson said, was that he would be quietly brought into the courthouse in Clayton, where he would post bond, accompanied by his lawyers.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Throughout the last three months, Officer Wilson has typically stayed close to St. Louis, reading news articles and following television coverage of the case, those close to him said. He has made no public statements or appearances.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">But he has given considerable thought to how he might begin to emerge from the shadows: He flirted with the idea of telling his story on television, holding off-the-record meetings with television anchors, including Anderson Cooper of CNN, who have courted him for interviews.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">And in a secret ceremony in October, he married his fianc&#233;e, Barbara Spradling, also a Ferguson police officer, court records show. His lawyer and longtime family friend, Greg Kloeppel, stood witness to the ceremony.   </p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Officer Wilson remains on paid administrative leave, but local officials said  they expected that he could resign in the coming days.</p>
