<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody"><span class="title">FINANCING FOR SUIT BY STEVEN COHENâS EX-WIFE  <span class="divider"> | </span></span> Steven A. Cohen may have fended off the government for the most part, but his former wife is another story, <b><a href="//dealbook.nytimes.com/2014/11/25/steven-cohens-ex-wife-gets-outside-financing-for-lawsuit">DealBookâs Matthew Goldstein reports</a></b>. Patricia Cohen continues to pursue Mr. Cohen, claiming that the billionaire investor cheated her out of money during their divorce some two decades ago and potentially owes her millions of dollars. Helping to fuel the long-running legal battle is Asta Funding, a financial backer of a Beverly Hills, Calif., firm that has provided litigation financing to Ms. Cohen. Asta and the firm that is financing Ms. Cohenâs lawsuit, Balance Point Divorce Funding, have an agreement to share in the proceeds of legal recoveries by clients. Ms. Cohenâs lawyers are scheduled to take a deposition from Mr. Cohen on Dec. 10.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Balance Point is said to have signed a deal with Ms. Cohen in the summer of 2013 to provide her with <b>about $1.2 million to continue her litigation</b>. Court filings in an unrelated lawsuit reveal it is common for Balance Point to get up to 25 percent of any legal recovery by a client in return for the financing provided. Ms. Cohen contends that she filed the lawsuit in 2009 after she discovered that her former husband had <b>hidden proceeds from a real estate deal during their divorce</b> and, in the process, cheated her out of money that was hers. Ms. Cohen claims she is entitled to at least half of the $5.5 million that Mr. Cohen obtained in that deal plus interest earned over the last 25 years. She also contends that some of the money Mr. Cohen hid from her was used to help him start his hedge fund, SAC Capital Advisors, in 1992.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Before SAC pleaded guilty to insider trading charges and paid $1.8 billion in penalties to federal authorities, it was one of the best-performing hedge funds for years. Mr. Cohen has since converted the hedge fund in Stamford, Conn., into a family office called Point72 Asset Management that trades about $10 billion of mostly his own money. Ms. Cohenâs lawsuit thus has the <b>potential to be a lucrative payout for Balance Point and Asta</b> if it is successful. But given that Mr. Cohen has shown no inclination to reach a settlement with his former wife, there is the possibility that Ms. Cohen may not have been able to pursue the litigation if not for the money from Balance Point.</p>

<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody"><span class="title">âPOISON PUTSâ DEVELOP A DOWNSIDE <span class="divider"> | </span></span> A recent judicial decision is threatening the hidden world of companies and âpoison puts,â a tactic used to forestall shareholder activists and hostile takeovers, <b><a href="//dealbook.nytimes.com/2014/11/25/a-defense-against-hostile-takeovers-develops-a-downside">Steven Davidoff Solomon writes in the Deal Professor column</a></b>. Companies will borrow money and enter into a loan agreement with the lender or the bond trustee. Such agreements specify that if there is a change of control at the company, the debt must be bought back. This is the âputâ part. The âpoisonâ is that the debt is often required to be bought back at a premium, or the company will be in a market where refinancing it is hard. But what began as a well-intentioned way to protect debt holders got a little bit out of hand.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">What led to this situation? In the 1988, Kohlberg Kravis Roberts borrowed billions to finance the $25 billion acquisition of RJR Nabisco. To save money, K.K.R. did not refinance all of RJR Nabiscoâs debt. The firm instead kept the old debt outstanding, reducing its value by more than $1 billion. RJR Nabisco was then in greater debt and more likely to default. After this, <b>banks began to negotiate poison puts</b> to protect their investments from such maneuvers. âIf you are going to lend a company bags of money, you probably want to know that its ownership will not change,â Mr. Davidoff Solomon writes. </p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Then companies realized it might be costly for a potential acquirer to have to refinance all of their debt. This kind of maneuvering has become even more commonplace now that <b>shareholder activists have stepped on the scene</b>. Companies began to negotiate poison puts that are activated not only if they are acquired, but also if a shareholder activist unseats a majority of a corporationâs directors. Companies argued that the fact that it would deter a shareholder activist was beside the point, placing the blame on banks for demanding this provision. âAlthough these features are common, courts have been struggling with how to deal with them,â Mr. Davidoff Solomon writes. âThey have been weighing a need for banks to know whom they are doing business with against the fact that these provisions can <b>entrench existing boards</b>.â</p>

<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody"><span class="title">TRUSTEE MOVES TO REPAY MT. GOX CREDITORS <span class="divider"> | </span></span> The bankruptcy trustee for the Bitcoin exchange Mt. Gox, which is based in Tokyo, announced on Wednesday that it would work with a California-based Bitcoin exchange, Kraken, to return the money left in the estate to the companyâs 127,000 creditors, <b><a href="//dealbook.nytimes.com/2014/11/25/mt-gox-bankruptcy-trustee-to-tap-kraken-exchange-in-repaying-creditors">Michael J. de la Merced and Nathaniel Popper write in DealBook</a></b>. Jesse Powell, Krakenâs chief executive, said at a news conference in Tokyo on Wednesday that his company would help with the claims process, including evaluating the assets owed to creditors, and that it would assist in the investigation of Mt. Goxâs collapse. He said the trustee would have the final decision on payments in Bitcoin.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">When Mt. Gox initially went down in February, the companyâs chief executive, Mark Karpeles, said the company had either <b>lost or been robbed of 850,000 coins</b>, worth about $500 million at the time. Mr. Karpeles said that 100,000 of the missing coins belonged to the exchange but that the rest were owned by customers. A few weeks after Mt. Gox shut down, Mr. Karpeles announced he had found about 200,000 coins that he had thought were missing. Mr. Karpeles has said that hackers appeared to have stolen the money. But while several law enforcement authorities in Japan and the United States have reportedly been investigating, they have produced few answers. As part of its mandate from the bankruptcy trustee, Kraken will participate in the investigation.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">The 200,000 coins discovered after the exchange shut down appear to <b>represent the bulk of the estateâs assets</b>, though the trustee has not recently commented on his success in recovering missing assets. In a July filing, the company said that in addition to 202,100 coins, it had 779 million yen, or about $6.6 million, in other assets. The court-appointed trustee previously suggested that the remaining coins could be converted into dollars before being returned. But many creditors resisted, worried that the conversion of all that Bitcoin into dollars would depress the digital currencyâs value.</p>

Falcone, the hedge fund manager who made billions betting against the housing market and then lost a bundle trying to build a wireless network, is stepping down as the chief executive and chairman of the Harbinger Group, <b><a href="//dealbook.nytimes.com/2014/11/25/falcone-steps-down-from-top-roles-at-harbinger-group">Matthew Goldstein reports in DealBook</a></b>. The Harbinger Group, a publicly traded company that owns stakes in the maker of the George Foreman grills and a life insurance company, announced the decision in a news release on Tuesday. Mr. Falcone will receive a lump-sum payment of $20.5 million and $19.8 million in bonus money that the Harbinger Group said he had earned for his service to the company.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">In an email, Mr. Falcone rejected speculation that the lump-sum payment might indicate he was in need of cash. Instead, he said he had decided to step down from the Harbinger Group so he could <b>focus more attention on building a new publicly traded venture</b> called HC2 Holdings, which appears to be buying stakes in companies much the way the Harbinger Group did. A spokesman for the Harbinger Group said Mr. Falconeâs move was not driven by any regulatory pressure. The resignation is effective on Dec. 1. Mr. Falcone agreed last year to be barred from working in the securities industry for at least five years as part of a settlement with the Securities and Exchange Commission that stemmed from violations at his hedge fund, Harbinger Capital Partners.</p>
