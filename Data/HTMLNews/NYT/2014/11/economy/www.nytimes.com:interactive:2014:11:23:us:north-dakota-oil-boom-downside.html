            <p class="paragraph paragraph-2">It was the 11th blowout since 2006 at a North Dakota well operated by Continental Resources, the most prolific producer in the booming Bakken oil patch. Spewing some 173,250 gallons of potential pollutants, the eruption, undisclosed at the time, was serious enough to bring the Oklahoma-based company&#x2019;s chairman and chief executive, Harold G. Hamm, to the remote scene.</p>

    <!-- END ADS -->



        

            <p class="paragraph paragraph-3">It was not the first or most catastrophic blowout visited by Mr. Hamm, a sharecropper&#x2019;s son who became the wealthiest oilman in America and energy adviser to Mitt Romney during the 2012 presidential campaign. Two years earlier, a towering derrick in Golden Valley County had erupted into flames and toppled, leaving three workers badly burned. &#x201C;I was a human torch,&#x201D; said the driller, Andrew J. Rohr.</p>

    <!-- END ADS -->



        

            <p class="paragraph paragraph-4">Blowouts represent the riskiest failure in the oil business. Yet, despite these serious injuries and some 115,000 gallons spilled in those first 10 blowouts, the North Dakota Industrial Commission, which regulates the drilling and production of oil and gas, did not penalize Continental until the 11th.</p>

            <p class="paragraph paragraph-13">State regulators say they deliberately choose a collaborative rather than punitive approach because they view the large independent companies that dominate the Bakken as responsible and as their necessary allies in policing the oil fields. They prefer to work alongside industry to develop new guidelines or regulations when problems like overflowing waste, radioactive waste, leaking pipelines, and flaring gas become too glaring to ignore.</p>

            <p class="paragraph paragraph-20">The spill numbers derive from estimates, and sometimes serious underestimates, reported to the state by the industry. State officials, who rarely discuss them publicly, sometimes use them to present a rosier image. Over the summer, speaking to farmers in the town of Antler, Lynn D. Helms, the director of the Department of Mineral Resources, announced &#x201C;a little bit of good news&#x201D;: The spill rate per well was &#x201C;steady or down.&#x201D; In fact, the rate has risen sharply since the early days of the boom.</p>

It found that companies in the Bakken spill at different rates. This suggests to some experts that companies could do more to prevent and minimize environmental incidents.</p>

          <p>An article last Sunday about the environmental record and state regulation of the North Dakota oil industry erroneously attributed a distinction to an oil spill last fall on the farm of Steven and Patricia Jensen near Tioga. It is considered the largest on-land oil spill in recent American history, not the largest ever.</p>
