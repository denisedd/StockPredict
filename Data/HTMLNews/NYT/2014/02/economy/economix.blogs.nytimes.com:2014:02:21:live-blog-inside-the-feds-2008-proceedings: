<div class="updated-entry-content">
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Until now, the world has known much about Janet L. Yellenâs economic views during the crisis, but little about her views on the government bailouts.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">In late October 2008, Ms. Yellen, then head of the Fedâs regional bank in San Francisco, said she strongly supported recent efforts to prop up the banking system. But she said it was not nearly enough. In tune with many critics of the government bailouts, Ms. Yellen said ordinary Americans also needed help.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Alluding to the bailouts, she said: âWe are fighting an uphill battle against falling home prices, an economy in recession and collapsing confidence. It is not clear whether these steps will reopen credit flows to households and businesses, especially those with less than sterling credit.&#8221;</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">At a time when many at the Fed were wary of stimulus packages, Ms. Yellenâs concerns led her to argue for more: âGiven the seriousness of the situation, I believe that we should put as much stimulus into the system as we can as soon as we can.â</p>

<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">The blame game, focusing on the handling of Lehmanâs collapse, seemed to be getting to senior Fed officials by the end of October 2008. Within the privacy of the F.O.M.C. meeting of Oct. 28-29, Timothy F. Geithner of the New York Fed placed some blame on Congress for making matters worse. He was presumably referring to the House&#8217;s vote against the Troubled Asset Relief Program at the end of September. Congress approved the program a few days later. But Mr. Geithner said the initial vote had hurt.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">âLook particularly at the damage to confidence created by the Congressâs actions in the weeks after the legislation was first proposed,â he said. He then pressed other committee members to watch their words when talking about the Fedâs actions. âBut please be very careful, certainly outside this room, about adding to the perception that the actions by this body were a substantial contributor to the erosion in confidence. I think that Don Kohn said it best. The whole framing, which seems to have hardened now, that the world ended with the Lehman bankruptcy is just deeply unfair to the basic truth.â</p>

<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">In July, Janet L. Yellen, the head of the Fedâs regional branch in San Francisco, told her story of dealing with IndyMac as it headed toward collapse. Ms. Yellen said that while her bank was offering IndyMac loans, the Office of Thrift Supervision, IndyMacâs primary regulator, was downgrading IndyMac without informing the Fed.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Jeffrey Lacker, the head of the Fed branch in Richmond, expressed his unhappiness with the way the O.T.S. had behaved in the IndyMac case, and other situations he had dealt with: âI think it is outrageous that the O.T.S. downgraded them and didnât inform the San Francisco Fed,â Mr. Lacker said. âI hope, Mr. Chairman, that the unacceptability of that sort of behavior is communicated at the highest levels to the O.T.S.â</p>

</p></div>
<div class="updated-entry-content">
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">In a meeting on March 18, Fed officials agreed that the economy had badly deteriorated and was pitching into recession. (They would later find out it had already been contracting for a full quarter.) But they disagreed about what kind of a threat rising inflation might pose to the economy â and what to tell the public about it. The transcript becomes an object lesson in the intricacies of the famed &#8220;Fed speak.&#8221; </p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">The participants in this discussion are: Donald Kohn, Frederic Mishkin, Ben S. Bernanke, Charles Evans of the Chicago Fed, Brian Madigan, William Dudley, Kevin Warsh, Timothy F. Geithner of the New York Fed, Dennis Lockhart of the Atlanta Fed and Randall Kroszner.   </p>
<blockquote><p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">
MR. KOHN: On inflation expectations, because they havenât risen very much, I agree with President Geithner. I like the fact that we tell people we are aware, but we could say âhave edged higherâ or something like that instead of ârisen.â </p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">MR. MISHKIN: We could use my âsmidgenâ word, but âedged higherâ is better. </p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">MR. KOHN: Went up a smidge. </p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">CHAIRMAN BERNANKE: All right. President Evans. </p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">MR. EVANS: âEdged higherâ is an unusual phrase. </p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">MR. MISHKIN: âHave risen somewhatâ? </p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">MR. MADIGAN: I think an issue with âedged higherâ is that it really does sound as though you have some very specific measures in mind. </p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">CHAIRMAN BERNANKE: Brian, do you have a thought on ârisenâ versus ârisen somewhatâ versus taking it out? </p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">MR. MADIGAN: I think if you take it out that very much raises the question of what to do with that language in red about the factors that would push inflation down. It would be tough to drop the inflation expectations thought and not have inflation expectations mentioned anywhere in the paragraph. There would just be vacant space where you had, at least in previous minutes, referred to it. </p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">CHAIRMAN BERNANKE: Anyone else? Bill. </p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">MR. DUDLEY: Adding just the word âslightlyâ â ârisen slightlyâ â gets to your point. </p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">MR. MISHKIN: âSlightlyâ or âsomewhatâ risen. </p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">MR. WARSH: Brian, does âsomewhatâ mitigate it a little, or does that highlight it? </p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">MR. MADIGAN: Iâm not sure. I mean, in my mind it mitigates it. </p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">VICE CHAIRMAN GEITHNER: Somewhat. </p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">MR. KROSZNER: Is âslightlyâ better than âsomewhatâ? </p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">MR. KOHN: âSomewhatâ is bigger than âslightly.â </p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">MR. EVANS: That is 50 versus 25 in the old days. </p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">MR. LOCKHART: Mr. Chairman, if I understand the discussion about this, when you say âsome indicators have risen somewhat,â you are getting into territory that seems sort of mealy-mouthed. </p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">CHAIRMAN BERNANKE: Right. </p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">MR. KOHN: âRisen a littleâ? </p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">MR. KROSZNER: What is wrong with âslightlyâ? </p>

</p></div>
<div class="updated-entry-content">
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">In late October, more than a month after Lehmanâs collapse and the sharp worsening of the crisis, Ben S. Bernanke took on the question of whether Lehman should have been saved.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Perhaps with an eye on history, he defended the decision, but he was also quick to note the danger of letting financial institutions become too big to fail, a phrase soon to enter the lexicon of the crisis. And one still very much on the mind of policy makers today.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">âAlso more recently we have heard more of a critique from the left, which is, &#8216;What in the heck were you guys doing letting Lehman fail?&#8217;â Mr. Bernanke said. âI think that critique is unfair at a narrow level in that, first, Lehman was a symptom as well as a cause of the recent crisis and, second, the Fed and the Treasury simply had no tools to address both Lehman and the other companies that were under stress at that time.â</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">But with outrage in Europe building, Mr. Bernanke made plain the situation was far from ideal. âI think that criticism is appropriate, though, as directed toward the United States as a whole,â he said. âWe did not have â as the Europeans have or as we have F.D.I.C.I.A. for banks â a system that was set up to allow a reasonable and responsible orderly resolution of nonbank systemically critical institutions.â</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">In any case, given what he termed the âfog of war,â Mr. Bernanke astutely split the difference and acknowledged that both sides had a point. It&#8217;s a point that Mr. Bernanke â who stepped down as Fed chairman at the end of last month and is now a distinguished fellow in residence at the Brookings Institution â is sure to tackle again as he writes a memoir of his years at the Fed. </p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">âSo given the fog of war â which has, of course, been intense going back for more than a year,&#8221; he said at the Oct. 28-29 meeting, &#8220;I would defend what weâve done in terms of the general direction, acknowledging that execution is not always perfect and that communication is not always perfect.â</p>

Yellen was known for being one of the most pessimistic members of the Fedâs policy making committee in early 2008, but even she was way off in her estimates of the magnitude of what was coming.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">At the Fedâs two-day meeting in late April, she was very concerned about the future. The Fedâs internal projections, she said, represent âone of the most pessimistic economic forecasts; yet I find its recessionary projection quite plausible and see downside risks that could take the economy well below that forecast.â</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">At the same time, though, Ms. Yellen was not envisioning a long recession. She said that while the first half of 2008 would likely see no economic growth, in the second half she was expecting growth of 1.5 percent. That view ended up being far too rosy, as was her assessment at the time that âthe likelihood of a severe financial panic has diminished.â</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Part of the reason for her note of optimism was her faith in the power of government stimulus. She said that a recent fiscal stimulus package and tax rebates would likely âprovide a bigger bank for the buckâ than similar measures taken in 2001.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">âOf course, there is considerable uncertainty about assessing the potential size of these effects,&#8221; she said. &#8220;But over the next few months as the checks go out and the retail sales reports come in, we should get a pretty quick preliminary read on how things are shaping up.&#8221;</p>

<div class="updated-entry-content">
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Jeffrey M. Lacker, then and now the Richmond Fed president, was confident at the Sept. 16 meeting that letting Lehman Brothers collapse had been the right call.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">âWhat we did with Lehman I obviously think is good,â he concluded. âIt has had an effect on market participantsâ assessment of the likelihood of other firms getting support, and I think you would have to attribute at least some of changes in equity prices to that.â</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">And while the stock market might drop in the short term, Mr. Lacker added, there was a âsilver liningâ to Lehmanâs collapse. âI donât want to be sanguine about it, but the silver lining to all the disruption thatâs ahead of us is that it will enhance the credibility of any commitment that we make in the future to be willing to let an institution fail and to risk such disruption again.â</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Thomas M. Hoenig, then the head of the Kansas City Fed, was similarly concerned that saving Lehman would have sent the wrong signal to Wall Street, the so-called moral hazard argument, which was much invoked at the time.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">âI think what we did with Lehman was the right thing because we did have a market beginning to play the Treasury and us, â Mr. Hoenig said, âand that has some pretty negative consequences as well, which we are now coming to grips with.&#8221;</p>

It&#8217;s a debate that rages to this day, on Wall Street, in Washington and in academia. Eric Rosengren, head of the Boston Fed, wasnât sure, and he astutely warned of the danger that a money-market fund could run into trouble as a result. That quickly happened, as the Reserve Fund âbroke the buckâ and sent the crisis into overdrive that week.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">âI think itâs too soon to know whether what we did with Lehman is right,â he said on Sept. 16. âBut we took a calculated bet. If we have a run on the money-market funds or if the nongovernment tri-party repo market shuts down, that bet may not look nearly so good.â</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">However, Mr. Rosengren stopped short of saying the decision to let Lehman collapse was the blunder that many overseas officials, like Christine Lagarde, then the French finance minister and now head of the International Monetary Fund, quickly said it was at the time.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">âI think we did the right thing given the constraints that we had,â Mr. Rosengren said. âI hope we get through this weekâ¦There are a lot of lessons learned, but we shouldnât be in a position where weâre betting the economy on one or two institutions. That is the situation we were in last weekend. We had no choice. We did what we had to do, but I hope we will find a way to not get into this position.&#8221;</p>

</p></div>
<div class="updated-entry-content">
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">In January 2008, the economy had just entered what would become the worst recession since the Great Depression, by many measures. </p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">A slew of economic data â on housing, industrial production, layoffs, job openings and credit-card defaults â had come in worse than expected, and Fed officials were attempting to gauge the possibility that a soft patch might turn into a recession. </p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Both Ben S. Bernanke and Janet L. Yellen were very pessimistic from the outset. &#8220;I think there are a lot of indications that we may soon be in a recession,&#8221; Mr. Bernanke said during a conference call in early January. &#8220;I think a garden-variety recession is an acceptable risk, but I am also concerned that such a downturn might morph into something more serious.&#8221; </p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Others were more bullish. &#8220;While there are tales of woe, none of the 30 C.E.O.&#8217;s to whom I talked, outside of housing, see the economy trending into negative territory,&#8221; said Richard Fisher of the Dallas Fed in January. &#8220;They see slower growth. Some of them see much slower growth. None of them at this juncture â the cover of Newsweek notwithstanding, a great contra-indicator, which by the way shows &#8216;the road to recession&#8217; on the issue that is about to come out â see us going into recession.&#8221;</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">And it is in January that Fed officials first predict that the economy is outright contracting â an assessment that their colleagues would not fully join them in for months.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">&#8220;The severe and prolonged housing downturn and financial shock have put the economy at, if not beyond, the brink of recession,&#8221; Ms. Yellen said.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Her colleague Eric Rosengren of the Boston Fed was more definitive: &#8220;We could soon be or may already be in a recession.&#8221;</p>

<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">At the March 18 meeting, Frederic Mishkin, an F.O.M.C. member, discussed the semantics of how to publicly discuss what was going on in the markets.</p>
<blockquote><p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Mr. MISHKIN: We are in a financial crisis, and it is worse than we have experienced in any other episode of financial &#8216;disruption,&#8217; which is the word I use. I will not use &#8216;financial crisis&#8217; in public. &#8216;Financial disruption&#8217; is still a good phrase to use in public, but I really do think that this is a financial crisis.

</p></div>
<div class="updated-entry-content">
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">In January 2008, as the debate about Wall Street bonuses began to come to a boil, Timothy F. Geithner, the Fed president in New York, and Janet L. Yellen, the Fed president in San Francisco, found themselves on opposite sides, with Mr. Geithner defending the Wall Street status quo.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Ms. Yellen pointed to a paper by Raghuram Rajan â now the head of Indiaâs central bank â about the danger of the structure of Wall Street bonuses. âI donât know what the answer is in terms of changing these practices,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Maybe the market will attend to them, but it seems to me that we have had an awful lot of booms and busts in which this type of incentive played a role.â</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Mr. Geithner, who has developed a reputation for representing Wall Streetâs interest during the crisis, pushed back. âRaghuâs presentation was mostly about hedge fund compensation, and I think he is mostly wrong when you think about that and the incentive structure,â Mr. Geithner said.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">He said that reforming bonuses probably wouldnât help much: âWhat distinguishes how well the guys did is much more subtle around culture, independence and the quality of judgment exercised at the senior level, and this is important because, when you think about what you can do through supervision and regulation, to affect that stuff is hard.â</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">In the end, given the relative lack of reforms to bonuses since the crisis, it would appear that Mr. Geithner won the argument.</p>

<div class="updated-entry-content">
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">On Sept. 16, even as Fed policy makers tried to gauge the depth of the crisis, some quickly concluded that it was an economic threat of historic proportions. In a prescient comment, the head of the Boston Fed realized this wasn&#8217;t just about Wall Street any more. </p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">&#8220;This is already a historic week, and the week has just begun,&#8221; said Eric S. Rosengren, then and now the president of the Boston Fed. &#8220;The failure of a major investment bank, the forced merger of another, the largest thrift and insurer teetering, and the failure of Freddie and Fannie are likely to have a significant impact on the real economy.</p>
