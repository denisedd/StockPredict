				</div>The National Archives made public on Friday afternoon a trove of secret documents detailing the inner workings of Bill Clintonâs White House, a disclosure of acute interest not just to the history of one presidency but to the prospects of another. Thousands of pages of internal memos and papers offered insights into Mr. Clinton&#8217;s decisions, as well as the role his wife, Hillary Rodham Clinton, may have played in shaping them. Times reporters posted standout passages and analysis below. <span id="more-248050"></span>

</p></div>
<div class="updated-entry-content">
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">White House aides at times gave blunt assessments of some of the other political actors they were dealing with.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">A case in point: Bruce Reed, then Mr. Clintonâs domestic policy adviser (and until recently chief of staff to Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr.), sent a memo to David Shipley, then a speechwriter, about a talk the president would give mentioning welfare in Alabama.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">âThe state has a retrograde governor whoâs not exactly famous for common sense or compassion,â Mr. Reed wrote. (The governor at the time was Fob James.)</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Other aides were also free with their views. In two different memos to Hillary Rodham Clinton, Chris Jennings, a health care adviser, summed up some of the characters she would encounter.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody"><a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1032936-health-care-task-force.html#text/p158">Representative Pete Stark</a>, Democrat of California: a âfierce advocateâ who âwins more than his share of victoriesâ but as a result is âprobably one of the more disliked members in the Congress.â<br />
<a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1032936-health-care-task-force.html#text/p159"><br />
Representative Henry A. Waxman,</a> Democrat of California: has âtremendous respect among consumer interest groupsâ but is ânot well liked at the state level.â</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody"><a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1032936-health-care-task-force.html#text/p68">Representative Jim Cooper</a>, Democrat of Tennessee: âincreasingly concerned that his viewpoints are being ignoredâ and âcould be a problem, particularly in the press, if we donât get him to at least feel we are considering his opinions.â<br />
<a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1032936-health-care-task-force.html#text/p68"><br />
Representative Sander M. Levin</a>, Democrat of Michigan: His âappetite for meetings can never be satiated, and he may be mad that we are not holding one this week.â<br />
<a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1032936-health-care-task-force.html#text/p68"><br />
Representative Norman Y. Mineta</a>, Democrat of California: âvery upset that there has been no meeting with the Asian/Pacific members of the Congress,â and so âa mollifying call is probably advisable.â</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">And, of course, there was Newt Gingrich, the Republican speaker who was Mr. Clintonâs principal adversary on Capitol Hill for much of his presidency. At one point in 1995, the two were scheduled to address the same newspaper forum in Dallas.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Paul Begala, an adviser to Mr. Clinton, sent a memo to White House aides urging that Mr. Clinton use the opportunity to put Mr. Gingrich in his place. âGingrichâs ratings continue to plummet,â <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1033344-david-shipley-speechwriter-ocr.html#document/p2/a2">Mr. Begala wrote</a>. âAt this pace heâll pass baseball owners in the race to the bottom.â</p>

</p></div>
<div class="updated-entry-content">
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Mrs. Clinton had a contentious relationship with the White House press corps during her husband&#8217;s first term and felt uncomfortable with Washington political reporters, according to memos written by her advisers that were released on Friday.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">&#8220;Hillary is comfortable with the local reporters and enjoys speaking with them,&#8221; <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1032079-hillary-rodham-clinton-on-childrens-issues-and.html#document/p20">wrote Lisa Caputo</a>, Mrs. Clinton&#8217;s spokeswoman. &#8220;This will help us get around her aversion to the national Washington media and serve to counter the tone of the national media.&#8221;</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Ms. Caputo pointed to the media strategy employed during the 1992 campaign. &#8220;I think it is important for us to consider returning to our 1992 campaign press strategy and have her do local interviews in the local markets,&#8221; Ms. Caputo wrote. &#8220;Good local press will develop into a ripple effect which will begin to influence the coverage of the national newspapers.&#8221;</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">The memos reveal the consistent struggle of Mrs. Clinton&#8217;s aides to help the first lady express the warm, funny, maternal side of her personality to the press. In the White House, that meant a focus on soft magazine articles and discussions with small, influential groups. &#8220;Hillary should own the women&#8217;s media,&#8221; Ms. Caputo said. That included interviews with People magazine and Barbara Walters, and events like hosting a &#8220;<a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1032079-hillary-rodham-clinton-on-childrens-issues-and.html#text/p22">Hillary Clinton Fan Club visit</a>&#8221; at the White House with fawning first lady watchers from across the world.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">The memo discusses the Clintons&#8217; 20th wedding anniversary, including &#8220;a big party&#8221; and &#8220;a wonderful photo spread to People magazine of photos from the party couple with old photos of their honeymoon.&#8221; </p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody"><!--more--></p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Notes about press strategy during the Clinton years highlight the rapid change in the media landscape. Ms. Caputo informs Mrs. Clinton that the &#8220;Internet has become a very popular mode of communication.&#8221;</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">But beyond the mainstream media, Mrs. Clinton&#8217;s advisers <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1032079-hillary-rodham-clinton-on-childrens-issues-and.html#document/p23">suggested</a> she sit down for off-the-record dinners with &#8220;opinion makers in New York.&#8221; Sidney Blumenthal, a Clinton adviser and former New Yorker writer, had volunteered to arrange the dinners with intellectuals and elites, including Victor S. Navasky, then editor of The Nation magazine, who &#8220;are not the mainstream New York media, but rather those people whom The New York Times respects intellectually.&#8221; </p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Ms. Caputo also recommended that Mrs. Clinton&#8217;s closest aides, including Melanne Verveer, Ann Stock, Ann Lewis and Lissa Muscatine, have relaxed meals with members of the White House press corps. &#8220;We can all tell wonderful Hillary anecdotes that humanize her and show the press the good person that she is,&#8221; Ms. Caputo wrote. &#8220;I believe if we were all out there consistently, we would erode the notion in the press that sometimes exists of Hillary being in a bunker mentality.&#8221;</p>

</p></div>
<div class="updated-entry-content">
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">The documents illustrate that Mrs. Clinton had hoped that her Beijing speech would manifest into a quintessential moment that would cement her feminist credentials. In a <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1032079-hillary-rodham-clinton-on-childrens-issues-and.html#document/p15">1995 memo</a> that lays out the proposed media strategy for Beijing, Lisa Caputo, her spokeswoman, says the goal of the trip is to &#8220;underscore&#8221; Mrs. Clinton&#8217;s &#8220;longstanding work and advocacy on behalf of women, families and children.&#8221; </p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">The memo also highlights a communications challenge Mrs. Clinton continues to face as she seeks to define her tenure at the State Department. Her focus on improving the lives of women and girls, her aides consistently remind reporters, has deeper national security and geopolitical implications. &#8220;It&#8217;s important to stress the interconnection between these issues,&#8221; Ms. Caputo wrote. &#8220;If women flourish, families flourish, economies flourish and therefore communities and societies are healthy, strong and flourishing.&#8221; </p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Part of the media plan included an interview with Dan Rather. &#8220;This will help to reinforce our message that women&#8217;s issues are not &#8216;soft&#8217; issues,&#8221; Ms. Caputo wrote. The press strategy also included an interview with The Los Angeles Times because California is &#8220;an important state for us politically&#8221; and the paper &#8220;understands Pacific Rim politics.&#8221; </p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Mrs. Clinton was also instructed to &#8220;recycle portions of your speeches in China and your speech to the Denver Women&#8217;s Economic Forum into an op-ed for USA Today.&#8221;</p>

</p></div>
<div class="updated-entry-content">
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">One thing was clear from the Clinton memos: Anything that had to do with health care was run by Hillary Clinton for approval.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Case in point: In an <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1032908-robert-bob-boorstin.html#document/p41">April 7, 1993, memo</a> proposing the creation of a &#8220;war room&#8221; to handle communications about the fight for a health care bill, Meeghan Prunty suggested that the appropriate people be consulted.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">&#8220;Next steps: Float this idea to everyone who needs to approve it (Ira, HRC?, all people who we would expect to provide staff/be staff, Mandy/Paul/Stan?, etc.)&#8221;</p>

</p></div>
<div class="updated-entry-content">
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Mrs. Clinton has made her speech at the United Nations&#8217; Fourth World Congress on Women in Beijing a central part of her post-State Department charitable efforts. In the lead-up to the 20th anniversary of her 1995 speech, she recently introduced a No Ceilings initiative at the Bill, Hillary &#038; Chelsea Clinton Foundation that will use data to track and measure the progress of women and girls since the speech. Nearly every time she speaks publicly now, Mrs. Clinton refers to the moment in Beijing when she declared that &#8220;women&#8217;s rights are human rights, and human rights are women&#8217;s rights.&#8221;</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">The documents released Friday reveal the planning and strategy behind Mrs. Clinton&#8217;s Beijing speech and put her work on women&#8217;s issues at the State Department and beyond into a broader context that dated back to her early years in the White House. </p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">&#8220;Our overall message will be one that focuses on women as agents of change, as active and full participants in their societies, meeting the challenges of today and those that will have to be met in the years to come,&#8221; <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1032903-lissa-muscatine-first-ladys-press-office.html#text/p59">Mrs. Clinton said</a>. </p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">She reached out to private corporations to sponsor the Beijing meeting and the events around it in the type of public-private partnership that became the centerpiece of her husband&#8217;s post-presidential philanthropic work. &#8220;How much money do you need from the private sector and why have you waited until the first of July to try to get it, only a few months before the conference?&#8221; <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1032903-lissa-muscatine-first-ladys-press-office.html#text/p72">one potential donor asked</a>. </p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Mrs. Clinton blamed State Department bureaucracy for the late plea for $900,000. &#8220;The process was very bizarre,&#8221; she told executives from Self magazine and Lady Foot Locker, among others involved in the events leading up to the speech. &#8220;We had an enormous amount of difficulty getting clearance to do this. For reasons that I do not fully understand,&#8221; Mrs. Clinton said.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">As secretary of state, Mrs. Clinton made relations with China and the Asia Pacific region central to her mission &#8212; a task that some critics say has been dropped since she left the administration. But, in 1995, she had <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1032903-lissa-muscatine-first-ladys-press-office.html#document/p86">harsh words</a> for the Chinese. &#8220;This conference is being held in a country that practices infanticide,&#8221; she said. &#8220;There are some very real tensions that are going to surface at this conference.&#8221;</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">But she said there was also hostility in Congress over her speaking at the conference. &#8220;There is hostility in our own country toward this congress,&#8221; she said.</p>

<h5 class="updated-marker highlight"><span class="time"><a href="#battling-for-health-care">3:30 P.M.</a></span> <strong>Battling for Health Care</strong></h5>
</p></div>
<div class="updated-entry-content">
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Many of the documents from the health care debates of 1993 sound similar to today&#8217;s battles over the Affordable Care Act. &#8220;I&#8217;m not going to underestimate the political battle that will ensue because of this,&#8221; <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1032903-lissa-muscatine-first-ladys-press-office.html#text/p5">Mrs. Clinton said</a> in a September 1993 meeting on Capitol Hill with Democratic leaders.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">She fielded lawmakers&#8217; concerns over her proposed health care overhaul and recognized that it needed to be done before the midterm elections. &#8220;If we don&#8217;t get this done by the close of business next year, if this isn&#8217;t signed, sealed and delivered by Election Day 1994, I think we can forget about us doing very well in the election,&#8221; Mrs. Clinton said. The remarks almost foreshadow the challenges Democrats currently face in midterm elections over the Obama administration&#8217;s unpopular health care overhaul. </p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Lawmakers expressed worries that the plan would not reach the poorest people in need of insurance coverage. &#8220;I&#8217;m much more concerned about the unsophisticated people, congressional district by congressional district,&#8221; one Democratic member of Congress said. &#8220;I&#8217;d much rather have rank-and-file people feel comfortable about this from the start than every C.E.O. in America.&#8221;</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">In 1994, Democrats ended up being penalized by voters in part because of their ugly failure to pass a health care overhaul; now, Republicans for a third election cycle (after 2010 and 2012) are attacking Democrats for what is actually in law. </p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">There are signs that Mrs. Clinton did underestimate the pushback her plan would face from insurance companies. &#8220;We anticipate having some allies and having some opposition from the insurance industry,&#8221; she told the Senate Labor Committee. The insurance industry, meanwhile, had geared up its $14 million &#8220;Harry and Louise&#8221; TV advertising campaign to turn public opinion against Mrs. Clinton&#8217;s planned health care overhaul.</p>

<div class="updated-entry-content">
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">It&#8217;s hard to imagine Hillary Clinton, who just served four years as secretary of state, as a neophyte when it comes to foreign policy. But in 1995, that is what she was.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">On May 2 of that year, Strobe Talbott, then the deputy secretary of state, wrote Mrs. Clinton, the first lady, <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1032908-robert-bob-boorstin.html#text/p234">a letter</a> thanking her for agreeing to participate in an interview on Moscow&#8217;s Radio Nadezhda. </p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">In the letter, Mr. Talbott praised Mrs. Clinton, saying that &#8220;it&#8217;s a terrific idea.&#8221;</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">&#8220;Part of the president&#8217;s purpose in going to Moscow is to reach out to the Russian people,&#8221; he wrote.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">He also added that &#8220;I have asked my executive assistant, Victoria Nuland, for her thoughts on the best approach.&#8221; Nearly 20 years later, Ms. Nuland is assistant secretary of state for European and Eurasian affairs at the State Department.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">The 1995 letter from Mr. Talbott goes on for two pages as he tries to describe the geopolitical situation in Russia for Mrs. Clinton. </p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">&#8220;The basic point to stress is that Russians are exceedingly &#8212; id even say increasingly &#8212; concerned about security and stability,&#8221; Mr. Talbott said. &#8220;Your message should be that we admire what they have already done and we support them in what they are trying to do.&#8221;</p>

Memos from staff members discussed planning for international conferences, including the 1995 World Conference on Women in Beijing. Nothing suggested the sort of globally provocative remarks that Mrs. Clinton would make in Beijing in which she declared that &#8220;women&#8217;s rights are human rights&#8221; and took issue with China&#8217;s one-child-only policy and dowry deaths. </p>

A mid-1970s &#8220;covenant&#8221; with the United States exempted the territory from federal labor and immigration laws, and it had become a major garment manufacturing hub, with workers flocking to it from China, Korea and Thailand in the 1980s and 1990s. </p>

In the letter, Mr. Clinton said, &#8220;I am writing now out of concern about certain labor practices in the islands that are inconsistent with our country&#8217;s values.&#8221; The letter said that federal officials had for years urged the territory&#8217;s officials to correct the problems, but that the problems had persisted. &#8220;I have, therefore, concluded that federal immigration, naturalization and minimum wage laws should be applied to the commonwealth, as provided by the covenant,&#8221; Mr. Clinton wrote. He added that he would work with Congress to amend the covenant.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Several bills were later introduced in Congress to curb worker exploitation, but ultimately none were passed into law. </p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">During the Bush administration, a law was passed that required the territory to raise its minimum wage yearly until it reached the federal minimum wage. It is currently $5.55 an hour, with the next increase set for 2015. </p>

</p></div>
<div class="updated-entry-content">
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">According to a list of topics, the papers being released on Friday concern much-discussed areas like Mrs. Clintonâs health care task force and the Clinton administrationâs response to early attacks by Al Qaeda. There are also topics that rarely excite partisans, like the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, the United States Information Agency and Mrs. Clintonâs efforts as first lady to encourage microcredit investment in third world countries.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">The documents are the first batch of a larger set of papers withheld until now under exceptions to public disclosure requirements in federal law, exceptions that expired a year ago. As Mrs. Clinton prepares for a possible second campaign for the presidency in 2016, friends and foes alike will pore over the documents for information that elaborates on her actions as first lady before she became a senator and then secretary of state.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody"><a href="//www.nytimes.com/2014/02/11/us/politics/clinton-scandal-of-90s-resurfaces-with-papers.html">Recent reports</a> on the once-secret papers of a friend of Mrs. Clintonâs who died in 2000, Diane D. Blair, have heightened interest in that period, and in the current supercharged political environment even small revelations can become magnified or provide fodder for political debate.</p>
