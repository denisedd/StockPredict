				</div><br />
Wu Wei is a former Chinese official who in the 1980s was heavily involved in developing the Communist Party chief Zhao Ziyangâs plans for measured political reform. Mr. Wu also served as a secretary to Bao Tong, the senior aide to Mr. Zhao. Those reforms collapsed in 1989, when the party patriarch, Deng Xiaoping, turned against Mr. Zhao and ordered troops to suppress student protests based in Tiananmen Square in Beijing. Mr. Wu was detained and investigated after the June 4, 1989, crackdown, and later went into publishing and business. He has remained a close observer of Chinese politics, and last year his <a href="//www.newcenturymc.com/Wu%20Wei.html">book</a> âOn Stage and Backstage: Chinaâs Political Reform in the 1980sâ was published in Hong Kong.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">In an interview, Mr. Wu, 61, discussed his experiences in the 1980s and what he sees as their lessons for understanding the current Chinese leadershipâs drive for market reforms and social adjustment under President Xi Jinping. Edited excerpts follow:</p>
<div class="q left">Q.</div>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody"><strong>Xi Jinping has said the party is committed to significant economic and social changes. You were involved in the central leadershipâs reform program in the 1980s. How different were the conditions for reform then compared with now?</strong></p>
<div class="a left">A.</div>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Of course, there are very big differences. Principally, the whole social background was different. After absorbing the lessons from the Cultural Revolution and reconsidering the doctrines and economic and political institutions left by Mao Zedong, people concluded that China had no future without reform. Public sentiment in ChinaÂ â including among ordinary people, intellectuals and also including Deng Xiaoping and most senior Communist Party leaders who suffered in the Cultural RevolutionÂ â all generally reached the same understanding. Promoting reform became the consensus view of the vast majority of members of society. Although a small number of conservatives in the party opposed the reforms, overall, they won the widespread support of society, including inside the party.<br />
<span id="more-4833"></span></p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">But nowadays peopleâs common concerns are not about reform, but about whether the ruling party will be able to deal with corruption and with unfair distribution in society. Reform doesn&#8217;t emerge from the public now, but from the government. Itâs little more than a spectacle of reallocating power to preserve the legitimacy of the party-state. Compared with the &#8217;80s, there is far less public concern about reforms, and far less support them.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Another feature of the &#8217;80s was that, whenever the party stressed reform and opening up, the conditions for expressing opinion became relatively open. And whenever the party stressed opposing liberalization, conditions for expressing opinion tightened up. But in recent years things have become a bit bizarreÂ â even while stressing reform, the authorities have tightened controls on opinion, and it&#8217;s been harshly suppressed. The mass media and intellectual elite have experienced this chill in conditions for expressing opinion. The Internet and Weibo, which prospered in recent years, are in a vegetative state. The intellectual community and the grassroots have basically lost the power to speak out about reform. Without that power, itâs meaningless to discuss whether or not you support reforms.</p>
<div class="q left">Q.</div>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody"><strong>Given those differences, do you think there are any lessons that can be learned from the course of reforms in the 1980s?</strong></p>
<div class="a left">A.</div>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Another big difference between the reforms of the 1980s and the reforms now is that in the &#8217;80s the ruling party was able and willing to push political reform, and political reforms proceeded more or less in step with the economic reforms. Political reforms were championed and led by the party, and proposed and promoted by its leader, Deng Xiaoping. He believed that without political reforms, economic reforms couldnât advance. Back at that time, Deng Xiaoping fully supported political reforms, especially separating the party from government and also inner-party democracy. Although the political reform program proposed by Zhao Ziyang went beyond Dengâs suggestions, Deng didnât oppose it and didnât express objections. He just warned against instituting a tripartite separation of powers. I believe that at the beginning Deng sincerely supported the political reforms; he wanted to try them out. Although he laid down the Four Cardinal Principles [uphold the socialist path, uphold the people&#8217;s democratic dictatorship, uphold the leadership of the Communist Party, uphold Mao Zedong Thought and Marxism-Leninism], he believed that the road would be impassable if economic reforms werenât accompanied by political reforms.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Itâs true that later Deng backed the conservative forces in the party and killed the very political reforms that he had personally backed. One reason was that, though Deng didnât oppose political reforms at the beginning, after a year or so of carrying them out, he saw that the consequences might go beyond the bottom-line he could tolerate. He discovered that these reforms had opened a Pandoraâs box, unleashed a demon of public demands and feeling for democracy. This overstepped the boundaries of what could be tolerated and controlled by the Communist Party and he thought this might threaten the partyâs rule. The student protests of 1989 led him to feel this threat directly, and in addition the students adopted a strategy of no compromise. So to defend the stability of Communist Party rule, he forcefully suppressed the student protests, and this put an end to the only political reforms attempted since the party took power.</p>
<div class="q left">Q.</div>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody"><strong>In your book, you describe a party study in 1988 that predicted, accurately, that the main threat to the partyâs control would come from student protests.</strong></p>
<div class="a left">A.</div>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">In the latter half of 1988, Bao Tong oversaw a social outlook study by the Central Political System Reform Research Office, and it predicted that China might experience some social turmoil, even mid-intensity social turmoil, in 1989. In 1988, mistakes had marred the central leadershipâs price liberalization [which triggered steep inflation] under Zhao Ziyang, and there was a surge of panic buying. There was also deep discontent among intellectuals, including students, about the slowing of political reforms and corruption fostered by the dual-track pricing system [which combined state controls and market prices]. Based on these social developments, we concluded that it would be impossible to avoid student protests and a degree of social turmoil. In addition, the international situation, especially the changes in Eastern Europe, showed that considerable instability would come with reforms.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Zhao proposed that the Central Political System Reform Research Office conduct a special study of this problem and propose how to respond. The research was done, the responses were proposed. But in truth, looking back, I don&#8217;t think we paid enough attention. The party then lacked awareness and experience about handling an outburst of mass turmoil. In particular, we never anticipated that conflict between differing views within the party would become so confrontational and acute. I don&#8217;t think Zhao ever expected there would be such problems in the party, but later this was the very problem that became a reason for suppressing the student protests, dismissing Zhao and halting the political reforms. As general secretary, Zhao was an enlightened politician, but he wasnât a very seasoned one. He always believed that Deng supported his reforms, and didnât consider what would happen if Deng withdrew his support, and he failed to adequately anticipate the intensification of conflict inside the party.</p>
<div class="q left">Q.</div>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody"><strong>Compared with the late 1980s, how do you assess the chances of major social unrest now?<br />
</strong>
<div class="a left">A.</div>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">I think there may be major differences between then and now. The whole social mentality back then was different. There was a widespread desire for reform, and support for reform. Even though the failure of the price liberalization fed a sense of crisis among people, they also despised the corruption created by the dual-track pricing system and they still supported reform, especially political reform. At that time, Chinese people had just emerged from the Cultural Revolution, and were deeply disgusted by any corruption. Their tolerance for corruption was low. It&#8217;s different now. More than two decades later, having undergone the reform of state-owned enterprises, the looting of state assets by the privileged and the parceling up of the national economy by interest blocs, the party, officialdom and society as a whole have all become deeply corrupt. But by now people have become used to it. Their tolerance has grown. So even though conflicts within society and between officials and the people have deepened, as have social inequities, people have become inured to all kinds of things. In other words, their capacity to put up with this has grown, and general sympathy for protest through direct street action has weakened.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Another point is that the core of the social movement of 1989 was the intellectual elite and the students. But things have changed. With the authoritiesâ crackdown on public opinion in recent years, most members of the public and the intellectual elite have gone into hibernation. The vast majority of people keep a leash on themselves. With the intensification of ideological and political education of students in the two decades after June 4, as well as real pressures in the job market, the students&#8217; mentality simply canât be compared to that of the &#8217;80s. Their participation in politics has fallen drastically, as have their demands to participate. So the possibility of large-scale social unrest has also fallen drastically.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Thirdly, now unrest mostly involves the lower levels of society, and is fueled by forced demolitions, corruption, miscarriages of justice. And it tends to be local, restricted to particular industries, limited in scope. I believe that the June 4 crackdown left a shadow of fear in peopleâs minds. And in recent years the authorities have taken forceful measures to ensure stability and intensified their crackdown on any organized defense of rights, creating fear in peopleâs minds about openly participating in actions to express discontent. For their part, the authorities are utterly terrified of any chance of social turmoil, and want to nip any signs of organized opposition movements in the bud. You can see this in how they insisted on bringing criminal charges against Xu Zhiyong, Wang Gongquan and other participants in the New Citizens Movement, ignoring the public pressure.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">So I believe that while China is stacked high with the kindling for unrest, and there is a widespread possibility of small social upheavals, large-scale social turmoil is virtually out of the question, unless there is a sudden incident with major social repercussions.</p>
<div class="q left">Q.</div>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody"><strong>Do you think the current leaders have absorbed lessons from the reforms of the 1980s?</strong></p>
<div class="a left">A.</div>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">I don&#8217;t think they have a good understanding of the reforms of the &#8217;80s. In particular, they havenât studied the political reforms of that time, or why there needs to be a separation between party and government, or why we need to develop democracy and rule of law, or why we need to ensure citizensâ fundamental rights. And theyâre not interested in understanding.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Now power inside the party is even more concentrated than it was in the &#8217;80s, and itâs evolved into a system of stability maintenance. They donât dare discuss democracy, or mention constitutionalism, let alone dare to use the Constitution, laws and institutions to put power inside a cage. Compared with Deng Xiaoping, this marks a major step backwards. Although Deng laid down the Four Cardinal Principals and set boundaries on reform, during the reforms of the &#8217;80s, he didnât avoid political issues. Though the partyâs current leaders occasionally mention political reform, thatâs just a ruse to consolidate the party-state.</p>
<div class="q left">Q.</div>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody"><strong>So what is your assessment of the reforms proposed by the Third Plenum last year?</strong></p>
<div class="a left">A.</div>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">The present so-called reforms are the partyâs reforms, they donât come from the public. Their ultimate goal is to maintain party power and preserve stability. After the decision was announced, some people praised it and believed it marked a big advance on the reforms of the &#8217;80s. But do the specifics about economic reform in the decision really mark an advance? I think there is some progress. But overall I donât think much of these reforms. Apart from some adjustments needed to maintain growth, there are no major advances in other areas. Especially in politics, the controls on opinion are a major step backwards. The economic reforms are, I think, a bundle of contradictions. They propose maintaining state ownership as the pillar, and still want to enhance the strength, control and influence of the state sector, and thereâs no mention of state enterprise monopolies. But the biggest problem for the Chinese economy now is state enterprise monopolies. State enterprises are the main encampment for the interest groups of the power elite. Although the Third Plenum proposed giving the market a decisive role in allocating resources, and this seems to be progress, in fact this contradicts treating state-owned businesses as the pillar. As long as the special status of state enterprises persists, the market simply cannot carry out a decisive role.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Also, to truly carry out reforms, reform of the political system can&#8217;t be avoided. Early on, Deng Xiaoping clearly stated as much. During reforms, many privileged interests will stand in their way. Without determination to overcome these obstacles, the reforms canât take hold. To deal with these interest blocs, you have no choice but to perform surgery on the bureaucracy. As long as the current ideology and the partyâs current leadership system remain as they are, economic reforms can only mean limited marketization, never full marketization. Once these reforms reach a certain point and threaten the survival of Chinaâs various interest blocs, thereâll be a choice: abandon the reforms or summon the determination to break past the current economic and political system. The former would mean that the reforms have failed; the latter would mean that China is really on the road to transformation.</p>
