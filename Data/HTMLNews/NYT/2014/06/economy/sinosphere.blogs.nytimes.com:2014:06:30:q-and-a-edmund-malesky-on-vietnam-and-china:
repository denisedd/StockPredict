<a href="//people.duke.edu/~ejm5/index.html">Edmund J. Malesky</a>, an associate professor of political economy at Duke University, has spent years <a href="//people.duke.edu/~ejm5/research.html">studying the politics of Vietnam</a>. More recently, he has been working on a governance project involving China. His scholarship on the two countries, both ruled by Communist parties with close ties, has given him a basis for a comparative perspective on the nationsâ politics and political economies. In early May, a Chinese state-owned oil company <a href="//sinosphere.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/05/08/q-and-a-m-taylor-fravel-on-chinas-dispute-with-vietnam/">moved an exploratory oil rig</a> into waters off the disputed <div class="w190 right"><figure class="media photo promo" itemprop="" itemscope="" itemid="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/06/30/world/30sino-vietnam02/30sino-vietnam02-articleInline.jpg" itemtype="//schema.org/ImageObject" role="group"><span class="visually-hidden">Photo</span><div class="image"><img itemprop="url" itemid="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/06/30/world/30sino-vietnam02/30sino-vietnam02-articleInline.jpg" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/06/30/world/30sino-vietnam02/30sino-vietnam02-articleInline.jpg" id="100000002972091" width="190" height="271" alt="Edmund J.

Malesky</span></figcaption></figure></div> Paracel Islands and the Vietnamese coast, igniting <a href="//www.nytimes.com/2014/05/19/world/asia/anti-chinese-protests-end-in-vietnam.html">violent populist protests</a> in Vietnam. Weeks later, Mr. Malesky flew to Vietnam to attend a meeting between the government and representatives of foreign investors that had been previously scheduled. He was able to see up close the political impact of Chinaâs decision and the nationalist discourse that had taken hold in Vietnam. After returning to the National University of Singapore, where he is spending a sabbatical, he answered questions on Vietnam and China.</p>
<div class="q left">Q.</div>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">To bolster the nationâs economic development, the Vietnamese party-state wants to partner with China and Chinese companies. In 2009, the Vietnamese government gave a contract to a Chinese company to mine bauxite in the Central Highlands with Chinese workers, which angered many Vietnamese, including some Communist Party officials. There are other notable examples of this kind of economic cooperation â we see it in the Chinese construction of power plants or the operation of manufacturing factories. Yet there is abiding wariness and frequent hostility from ordinary Vietnamese and some party and government officials toward Chinaâs economic clout in Vietnam. Is it difficult for the government to strike a balance here?</p>
<div class="a left">A.</div>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">My first reaction to this question is that it is probably not right to portray this as a Vietnamese Communist Party versus society divide. The Vietnamese leadership has been torn about its relationship with China for some time. One of the enduring elements of the elite tensions over the past decade has been the relationship between particular players and China. When Le Kha Phieu was not re-elected as party secretary, one of the purported reasons was his settlement of the northern border dispute with China. I think among all the elite players, there is acceptance of the need to engage China economically and of the realities of the asymmetric power relationship between the two countries, but top officials have differed in how close they want to get to China. The <a href="//www.nytimes.com/2009/12/21/world/asia/21china.html?pagewanted=all">debate over bauxite</a> was actually a good example of the divisions among policy makers. But when the popular unrest over bauxite became highly animated, the decision to dampen the debate was more uniform.<br />
<span id="more-13994"></span><br />
Since the protests in early May, the debate in Vietnam has also moved forward. The unsuccessful meeting between top Chinese foreign policy officials and the Vietnamese leadership, namely the prime minister and party secretary, provided a further signal that the crisis is only commencing rather than winding down.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Second, <a href="//politicalscience.yale.edu/people/jessica-weiss">Jessica Weiss</a>, a political scientist at Yale University, has a great book about how China uses antiforeign protests as a foreign policy tool. The protests are a symbol of popular opinion and nationalism, but as soon as they threaten to get out of hand, Chinese leaders rein them in. Some of what we are seeing is Vietnam pulling a page from this playbook and using it back against the Chinese.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Third, there are popular animosities against China that are driving this as well. Over the past few years, there have been real concerns about the quality of Chinese products, worries about contamination in foods imported from China and discussions about Chinese workers who have been brought in by Chinese and other foreign firms. These fears and concerns are inflaming popular actions, which adds an unpredictable element to the events.</p>
<div class="q left">Q.</div>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Itâs interesting you raise the comparison to Chinaâs own use of antiforeign protests. Are there other elements of this latest expression of Vietnamese nationalism that have parallels in China?</p>
<div class="a left">A.</div>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Yes, there are very clear parallels. Let me step back a second, to differentiate the three different types of protests we saw in Vietnam in May.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">First, there were the peaceful protests outside the Chinese Embassy in Hanoi and in a number of other urban centers. These appear to have been tolerated by leaders at first. Journalists were allowed to cover them, and human rights groups organized events around them.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Second, there was the violence against Chinese laborers at a Taiwanese factory in the central province of Ha Tinh. These actions may have been initiated by the movement of the Chinese oil rig initially but also reflected a long-simmering antiforeign bias caused by the presence of so many Chinese workers, rumors of their special treatment and their perceived effect on the socio-cultural fabric in the province.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Third, there were the attacks on foreign factories in the industrial zones in Binh Duong and Dong Nai Provinces in the southern industrial hub around Ho Chi Minh City. The motivation behind these protests and the massive damage they unleashed on Taiwanese-, Korean-, Singaporean- and even Vietnamese-owned factories is heavily disputed. While protesters carried banners with flags and nationalist slogans, factory managers reported that they saw Vietnamese laborers involved in the protests.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Of the three, it is the first type of protest that Weiss profiles in her book, where she specifically looks at anti-Japanese and anti-U.S. protests that appeared to have been organized by the Chinese authorities to assist in key foreign policy negotiations. These protests were quickly shut down, however, if it appeared that they might spin out of control or could be co-opted by anti-regime protesters. Weiss even has some new work showing how Vietnamese authorities have taken a page from this Chinese playbook.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">The antiforeign violence exhibited in Ha Tinh and Binh Duong, however, do not appear to fit the Weiss model. They were disorganized, chaotic, did not express a clear foreign policy viewpoint and began aggressively rather than morphing from peaceful expressions. Most important, in Binh Duong, the damage was far worse for non-Chinese operations, limiting any potential signal it might have sent to Chinese authorities.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">As a result, a number of analysts have pointed out that the violence in the southern industrial zones may have been more about labor dissatisfaction and economic inequality than the Paracels.</p>
<div class="q left">Q.</div>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Vietnamese leaders have reined in the protests, for now. What do you make of that decision? Do you think that the attacks on foreign-run factories and the killing of Chinese workers went beyond what Vietnamese officials had expected?</p>
<div class="a left">A.</div>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Steps have been taken to limit the protests and mitigate their side effects. While there was an effort to signal popular support in Vietnam for aggressive action in China, the rhetoric has been toned down somewhat. The damage to foreign factories was a clear shock, severely injuring operations of four of the five largest countries investing in Vietnam. Officials remain adamant that they will stand strong against their powerful neighbor, but they have limited their more populist appeals.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">This was best exemplified by two text messages that were blasted to all Vietnamese cellphone holders by the prime minister. The first text message asked Vietnamese citizens to prepare to sacrifice for their country, while the second, which came on May 16, after the incidents, appealed for more calm and peaceful actions.</p>
<div class="q left">Q.</div>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Besides the debate over the Chinese-run bauxite mine, are there other recent incidents that have exposed apparent divisions within the Vietnamese Communist Party over how to deal with Chinese interests? Is it there any way you can pinpoint these factions within the Vietnamese Communist Party?</p>
<div class="a left">A.</div>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Rumors about these divisions, including which elites are on which side, are common coffeehouse fodder in Vietnam. On some occasions, Vietnamâs active blogosphere has also jumped in to highlight divisions. Despite the heated rhetoric, we donât actually know very much. Very few analysts have the inside knowledge to say for certain where certain actors stand vis-Ã -vis China, and the actors themselves do not actually have fixed positions.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">In addition to the bauxite debate, reports of divisions over policy toward China have surfaced multiple times in previous years. Each of Vietnamâs major trade agreements has unleashed these discussions, including the bilateral trade agreement with the United States in 2001 and the entry into the World Trade Organization in 2007. More recently, leaders are thought to be split on which international economic agreement to prioritize â the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership, known as the R.C.E.P., which includes China, or the Trans-Pacific Partnership, the T.P.P., which does not.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">One example that piqued my interest recently was an oft-repeated, but unsubstantiated, claim that Chinese were exerting influence on the selection of top leaders during the Vietnamese Party Congress in 2011, trying to move perceived favorites to the top of the list. Another debate took place over the leasing of Vietnamese foreign land to a Chinese company called Innov Green in 2010. Some leaders were thought to favor economic cooperation, while other high-ranking leaders questioned the leasesâ impact on national security.</p>
<div class="q left">Q.</div>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">What are the various sources of pressure acting on Vietnamese leaders now to take more forceful action against the Chinese oil rig? What are the risks for Vietnamese leaders if they appear too weak?</p>
<div class="a left">A.</div>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">The two most vocal sources of pressure have been the active protesters in the country and the large overseas Vietnamese community. Both are calling for more forceful actions to defend Vietnamese interests. There is another element here that is not directly related to the Paracels. On the one hand, it has to do with the leadership&#8217;s performance legitimacy, which rests on economic development and defense of the country. Citizens expect a strong, robust stance against Chinese actions, because this has been a critical stream in the narrative of Vietnamese Communist Party leadership. On the other hand, there has been growing popular anxiety about inequality and unfairness in Vietnamese society. The activities of both sides are shaped by these underlying forces as well.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">All parties in the debates, however, are aware of the wide differences in military and economic capabilities between the two states. Moreover, the social pressure cuts both ways for Vietnamese leaders â an ill-considered military venture that results in losses may be just as dangerous in terms of performance legitimacy.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">This is why Vietnamese authorities are also exploring diplomatic, legal and economic options. These are likely to bear greater fruit than the military standoff. On the diplomatic front, the troubles in the Eastern Sea have re-energized relations with Vietnamâs other partners, including the United States; Association of Southeast Asian Nations, or Asean; and the European Union. Vietnamese leaders have expressed interest in moving discussions on the T.P.P. and the European Free Trade agreement forward. The T.P.P., in particular, requires comprehensive economic reforms, including treatment of state-owned enterprises and domestic treatment of foreign operations.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Legally, Vietnamese policy makers have publicly mused over taking their case to the International Court of Justice. Because China has threatened retaliation through economic sanctions, which would limit trade and capital flows, Vietnamese authorities have begun studying how severe the blow would be and whether Vietnamese companies, which currently rely on Chinese inputs, could diversify and survive the jolt.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">For me, these nonmilitary activities have been the most interesting. There appears to be substantial movement toward greater economic and diplomatic relations with the United States that might in turn generate momentum for robust economic reforms that had appeared to stall in recent years.</p>
<div class="q left">Q.</div>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">To what degree has the state-run press been encouraging the nationalism we&#8217;re seeing playing out on the streets?</p>
<div class="a left">A.</div>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Vietnamese television has definitely amped up the patriotism, showing powerful images of the rig and aggressive Chinese actions such as ramming Vietnamese vessels and spraying others with water hoses. More heavily controlled newspapers have taken similar stances.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Equally interesting, more liberal papers with better journalistic reputations â Thanh Nien, Tuoi Tre, VietnamNet â have been free to cover the events in an unfettered manner, which is definitely providing greater information about the events to the protesters. Here, too, the bauxite debate was instructive. At first stories appeared about the mine and the use of Chinese labor on it in a few Vietnamese newspapers. It was only after the protests began that limits were placed on journalists covering those stories.</p>
<div class="q left">Q.</div>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">What impact have the recent violence and diplomatic tensions had on foreign investment from China or other nations?</p>
<div class="a left">A.</div>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">In the <a href="//www.pcivietnam.org">2013 Provincial Competitiveness Index</a> survey, foreign investors were asked to compare Vietnam with other locations where that they had considered investing. They rated the environments on a range of factors, including infrastructure, labor costs and governance. The two advantages that Vietnam clearly had over their neighbors were government stability and the security of business premises. In other words, foreign investors had concerns about the Vietnamese regulatory environment and governance, but they felt they were entering a secure and safe location. The riots called both of these into question. In the future, foreign investors will have to balance Vietnamâs advantageous labor costs and quality against this potential instability.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Second, as I mentioned, the riots struck three of the four largest foreign investors in Vietnam, in terms of nations â Korea, Taiwan and Singapore. Only Japan was unscathed among the top four. New investors asked themselves the same question, and wondered if there were deeper issues emerging that might pose future threats to their investments.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Third, the riots were eerily foreboding. They didnât occur just anywhere. They occurred in Binh Duong, the province most famous for providing excellent conditions for foreign investors. And they struck the Vietnam Singapore Industrial Park, the V.S.I.P., one of the countryâs first industrial zones, which was launched as a cooperative project between Singapore and Vietnam. Among students of Vietnamese economic reform, the launch of V.S.I.P. in 1996 has been seen as a landmark in Vietnamâs entry into the global economy.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Clearly, Vietnamese authorities were aware how the riots would scare away new investors, which is why they have worked very hard to meet with companies, assure them of future security and address their complaints. Since May 11, Vietnamese officials have taken steps to assure the security of foreign investors and agreed to compensation packages for a number of injured Taiwanese and Korean companies. The prime minister gave a particularly poignant speech on this issue at the semiannual Vietnamese Business Forum in Hanoi this month. At the same time, some perpetrators of the antiforeign violence have been identified and arrested.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">In the long term, my guess is that most investors will see this as a tiny blemish against the large backdrop of Vietnamâs structural conditions, which include labor costs, labor quality, demographic bonus, historical growth rate, proximity to export markets and now emerging momentum toward more comprehensive economic reform. For this group, investment in Vietnam will make sense despite the current situation. Nevertheless, I do believe there is a smaller group, more concerned about instability and risk, for whom the riots quite literally put up red flags.</p>
