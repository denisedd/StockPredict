        <meta name="transcript" content="You know, I must say I’m incredibly honored. Incredibly honored to have all your support and all of the things that I heard were said. You know tonight, we made history. We already made history. I can handle all the bigotry and all the grief in the world to know that I’m supporting people in a marginalized community. And it’s not just about the transgender community. It’s not just about the L.G.B.T. community. It’s about all marginalized communities. All Phil has is no new taxes. I have a plan to grow Vermont’s economy. You know it’s one thing to just fight over the scraps on the table. But we’ve got to put more food on the table. And when you look at my five-year plan and the plan to build our communities with tax income and financing, Vermont needs a 20-year vision. Vermont needs a vision that goes beyond the candidate, beyond the governor. And that’s what leaders should be doing.">

You know tonight, we made history. We already made history. I can handle all the bigotry and all the grief in the world to know that I’m supporting people in a marginalized community. And it’s not just about the transgender community. It’s not just about the L.G.B.T. community. It’s about all marginalized communities. All Phil has is no new taxes. I have a plan to grow Vermont’s economy. You know it’s one thing to just fight over the scraps on the table. But we’ve got to put more food on the table. And when you look at my five-year plan and the plan to build our communities with tax income and financing, Vermont needs a 20-year vision. Vermont needs a vision that goes beyond the candidate, beyond the governor. And that’s what leaders should be doing.">
