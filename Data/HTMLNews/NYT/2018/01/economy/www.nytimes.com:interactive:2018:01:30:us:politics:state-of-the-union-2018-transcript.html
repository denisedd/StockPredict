He is here tonight with his wife Rebecca.  Last year, Ryan was on duty when he saw a pregnant, homeless woman preparing to inject heroin.  When Ryan told her she was going to harm her unborn child, she began to weep.

The Holets named their new daughter Hope.</p>

                  Mr. Trump again called on lawmakers to make ambitious changes to the Obama-era accord. But it is not clear if that is even possible: The United States negotiated the deal with five other nations and Iran, who are not eager to make renegotiate the deal. Dedicating just a single line to it, Mr. Trump offered little help.

On his way to study abroad in Asia, Otto joined a tour to North Korea.  At its conclusion, this wonderful young man was arrested and charged with crimes against the state.  After a shameful trial, the dictatorship sentenced Otto to 15 years of hard labor, before returning him to America last June – horribly injured and on the verge of death.  He passed away just days after his return.</p>

You are powerful witnesses to a menace that threatens our world, and your strength inspires us all.  Tonight, we pledge to honor Otto’s memory with American resolve.</p>
              

            

          

            

              

              
                <p>Finally, we are joined by one more witness to the ominous nature of this regime.  His name is Mr. Ji Seong-ho.</p>
              

            

          

            

              

              
                <p>In 1996, Seong-ho was a starving boy in North Korea.  One day, he tried to steal coal from a railroad car to barter for a few scraps of food.  In the process, he passed out on the train tracks, exhausted from hunger.  He woke up as a train ran over his limbs.  He then endured multiple amputations without anything to dull the pain.  His brother and sister gave what little food they had to help him recover and ate dirt themselves – permanently stunting their own growth.  Later, he was tortured by North Korean authorities after returning from a brief visit to China.  His tormentors wanted to know if he had met any Christians.  He had – and he resolved to be free.</p>
              

            

          

            

              

              
                <p>Seong-ho traveled thousands of miles on crutches across China and Southeast Asia to freedom.  Most of his family followed.  His father was caught trying to escape, and was tortured to death.</p>
              

            

          

            

              

              
                <p>Today he lives in Seoul, where he rescues other defectors, and broadcasts into North Korea what the regime fears the most ‑- the truth.</p>
              

            

          

            

              

              
                <p>Today he has a new leg, but Seong-ho, I understand you still keep those crutches as a reminder of how far you have come.  Your great sacrifice is an inspiration to us all.</p>
              

            

          

            

              

              
                <p>Seong-ho’s story is a testament to the yearning of every human soul to live in freedom.</p>
              

            

          

            

              

              
                <p>It was that same yearning for freedom that nearly 250 years ago gave birth to a special place called America.  It was a small cluster of colonies caught between a great ocean and a vast wilderness.  But it was home to an incredible people with a revolutionary idea:  that they could rule themselves.  That they could chart their own destiny.  And that, together, they could light up the world.</p>
